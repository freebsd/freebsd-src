SFTP-SERVER(8)          OpenBSD System Manager's Manual         SFTP-SERVER(8)

NAME
     sftp-server - SFTP server subsystem

SYNOPSIS
     sftp-server [-ehR] [-f log_facility] [-l log_level] [-u umask]

DESCRIPTION
     sftp-server is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol to
     stdout and expects client requests from stdin.  sftp-server is not
     intended to be called directly, but from sshd(8) using the Subsystem
     option.

     Command-line flags to sftp-server should be specified in the Subsystem
     declaration.  See sshd_config(5) for more information.

     Valid options are:

     -e      Causes sftp-server to print logging information to stderr instead
             of syslog for debugging.

     -f log_facility
             Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages
             from sftp-server.  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH,
             LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
             The default is AUTH.

     -h      Displays sftp-server usage information.

     -l log_level
             Specifies which messages will be logged by sftp-server.  The
             possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG,
             DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  INFO and VERBOSE log transactions
             that sftp-server performs on behalf of the client.  DEBUG and
             DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher
             levels of debugging output.  The default is ERROR.

     -R      Places this instance of sftp-server into a read-only mode.
             Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations
             that change the state of the filesystem, will be denied.

     -u umask
             Sets an explicit umask(2) to be applied to newly-created files
             and directories, instead of the user's default mask.

     For logging to work, sftp-server must be able to access /dev/log.  Use of
     sftp-server in a chroot configuration therefore requires that syslogd(8)
     establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.
