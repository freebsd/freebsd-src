This program has no explanation.

The
[= prog-name =]
utility program is used to query NTP servers which
implement the standard NTP mode 6 control message formats defined
in Appendix B of the NTPv3 specification RFC1305, requesting
information about current state and/or changes in that state.
The same formats are used in NTPv4, although some of the
variables have changed and new ones added.

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
the aginfo template and the option descriptions for the @command{ntpq} program.  It documents the ntpq usage text and option meanings.

@node ntpq ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex ntpq-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

@node ntpq ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex ntpq-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

@node ntpq command
@subsection command option (-c)
@cindex ntpq-command

This is the ``run a command and exit'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
host(s).

@node ntpq debug-level
@subsection debug-level option (-d)
@cindex ntpq-debug-level

This is the ``increase output debug message level'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{DEBUG} during the compilation.
@end itemize

Increase the debugging message output level.

@node ntpq set-debug-level
@subsection set-debug-level option (-D)
@cindex ntpq-set-debug-level

This is the ``set the output debug message level'' option.

@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{DEBUG} during the compilation.
@end itemize

Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
but each overrides the previous value(s).

@node ntpq peers
@subsection peers option (-p)
@cindex ntpq-peers

This is the ``print a list of the peers'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
interactive.

@node ntpq interactive
@subsection interactive option (-i)
@cindex ntpq-interactive

This is the ``force ntpq to operate in interactive mode'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command, peers.

Force ntpq to operate in interactive mode.  Prompts will be written
to the standard output and commands read from the standard input.

@node ntpq numeric
@subsection numeric option (-n)
@cindex ntpq-numeric

This is the ``numeric host addresses'' option.
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names.
