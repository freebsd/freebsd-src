     [ssh.c]
     close any extra file descriptors inherited from parent at start and
     reopen stdin/stdout to /dev/null when forking for ControlPersist.
     
     prevents tools that fork and run a captive ssh for communication from
     failing to exit when the ssh completes while they wait for these fds to
     close. The inherited fds may persist arbitrarily long if a background
     mux master has been started by ControlPersist. cvs and scp were effected
     by this.

     [channels.c]
     Fix a trio of bugs in the local/remote window calculation for datagram
     data channels (i.e. TunnelForward):
     
     Calculate local_consumed correctly in channel_handle_wfd() by measuring
     the delta to buffer_len(c->output) from when we start to when we finish.
     The proximal problem here is that the output_filter we use in portable
     modified the length of the dequeued datagram (to futz with the headers
     for !OpenBSD).
     
     In channel_output_poll(), don't enqueue datagrams that won't fit in the
     peer's advertised packet size (highly unlikely to ever occur) or which
     won't fit in the peer's remaining window (more likely).
     
     In channel_input_data(), account for the 4-byte string header in
     datagram packets that we accept from the peer and enqueue in c->output.

     [key.c servconf.c servconf.h sshd.8 sshd_config.5]
     add some optional indirection to matching of principal names listed
     in certificates. Currently, a certificate must include the a user's name
     to be accepted for authentication. This change adds the ability to
     specify a list of certificate principal names that are acceptable.
     
     When authenticating using a CA trusted through ~/.ssh/authorized_keys,
     this adds a new principals="name1[,name2,...]" key option.
     
     For CAs listed through sshd_config's TrustedCAKeys option, a new config
     option "AuthorizedPrincipalsFile" specifies a per-user file containing
     the list of acceptable names.
     
     If either option is absent, the current behaviour of requiring the
     username to appear in principals continues to apply.
     
     These options are useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces
     and "user@realm"-style naming policies in certificates.

     Add support for certificate key types for users and hosts.
     
     OpenSSH certificate key types are not X.509 certificates, but a much
     simpler format that encodes a public key, identity information and
     some validity constraints and signs it with a CA key. CA keys are
     regular SSH keys. This certificate style avoids the attack surface
     of X.509 certificates and is very easy to deploy.
     
     Certified host keys allow automatic acceptance of new host keys
     when a CA certificate is marked as trusted in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
     see VERIFYING HOST KEYS in ssh(1) for details.
     
     Certified user keys allow authentication of users when the signing
     CA key is marked as trusted in authorized_keys. See "AUTHORIZED_KEYS
     FILE FORMAT" in sshd(8) for details.
     
     Certificates are minted using ssh-keygen(1), documentation is in
     the "CERTIFICATES" section of that manpage.
     
     Documentation on the format of certificates is in the file

     fix bug introduced in mux rewrite:
     
     In a mux master, when a socket to a mux slave closes before its server
     session (as may occur when the slave has been signalled), gracefully
     close the server session rather than deleting its channel immediately.
     A server may have more messages on that channel to send (e.g. an exit
     message) that will fatal() the client if they are sent to a channel that
     has been prematurely deleted.

     [channels.c channels.h clientloop.c clientloop.h mux.c nchan.c ssh.c]
     rewrite ssh(1) multiplexing code to a more sensible protocol.
     
     The new multiplexing code uses channels for the listener and
     accepted control sockets to make the mux master non-blocking, so
     no stalls when processing messages from a slave.
     
     avoid use of fatal() in mux master protocol parsing so an errant slave
     process cannot take down a running master.
     
     implement requesting of port-forwards over multiplexed sessions. Any
     port forwards requested by the slave are added to those the master has
     established.
     
     add support for stdio forwarding ("ssh -W host:port ...") in mux slaves.
     
     document master/slave mux protocol so that other tools can use it to
     control a running ssh(1). Note: there are no guarantees that this
     protocol won't be incompatibly changed (though it is versioned).

     pass the option and option argument as separate argv entries and
     not smashed into one (e.g., as -l foo and not -lfoo).  Also, always
     pass a "--" argument to stop option parsing, so that a positional

     [Makefile.in]
     Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication
     method using the J-PAKE protocol described in F. Hao, P. Ryan,
     "Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling", 16th Workshop on
     Security Protocols, Cambridge, April 2008.
     
     This method allows password-based authentication without exposing
     the password to the server. Instead, the client and server exchange
     cryptographic proofs to demonstrate of knowledge of the password while
     revealing nothing useful to an attacker or compromised endpoint.
     
     This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently
     compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).

     because parse_forward() is now used to parse all forward types (DLR),
     and it malloc's space for host variables, we don't need to malloc
     here.  fixes small memory leaks.
     
     previously dynamic forwards were not parsed in parse_forward() and
     space was not malloc'd in that case.

     Make protocol 2 MaxAuthTries behaviour a little more sensible:
     Check whether client has exceeded MaxAuthTries before running
     an authentication method and skip it if they have, previously it
     would always allow one try (for "none" auth).
     Preincrement failure count before post-auth test - previously this
     checked and postincremented, also to allow one "none" try.
     Together, these two changes always count the "none" auth method
     which could be skipped by a malicious client (e.g. an SSH worm)
     to get an extra attempt at a real auth method. They also make
     MaxAuthTries=0 a useful way to block users entirely (esp. in a
     sshd_config Match block).
     Also, move sending of any preauth banner from "none" auth method
     to the first call to input_userauth_request(), so worms that skip
     the "none" method get to see it too.

     Introduce SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualization, a technique inspired by the
     graphical hash visualization schemes known as "random art", and by
     Dan Kaminsky's musings on the subject during a BlackOp talk at the
     23C3 in Berlin.
     Scientific publication (original paper):
     "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World Security",
     Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on Cryptographic
     Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
     http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf
     The algorithm used here is a worm crawling over a discrete plane,
     leaving a trace (augmenting the field) everywhere it goes.
     Movement is taken from dgst_raw 2bit-wise.  Bumping into walls
     makes the respective movement vector be ignored for this turn,
     thus switching to the other color of the chessboard.
     Graphs are not unambiguous for now, because circles in graphs can be
     walked in either direction.

     deraadt@ djm@
     djm belives that the reason for the "0" strings is to ensure that
     it's not possible to call getaddrinfo with both host and port being
     NULL.  In the case of canohost.c host is a local array.  In the
     case of sshconnect.c, it's checked for null immediately before use.
     In dns.c it ultimately comes from ssh.c:main() and is guaranteed to
     be non-null but it's not obvious, so I added a warning message in
     case it is ever passed a null.

     Implement a channel success/failure status confirmation callback

     Also includes a abandonment callback to clean up if a channel is

     (MaxSessions 0), disabling connection multiplexing (MaxSessions 1) or
     simply increasing the number of allows multiplexed sessions.
     Because some bozos are sure to configure MaxSessions in excess of the
     number of available file descriptors in sshd (which, at peak, might be
     as many as 9*MaxSessions), audit sshd to ensure that it doesn't leak fds
     on error paths, and make it fail gracefully on out-of-fd conditions -
     sending channel errors instead of than exiting with fatal().

     Use new channel status confirmation callback system to properly deal
     with "important" channel requests that fail, in particular command exec,

     that the requests would always succeed, which could cause hangs if they
     did not (e.g. when the server runs out of fds) or were unimplemented by
     the server (bz #1384)
     Also, properly report failing multiplex channel requests via the mux
     client stderr (subject to LogLevel in the mux master) - better than
