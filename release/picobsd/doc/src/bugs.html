<center><h1>History and List of Bugfixes</h1></center>

<p>This is the short release history of PicoBSD, as well as the list of bugs
which were found. Some of them were already corrected, so that you should read
the list before reporting a new one.</p>

<p>We tried to make this software bug-free, but life is life... Sorry for the
 inconvenience.</p>

<h3>PicoBSD 0.44</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1999.05.10: Slightly refreshed version to match 3.2-RELEASE.
	No significant changes (yet)... :-(
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PicoBSD 0.43</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1999.01.19: A lot of fixes related to architectural changes in
	3.0-current code. Most importantly, we run now ELF kernel and we use
	the new bootloader. This is most probably the last release of PicoBSD in
	its present shape - the next version will (hopefully) become a part of
 	normal release building process.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>PicoBSD 0.42</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1999.01.15: Well, it seems that this version was for developers
	only... ;-) It was abandoned when recent massive changes in -current
	demanded more serious measures...
</li>
<li>
	1998.10.15: Small fixes and updates to match the 3.0-RELEASE
	source tree. The binary snapshot built from 3.0-R sources will
	soon follow...
</li>
</ul>

<h3>PicoBSD 0.41</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1998.10.12: Two small buglets has been discovered, and fixed in CVS
	copy of the sources. 'kget' utility was dumping core due to unexpected
	change in behaviour of dumpnlist. 'ns' utility poorly handled other
	netmasks than class C network.
	<p>I prepared new tar archive containing these corrected sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
	1998.09.26: Yes, this took more than just "a few days"... :-(. This is
	mainly a bugfix release of 0.4 - almost no new features were added,
	except the 'dmesg' to examine kernel messages buffer. Also, all
	programs are compiled in ELF format. SNMP services are provided now
	by UCD-SNMP v.3.5.

	<p>Unfortunately, I had to remove DEVFS for now - there are too many
	problems with it for now. This also means that we're back to creating
	device nodes manually, and chances are that the one you need is
	missing... </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>PicoBSD 0.4</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1998.08.28: Serious bug was discovered in MFS code (thanks to Eric
	P. Scott for detailed bug report!). Though the bug itself is in 
	FreeBSD-current kernel code and not in the PicoBSD-specific sources,
	it makes PicoBSD very fragile and easy to crash.
	<p>Some people are already working on it, so expect the fixed version
	in a few days. Its availability will be noted here, on this page,
	so keep an eye on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
	1998.08.27: PicoBSD source tree is now a part of official FreeBSD
	source tree (you can find it in src/release/picobsd). From now on,
	all the fixes and changes will go directly to this tree, and from
	time to time I'll be preparing a stand-alone snapshot of the sources.
</li>
<li>
	1998.08.19: PicoBSD 0.4 released.
	<p>New features include: NATd,
	netstat, DEVFS/SLICE instead of standard /dev, additional network
	drivers, and several minor fixes. Distribution contains also
	a collection of small versions of system programs (TinyWare), among
	them custom init(8).</p>
	<p>I added also the fourth type of setup - 'router' - which is a
	specialized version of PicoBSD that focuses on providing as small
	as possible router solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PicoBSD 0.31</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	1998.03.28: Some people reported that the binary files (*.flp) were
	being corrupted during download because their browsers assumed that
	these are text files. I changed the names to *.bin - their contents
	 is the same.
</li>
<li>
	1998.03.20: PicoBSD 0.31 released. New features include: SNMP daemon,
	better creation of /kernel.config, some other minor fixes. Massive
	changes in the building scripts. I also removed vn(4) driver from
	"net" and "isp" floppies.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PicoBSD 0.3</h3>
<p>The following bugs were found in this release of PicoBSD:</p>
<ul>
<li>	1998.02.27: A bug in kget(8) utility caused it to dump core in certain
	situations. As a consequence, it wasn't possible to save the changes
	made in UserConfig (-c). This will be corrected in the next release (or
	bugfix issue).
</li>
<li>	1998.02.24: Wrongly sized MFS caused the passwd(1) on "net" type
	floppy to fail because of lack of space for temporary files. This bug
	affected only "net" floppies, and of course the scripts ("2000" looks
	quite similar to "2200" :-(( ). Also, the 'update' script didn't work
	as expected...
<p>	This was fixed the same day, and the corrected files are: pb03en1.zip,
	pb03pn1.zip, and pbsd-s031.tgz respectively. They are now under standard
	links on the main page of PicoBSD project, so if you downloaded after
	this date, you shouldn't worry.</p>
<p>	Please check that you have the fixed versions - the archive name should
	contain the tiny number, such as "pb03en<b>1</b>.zip", or
	pbsd-s03<b>1</b>.tgz".</p>
<li>
	1998.02.15: PicoBSD 0.3 released. This is the first version that I can
	truly recommend - previous one was too buggy... :-)
</li>
</li>
</ul>
