What is it?
-----------

This utility allows to gather device configuration which possibly
was changed in userconfig (-c) session, and to save it to /kernel.config
file on startup floppy, so that when user boots next time, the
settings will automatically be changed.

This program uses sysctl(3) interface to retrieve data from the kernel -
the machdep.uc_devlist sysctl was added Jan 5 1999 to 3.0-current.

How can I use it?
-----------------

The best way is to call it from /etc/rc in such phase when the startup floppy
is mounted, and redirect its output to /kernel.config on the floppy.

Usage is straightforward:

	kget output_filename

where output_filename is either regular file (then it's created or
overwritten), or a "-" meaning standard output.

In simplest form you can do

	kget -

to list current in-core parameters, or

	kget /kernel.config

to produce list of changes from 'vanilla' configuration and write
it to /kernel.config file - it already contains required keywords.
