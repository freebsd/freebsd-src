desc = <<EOD
The libufs library and the functions it provides are used for implementing
utilities which need to access a UFS file system at a low level from userland.
Facilities provided are used to implement utilities such as newfs(8) and
dumpfs(8).  The libufs library is designed to be simple, and to provide
functions that are traditionally useful to have.
