comment = "Filesystem quota consistency checker"
desc = <<EOD
The quotacheck utility examines each file system, builds a table of current
disk usage, and compares this table against that recorded in the disk quota
file for the file system.  If any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota
file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the
latter only occurs if an active file system is checked).
