This directory contains package manifests for the base packages in UCL format.
There are two types of manifest: "<package>.ucl" applies specifically to the
package called "<package>", and "<package>-all.ucl" applies to all of that
package's subpackages.

For example, if a Makefile sets PACKAGE=foo, then the build might generate the
following packages:

	FreeBSD-foo
	FreeBSD-foo-dev
	FreeBSD-foo-lib32
	FreeBSD-foo-man

All of these packages will include "foo-all.ucl", but "foo.ucl" will only be
included by FreeBSD-foo, "foo-dev.ucl" will only be included by FreeBSD-foo-dev,
and so on.

In general, dependencies and post-install scripts should be added in the
package-specific manifests, while comment and description should be set
in the "-all" manifest.
