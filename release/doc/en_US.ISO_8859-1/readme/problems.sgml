  <title>Reporting Problems, Making Suggestions, and Submitting
  Code</title>

  <para>Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are
  always valued &mdash; please do not hesitate to report any problems you
  may find (preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).</para>

  <para>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
  Internet mail connectivity is to use the &man.send-pr.1; command or
  use the CGI script at <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html</ulink>.
  Bug reports will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program
  and you can be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all
  reported bugs as soon as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also
  visible on our Web site in the support section and are therefore
  valuable both as bug reports and as <quote>signposts</quote> for
  other users concerning potential problems to watch out for.</para>

  <para>If, for some reason, you are unable to use &man.send-pr.1; to
  submit a bug report, you can try to send it to the &a.bugs;.</para>

  <para>Note that &man.send-pr.1; itself is a shell script that should
  be easy to move even onto a totally different system.  We much
  prefer if you could use this interface, since it make it easier to
  keep track of the problem reports.  However, before submitting,
  please try to make sure whether the problem might have already been
  fixed since.</para>

  <para>Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send
  mail to the &a.questions;.</para>

  <para>If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you
  <emphasis>must</emphasis> join the &a.current;, in order to keep
  abreast of recent developments and changes that may affect the way
  you use and maintain the system.

  <para>Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to
  have extra hands willing to help &mdash; there are already far more
  desired enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!
  To contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please
  send mail to the &a.hackers;.</para>

  <para>Please note that these mailing lists can experience
  <emphasis>significant</emphasis> amounts of traffic and if you have
  slow or expensive mail access and are only interested in keeping up
  with significant FreeBSD events, you may find it preferable to
  subscribe instead to the &a.announce;.</para>

  <para>All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone
  wishing to do so.  Send mail to &a.majordomo;
  and include the keyword <literal>help</literal> on a line by itself
  somewhere in the body of the message.  This will give you more
  information on joining the various lists, accessing archives, etc.
  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at special interest
  groups not mentioned here; more information can be obtained either
  through majordomo or the <ulink
  url="http://www.freebsd.org/support.html#mailing-list">mailing lists
  section</ulink> of the FreeBSD Web site.</para>

  <important>
  <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> send email to the lists asking to
  be subscribed.  Use the &a.majordomo; address
  instead.</para>
