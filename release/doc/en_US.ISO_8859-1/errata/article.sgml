	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

  <abstract>
    <para>This document lists errata that pertain to the most
    recently-released version of &os; (&release.prev;).  It includes
    both security advisories that pertain this release, as well as
    items relating to the software or documentation, discovered after
    the release, that could affect its operation or usability.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of &os;, you should <emphasis>read
    the errata</emphasis> for this release so that you don't stumble
    over problems which have already been found and fixed.  Any
    version of this
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> file actually distributed with the
    release is out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the net and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for your
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/">http://www.freebsd.org/releases/</ulink>,
    as well as any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location).</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &release.current; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>

    <para>Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to the
    &a.stable;.</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
    url="http://www.freebsd.org/security"></ulink> or <ulink
    url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/"></ulink>.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>The vulnerability documented in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:39 was fixed in &os; 4.3-RELEASE.  The release
    notes mentioned the fix, but made no mention of the security
    advisory.</para>

    <para>A vulnerability in the &man.fts.3; routines (used by
    applications for recursively traversing a filesystem) could allow
    a program to operate on files outside the intended directory
    hierarchy.  This bug, as well as a fix, is described in security
    advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:40).</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>System Update Information</title>

    <para>The release note entry for the ESS Maestro-3/Allegro sound
    driver gave an incorrect command for loading the driver via
    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The correct command is:

      <screen><userinput>snd_maestro3_load="YES"</userinput></screen>
    </para>

    <para>&man.ssh.1; is no longer SUID <username>root</username>.
    The primary manifestation of this change is that
    <filename>.shosts</filename> authentication may not work
    <quote>out of the box</quote>.  Both temporary and permanent fixes
    are described in <ulink
    url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/faq/admin.html#SSH-SHOSTS">an item in the FAQ</ulink>.</para>
