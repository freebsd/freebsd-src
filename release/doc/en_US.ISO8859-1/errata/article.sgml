	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <title>Late-Breaking News and Corrections</title>

    <para>A bug in <application>OpenSSL</application> that could cause
      it to parse past the end of the message was found at the late
      stage of &release.bugfix; release process.  The &release.bugfix;
      includes a fix for this issue by importing relevant parts from
      the OpenSSL CVS.  This could be triggered by an incorrectly
      formatted ClientHello SSL/TLS handshake messages.  The details
      can be found at <ulink
      url="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20110208.txt"></ulink>.</para>

    <para>The shared object version numbers of
      <application>libcrypto</application> and
      <application>libssl</application> have been decreased from
      <literal>6</literal> to <literal>5</literal>.  These are
      accidentaly increased on 28 November, 2010 (r215997) as OpenSSL
      0.9.8p was merged.  Note that this affects systems running
      7-STABLE after that date (after 7.3-RELEASE), not 7.3-RELEASE
      and the security branch.  Also note that in &os;
      &release.bugfix;, the library files with the version number
      <literal>6</literal> are still provided as symbolic links to
      prevent binaries built in the time window with the accidentaly
      increased version number from being broken after the system gets
      updated to &release.bugfix;.</para>
