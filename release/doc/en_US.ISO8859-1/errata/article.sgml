	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

	<para>In some releases prior to &release.current;, upgrading
	  by using &man.freebsd-update.8; can fail.  This issue has
	  been fixed by a change in Errata Notice EN-12:01.  For more
	  information, see <ulink
	    url="http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-12:01.freebsd-update.asc"></ulink></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para arch="amd64,i386">&os; &release.current; includes
	  several changes to improve resource management of PCI
	  devices.  Some x86 machines may not boot or may have devices
	  that no longer attach when using ACPI as a result of these
	  changes.  This can be worked around by setting a
	  &man.loader.8; tunable
	  <varname>debug.acpi.disabled</varname> to
	  <literal>hostres</literal>.  To do this, enter the following
	  lines at the loader prompt:</para>

	<screen>set debug.acpi.disabled="hostres"
boot</screen>

	<para>Or, put the following line into
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

	<programlisting>debug.acpi.disabled="hostres"</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A &man.devctl.4; event upon arrival of a &man.ugen.4;
	  device has been changed.  The event now includes
	  <literal>ugen</literal> and <literal>cdev</literal>
	  variables instead of <literal>device-name</literal>.  This
	  change can prevent the following &man.devd.8; rule which
	  worked in a previous releases from working:</para>

	<programlisting>attach 0 {
	match "device-name" "ugen[0-9]+.[0-9]+";
	action "/path/to/script /dev/$device-name";
}</programlisting>

	<para>This should be updated to the following:</para>

	<programlisting>attach 0 {
	match "subsystem" "DEVICE";
	match "type" "ATTACH";
	match "cdev" "ugen[0-9]+.[0-9]+";
	action "/path/to/script /dev/$cdev";
}</programlisting>

      <listitem>
	<para>The &os; &release.current; Release Notes should have
	  mentioned that SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) MLDv2 now
	  uses <literal>ALLOW_NEW_SOURCES</literal> and
	  <literal>BLOCK_OLD_SOURCES</literal> record types to signal
	  a join or a leave by default.  This conforms RFC 4604,
	  <quote>Using Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3
	  (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2
	  (MLDv2) for Source-Specific Multicast</quote>.  A new
	  &man.sysctl.8; variable
	  <varname>net.inet6.mld.use_allow</varname> which controls
	  the behavior has been added.  The default value is
	  <literal>1</literal> (use
	  <literal>ALLOW_NEW_SOURCES</literal> and
	  <literal>BLOCK_OLD_SOURCES</literal>).</para>

	<para>&release.current; fails to configure an interface

	  when the interface does not have a corresponding
	  <varname>ifconfig_<replaceable>IF</replaceable>_ipv6</varname>
	  variable.  This problem will be fixed in the future
	  releases.  To work around this problem on &release.current;,
	  add an
	  <varname>ifconfig_<replaceable>IF</replaceable>_ipv6</varname>
	  line for each interface specified in
	  <varname>ipv6_prefix_<replaceable>IF</replaceable></varname>
	  as the following:</para>

	<para>In &release.current; the &os; USB subsystem supports USB
	  3.0 by the &man.xhci.4; driver.  However, a bug that could
	  prevent it from working with a USB 3.0 hub has been found
	  and fixed after the release date.  This means
	  &release.current; and prior do not work with a USB 3.0 hub.
	  This problem has been fixed in HEAD and will be merged into
	  the 9-STABLE branch.</para>
