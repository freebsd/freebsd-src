<!-- 
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    Before installing this version,
    it is important to consult this document to learn about
    any post-release discoveries or 
    problems that may already have been found and
    fixed.</para>

    <para>Any
    version of this
    errata document actually distributed with the
    release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for this
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>,
    plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink> or <ulink

    <para>The handling of some types of comments in &man.printcap.5;

      the continuation of a printer definition), the line following
      the comment will be parsed as a part of the previous printer
      definition.</para>
