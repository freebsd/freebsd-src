    <para>(30 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) A bug in &man.mksnap.ffs.8; causes the creation of a
      filesystem snapshot to reset the flags on the filesystem to
      their default values.  The possible consequences depend on local
      usage, but can include disabling extended access control lists
      or enabling the use of setuid executables stored on an untrusted
      filesystem.  This bug also affects the &man.dump.8;
      <option>-L</option> option, which uses &man.mksnap.ffs.8;.  Note
      that &man.mksnap.ffs.8; is normally only available to the
      superuser and members of the <groupname>operator</groupname>
      group.  This bug has been fixed on the &os; &release.prev;
      security fix branch and in &os; &release.bugfix;.  For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:01.mksnap_ffs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:01</ulink>.</para>

    <para>(8 Feb 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call)
      can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      This bug has been fixed on the &os; &release.prev;
      security fix branch and in &os; &release.bugfix;.
      More details, including bugfix and workaround information,
      can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.</para>

    <para>(28 Feb 2004) It is possible, under some circumstances, for
      a processor with superuser privileges inside a &man.jail.8;
      environment to change its root directory to a different jail,
      giving it read and write access to the files and directories
      within.  This vulnerability has been closed on the &os;
      &release.prev; security fix branch and in &os;
      &release.bugfix;.  Information on the bug fix can be found in
      security advisory <ulink

    <para>(4 Mar 2004) It is possible for a remote attacker to conduct
      a low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against a machine
      providing TCP-based services, filling up the target's memory
      buffers and potentially leading to a system crash.  This
      vulnerability has been addressed on the &os; &release.prev;
      security fix branch, but is present in both &os; &release.prev;
      and &release.bugfix;.  Security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>
      contains more details, as well as information on patching
      existing systems.</para>

    <para>(17 Mar 2004) By performing a specially crafted SSL/TLS
      handshake with an application that uses OpenSSL a null pointer
      may be dereferenced.  This may in turn cause the application to
      crash, resulting in a denial of service attack.  For more information
      see the Security Advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</ulink>
      which contains more details and instructions on how to patch existing
      systems.</para>

    <para>(29 Mar 2004) A local attacker may take advantage of a
      programming error in the handling of certain IPv6 socket options
      in the &man.setsockopt.2; system call to read portions of kernel
      memory without proper authorization.  This may result in disclosure
      of sensitive data, or potentially cause a panic.  See Security
      Advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:06.ipv6.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:06</ulink>
      for a more detailed description and instructions on how to patch
      existing systems.</para>

    <para>(9 May 2004) Two programming errors in
      <application>CVS</application> can allow a server to overwrite
      arbitrary files on the client, and a client to read arbitrary
      files on the server when accessing remote CVS repositories.
      More details, including patch and upgrade information, can be
      found in security advisory <ulink

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>(9 Jan 2004) Due to a change in &man.cpp.1; behavior, the
      login screen for &man.xdm.1; is in black and white, even on
      systems with color displays.  As a workaround, update to a newer
      version of the 
      <filename role="package">x11/XFree86-4-clients</filename>
      port/package.</para>

    <para>(9 Jan 2004) There remain some residual problems with ACPI.
      In some cases, systems may behave erratically, or hang at boot
      time.  As a workaround, disable ACPI, using the <quote>safe
      mode</quote> option of the bootloader or using the
      <varname>hint.acpi.0.disabled</varname> kernel environment
      variable.  These problems are being investigated.  For problems
      that have not already been reported (check the mailing list
      archives <emphasis>before</emphasis> posting), sending the
      output of &man.dmesg.8; and &man.acpidump.8; to the
      &a.current; may help diagnose the problem.</para>

    <para>(9 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) In some cases, ATA devices may behave
      erratically, particularly SATA devices.  Reported symptoms
      include command timeouts or missing interrupts.  These problems
      appear to be timing-dependent, making them rather difficult to
      isolate.  Workarounds include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Turn off ATA DMA using the <quote>safe mode</quote>
	  option of the bootloader or the
	  <varname>hw.ata.ata_dma</varname> sysctl variable.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Use the host's BIOS setup options to put the ATA
	  controller in its <quote>legacy mode</quote>, if
	  available.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Disable ACPI, for example using the <quote>safe mode</quote>
	  option of the bootloader or using the
	  <varname>hint.acpi.0.disabled</varname> kernel environment
	  variable.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Some of these problems were addressed in &os;
      &release.bugfix; with the import of a newer &man.ata.4; from
      &release.current;.</para>

    <para>(9 Jan 2004) Installing over NFS when using the install
      floppies requires that the <filename>nfsclient.ko</filename>
      module be manually loaded from the third floppy disk.  This can
      be done by following the prompts when &man.sysinstall.8;
      launches to load a driver off of the third floppy disk.</para>

    <para>(9 Jan 2004) The use of multiple vchans (virtual audio
      channels with dynamic mixing in software) in the &man.pcm.4;
      driver has been known to cause some instability.</para>

    <para>(10 Jan 2004) Although APIC interrupt routing seems to work
      correctly on many systems, on some others (such as some laptops)
      it can cause various errors, such as &man.ata.4; errors or hangs
      when starting or exiting X11.  For these situations, it may be
      advisable to disable APIC routing, using the <quote>safe
      mode</quote> of the bootloader or the
      <varname>hint.apic.0.disabled</varname> loader tunable.  Note
      that disabling APIC is not compatible with SMP systems.</para>

    <para>(10 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The NFSv4 client may panic when attempting an
      NFSv4 operation against an NFSv3/NFSv2-only server.  This
      problem has been fixed with revision 1.4 of
      <filename>src/sys/rpc/rpcclnt.c</filename> in &os;
      &release.current;.  It was also fixed in &os;
      &release.bugfix;.</para>

    <para>(11 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) Some problems have been encountered when using
      third-party NSS modules, such as <filename>nss_ldap</filename>,
      and groups with large membership lists.  These have been fixed
      with revision 1.2 of <filename>src/include/nss.h</filename> and
      revision 1.2 of
      <filename>src/lib/libc/net/nss_compat.c</filename> in &os;
      &release.current;; this fix was backported to &os;
      &release.bugfix;.</para>

    <para>(13 Jan 2004) The &os; &release.current; release notes
      incorrectly stated that <application>GCC</application> was a
      post-release GCC 3.3.3 snapshot.  They should have stated that
      GCC was a <emphasis>pre-release</emphasis> GCC 3.3.3
      snapshot.</para>

    <para>(13 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The <filename
      role="package">sysutils/kdeadmin3</filename> port/package has a
      bug in the <application>KUser</application> component that can
      cause deletion of the <username>root</username> user from the
      system password file.  Users are strongly urged to upgrade to
      version 3.1.4_1 of this port/package.  The package set included
      with &os; &release.bugfix; contains the fixed version of this
      package.</para>

    <para>(21 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) Some bugs in the IPsec implementation imported
      from the KAME Project can result in memory objects being freed
      before all references to them were removed.  Reported symptoms
      include erratic behavior or kernel panics after flushing the
      Security Policy Database (SPD).  Some of these problems have
      been fixed in &os; &release.current; in rev. 1.31 of
      <filename>src/sys/netinet6/ipsec.c</filename>, rev. 1.136 of
      <filename>src/sys/netinet/in_pcb.c</filename>, and revs. 1.63
      and 1.64 of <filename>src/sys/netkey/key.c</filename>.  These
      bugfixes were backported to &os; &release.bugfix;.  More
      information about these problems has been posted to the
      &a.current;, in particular the thread entitled <ulink 
      url="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2004-January/thread.html#18084">
      <quote>[PATCH] IPSec fixes</quote></ulink>.</para>

    <para>(28 Feb 2004) The edition of the Porters Handbook included
      with &os; &release.bugfix; contained an incorrect value for
      &release.bugfix;'s <varname>__FreeBSD_version</varname>.  The
      correct value is <literal>502010</literal>.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>(10 Jan 2004, updated 28 Feb 2004) The TCP implementation in &os; now includes
      protection against a certain class of TCP MSS resource
      exhaustion attacks, in the form of limits on the size and rate
      of TCP segments.  The first limit sets the minimum allowed
      maximum TCP segment size, and is controlled by the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.minmss</varname> sysctl variable (the
      default value is <literal>216</literal> bytes).  The second
      limit is set by the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.minmssoverload</varname> variable, and
      controls the maximum rate of connections whose average segment
      size is less than <varname>net.inet.tcp.minmss</varname>.
      Connections exceeding this packet rate are reset and dropped.
      Because this feature was added late in the &release.prev;
      release cycle, connection rate limiting is disabled by default,
      but can be enabled manually by assigning a non-zero value to
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.minmssoverload</varname>.  This feature
      was added to &os; &release.prev; too late for inclusion in its
      release notes.</para>
