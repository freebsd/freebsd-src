	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>(5 Dec 2003) <application>BIND</application> contains the potential for a
      denial-of-service attack.  This vulnerability has been addressed
      by a vendor patch on the &release.prev; security fix branch and
      by the import of a new version to the &release.branch;
      development branch.  For more information, see 
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:19.bind.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:19</ulink>.</para>

    <para>(8 Feb 2004) A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call)
      can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details, including bugfix and workaround information,
      can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.</para>

    <para>(4 Mar 2004) It is possible for a remote attacker to conduct
      a low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against a machine
      providing TCP-based services, filling up the target's memory
      buffers and potentially leading to a system crash.  This
      vulnerability has been addressed on the &os; &release.prev;
      security fix branch.  Security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>
      contains more details, as well as information on patching
      existing systems.</para>

    <para>(17 Mar 2004) By performing a specially crafted SSL/TLS
      handshake with an application that uses OpenSSL a null pointer
      may be dereferenced.  This may in turn cause the application to
      crash, resulting in a denial of service attack.  For more information
      see the Security Advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</ulink>
      which contains more details and instructions on how to patch existing
      systems.</para>

    <title>Late-Breaking News</title>

    <para>(28 Oct 2003) Very late in the release cycle, a change was made to the
      HyperThreading (HTT) support on &intel; processors.  HTT support
      is now enabled by default on SMP-capable kernels; as a result,
      the <literal>HTT</literal> kernel option is unnecessary and has
      been removed.  The extra logical CPUs are always started so that
      they can handle interrupts, but are prevented from executing
      user processes by default.  To enable the logical CPUs, change
      the value of the <varname>machdep.hlt_logical_cpus</varname>
      &man.sysctl.8; variable from <literal>1</literal> to
      <literal>0</literal>.  This value can also be set from the
      loader as a tunable of the same name.  This behavior is now
      identical to &os; 5.<replaceable>X</replaceable>.</para>

    <para>(29 Oct 2003) Some of the packages contained in the first CD-ROM depend on
      different versions of the <application>OpenLDAP</application>
      packages, which cannot co-exist on the same host.  One
      manifestation of this problem is that it is not possible to
      install both the <filename role="package">x11/gnome2</filename>
      and <filename role="package">x11/kde3</filename>
      packages.</para>

    <para>(30 Oct 2003) It appears that the
      <filename>crypto</filename> distribution is required for correct
      functioning of the &os; base system.  At the very least, the
      libraries contained in the <filename>crypto</filename>
      distribution are required for &man.pkg.add.1;.</para>

    <para>(30 Oct 2003) There are known cases of fairly-recent i386
      machines with BIOSes that do not support booting from emulation
      mode El Torito CDROMs.  This prevents booting from the &os;
      &release.current; CDROMs.  As a workaround, download the floppy
      disk images, use them to boot the machine into
      &man.sysinstall.8;, and then do a CDROM install.  This problem
      does not seem to be wide-spread as of this writing.

      <note>
	<para>&os; 5.<replaceable>X</replaceable> uses non-emulation
	  El Torito booting on its CDROM releases by default.  These,
	  of course, cannot be booted on very old i386 machines that
	  only support emulation mode.</para>
      </note>

      </para>

    <para>(10 Nov 2003) An update was made to the
      <literal>xterm</literal> entry in the &man.termcap.5; database
      which, among other things, removed the (already deprecated)
      <literal>bs</literal> backspacing capability.  The &man.hack.6;
      game appears to depend on this capability and hence fails when
      run from inside a window with a terminal type of
      <literal>xterm</literal>.</para>

    <para>(10 Nov 2003) Tagged queueing in the &man.ata.4; driver
      is broken and appears to cause kernel panics.</para>
