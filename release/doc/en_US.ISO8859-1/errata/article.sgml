	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release.bugfix;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of
      &os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document for &os; &release.bugfix;
      will be maintained until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release.bugfix;.
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>(2006/05/10) The errata file distributed with &os;
      &release.bugfix; mistakenly contained the errata applicable to
      &os; 6.0-RELEASE.</para>

    <para>(2006/05/10) The release notes for &os; &release.bugfix;
      gave the wrong name for the KDE port in the item documenting the
      KDE upgrade.  The correct name is
      <filename role="package">x11/kde3</filename>.

    <para>(2006/05/10) The release notes for &os; &release.bugfix;
      should have mentioned changes that enable the second core of
      dual-core i386 and amd64 CPUs by default when running an SMP
      kernel.</para>

    <para>(2006/05/13) A change in the &man.ata.4; driver in &os;
      &release.bugfix; modified a software interface visible from
      userland programs.  Programs that use the
      <literal>IOCATAREQUEST</literal> &man.ioctl.2; interface will
      need to be recompiled.  Typically, these programs communicate
      directly with ATA and ATAPI drives, such as CDROM burning or
      ripping tools, or monitoring utilities.  One known example
      is <filename>smartd</filename> from the
      <filename role="package">sysutils/smartmontools</filename>
      port.</para>

    <para>(2006/05/27) On &os;/alpha, sysinstall sometimes does not allow
      a disk to be labeled.  The disk is presented in sysinstall but
      actions like 'A'auto do not result in a disklabel being presented.
      Workaround is to boot the install CD, then select Fixit.  From
      the Fixit prompt run disklabel manually.  For example:  
      "disklabel -rw da1 auto" ensures a valid disklabel is written onto
      da1.  Reboot from the install media.  sysinstall will now
      detect a valid disklabel on the disk and allow it to be partitioned
      to your preference.</para>

    <para>(2006/05/27) &os; &release.bugfix; includes a change
      to some definitions in <filename>src/sys/net/if_media.h</filename>
      (revision 1.30.2.1).  This could break source-level compatibility
      with externally-maintained 10Gb Ethernet network drivers written
      for &os; 6.0-RELEASE.  This change should have been documented
      in the release notes.</para>
