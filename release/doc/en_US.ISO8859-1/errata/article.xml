    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of
      &os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document for &os; &release;
      will be maintained until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink

      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>[20130608] &os; &release; no longer supports &os; CVS
      repository.  Some documents mistakenly refer to
      <literal>RELEASE_8_4_0</literal> as CVS tag for the release and
      <literal>RELENG_8_4</literal> as CVS branch tag for the
      &release; security branch.  However, &os; Project no longer
      supports &os; CVS repository and &release; has been released by
      using &os; subversion repository instead.
      <literal>RELENG_8_4</literal> corresponds to
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/releng/8.4</literal>, and
      <literal>RELEASE_8_4_0</literal> corresponds to
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/release/8.4.0</literal>.
      Please note that &os; source tree for &release; and its security
      branch cannot be updated by using official CVSup servers.</para>

    <para>[20130607] The &man.bge.4; network interface driver has an
      issue when TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) is enabled.  It causes
      intermittent reset and re-initialization.</para>

    <para>A workaround is disabling the TSO feature.  One can disable
      it by adding the following line into the &man.rc.conf.5;
      file:</para>

    <programlisting>ifconfig_<replaceable>bge0</replaceable>="-tso"</programlisting>

    <para>or by using the &man.ifconfig.8; utility manually:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ifconfig <replaceable>bge0</replaceable> -tso</userinput></screen>

    <para>A patch to fix this issue will be released as an Errata
      Notice.</para>

    <para>[20130606] The &man.fxp.4; network interface driver may not
      work well with the &man.dhclient.8; utility.  More specifically,
      if the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> has the following
      line:</para>

    <programlisting>ifconfig_fxp0="DHCP"</programlisting>

    <para>to activate a DHCP client to configure the network
      interface, the following notification messages are displayed and
      the &man.dhclient.8; utility keeps trying to initialize the
      network interface forever.</para>

    <screen>kernel: fxp0: link state changed to UP
kernel: fxp0: link state changed to DOWN</screen>

    <para>A patch to fix this issue will be released as an Errata
      Notice.</para>

    <para>[20130606] As described in &os; &release; Release Notes,
      &os; ZFS subsystem has been updated to support feature flags for
      ZFS pools.  However, the default version number of a newly
      created ZFS pool is still <literal>28</literal>.</para>

    <para>This is because &os; 9.0 and 9.1 do not support the feature
      flags.  This means ZFS pools with feature flag support cannot be
      used on &os; 9.0 and 9.1.  An 8.X system with v28 ZFS pools can
      be upgraded to 9.X with no problem.  Note that &man.zfs.8;
      <command>send</command> and <command>receive</command> commands
      do not work between pools with different versions.  Once a ZFS
      pool is upgraded from v28, there is no way to upgrade the system
      to &os; 9.0 and 9.1.  &os; 9.2 and later will support ZFS pools
      with feature flags.</para>

    <para>To create a ZFS pool with feature flag support, use the
      &man.zpool.8; <command>create</command> command and then the
      &man.zpool.8; <command>upgrade</command> command.</para>
