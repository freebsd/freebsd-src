	relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
	operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
	should always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at
      <link xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />,
      plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>
