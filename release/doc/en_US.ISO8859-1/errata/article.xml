      <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
	containing significant information discovered after the release

	This information includes security advisories, as well as news
	relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
	operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
	should always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the

      plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of

	<para>An issue was discovered with Amazon&reg; EC2&trade;
	  images which would cause the virtual machine to hang during
	  boot when upgrading from previous FreeBSD versions.  New
	  EC2&trade; installations are not affected, but existing
	  installations running earlier releases are advised to wait
	  until the issue is resolved in an Errata Notice before
	  upgrading.  An Errata Notice to address this is planned
	  following the release.</para>

	  without recompiling the kernel.</para>

	<para>To mitigate system crashes with such configurations,
	  chose <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the boot
	  menu and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8;
	  prompt, after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	  in Legacy/BIOS/CSM mode, the boot disk is partitioned with
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym>, and the Active flag in the
	  Protective <acronym>MBR</acronym> is not set.  To work

      <listitem>
	<para>[2016-10-21] Support for <literal>sha512</literal> and
	  <literal>skein</literal> checksumming has been added to the
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> filesystem.  This was not mentioned
	  in the release notes.</para>

	<para>Systems being upgraded from earlier &os; releases with
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> will see a message in <literal>zpool
	    status</literal> output noting the pool is not at the

	  Additional instructions on how to any <acronym>ZFS</acronym>

	  enabled <acronym>ZFS</acronym> boot blocks
	  (<filename>/boot/gptzfsboot</filename>) has increased past
	  64K.  Systems upgraded from older releases may experience
	  a problem where the size of the existing
	  &quot;freebsd-boot&quot; partition is too small to hold the
	  new <filename>gptzfsboot</filename>.</para>

	<para>Systems where the boot partition is immediately followed
	  by the swap partition, such as those installed via
	  &man.bsdinstall.8;, can resize the swap partition slightly
	  using the &man.gpart.8; <literal>resize</literal> command,
	  so space can be reclaimed to increase the size of the
	  freebsd-boot partition.</para>
