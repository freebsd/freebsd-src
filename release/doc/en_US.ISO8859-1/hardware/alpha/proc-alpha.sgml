    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>This document tries to provide a starting point for those
    who want to run &os; on an Alpha-based machine. It is
    aimed at providing background information on the various hardware
    designs. It is not a replacement for the systems manuals.</para>

    <para>The information is structured as follows:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>general hardware requirements to run &os; on alpha;</para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>system specific information for each of the
          systems/boards supported  by &os;;</para>

    </para>

    <note>
      <para>You will see references to DEC, Digital Equipment Corporation and 
      Compaq used more or less interchangeably. Now that Compaq has acquired 
      Digital Equipment it would be more correct to refer to Compaq only.
      Given the fact that you will see the mix of names everywhere I don't
      bother.</para>

    <note>
      <para>SRM commands will be in <userinput>UPPER CASE</userinput>. 
      Lower case input is also acceptible to SRM. Upper case is used for

    <title>In general, what do you need to run &os; on an Alpha?</title>

    <para>Obviously you will need an Alpha machine that &os;
    knows about.  Alpha machines are NOT like PCs. There are
    considerable differences between the various core logic chip sets and
    mainboard designs. This means that a kernel needs to know the
    intimate details of a particular machine before it can run on
    it. Throwing some odd <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel at
    unknown hardware is almost guaranteed to fail miserably.</para>

    <para>For a machine even to be considered for &os; use please
    make sure it has the SRM console firmware installed. Or at least
    make sure that SRM console firmware is available for the
    particular machine type. If &os; does not currently support
    your machine type, there is a good chance that this will change at
    some point in time, assuming SRM is available. All bets are off when
    SRM console firmware is not available.</para>

    <para>Machines with the ARC or AlphaBIOS console firmware were
    intended for WindowsNT. Some have SRM console firmware available
    in the system ROMs which you only have to select (via an ARC or
    AlphaBIOS menu). In other cases you will have to re-flash the ROMs
    with SRM code. Check on
    http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware to see what is
    available for your particular system. In any case: no SRM means 
    <emphasis>no</emphasis>
    &os; (or NetBSD, OpenBSD, Tru64 Unix or OpenVMS for that
    matter). With the demise of WindowsNT/alpha a lot of former NT
    boxes are sold on the second hand market. They have little or no
    trade-in value when they are NT-only from the console firmware
    perspective. So, be suspicious if the price appears too good.</para>

    <para>Known non-SRM machines are:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Digital XL series</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Digital XLT series</para>

	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Samsung 164B</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>To complicate things a bit further: Digital used to have so
    called <quote>white-box</quote> Alpha machines destined as NT-only
    and <quote>blue-box</quote> Alpha machines destined for OpenVMS
    and Digital Unix. These names are based on the color of the
    cabinets, <quote>FrostWhite</quote> and <quote>TopGunBlue</quote>
    respectively.  Although you could put the SRM console firmware on a
    whitebox, OpenVMS and Digital Unix will refuse to boot on
    them. &os; in post-4.0-RELEASE will run on both the white and the
    blue-box variants. Before someone asks: the white ones had a
    rather different (read: cheaper) Digital price tag.</para>

    <para>As part of the SRM you will get the so called OSF/1 PAL code
    (OSF/1 being the initial name of Digital's UNIX offering on
    Alpha). The PAL code can be thought of as a software abstraction
    layer between the hardware and the operating system. It uses
    normal CPU instruction plus a handful of privileged instructions
    specific for PAL use. PAL is not microcode.  The ARC console
    firmware contains a different PAL code, geared towards WinNT and
    in no way suitable for use by &os; (or more generic: Unix or
    OpenVMS).  Before someone asks: Linux/alpha brings its own PAL
    code, allowing it to boot on ARC and AlphaBIOS. There are various
    reasons why this is not a very good idea in the eyes of the *BSD
    folks. I don't want to go into details here. If you are interested
    in the gory details search the &os; and NetBSD web sites.</para>

    <para>There is another pitfall ahead: you will need a disk adapter
    that the SRM console firmware recognizes in order to be able to boot from
    a disk. What is acceptable to SRM as a boot adapter is
    unfortunately highly system and SRM version dependent. For older PCI
    based machines it means you will need either a NCR/Symbios
    53C810 based adapter, or a Qlogic 1020/1040 based adapter.  Some
    machines come with a SCSI chip embedded on the mainboard. Newer
    machine designs and SRM versions will be able to work with more modern
    SCSI chips/adapters.  Check out the machine specific info
    below. Please note that the rest of this discussion only refers to
    Symbios chips, this is meant to include the older chips that still
    have NCR stamped on them. Symbios bought NCR sometime.</para>

    <para>The problem might bite those who have machines that started
    their lives as WindowsNT boxes. The ARC or AlphaBIOS knows about
    <emphasis>other</emphasis> adapter types that it can boot from
    than the SRM. For example you can boot from an Adaptec 2940UW with
    ARC/AlphaBios but (generally) not with SRM. Some newer machine types have
    introduced Adaptec boot support. Please consult the machine
    specific section for details.</para>

    <para>Most adapters that cannot be booted from work fine for
    data-only disks.  The differences between SRM and ARC could also
    get you pre-packaged IDE CDROMs and hard drives in some (former
    WindowsNT) systems.  SRM versions exist (depends on the machine type)
    that can boot from IDE disks and CDROMs. Check the machine
    specific section for details.</para>

    <para>&os; 4.0 and later can be booted from the
    distribution CDROM.  Earlier versions needed booting from a
    2 disk floppy set.</para>

    <para>In order to be bootable the root partition (partition a)
    must be at offset 0 of the disk drive. This means you have to 
    use the installer's partitioning menu and start with assigning 
    partiton a at offset 0 to the root partition. Subsequently layout
    the rest of the partitions to your liking. If you do not adhere
    to this rule the install will proceed just fine, but the system
    will not be bootable from the freshly installed disk.</para>

    <para>If you don't have/want a local disk drive you can boot via
    the Ethernet.  This assumes an Ethernet adapter/chip that is
    recognized by the SRM console. Generally speaking this boils down to
    either a 21040 or 21142 or 21143 based Ethernet interface. Older
    machines or SRM versions may not recognize the 21142 / 21143 Fast
    Ethernet chips, you are then limited to using 10Mbit Ethernet for net
    booting those machines. Non-DEC cards based on said chips will
    generally (but are not guaranteed to) work. Note that Intel took
    over the 21x4x chips when it bought Digital Semiconductor. So you
    might see an Intel logo on them these days. Recent machine designs
    have SRM support for Intel 8255x Ethernet chips.</para>

    <para>Alpha machines can be run with SRM on a graphics console or
    on a serial console. ARC can also be run on a serial consoles if need
    be. VT100 emulation with 8 bit controls should at least allow you
    to switch from ARC/AlphaBIOS to SRM mode without having to install a
    graphics card first.</para>

    <para>If you want to run your Alpha machine without a monitor/graphics
    card just don't connect a keyboard/mouse to the machine. Instead
    hook up a serial terminal[emulator] to serial port #1.  The SRM
    will talk 9600N81 to you. This can also be really practical for
    debugging purposes. Beware: some/most (?) SRMs will also present
    you with a console prompt at serial port #2. The booting kernel,
    however, will display the boot messages on serial port #1 and will
    also put the console there. <emphasis>This can be extremely 
    confusing.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Most PCI based Alphas can use ordinary PC-type VGA
    cards. The SRM contains enough smarts to make that work. It does
    not, however, mean that each and every PCI VGA card out on the
    street will work in an Alpha machine. Things like S3 Trio64,
    Mach64, and Matrox Millennium generally work. Old ET4000 based ISA
    cards have also worked for me. But ask around first before buying.
    Please note that TGA cards are not currently supported as &os; console
    display cards.</para>

    <para>Most PCI devices from the PC-world will also work in
    &os; PCI-based machines. Check the
    <filename>/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</filename> file for the latest word
    on this. Check the appropriate machine type's
    discussion in case you want to use PCI cards that have PCI bridge
    chips on them. In some cases you might encounter problems with
    PCI cards not handling PCI parity correctly. This can lead to
    panics. PCI parity checking can be disabled using the following
    SRM command: &gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET PCI_PARITY OFF</userinput>. 
    This is not a &os; problem, all operating systems running on 
    Alpha hardware will need this workaround.</para>

    <para>If your system (also) contains EISA expansion slots you will
    need to run the EISA Configuration Utility (ECU) after you have
    installed EISA cards or after you have upgraded your 
    console firmware.</para>

    <para>For Alpha CPUs you will find multiple generations. The
    original Alpha design is the 21064. It was produced in a chip
    process called MOS4, chips made in this process are nicknamed
    EV4. Newer CPUs are 21164, 21264 etc. You will see designations
    like EV4S, EV45, EV5, EV56, EV6, EV67.  The EVs with double digit
    numbers are slightly improved versions. For example EV45 has an
    improved FPU and 16 kByte on-chip separate I &amp; D caches compared
    to the EV4 on which it is based. Rule of thumb: the higher the
    digit immediately following <quote>EV</quote> the more desirable
    (read: faster / more modern).</para>

    <para>For memory you want at least 32 Mbytes. I have had
    &os; run on a 16 Mbyte system but you will not enjoy
    that. Kernel build times halved when I went to 32 Mbytes. Note that
    the SRM console steals 2Mbyte from the total system memory (and keeps
    it). For more serious work 64 Mbytes or more are recommended.</para>

    <para>While on the subject of memory: pay close attention to the
    type of memory your machine uses. There are very different memory
    configurations and requirements for the various machines.</para>

    <para>Final word: I expect the above to sound a bit daunting to
    the first-time Alpha user. Don't be daunted too much. And do feel
    free to ask questions if something is not clear after reading this
    document.</para>

    <title>System-specific information</title>

    <para>Below is an overview of the hardware that &os; runs on. This list 
    will definitely grow, a look in 
    <filename>/sys/alpha/conf/GENERIC</filename> can be enlightening.</para>
 
    <para>Alpha machines are often best known by their project code name. 
    Where known these are listed below in parentheses.</para>

    <sect3>    
      <title>AXPpci33 (<quote>NoName</quote>)</title>

      <para>The NoName is a baby-AT mainboard based on the 21066 LCA
      (Low Cost Alpha) processor. NoName was originally designed for
      OEM-use. The LCA chip includes almost all of the logic to drive
      a PCI bus and the memory subsystem.  All of this makes for a
      low-priced design.</para>

      <para>Due to the limited memory interface the system is not
      particularly fast in case of cache misses. As long as you stay
      inside the on-chip cache the CPU is comparable to a 21064 (first
      generation Alpha). These boards should be very cheap to obtain
      these days. It is a full-fledged 64 bit CPU, just don't expect
      miracles as far as speed goes.</para>

      <para>NoNames can either have SRM <emphasis>or</emphasis> ARC console
      firmware in their Flash ROM.  The Flash ROM is not big enough to
      hold both ARC and SRM at the same time and allow software
      selection of alternate console code. But you only need SRM
      anyway.</para>

      <para>Cache for the NoNames are 15 or 20 ns DIL chips. For a 256
      kByte cache you want to check your junked 486 mainboard. Chips
      for a 1 Mbyte cache are a rarer breed unfortunately. Getting at
      least a 256kByte cache is recommended performance
      wise. Cache-less they are really slow.</para>

      <para>The NoName mainboard has a PC/AT-standard power
      connector. It also has a power connector for 3.3 Volts. No need
      to rush out to get a new power supply. The 3.3 Volts is only
      needed in case you run 3.3 Volts PCI expansion boards. These are
      quite rare.</para>

      <para>The IDE interface is supported by &os; and requires a
      line in the kernel configuration file as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>device ata0 at isa? port IO_WD1 irq 14</programlisting>

      <para>The SRM console unfortunately <emphasis> cannot boot</emphasis>
      from IDE disks. This means you will have to use a SCSI disk as
      the boot device.</para>

      <para>The NoName is somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial
      consoles. It needs 
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE SERIAL</userinput></screen>
      before it goes for a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from 
      the machine is not sufficient, like it is on most other Alpha models. 
      Going back to a graphical console needs
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</userinput></screen>
      at the serial console.</para>

      <para>Make sure you use true 36 bit SIMMs, and only FPM (Fast
      Page Mode) DRAM. EDO DRAM or SIMMs with fake parity <emphasis>will not
      work</emphasis>. The board uses the 4 extra bits for ECC. 33
      bit FPM SIMMs will for the same reason not work.</para>

      <para>Given the choice, get the PS/2-variant mainboard. Apart
      from giving you a mouse port as bonus it is directly supported
      by Tru64 Unix in case you ever want or need to run it. The
      <quote>DIN-plug</quote>-variant should work OK for &os;.</para>

      <para>Multia has enough Flash ROM to store both SRM and ARC code

      <para>Multia has only one 32 bit PCI slot for expansion, and it
      is only suitable for a small form factor PCI card. By
      sacrificing the PCI slot space you can mount a 3.5&quot; hard disk
      drive. Mounting stuff may have come with your Multia. Adding a
      3.5&quot; disk is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a recommended upgrade 
      due to the limited power rating of the power supply 
      and the extremely marginal cooling of
      the system box.</para>

      <para>Multia also has 2 PCMCIA expansion slots. These are
      currently not supported by &os;.</para>

      <para>The CPU might or might not be socketed, check this before
      considering CPU upgrade hacks. The low-end Multias have a

      <para>It comes with a TGA based graphics on-board. TGA is not
      currently suitable for console use with &os;. This means you will have
      to run Multia using a serial console. Note that the boot of the
      installation disk will appear to work fine using the TGA
      console, but then switches to using the serial port. This is
      even mentioned during by installer (but never read by the human
      doing the install). Your keyboard appears dead from that point
      on.</para>

      <para>Multia has 2 serial ports but routes both of them to the
      outside world on a single 25 pin sub-D connector. The Multia FAQ
      explains how to build your own Y-cable to allow both ports to be
      used.</para>

      <para>Although the Multia SRM supports booting from floppy this
      can be problematic. Typically the errors look like:

      <screen>
	*** Soft Error - Error #10 - FDC: Data overrun or underrun
      </screen>

      This is not a &os; problem, it is a SRM problem. The best available
      workaround to install &os; is to boot from a SCSI CDROM.</para>

      <para>Sound works fine using &man.pcm.4; driver and a line in the
      kernel configuration file as follows for the Crystal CS4231
      chip:</para>

      <programlisting>device pcm0 at isa? port 0x530  irq 9 drq 3 flags 0x15</programlisting>

      <para>I have not yet been successful in getting my Multia with
      the AD1848 to play any sound.</para>

      <para>While verifying playback I was reminded of the lack of CPU
      power of the 166MHz CPU. MP3 only plays acceptable using 22kHz
      down-sampling.</para>

      <para>Multias are somewhat notorious for dying of heat
      strokes. The very compact box does not really allow access to cooling air.
      Please use the Multia on its vertical stand,
      don't put it horizontally (<quote>pizza style</quote>).  Replacing the 
      fan with something which pushes around more air is really
      recommended. You can also cut one of the wires to the fan speed
      sensor. Once cut, the fan runs at a (loud) full speed.
      Beware of PCI cards with high power consumption.
      If your system has died you might want to check the
      Multia-Heat-Death pages at the 
      <ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD Web site</ulink>
      for help in reviving it.</para>

      <para>The Intel 82378ZB PCI to ISA bridge enables the use of an
      IDE disk. This requires a line in the kernel configuration file
      as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>device ata0 at isa? port IO_WD1 irq 14</programlisting>

      <para>The IDE connector pin spacing is thought for 2.5&quot; laptop
      disks. A 3.5&quot; IDE disk would not fit in the case anyway. At
      least not without sacrificing your only PCI slot. The SRM 
      console unfortunately does not know how to boot from IDE 
      disks. You will need to use a SCSI disk as the bootdisk.</para>

      <para>In case you want to change the internal hard drive: the
      internal flat cable running from the PCI riser board to the 
      <emphasis>2.5&quot;</emphasis>
      hard drive has a finer pitch than the standard SCSI flat
      cables. Otherwise it would not fit on the 2.5&quot; drives. There are
      also riser cards that have a standard-pitch SCSI cable attached
      to it, which will fit an ordinary SCSI disk.</para>

      <para>Again, I recommend against trying to cram a replacement
      hard disk inside. Use the external SCSI connector and put your
      disk in an external enclosure.  Multias run hot enough as-is. In
      most cases you will have the external high density 50-pin SCSI
      connector but some Multia models came without disk and may lack
      the connector. Something to check before buying one.</para>

      <para>The kernel configuration file for a Multia kernel must
      contain:

      <programlisting>options	DEC_AXPPCI_33
cpu	EV4</programlisting></para>

      <title>Personal Workstation (<quote>Miata</quote>)</title>

      <para>The Miata is a small tower machine intended to be put
      under a desk. There are multiple Miata variants. The original
      Miata is the MX5 model. Because it suffers from a number of
      hardware design flaws a redesign was done, yielding the
      MiataGL. Unfortunately the variants are not easily distinguishable 
      at first sight from the outside of the case.
      An easy check is to see if the back of the machine sports two
      USB connectors. If yes, it is a MiataGL. MX5 models tend to be
      more common in the used system market place.</para>

      <para>System designations look like <quote>Personal Workstation
      433a</quote>. Personal Workstation, being a bit of a mouthful,
      is often abbreviated to PWS.  This means it has a 433 MHz CPU,
      and started life as a WinNT workstation (the trailing
      <quote>a</quote>). Systems designated from day 1 to run Tru64
      Unix or OpenVMS will sport <quote>433au</quote>. WinNT-Miatas
      are likely to come pre-configured with an IDE CDROM drive. So,
      in general systems are named like PWS[433,500,600]a[u].

      <para>There was also a Miata model with a special CPU cooling
      system by Kryotech. The Kryotech has a special cooling system 
      and is housed in a different enclosure.</para>

      <para>The Miata logic is divided into two printed circuit
      boards.  The lower board in the bottom of the machine has the
      PCI and ISA slots and things like the sound chip etc. The top
      board has the CPU, the Pyxis chip, memory etc. Note that MX5
      and the MiataGL use a different PCI riser board. This means
      that you cannot just upgrade to a MiataGL CPU board (with the
      newer Pyxis chip) but that you will also need a different
      riser board. Apparently an MX5 riser with a MiataGL CPU board
      will work but it is definitely not a supported or tested
      configuration.  Everything else (cabinet, wiring, etc.) is
      identical for MX5 and MiataGL.</para>

      <para>MX5 has problems with DMA via the 2 64-bit PCI slots
      when this DMA crosses a page boundary. The 32 bit slots don't
      have this problem because the PCI-PCI bridge chip does not
      allow the offending transfers. The SRM code knows about the
      problem and refuses to start the system if there is a PCI card
      in one of the 64bit slots that it does not know about. Cards
      that are <quote>known good</quote> to the SRM are allowed to
      be used in the 64bit slots.</para>

      <para>If you want to fool the SRM you can type <userinput>set
      pci_device_override</userinput> at the SRM prompt. Just don't
      complain if your data mysteriously gets mangled.</para>

      <para>The complete command is:

      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE <replaceable>&lt;vendor_id&gt;</replaceable><replaceable>&lt;device_id&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen></para>

      <para>For example:

<screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE 88c15333</userinput></screen></para>

      <para>The most radical approach is to use:

<screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PCI_DEVICE_OVERRIDE -1</userinput></screen></para>

      <para>This disables PCI ID checking altogether, so that you
      can install any PCI card without its ID getting
      checked. For this to work you need a reasonable current SRM version.
      <important><para>Do this on your own risk..</para></important></para>

      <para>The &os; kernel reports it when it sees a buggy Pyxis chip:
<screen>Sep 16 18:39:43 miata /kernel: cia0: Pyxis, pass 1
Sep 16 18:39:43 miata /kernel: cia0: extended capabilities: 1&lt;BWEN&gt;
Sep 16 18:39:43 miata /kernel: cia0: WARNING: Pyxis pass 1 DMA bug; no bets...</screen></para>

      <para>A MiataGL probes as:
<screen>Jan  3 12:22:32 miata /kernel: cia0: Pyxis, pass 1
Jan  3 12:22:32 miata /kernel: cia0: extended capabilities: 1&lt;BWEN&gt;
Jan  3 12:22:32 miata /kernel: pcib0: &lt;2117x PCI host bus adapter&gt; on cia0</screen></para>

      <para>MiataGL does not have the DMA problems of the MX5. PCI
      cards that make the MX5 SRM choke when installed in the 64bit
      slots are accepted without problems by the MiataGL SRM.</para>

      <para>The latest mainboard revisions of MX5 contain a hardware
      workaround for the bug. The SRM does not know about the ECO
      and will complain about unknown cards as before. So does the
      &os; kernel by the way.</para>

      <para>The Miata SRM can boot from IDE CDROM drives. IDE harddisk
      boot is known to work for both MiataGL and MX5 disks, so you
      can root &os; from an IDE disk. Speeds on MX5 are around 14
      Mbytes/sec assuming a suitable drive. Miata's CMD646 chip will
      support up to WDMA2 mode as the chip is too buggy for use
      with UDMA.</para>

      <para>Miata MX5s generally use Qlogic 1040 based SCSI adapters.
      These are bootable by the SRM console. Note that Adaptec cards
      are <emphasis>not</emphasis> bootable by the Miata SRM console.</para>

      <para>The MiataGL has a faster PCI-PCI bridge chip on the PCI
      riser card than some of the MX5 riser card versions. Some of
      the MX5 risers have the <emphasis>same</emphasis> chip as the
      MiataGL. All in all there is a lot of variation.</para>

      <para>Not all VGA cards will work behind the PCI-PCI
      bridge. This manifests itself as no video at all. Workaround
      is to put the VGA card <quote>before</quote> the bridge, in
      one of the 64 bit PCI slots.</para>

      <para>Both MX5 and MiataGL have an on-board sound chip, an
      ESS1888. It emulates a SoundBlaster and can be enabled by
      putting
<programlisting>device	pcm0
device	sbc0</programlisting>
      in your kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>in case your Miata has the optional cache board
      installed make sure it is firmly seated. A slightly loose
      cache has been observed to cause weird crashes (not surprising
      obviously, but maybe not so obvious when troubleshooting). The
      cache module is identical between MX5 and MiataGL.</para>

      <para>Installing a 2Mb cache module achieves, apart from a
      10-15% speed increase (based on buildworld elapsed time), a
      <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> for PCI DMA read bandwidth from
      64bit PCI cards. A benchmark on a 64-bit Myrinet card resulted
      in a decrease from 149 Mbytes/sec to 115 Mbytes/sec. Something
      to keep in mind when doing really high speed things with 64
      bit PCI adapters.</para>

      <para>If you experience SRM errors like 

      <screen>ERROR: scancode 0xa3 not supported on PCXAL</screen> 

      after halting &os; you should update your SRM firmware to V7.2-1 or
      later. This SRM version is first available on the Firmware
      Update CD V5.7, or on <ulink
      url="http://www.compaq.com/">http://www.compaq.com/</ulink> This SRM
      problem is fixed on both Miata MX5 and Miata GL.</para>

      <para>USB is supported by &os; 4.1 and later.</para>

      <title>DEC3000 family (the <quote>Bird</quote> machines)</title>

      <para>The DEC3000 series were among the first Alpha machines
      ever produced. They are based on an I/O bus called the
      TurboChannel (TC) bus. These machines are built like tanks
      (watch your back).</para>

      <para>DEC3000 can be subdivided in DEC3000/500-class and
      DEC3000/300-class.  The DEC3000/500-class is the early high-end
      workstation/server Alpha family.  Servers use serial consoles,
      workstations have graphics tubes.  DEC3000/300-class is the
      lower-cost workstation class.</para>

      <para>DEC3000/500-class are quite fast (considering their age)
      thanks to the good memory design. DEC3000/300 is crippled
      compared to DEC3000/500 because of its much narrower memory
      bus.</para>

      <para>They are called <quote>Birds</quote> because their
      internal DEC code names were bird names:

      <para>Currently DEC3000 machines can only be used diskless on
      &os;. The reason for this is that the SCSI drivers needed
      for the TC SCSI adapters were not brought into CAM that the
      recent &os; versions use. TC option cards for single (PMAZ-A) or
      dual fast SCSI (PMAZC-AA) are also available.  These cards currently
      have no drivers on &os; either.<para>

      <para>DEC3000/300 has 5 MBytes/sec SCSI on-board. This bus is
      used for both internal and external devices. DEC3000/500 has 2
      SCSI buses. One is for internal devices only, the other one is
      for external devices only.<para>

      <para>Floppy devices found in the DEC3000s are attached to the
      SCSI bus (via a bridge card). This makes it possible to boot from them
      using the same device names as ordinary SCSI hard-disks, for example:
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>BOOT DKA300</userinput></screen>
      </para>

      <para>The 3000/300 series has a half-speed TurboChannel compared
      to the other 3000 machines. Some TC expansion cards have
      troubles with the half-speed bus. Caveat emptor.</para>

      <para>The embedded ISDN interface is not supported on &os;.</para>

      <para>DEC3000/300-class uses standard 36 bit, 72 pin Fast Page
      Mode SIMMs.  EDO SIMMs, 32 or 33 bit SIMMs all will not work in
      Pelicans.  For 32Mbyte SIMMs to work on the DEC3000/300-class
      the presence detect bits/pins of the SIMM must correspond to
      what the machine expects. If they don't, the SIMM is
      <quote>seen</quote> as a 8 Mbyte SIMM. 8 Mbyte and 32 Mbyte
      SIMMs can be mixed, as long as the pairs themselves are
      identical.</para>

      <para>When you find yourself in need of fixing 32Mbyte SIMMs
      that lack correct presence bits the following info might be of

      <para>There are four presence detection bits on PS/2 SIMMs.  Two
      of the bits indicate the access time.  The other two indicate
      the memory size.</para>

      <para>At one end of the SIMM there are two rows of four solder

      <para>DEC3000/500-class can use 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Mbyte 100pin
      SIMMs.  Note that the maximum memory size varies from system to
      system, desktop machines have sacrificed box size for less
      memory SIMM sockets.  Given enough sockets and enough SIMMs you
      can get to 512 Mbytes maximum.  This is one of the main
      differences between floor standing and desktop machines, the
      latter have far less SIMM sockets.</para>

      <para>The sound hardware is not supported on any of the Birds.</para>

      <para>There is no X-Windows version available for the TC

      might work with a graphical console. I ran mine with a serial
      console so I cannot verify this.</para>

      <para>Birds can be obtained from surplus sales etc. As they are
      not PCI based they are no longer actively maintained. TC
      expansion boards can be difficult to obtain these days and
      support for them is not too good unless you write/debug the code
      yourself. Programming information for TC boards is hard to
      find. Birds are recommended only if a. you can get them cheap
      and b. if you prepared to work on the code to support them
      better.</para>

      <para>Aspen Alpine is slightly different, but is close enough to the 
      EB64+ to run an EB64+ SRM EPROM (mine did..). The Aspen Alpine does 
      not have an embedded Ethernet, has 3 instead of 2 PCI slots. It comes 
      with 2 Mbytes of cache already soldered onto the mainboard. It has 
      jumpers to select the use of 60, 70 or 80ns SIMM speeds.</para>

      <para>36 bits SIMMs work fine, 3 bits simply remain unused. Note
      the systems use Fast Page Mode memory, not EDO memory.</para>

      <para>The SRM console code is housed in an UV-erasable EPROM. No 
      easy flash SRM upgrades for the EB64+ The latest SRM version available 
      for EB64+ is quite ancient anyway.</para>

      <para>The EB64+ SRM can boot both 53C810 and Qlogic1040 SCSI adapters. 
      Pitfall for the Qlogic is that the firmware that is down-loaded by 
      the SRM onto the Qlogic chip is very old. There are no updates for the 
      EB64+ SRM available. So you are stuck with old Qlogic bits too. 
      I have had quite some problems when I wanted to use Ultra-SCSI drives 
      on the Alpine with Qlogic. The &os; kernel can be compiled to include 
      a much newer Qlogic firmware revision. This is not the default because 
      it adds hundreds of kBytes worth of bloat to the kernel. In &os; 4.1 
      and later the isp firmware is contained in a kernel loadable module. 
      All of this might mean that you need to use a non-Qlogic adapter to 
      boot from.</para>

      <para>For the EB64+ class machines the kernel config file must contain:

      <para>Using 8 SIMMs for a 256bit wide memory can yield interesting 
      speedups over a 4 SIMM/128bit wide memory. Obviously all 8 SIMMs must 
      be of the same type to make this work. The system must be explicitly 
      setup to use the 8 SIMM memory arrangement. You must have 8 SIMMs, 
      4 SIMMs distributed over 2 banks will not work.</para>

      <para>The SRM can boot from Qlogic 10xx boards or the Symbios 53C810[A].
      Newer Symbios 810 revisions like the Symbios 810AE are not recognized by
      the SRM on PC164. PC164 SRM does not appear to recognize a Symbios 53C895 
      based host adapter (tested with a Tekram DC-390U2W). On the other hand 
      some no-name Symbios 53C985 board has been reported to work.
      Cards like the Tekram DC-390F (Symbios875 based) have been confirmed to 
      work fine on the PC164. Unfortunately this seems to be dependent on the 
      actual version of the chip/board.</para>

      <para>Symbios 53C825[a] will also work as boot adapter. Diamond 
      FirePort, although based on Symbios chips, is not bootable by the 
      PC164SX SRM. PC164SX is reported to boot fine with Symbios825, 
      Symbios875 and Symbios876 based cards. In addition, Adaptec 
      2940U and 2940UW are reported to work for booting (verified on 
      SRM V5.7-1). Adaptec 2930U2 and 2940U2[W] do not work.</para>

      <para>164LX and 164SX with SRM firmware version 5.8 or later can boot 
      from Adaptec 2940-series adapters.</para>

      <para>In summary: this family of machines is <quote>blessed</quote> with a 
      challenging compatibility as far as SCSI adapters go.</para>

      <para>On PC164 the SRM sometimes seems to loose its variable settings. 
      <quote>For PC164, current superstition says that, to avoid losing settings,
      you want to first downgrade to SRM 4.x and then upgrade to 5.x.</quote>
      One sample error that was observed was: 
      <screen>ERROR: ISA table corrupt!</screen>
      A sequence of a downgrade to SRM4.9, an <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</prompt> <userinput>ISACFG -INIT</userinput></screen> 
      followed by <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt; </prompt><userinput>INIT</userinput></screen> 
      made the problem go away. Some PC164 owners report they have never seen 
      the problem. </para>

      <para>On PC164SX the AlphaBIOS allows you a selection to select SRM to
      be used as console on the next power up. This selection does 
      not appear to have any effect. In other words, you will get the 
      AlphaBIOS regardless of what you select. The fix is to reflash the 
      console ROM with the SRM code for PC164SX. This will overwrite the 
      AlphaBIOS and will get you the SRM console you desire. The SRM code 
      can be found on the Compaq Web site.</para>

      <para>PC164 can boot from IDE disks assuming your SRM version is 
      recent enough.</para>

      <para>EB164 needs a power supply that supplies 3.3 Volts. PC164 does 
      not implement the PS_ON signal that ATX power supplies need to switch on. 
      A simple switch pulling this signal to ground allows you to run a
      standard ATX power supply.</para>

      <para>For the EB164 class machines the kernel config file must 
      contain:

      EV6 based machines have in the meantime taken their place as front 
      runners. AS500 is a desktop in a dark blue case (TopGun blue), 
      AS600 is a sturdy desk-side box. AS600 has a nice LCD panel to observe 
      the early stages of SRM startup.</para>

      <para>Early machines had Fast SCSI interfaces, later ones are Ultra 
      SCSI capable. AS500 shares its single SCSI bus with internal and external 
      devices. For a Fast SCSI bus you are limited to 1.8 meters bus 
      length external to the box. +++ This is what some DEC docs suggest. 
      Did they ever go UltraSCSI?</para>
  
      <para>AS600 has one Qlogic SCSI chip dedicated to the internal devices 
      whereas the other Qlogic SCSI chip is dedicated to external SCSI devices.
      </para>
  
      <para>In AS500 DIMMs are installed in sets of 4, in <quote>physically 
      interleaved</quote> layout. So, a bank of 4 DIMMs is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      4 physically adjacent DIMMs.</para>
  
      <para>In AS600 the memory SIMMs are placed onto two memory daughter 
      cards. SIMMs are installed in sets of 8. Both memory daughter cards must 
      be populated identically.</para>
  
      <para>AS600 has a peculiarity for its PCI slots. AS600 (or rather the 
      PCI expansion card containing the SCSI adapters) does not allow I/O port 
      mapping, therefore all devices behind it must use memory mapping. If you 
      have problems getting the Qlogic SCSI adapters to work, add the following 
      option to <filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>: 
  
      <screen><userinput>set isp_mem_map=0xff</userinput></screen>
          
      This may need to be typed at the boot loader prompt before booting the
      installation kernel.</para>

      <title>AlphaServer 1000 (<quote>Mikasa</quote>), 
      1000A (<quote>Noritake</quote>) and 800</title>

      <para>The AlphaServer 1000 and 800 range of machines are intended as 
      departmental servers. They come in quite some variations in packaging 
      and mainboard/cpu. Generally speaking there are 21064 (EV4) CPU based 
      machines and 21164 (EV5) based ones. The CPU is on a daughter card, and 
      the type of CPU (EV4 or EV5) must match the mainboard in use.</para>

      <para>AlphaServer 800 has a much smaller mini tower case, it lacks the 
      StorageWorks SCSI hot-plug chassis. The main difference between AS1000 
      and AS1000A is that AS1000A has 7 PCI slots whereas AS1000 only has 3 
      PCI slots and has EISA slots instead.</para>

      <para>AS1000-systems: All EV4 based machines use standard PS/2 style 
      36 bit 72pin SIMMs in sets of 5. The fifth SIMM is used for ECC.
      All EV5 based machines use standard PS/2 style 36 bit 72pin SIMMs in sets 
      of 4. The ECC is done based on the 4 extra bits per SIMM 
      (4 bits out of 36). The EV5 mainboards have 16 SIMM slots, 
      the EV4 mainboards have 20 slots.</para>

      <para> AS800 machines use DIMMs in sets of 4. DIMM installation must 
      start in slots marked bank 0. A bank is four physically adjacent slots. 
      The biggest size DIMMs must be installed in bank 0 in case 2 banks 
      of different DIMM sizes are used. Max memory size is 2GB. Note 
      that these are EDO DIMMs.</para>

      <para>The AS1000/800 are somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial
      consoles. They need 
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE SERIAL</userinput></screen>
      before they go for
      a serial console. Pulling the keyboard from the machine is not sufficient,
      like it is on most other Alpha models. Going back to a graphical console
      needs 
      <screen>&gt;&gt;&gt; <userinput>SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</userinput></screen>
      at the serial console.</para>

      <para>For AS800 you want to check if your Ultra-Wide SCSI is indeed

      The differences are the software and options that are supported. DS10L 
      is a DS10 based machine in a 1U high rackmount enclosure. DS10L is 
      intended for ISPs and for HPTC clusters (e.g. Beowulf)</para>

      <para>Webbrick is shipped in a desktop-style case similar to the older 
      21164 <quote>Maverick</quote> workstations but this case offers much better access 
      to the components. If you intend to build a farm you can rackmount them 
      in a 19-inch rack; they are 3U high. Slate is 1U high but has only 
      one PCI slot.</para>

      <para>DS10 has 4 DIMM slots. DIMMs are installed as pairs. Please note 
      that DIMM pairs are not installed in adjacent DIMM sockets but rather 
      physically interleaved. DIMM sizes of 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 Mbytes 
      are supported.</para>

      <para>When 2 pairs of identical-sized DIMMs are installed DS10 will 
      use memory interleaving for increased performance. DS10L, which has 
      only 2 DIMM slots cannot do interleaving.</para>

      <para>Starting with SRM firmware version 5.9 you can boot from 
      Adaptec 2940-series adapters in addition to the usual set of Qlogic 
      and Symbios/NCR adapters.</para>

      <para>The base model comes with a FUJITSU 9.5GB ATA disk as its boot 
      device. &os; works just fine using EIDE disks on Webbrick. DS10 has 
      2 IDE interfaces on the mainboard. Machines destined for Tru64 Unix or 
      VMS are standard equipped with Qlogic-driven Ultra-SCSI disks</para>

      <para>On the PCI bus 32 and 64 bit cards are supported, in 3.3V and

      needs &gt;&gt;&gt; 
      <screen><userinput>SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS</userinput></screen>
      at the serial console.  
      Confusing is the fact that you will get SRM console
      output on the graphics console with the console set to serial,
      but when &os; boots it honors the <literal>CONSOLE</literal>
      variable setting and all the boot messages as well as the login
      prompt will go to the serial port.</para>

      <para>The DS20 is housed in a fat cube-like enclosure. The
      enclosure also contains a StorageWorks SCSI hot-swap shelf for a
      maximum of seven 3.5&quot; SCSI devices.  The DS20E is in a sleeker

      and so on.</para>

      <para>Don't try to use Symbios-chip based SCSI adapters in the
      PCI slots connected to hose 1. There is a not-yet-found &os; bug

      <para>The AlphaServer 2[01]00 machines are intended as departmental 
      servers. This is medium iron. They are multi-CPU machines, up to 2 
      CPUs (AS2000) or 4 CPUs (2100[A]) can be installed. Both floor-standing 
      and 19&quot; rackmount boxes exist. Rackmount variations have
      different numbers of I/O expansion slots, different max number 
      of CPUs and different maximum memory size. Some of the boxes come 
      with an integral StorageWorks shelf to house hot-swap SCSI disks. 
      There was an upgrade program available to convert your Sable 
      machine into a Lynx by swapping the I/O backplane (the C-bus 
      backplane remains). CPU upgrades were available as well.</para>

      <para>The CPUs spec-ed as 200 MHz are in reality running at 
      190 MHz. Maximum number of CPUs is 4. All CPUs must be of the 
      same type/speed.</para>

      <para>If any of the processors are ever marked as failed, they will
      remain marked as failed even after they have been replaced (or reseated) 
      until you issue the command <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>CLEAR_ERROR ALL</userinput></screen>
      on the SRM console and power-cycle the machine.  This may be true 
      for other modules (IO and memory) as well, but it has not been verified.
      </para>

      <para>The machines use dedicated memory boards. These boards live on 
      a 128 bit C-bus shared with the CPU boards. DemiSable supports up 
      to 1GB, Sable up to 2GB. One of the memory bus slots can either 
      hold a CPU or a memory card. A 4 CPU machine can have a maximum of 
      2 memory boards.</para>

      <para>Some memory board models house SIMMs. These are called SIMM 
      carriers. There are also memory modules that have soldered-on memory 
      chips instead of SIMMs. These are called <quote>flat memory 
      modules</quote>.</para>

      <para>SIMM boards are used in sets of eight 72-pin 36 bit FPM 
      memory of 70ns or faster. SIMM types supported are 1Mb x36 bit 
      (4 Mbyte) and 4Mb x36 bit (16 Mbyte). Each memory board can house 
      4 banks of SIMMs. SIMM sizes can not be mixed on a single memory 
      board. The first memory module must be filled with SIMMs before 
      starting to fill the next memory module. Note that the spacing 
      between the slots is not that big, so make sure your SIMMs fit 
      physically (before buying them..)</para>

      <para>Both Lynx and Sable are somewhat stubborn when it comes to serial
      consoles. They need 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput> SET CONSOLE SERIAL</userinput></screen>
      before they go for a serial console. 
      Pulling the keyboard from the machine is not sufficient, like it is 
      on many other Alpha models. Going back to a graphical console needs 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET CONSOLE GRAPHICS
      </userinput></screen> at the serial console. On Lynx keep the VGA card in 
      one of the primary PCI slots. EISA VGA cards are not slot sensitive.
      </para>

      <para>The machines are equipped with a small OCP 
      (Operator Control Panel) LCD screen. On this screen the self-test 
      messages are displayed during system initialization. You can put 
      your own little text there by using the SRM: 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET OCP_TEXT "FreeBSD"
      </userinput></screen> is the recommended setting.

      <para>The SRM 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SHOW FRU</userinput></screen>
      command produces an overview of your configuration
      with module serial numbers, hardware revisions and error log counts.
      </para>

      <para>Both Sable, DemiSable and Lynx have Symbios 810 based 
      Fast SCSI on-board. Check if it is set to Fast SCSI speed 
      by 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SHOW PKA0_FAST</userinput></screen>. 
      When set to 1 it is negotiating for Fast speeds. 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>SET PKA0_FAST 1</userinput></screen>
      enables Fast SCSI speeds.</para>

      <para>AS2100[A] come equipped with a StorageWorks 7 slot SCSI 
      cage. A second cage can be added inside the cabinet. AS2000 
      has a single 7 slot SCSI cage, which cannot be expanded with 
      an additional one. Note that the slot locations in these cages 
      map differently to SCSI IDs compared to the standard StorageWorks 
      shelves. Slot IDs from top to bottom are 0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3 
      when using a single bus configuration.</para>

      <para>The cage can also be set to provide two independent SCSI 
      buses. This is used for embedded RAID controllers like the 
      KZPSC (Mylex DAC960). Slot ID assignments for split bus are, 
      from top to bottom: 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B. 
      Where A and B signify a SCSI bus. In a single bus configuration the 
      terminator module on the back of the SCSI cage is on the TOP. The jumper
      module is on the BOTTOM. For split bus operation these two modules are
      reversed. The terminator can be distinguished from the jumper 
      by noting the chips on the terminator. The jumper does not have 
      any active components on it.</para>

      <para>DemiSable has 7 EISA slots and 3 PCI slots. Sable has 
      8 EISA and 3 PCI slots. Lynx, being newer, has 8 PCI 
      and 3 EISA slots. The Lynx PCI slots are grouped in 
      sets of 4. The 4 PCI slots closest to the CPU/memory
      slots are the primary slots, so logically before the PCI bridge chip.
      Note that contrary to expectation the primary PCI slots are the highest
      numbered ones (PCI4 - PCI7).</para>

      <para>Make sure you run the EISA Configuration Utility (from floppy) 
      when adding/change expansion cards in EISA slots or after 
      upgrading your console firmware. This is done by inserting the 
      ECU floppy and typing 
      <screen><prompt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</prompt> <userinput>RUNECU</userinput></screen>

      <note><para>EISA slots are currently unsupported, but the Compaq Qvision
      EISA VGA adapter is treated as an ISA device. It therefore
      works OK as a console.</para></note>

      <para>A special Extended I/O module for use on the C-bus was 
      planned-for. If they ever saw daylight is unknown. In any case 
      &os; has never been verified with an ExtIO module.</para>

      <para>The machines can be equipped with redundant power supplies. Note 
      that the enclosure is equipped with interlock switches that switch 
      off power when the enclosure is opened. The system's cooling 
      fans are speed controlled. When the machine has more than 2 
      CPUs and more than 1 memory board dual power supplies 
      are mandatory.</para>

     <para>Rawhide uses a maximum of 8 RAM modules. These modules are used 
     in pairs and supply 72 bits to the bus (this includes ECC bits). 
     Memory can be EDO RAM or synchronous DRAM. A fully populated Rawhide 
     has 4 pairs of memory modules. Given the choice use SDRAM for 
     best performance. The highest capacity memory board must be in 
     memory slot 0. A mix of memory board sizes is allowed. A mix 
     of EDO and SDRAM is also reported as working (assuming you don't 
     try to mix EDO and SDRAM in one module pair). A mix of EDO and SDRAM
     results in the <emphasis>entire</emphasis> memory subsystem running at
     the slower EDO timing</para>

     <para>Rawhide has an embedded Symbios 810 chip that gives you a
     narrow fast-SCSI bus. Generally only the SCSI CDROM is driven by
     this interface.</para>

     <para>Rawhides are available with a 8 64-bit PCI / 3 EISA 
     slot expansion backplanes (called <quote>Saddle</quote> modules). There 
     are 2 separate PCI buses, PCI0 and PCI1. PCI0 has 1 dedicated 
     PCI slot and (shared) 3 PCI/EISA slots. PCI0 also has a
     PCI/EISA bridge that drives things like the serial and 
     parallel ports, keyboard/mouse etc. PCI1 has 4 PCI slots 
     and an Symbios 810 SCSI chip. VGA console cards must be installed 
     in a slot connected to PCI0.</para>

     <para>The current &os; implementation has problems in handling 
     PCI bridges. There is currently a limited fix in place which allows 
     for single level, single device PCI bridges. The fix allows the use of
     the Digital supplied Qlogic SCSI card which sits behind 
     a 21054 PCI bridge chip.<para>

     <note><para>EISA slots are currently unsupported, but the Compaq Qvision
     EISA VGA adapter is treated as an ISA device. It therefore works 
     OK as a console.<para></note>

     <para>Rawhide employs an I2C based power controller system. If 
     you want to be sure all power is removed from the system remove the 
     mains cables from the system.</para>

      <para>The AlphaServer 1200 machine is the successor to the 
      AlphaServer 1000A. It uses the same enclosure the 1000A uses, 
      but the logic is based on the AlphaServer 4000 design. These 
      are multi-CPU machines, up to 2 CPUs can be in a single machine.  
      Basic disk storage is housed in a StorageWorks shelves
      The AS1200 intended for the NT market were designated DIGITAL

      <para>AS1200 uses 2 memory daughter cards. On each of these cards 
      are 8 DIMM slots. DIMMs must be installed in pairs. The maximum 
      memory size is 4 GBytes. Slots must be filled in order and slot 
      0 must contain the largest size DIMM if different sized DIMMs are 
      used. AS1200 employs fixed starting addresses for DIMMs, each 
      DIMM pair starts at a 512 Mbyte boundary. This means that if 
      DIMMs smaller than 256 Mbyte are used the system's physical memory 
      map will contain <quote>holes</quote>. Supported DIMM sizes are 64 Mbytes 
      and 256 Mbytes. The DIMMs are 72 bit SDRAM based, as the 
      system employs ECC.</para>

      <note><para>&os; currently supports up to 2GBytes</para></note>

      <para>AS1200 has an embedded Symbios 810 drive Fast SCSI bus.</para>

      <para>Tincup has 5 64-bit PCI slots, one 1 32-bit PCI slot and one 
      EISA slot (which is physically shared with one of the 64-bit PCI slots).
      There are 2 separate PCI buses, PCI0 and PCI1. PCI0 has the 32-bit PCI 
      slot and the 2 top-most 64-bit PCI slots. PCI0 also has an Intel 82375EB
      PCI/EISA bridge that drives things like the serial and parallel ports, 
      keyboard/mouse etc. PCI1 has 4 64-bit PCI slots and an Symbios 810 
      SCSI chip. VGA console cards must be installed in a slot 
      connected to PCI0.</para>

      <para>The system employs an I2C based power controller system. 
      If you want to be sure all power is removed from the system remove
      the mains cables from the system. Tincup uses dual power supplies 
      in load-sharing mode and not as a redundancy pair.</para>

      <para>The AlphaServer 8200 and 8400 machines are enterprise servers.
      Expect a tall 19&quot; cabinet (8200) or fat (8400) 19&quot; rack. 
      This is big iron, not a hobbyist system. TurboLasers are multi-CPU 
      machines, up to 12 CPUs can be in a single machine. The TurboLaser 
      System Bus (TLSB) allows 9 nodes on the AS8400 and 5 nodes on 
      the AS8200. TLSB is 256 bit data, 40 bit address allowing 2.1 
      GBytes/sec. Nodes on the TLSB can be CPUs, memory or I/O. A 
      maximum of 3 I/O ports are supported on a TLSB.</para>

      <para>Basic disk storage is housed in a StorageWorks shelf. 
      AS8400 uses 3 phase power, AS8200 uses single phase power.</para>

      </para>
       
      <para>&os; supports (and has been tested with) up to 2 GBytes 
      of memory on TurboLaser. There is a trade-off to be made between
      TLSB slots occupied by memory modules and TLSB slots occupied by
      CPU modules. For example you can have 28GBytes of memory but only
      2 CPUs (1 module) at the same time.</para>

      <para>Only PCI expansion is supported on &os;. XMI or 
      Futurebus+ (which are AS8400 only) are both unsupported.</para>

      <para>The I/O port modules are designated KFTIA or KFTHA. The 
      I/O port modules supply so called <quote>hoses</quote> that connect to 
      up to 4 (KFTHA) PCI buses or 1 PCI bus (KFTIA). KFTIA has 
      embedded dual 10baseT Ethernet, single FDDI, 3 SCSI Fast 
      Wide Differential SCSI buses and a single Fast Wide Single Ended
      SCSI bus. The FWSE SCSI is intended for the CDROM.</para>

      <para>KFTHA can drive via each of its 4 hoses a DWLPA or DWLPB 
      box. The DWLPx house a 12 slots 32 bit PCI backplane. Physically 
      the 12 slots are 3 4-slot buses but to the software it appears 
      as a single 12 slots PCI bus. A fully expanded AS8x00 can have 
      3 (I/O ports) times 4 (hoses) times 12 (PCI slots/DWLPx) = 
      144 PCI slots. The maximum bandwidth per KFTHA is 500
      Mbytes/second. DWLPA can also house 8 EISA cards, 2 slots 
      are PCI-only, 2 slots are EISA only. Of the 12 slots 2 
      are always occupied by an I/O and connector module. DWLPB are the
      prefered I/O boxes.</para>

      <para>For best performance distribute high bandwidth 
      (FibreChannel, Gigabit Ethernet) over multiple hoses and/or 
      multiple KFTHA/KFTIA.</para>

      <para>Currently PCI expansion cards containing PCI bridges are 
      not usable with &os;. Don't use them at this time.</para>

      <para>The single ended narrow SCSI bus on the KFTIA will turn up as 
      the <emphasis>fourth</emphasis> SCSI bus. The 3 fast-wide
      differential SCSI buses of the KFTIA precede it. </para>

      <para>AS8x00 are generally run with serial consoles. Some

    <title>Supported Hardware Overview</title>

    <para>A word of caution: the installed base for &os; is not
    nearly as large as for &os;/Intel. This means that the enormous
    variation of PCI/ISA expansion cards out there has much less
    chance of having been tested on alpha than on Intel. This is not
    to imply they are doomed to fail, just that the chance of running
    into something never tested before is much higher.
    <filename>GENERIC</filename>
    contains things that are known to work on Alpha only.</para>

    <para>The PCI and ISA expansion busses are fully supported. Turbo
    Channel is not in <filename>GENERIC</filename> and has limited
    support (see the relevant machine model info).  The MCA bus is not
    supported. The EISA bus is not supported for use with EISA
    expansion cards as the EISA support code is lacking. ISA cards in
    EISA slots are reported to work. The Compaq Qvision EISA VGA card
    is driven in ISA mode and works OK as a console.</para>

    <para>1.44 Mbyte and 1.2 Mbyte floppy drives are supported.
    2.88 Mbyte drives sometimes found in Alpha machines are supported up to
    1.44Mbyte.</para>

    <para>ATA and ATAPI (IDE) devices are supported via the &man.ata.4;
    driver framework. As most people run their Alphas with SCSI disks
    it is not as well tested as SCSI. Be aware of boot-ability
    restrictions for IDE disks. See the machine specific information.</para>

    <para>There is full SCSI support via the CAM layer for Adaptec
    2940x (AIC7xxx chip-based), Qlogic family and Symbios. Be aware of
    the machine-specific boot-ability issues for the various adapter
    types.</para>

    <para>The Qlogic QL2x00 FibreChannel host adapters are fully
    supported.</para>

    <para>If you want to boot your Alpha over the Ethernet you will
    obviously need an Ethernet card that the SRM console
    recognizes. This generally means you need a board with an 21x4x
    Ethernet chip as that is what Digital used. These chips are driven
    by the &os; &man.de.4; (older driver) or &man.dc.4; (newer
    driver). Some new SRM versions are known to recognize the Intel
    8255x Ethernet chips as driven by the &os; &man.fxp.4; driver. But
    beware: the &man.fxp.4; driver is reported not to work correctly
    with &os; (although it works excellently on &os;/x86).</para>

    <para>DEC DEFPA PCI FDDI network adapters are supported on alpha.</para>

    <para>In general the SRM console emulates a VGA-compatibility mode
    on PCI VGA cards. This is, however, not guaranteed to work by
    Compaq/DEC for each and every card type out there. When the SRM
    thinks the VGA is acceptable &os; will be able to use it. The
    console driver works just like on a &os;/intel machine. The TGA
    video graphics which is embedded on for example Multia does
    <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    work with &os;. TGA based PCI cards are also <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    supported. Please note that VESA modes are not supported on Alpha,
    so that leaves you with 80x25 consoles.</para>

    <para>The <quote>PC standard</quote> serial ports found on most
    Alphas are supported. For TurboChannel machines the serial ports
    are also supported.</para>

    <para>ISDN (i4b) is not supported on &os;/alpha.</para>

    <para>In compiling this file I used multiple information sources,
    but <ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/">the NetBSD Web
    site</ulink> proved to be an invaluable source of information.  If
    it wasn't for NetBSD/alpha there probably would not be a
    &os;/alpha in the first place.</para>
