  <title>Supported Processors and Motherboards</title>

  <para>&os;/&arch; has supported the &arch.print;
    (<quote>Hammer</quote>) architecture since mid-2003.  It made its
    first debut as an experimental release based on &os;
    5.1-RELEASE.</para>

  <para>As of this writing, this port supports the Athlon64
    (<quote>Clawhammer</quote>) and Opteron
    (<quote>Sledgehammer</quote>) machines.  The largest tested
    memory configuration to date is 8GB.  SMP support has been
    recently completed and is reasonably robust.</para>

  <para>In many respects, &os;/&arch; is similar to &os;/i386, in
    terms of drivers supported.  There may be some issues with 64-bit
    cleanliness in some (particularly older) drivers.  Generally,
    drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit platforms
    should work.</para>

  <para>&os;/&arch; is a very young platform on FreeBSD.  While the
    core FreeBSD kernel and base system components are generally
    fairly robust, there are likely to still be rough edges,
    particularly with third party packages.</para>
