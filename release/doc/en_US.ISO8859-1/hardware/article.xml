    <para>This document contains the hardware compatibility notes for
      &os; &release.current;.  It lists the hardware platforms
      supported by &os;, as well as the various types of hardware
      devices (storage controllers, network interfaces, and so on),
      along with known working instances of these devices.</para>

    <title>Supported Processors and System Boards</title>

    <para>This section provides some architecture-specific information
      about the specific processors and systems that are supported by
      each architecture.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="proc-amd64">
      <title>amd64</title>

      <para>Since mid-2003 &os;/&arch.amd64; has supported the AMD64
	(<quote>Hammer</quote>) and &intel; EM64T architecture, and is
	now one of the Tier-1 platforms (fully supported
	architecture), which are expected to be Production Quality
	with respects to all aspects of the &os; operating system,
	including installation and development environments.</para>

      <para>Note that there are two names for this architecture, AMD64
	(AMD) and Intel EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology).
	64-bit mode of the two architectures are almost compatible
	with each other, and &os;/&arch.amd64; supports them
	both.</para>

      <para>As of this writing, the following processors are
	supported:</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Some &intel; &pentium; 4s and &celeron; Ds using

	    the <link xlink:href="http://processorfinder.intel.com">Intel
	    Processor Spec Finder</link> for the definitive answer about
	    EM64T support in Intel processors.</para>
	</listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>&intel; EM64T is an extended version of IA-32 (x86) and
	different from &intel; IA-64 (Itanium) architecture.  Some
	&intel;'s old documentation refers to &intel; EM64T as
	<quote>64-bit extension technology</quote> or
	<quote>IA-32e</quote>.</para>

      <para>Both Uniprocessor (UP) and Symmetric Multi-processor (SMP)
	configurations are supported.</para>

      <para>In many respects, &os;/&arch.amd64; is similar to
	&os;/&arch.i386;, in terms of drivers supported.  Generally,
	drivers that already function correctly on other 64-bit
	platforms should work.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proc-i386">
      <title>i386</title>

      <para>&os;/&arch.i386; runs on a wide variety of <quote>IBM PC
	  compatible</quote> machines. Due to the wide range of
	hardware available for this architecture, it is impossible
	to exhaustively list all combinations of equipment supported
	by &os;.  Nevertheless, some general guidelines are
	presented here.</para>

      <para>Almost all &i386;-compatible processors with a floating
	point unit are supported. All &intel; processors beginning
	with the 80486 are supported, including the 80486, &pentium;,
	&pentium; Pro, &pentium; II, &pentium; III, &pentium; 4, and
	variants thereof, such as the &xeon; and &celeron; processors.
	All &i386;-compatible AMD processors are also supported,
	including the &am486;, &am5x86;, K5, &amd.k6; (and variants),
	&amd.athlon; (including Athlon-MP, Athlon-XP, Athlon-4, and
	Athlon Thunderbird), and &amd.duron; processors.  The AMD
	&Eacute;lan SC520 embedded processor is supported.  The
	Transmeta Crusoe is recognized and supported, as are
	&i386;-compatible processors from Cyrix and NexGen.</para>

      <para>There is a wide variety of motherboards available for this
	architecture.  Motherboards using the ISA, VLB, EISA, AGP, and
	PCI expansion buses are well-supported.  There is some
	limited support for the MCA (<quote>MicroChannel</quote>)
	expansion bus used in the IBM PS/2 line of PCs.</para>

      <para>Symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems are generally
	supported by &os;, although in some cases, BIOS or motherboard
	bugs may generate some problems.  Perusal of the archives of
	the &a.smp; may yield some clues.</para>

      <para>&os; will take advantage of SMT (Symmetric MultiThreading,
	also known as HyperThreading on &intel; CPUs) on the supported
	CPUs.  The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel which is
	installed by default will automatically detect the additional
	logical processors.  The default &os; scheduler recognizes
	processor topology on the system and selects logical and
	physical processors to obtain optimal performance.
	The &man.smp.4; manual page has more details.</para>

      <para>&os; will take advantage of Physical Address Extensions
	(PAE) support on CPUs that support this feature.  A kernel
	with the <literal>PAE</literal> feature enabled will detect
	memory above 4 gigabytes and allow it to be used by the
	system.  This feature places constraints on the device drivers
	and other features of &os; which may be used; consult the
	&man.pae.4; manual page for more details.</para>

      <para>&os; will generally run on i386-based laptops, albeit with
	varying levels of support for certain hardware features such
	as sound, graphics, power management, and PCCARD expansion
	slots.  These features tend to vary in idiosyncratic ways
	between machines, and frequently require special-case support
	in &os; to work around hardware bugs or other oddities.  When
	in doubt, a search of the archives of the &a.mobile; may be
	useful.</para>

      <para>Most modern laptops (as well as many desktops) use the
	Advanced Configuration and Power Management (ACPI) standard.
	&os; supports ACPI via the ACPI Component Architecture
	reference implementation from &intel;, as described in the
	&man.acpi.4; manual page.  The use of ACPI causes
	instabilities on some machines and it may be necessary to
	disable the ACPI driver, which is normally loaded via a kernel
	module.  This may be accomplished by adding the following line
	to <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</programlisting>

      <para>Users debugging ACPI-related problems may find it useful
	to disable portions of the ACPI functionality.  The
	&man.acpi.4; manual page has more information on how to do
	this via loader tunables.</para>

      <para>ACPI depends on a Differentiated System Descriptor Table
	(DSDT) provided by each machine's BIOS.  Some machines have
	bad or incomplete DSDTs, which prevents ACPI from functioning
	correctly.  Replacement DSDTs for some machines can be found
	at the <link xlink:href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php">DSDT</link>
	section of the <link xlink:href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/">ACPI4Linux</link> project
	Web site.  &os; can use these DSDTs to override the DSDT
	provided by the BIOS; see the &man.acpi.4; manual page for
	more information.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proc-pc98">
      <title>pc98</title>

      <para>NEC PC-9801/9821 series with almost all &i386;-compatible
	processors, including 80486, &pentium;, &pentium; Pro,
	&pentium; II, and variants.  All &i386;-compatible processors
	by AMD, Cyrix, IBM, and IDT are also supported.</para>

      <para>NEC FC-9801/9821 series, and NEC SV-98 series (both of
	them are compatible with PC-9801/9821 series) should be
	supported.</para>

      <para>EPSON PC-386/486/586 series, which are compatible with NEC
	PC-9801 series are supported.</para>

      <para>High-resolution mode is not supported.  NEC
	PC-98XA/XL/RL/XL^2, and NEC PC-H98 series are supported in
	normal (PC-9801 compatible) mode only.</para>

      <para>Although there are some multi-processor systems (such as
	Rs20/B20), SMP-related features of &os; are not supported
	yet.</para>

      <para>PC-9801/9821 standard bus (called C-Bus), PC-9801NOTE
	expansion bus (110pin), and PCI bus are supported.  New Extend
	Standard Architecture (NESA) bus (used in PC-H98, SV-H98, and
	FC-H98 series) is not supported.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proc-powerpc">
      <title>powerpc</title>

      <para>All Apple PowerPC machines with built-in USB are supported,
	as well a limited selection of non-Apple machines,
	including KVM on POWER7</para>

      <para>SMP is supported on all systems with more than
	1 processor.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="proc-sparc64">
      <title>sparc64</title>

      <para>This section describes the systems currently known to be
	supported by &os; on the Fujitsu &sparc64; and Sun &ultrasparc;
	platforms.</para>

      <para>SMP is supported on all systems with more than 1
	processor.</para>

      <para>When using the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel,
	&os;/&arch.sparc64; systems not equipped with a framebuffer
	supported by the &man.creator.4; (Sun Creator, Sun Creator3D
	and Sun Elite3D) or &man.machfb.4; (Sun PGX and Sun PGX64
	as well as the ATI Mach64 chips found onboard in for example
	&sun.blade; 100, &sun.blade; 150, &sun.ultra; 5	and &sun.ultra; 10)
	driver must use the serial console.</para>

      <para>If you have a system that is not listed here, it may not
	have been tested with &os; &release.current;.  We encourage
	you to try it and send a note to the &a.sparc; with your

  <!--

  The "Supported Devices" section of the release notes.
  Generally processor-independent, with conditional text
  inclusion handling any architecture-dependent text.

  Within each subsection describing a class of hardware
  (i.e. Ethernet interfaces), list broad groups of devices
  alphabetically as paragraphs sorted alphabetically (frequently
  these groups will be arranged by manufacturer, i.e. 3Com
  Ethernet interfaces).

  Where applicable, a "Miscellaneous" section may follow all
  other named sections.

  These guidelines are not hard-and-fast rules, and exceptions
  will occur.  Following these guidelines (vague as they may be)
  is highly recommended to try to keep the formatting of
  this section consistent.

  We give manpage references using the &man entities where
  possible.  If a driver has no manpage (and consequently no
  &man entity, we simply give the name of the driver).
  Please avoid doing &man entity conversions unless you
  know for sure that an entity and manpage exist; sweeps through
  this file to fix "missed" conversions are likely to break the
  build.
