        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN12">1 Introduction</a></h1>

        <p>This distribution is a release of FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE,
        the latest point along the 4-STABLE branch.</p>

        <div class="SECT2">

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN15">1.1 About
          FreeBSD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD Lite
          for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen ``x86'' based PC hardware
          and Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers. Versions for
          the IA64, PowerPC, and Sparc64 architectures are
          currently under development as well. FreeBSD works with a
          wide variety of peripherals and configurations and can be
          used for everything from software development to games to
          Internet Service Provision.</p>

          <p>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need
          to run such a system, including full source code for the
          kernel and all utilities in the base distribution. With
          the source distribution installed, you can literally
          recompile the entire system from scratch with one
          command, making it ideal for students, researchers, or
          users who simply want to see how it all works.</p>

          <p>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
          ``Ports Collection'') is also provided to make it easy to
          obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
          utilities for FreeBSD. Each ``port'' consists of a set of
          scripts to retrieve, configure, build, and install a
          piece of software, with a single command. Over 5,400
          ports, from editors to programming languages to graphical
          applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and comprehensive
          operating environment that extends far beyond what's
          provided by many commercial versions of UNIX. Most ports
          are also available as pre-compiled ``packages'', which
          can be quickly installed from the installation
          program.</p>

          Audience</a></h2>

          <p>This release of FreeBSD is suitable for all users. It
          has undergone a period of testing and quality assurance
          checking to ensure the highest reliability and
          dependability.</p>

        FreeBSD</a></h1>

        <p>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways. This
        section focuses on those ways that are primarily of use for
        obtaining a complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than
        updating an existing installation.</p>

        <div class="SECT2">
          <hr>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN30">2.1 CDROM and
          DVD</a></h2>

          <p>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may be ordered on CDROM
          or DVD from several publishers. This is frequently the
          most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new
          installations, as it provides a convenient way to quickly
          reinstall the system if necessary. Some distributions
          include some of the optional, precompiled ``packages''
          from the FreeBSD Ports Collection.</p>

          <p>A list of the CDROM and DVD publishers known to the
          project are listed in the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN37">2.2 FTP</a></h2>

          <p>You can use FTP to retrieve FreeBSD and any or all of
          its optional packages from <a href=
          "ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/" target=
          "_top">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/</a>, which is the official
          FreeBSD release site, or any of its ``mirrors''.</p>

          <p>Lists of locations that mirror FreeBSD can be found in
          the <a href=
          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html"
           target="_top">FTP Sites</a> section of the Handbook, or
          on the <a href="http://www.freebsdmirrors.org/" target=
          "_top">http://www.freebsdmirrors.org/</a> Web pages.
          Finding a close (in networking terms) mirror from which
          to download the distribution is highly recommended.</p>

          <p>Additional mirror sites are always welcome. Contact
          <tt class="EMAIL">&lt;<a href=
          "mailto:freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org">freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org</a>&gt;</tt>
          for more details on becoming an official mirror site.</p>

          <p>Mirrors generally contain the floppy disk images
          necessary to begin an installation, as well as the
          distribution files needed for the install process itself.
          Some mirrors also contain some of the ISO images
          necessary to create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.</p>

          changes that may affect the way you use and maintain the
          system.</p>

          <p>Additionally, being a largely-volunteer effort, the
          FreeBSD Project is always happy to have extra hands
          willing to help -- there are already far more desired
          enhancements than there is time to implement them. To
          contact the developers on technical matters, or with
          offers of help, please send mail to the FreeBSD technical

          if you have slow or expensive mail access and are only
          interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events,

          <p>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are
          always valued -- please do not hesitate to report any
          problems you may find. Bug reports with attached fixes
          are of course even more welcome.</p>

          <p>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a

          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=

          "http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html" target=
          "_top">http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html</a>. ``Problem
          Reports'' (PRs) submitted in this way will be filed and
          their progress tracked; the FreeBSD developers will do
          their best to respond to all reported bugs as soon as
          possible. <a href=

          shell script that should be easy to move even onto a
          non-FreeBSD system. Using this interface is highly
          preferred. If, for some reason, you are unable to use <a
          href=

          <span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class=
