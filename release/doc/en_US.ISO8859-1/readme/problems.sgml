  <title>Contacting the &os; Project</title>

  <para>Suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are
  always valued &mdash; please do not hesitate to report any problems you
  may find.  Bug reports with attached fixes are of course even more
  welcome.</para>

  <para>The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
  Internet mail connectivity is to use the &man.send-pr.1; command or
  use the Web form at <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html">http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html</ulink>.
  <quote>Problem Reports</quote> (PRs) submitted in this way will be filed and
  their progress tracked; the &os; developers will do their best to respond to all
  reported bugs as soon as possible.  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi">A list of all active PRs</ulink> is
  available on the &os; Web site; this list is useful to see what
  potential problems other users have encountered.</para>

  <para>Note that &man.send-pr.1; itself is a shell script that should
  be easy to move even onto a non-&os; system.  Using this interface
  is highly preferred.
  If, for some reason, you are unable to use &man.send-pr.1; to
  submit a bug report, you can try to send it to the &a.bugs;.</para>

  <para>In any case, before submitting a PR,
  please try to determine whether the problem might have already been
  fixed since.</para>

  <para>For any questions or general technical support issues, please send
  mail to the &a.questions;.</para>

  <para>If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you
  <emphasis>must</emphasis> join the &a.current;, in order to keep
  abreast of recent developments and changes that may affect the way
  you use and maintain the system.

  <para>Additionally, being a largely-volunteer effort, the &os;
  Project is always happy to
  have extra hands willing to help &mdash; there are already far more
  desired enhancements than there is time to implement them.
  To contact the developers on technical matters, or with offers of help, please
  send mail to the &a.hackers;.</para>

  <para>Please note that these mailing lists can experience
  <emphasis>significant</emphasis> amounts of traffic and if you have
  slow or expensive mail access and are only interested in keeping up
  with significant &os; events, you may find it preferable to
  subscribe instead to the &a.announce;.</para>

  <para>All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone
  wishing to do so.  Send mail to &a.majordomo;
  and include the keyword <literal>help</literal> on a line by itself
  somewhere in the body of the message.  This will give you more
  information on joining the various lists, accessing archives, etc.
  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at special interest
  groups not mentioned here; more information can be obtained either
  through majordomo or the <ulink
  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/support.html#mailing-list">mailing lists
  section</ulink> of the &os; Web site.</para>

  <important>
  <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> send email to the lists asking to
  be subscribed.  Use the &a.majordomo; address
  instead.</para>
  </important>
