  <title>Installing &os;</title>

  <para>This section documents the process of installing a new
  distribution of &os;.  These instructions pay particular emphasis to
  the process of obtaining the &os; &release.current; distribution and
  to beginning the installation procedure.  The <ulink
  url="&url.books.handbook;/install.html"><quote>Installing
  &os;</quote></ulink>
  chapter of the <ulink
  url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
  Handbook</ulink> provides more in-depth information about the
  installation program itself, including a guided walkthrough with
  screenshots.</para>

  <para>If you are upgrading from a previous release
  of &os;, please see <xref linkend="upgrading"> for instructions on
  upgrading.</para>

  <sect2 id="getting-started">
    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>Probably the most important pre-installation step that can
    be taken is that of reading the various instruction documents
    provided with &os;.  A roadmap of documents pertaining to this
    release of &os; can be found in <filename>README.TXT</filename>,
    which can usually be found in the same location as this file; most
    of these documents, such as the release notes and the hardware
    compatibility list, are also accessible in the Documentation menu
    of the installer.</para>

    <para>Note that on-line versions of the &os; <ulink
    url="&url.books.faq;/">FAQ</ulink> and <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">Handbook</ulink> are also
    available from the <ulink url="&url.base;/">&os;
    Project Web site</ulink>, if you have an Internet
    connection.</para>

    <para>This collection of documents may seem daunting, but the time
    spent reading them will likely be saved many times over.  Being
    familiar with what resources are available can also be helpful in
    the event of problems during installation.</para>

    <para>The best laid plans sometimes go awry, so if you run into
    trouble take a look at <xref linkend="trouble">, which contains
    valuable troubleshooting information.  You should also read
    an updated copy of
    <filename>ERRATA.TXT</filename> before installing,
    since this will alert you to
    any problems which have reported in the interim for your
    particular release.</para>

    <important>
      <para>While &os; does its best to safeguard against
      accidental loss of data, it's still more than possible to
      <emphasis>wipe out your entire disk</emphasis>
      with this installation if you make a
      mistake.  Please do not proceed to the final &os;
      installation menu unless you've adequately backed up any
      important data first.</para>

  <title>Floppy Disk Image Instructions</title>

  <para arch="i386,alpha,pc98">Depending on how you choose to install &os;, you may need to
  create a set of floppy disks (usually three) to begin the installation
  process.  This section briefly describes how to create these disks,
  either from a CDROM installation or from the Internet.  Note that in
  the common case of installing &os; from CDROM, on a machine that
  supports bootable CDROMs, the steps outlined in this section will
  not be needed and can be skipped.</para>

    <para>If you've never installed &os; before, or even if you

      <title>Installing from a Network CDROM</title>

      <para>If you simply wish to install from a local CDROM drive
      then see <xref linkend="start-installation">.  If you don't have a CDROM
      drive on your system and wish to use a &os; distribution CD
      in the CDROM drive of another system to which you have network
      connectivity, there are also several ways of going about it:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you would be able to FTP install &os; directly
          from the CDROM drive in some &os; machine, it's quite
          easy: You ensure an FTP server is running and then
          simply add the following line to the password file
          (using the &man.vipw.8; command):</para>

          <screen>ftp:*:99:99::0:0:FTP:/cdrom:/sbin/nologin</screen>

          <para>On the machine on which you are running the install,
          go to the Options menu and set Release Name to
          <literal>any</literal>.  You may then choose a Media type of
          <literal>FTP</literal> and type in
          <filename>ftp://<replaceable>machine</replaceable></filename>
          after picking <quote>URL</quote> in the ftp sites
          menu.</para>

          <warning>
	    <para>This may allow anyone on the local network (or Internet) to
            make <quote>anonymous FTP</quote> connections to this
            machine, which may not be desirable.</para>
	  </warning>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you would rather use NFS to export the CDROM
          directly to the machine(s) you'll be installing from, you
          need to first add an entry to the
          <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file (on the machine with
          the CDROM drive).  The example below allows the machine
          <hostid role="hostname">ziggy.foo.com</hostid> to mount the
          CDROM directly via NFS during installation:</para>

	  <screen>/cdrom          -ro             ziggy.foo.com</screen>

	  <para>The machine
          with the CDROM must also be configured as an NFS server, of
          course, and if you're not sure how to do that then an NFS
          installation is probably not the best choice for you unless
          you're willing to read up on &man.rc.conf.5; and configure things
          appropriately.  Assuming that this part goes smoothly, you
          should be able to enter: <filename><replaceable>cdrom-host</replaceable>:/cdrom</filename> as the path for
          an NFS installation when the target machine is installed,
          e.g. <filename>wiggy:/cdrom</filename>.</para>

      <title>Installing from Floppies</title>

      <para>If you must install from floppy disks, either due to
      unsupported hardware or just because you enjoy doing things the
      hard way, you must first prepare some floppies for the
      install.</para>

      <para>First, make your boot floppies as described in
      <xref linkend="floppies">.</para>

      <para>Second, peruse <xref linkend="layout"> and pay special attention
      to the <quote>Distribution Format</quote> section since it describes which
      files you're going to need to put onto floppy and which you can
      safely skip.</para>

      <para>Next you will need, at minimum, as many 1.44MB floppies as
      it takes to hold all files in the <filename>bin</filename>
      (binary distribution) directory.  If you're preparing these
      floppies under DOS, then these floppies
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be formatted using the MS-DOS
      <filename>FORMAT</filename> command.  If you're using Windows,
      use the Windows File Manager format command.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Frequently, floppy disks come <quote>factory
        preformatted</quote>.  While convenient,
        many problems reported by users in the past have resulted
        from the use of improperly formatted media.
        Re-format them yourself, just to make sure.</para>
      </important>

      <para>If you're creating the floppies from another &os;
      machine, a format is still not a bad idea though you don't need
      to put a DOS filesystem on each floppy.  You can use the
      &man.disklabel.8; and &man.newfs.8; commands to put a UFS filesystem on a
      floppy, as the following sequence of commands
      illustrates:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdformat -f 1440 fd0</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -w fd0 floppy3</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -i 65536 /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

      <para>After you've formatted the floppies for DOS or UFS, you'll
      need to copy the files onto them.
      The distribution files are sized so that a floppy disk will hold
      a single file.
      Each distribution should go into its own subdirectory on the floppy,
      e.g.: <filename>a:\bin\bin.inf</filename>, <filename>a:\bin\bin.aa</filename>, <filename>a:\bin\bin.ab</filename>, ...</para>

      <important>
        <para>The <filename>bin.inf</filename> file also needs to go on the first floppy of
        the <filename>bin</filename> set since it is read by the installation program in
        order to figure out how many additional pieces to look for
        when fetching and concatenating the distribution.  When
        putting distributions onto floppies, the
        <filename>distname.inf</filename> file <emphasis>must</emphasis> occupy the first
        floppy of each distribution set.</para>
      </important>

      <para>Once you come to the Media screen of the install, select
      <quote>Floppy</quote> and you'll be prompted for the rest.</para>

      <title>Installing from QIC/SCSI Tape</title>

      <para>When installing from tape, the installation program
      expects the files to be simply tar'ed onto it, so after fetching
      all of the files for the distributions you're interested in,
      simply use &man.tar.1; to get them onto the tape with a command something like
      this:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd <replaceable>/where/you/have/your/dists</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar cvf /dev/sa0 <replaceable>dist1</replaceable> .. <replaceable>dist2</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>When you go to do the installation, you should also make
      sure that you leave enough room in some temporary directory
      (which you'll be allowed to choose) to accommodate the <emphasis>full</emphasis>
      contents of the tape you've created.  Due to the non-random
      access nature of tapes, this method of installation requires
      quite a bit of temporary storage.  You should expect to require
      as much temporary storage as you have stuff written on tape.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When going to do the installation, the tape must be in

      <title>Installing over a Network using FTP or NFS</title>

      <para>After making the boot floppies as described in the first
      section, you can load the rest of the installation over a
      network using one of 3 types of connections:  serial port,
      parallel port, or Ethernet.</para>

      <sect4>
        <title>Serial Port</title>

	<para>SLIP support is rather primitive, and is limited
        primarily to hard-wired links, such as a serial cable running
        between two computers.  The link must be hard-wired because
        the SLIP installation doesn't currently offer a dialing
        capability.  If you need to dial out with a modem or otherwise
        dialog with the link before connecting to it, then the PPP
        utility should be used instead.</para>

        <para>If you're using PPP, make sure that you have your
        Internet Service Provider's IP address and DNS information
        handy as you'll need to know it fairly early in the
        installation process.  You may also need to know your own IP
        address, though PPP supports dynamic address negotiation and
        may be able to pick up this information directly from your ISP
        if they support it.</para>

        <para>You will also need to know how to use the various <quote>AT
        commands</quote> for dialing out with your particular brand of modem
        as the PPP dialer provides only a very simple terminal
        emulator.</para>
      </sect4>

      <sect4>
        <title>Parallel Port</title>

	<para>If a hard-wired connection to another &os; or Linux
        machine is available, you might also consider installing over
        a <quote>laplink</quote> style parallel port cable.  The data rate over the
        parallel port is much higher than what is typically possible
        over a serial line (up to 50k/sec), thus resulting in a
        quicker installation.  It's not typically necessary to use
        <quote>real</quote> IP addresses when using a point-to-point parallel cable
        in this way and you can generally just use RFC 1918 style
        addresses for the ends of the link (e.g. <hostid
        role="ipaddr">10.0.0.1</hostid>, <hostid role="ipaddr">10.0.0.2</hostid>,
        etc).</para>

        <important>
	  <para>If you use a Linux machine rather than a &os;
          machine as your PLIP peer, you will also have to specify
          <option>link0</option> in the TCP/IP setup screen's <quote>extra options for
          ifconfig</quote> field in order to be compatible with Linux's
          slightly different PLIP protocol.</para>
	</important>

      </sect4>

      <sect4>
        <title>Ethernet</title>

	<para>&os; supports most common Ethernet cards; a table
        of supported cards is
        provided as part of the &os; Hardware Notes (see
        <filename>HARDWARE.TXT</filename> in
	the Documentation menu on the boot floppy or the top level
        directory of the CDROM).  If you are using one of the
        supported PCMCIA Ethernet cards, also be sure that it's
        plugged in <emphasis>before</emphasis> the laptop is powered on.  &os; does
        not, unfortunately, currently support <quote>hot insertion</quote> of
        PCMCIA cards during installation.</para>

        <para>You will also need to know your IP address on the
        network, the <option>netmask</option> value for your subnet and the
        name of your machine.  Your system administrator can tell you
        which values are appropriate to your particular network setup.
        If you will be referring to other hosts by name rather than IP
        address, you'll also need a name server and possibly the
        address of a gateway (if you're using PPP, it's your
        provider's IP address) to use in talking to it.  If you want
        to install by FTP via an HTTP proxy (see below), you will also
        need the proxy's address.</para>

        <para>If you do not know the answers to these questions then
        you should really probably talk to your system administrator
        <emphasis>first</emphasis> before trying this type of
        installation.  Using a randomly chosen IP address or netmask
        on a live network is almost guaranteed not to work, and will
        probably result in a lecture from said system administrator.</para>

	installation can continue over NFS or FTP.</para>

        <title>NFS installation tips</title>

        <para>NFS installation is fairly straight-forward: Simply copy
        the &os; distribution files you want onto a server
        somewhere and then point the NFS media selection at it.</para>

        <para>If this server supports only <quote>privileged port</quote> access (this is
        generally the default for Sun and Linux workstations), you
        may need to set this option in the Options menu before
        installation can proceed.</para>

        <para>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which suffers from very
        slow transfer rates, you may also wish to toggle the appropriate
        Options flag.</para>

        <para>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must
        also support <quote>subdir mounts</quote>, e.g. if your &os;
        distribution directory lives on
        <filename>wiggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, then
        <hostid role="hostname">wiggy</hostid> will have to allow
        the direct mounting of <filename>/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, not just
        <filename>/usr</filename> or <filename>/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>

        <para>In &os;'s <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file this is controlled by the
        <option>-alldirs</option> option.  Other NFS servers may have different
        conventions.  If you are getting <literal>Permission Denied</literal> messages
        from the server then it's likely that you don't have this
        properly enabled.</para>

        <title>FTP Installation tips</title>

        <para>FTP installation may be done from any mirror site containing a
        reasonably up-to-date version of &os;.  A full menu of
        reasonable choices for almost any location in the world is
        provided in the FTP site menu during installation.</para>

        <para>If you are installing from some other FTP site not listed in
        this menu, or you are having troubles getting your name server
        configured properly, you can also specify your own URL by
        selecting the <quote>URL</quote> choice in that menu.  A URL can
        contain a hostname or an IP address, so something like the following would
        work in the absence of a name server:</para>

        <screen>ftp://216.66.64.162/pub/FreeBSD/releases/&arch;/4.2-RELEASE</screen>

        <para>There are three FTP installation modes you can use:</para>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>FTP:  This method uses the standard
              <quote>Active</quote> mode for transfers, in which the
              server initiates a connection to the client.  This will
              not work through most firewalls but will often work best
              with older FTP servers that do not support passive mode.
              If your connection hangs with passive mode, try this
              one.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>FTP Passive:  This sets the FTP "Passive" mode
              which prevents the server from opening connections to
              the client.  This option is best for users to pass
              through firewalls that do not allow incoming connections
              on random port addresses.</para>
	    </listitem>
            <listitem>
	      <para>FTP via an HTTP proxy: This option instructs &os;
              to use HTTP to connect to a proxy for all FTP
              operations.  The proxy will translate the requests and
              send them to the FTP server.  This allows the user to
              pass through firewalls that do not allow FTP at all, but
              offer an HTTP proxy.  You must specify the hostname of
              the proxy in addition to the FTP server.</para>

	      <para>In the rare case that you have an FTP proxy that
              does not go through HTTP, you can specify the URL as
              something like:</para>

              <screen><userinput>ftp://foo.bar.com:<replaceable>port</replaceable>/pub/FreeBSD</userinput></screen>

              <para>In the URL above, <replaceable>port</replaceable>
              is the port number of the proxy FTP server.</para>

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>If your machine is already running DOS and has little
	  or no free space available for &os;'s installation, all is
	  not lost!  You may find the <application>FIPS</application>
	  utility, provided in the <filename>tools/</filename>
	  subdirectory on the &os; CDROM or on the various &os; ftp
	  sites, to be quite useful.</para>

	  <para><application>FIPS</application> allows you to split an
	  existing DOS partition into two pieces, preserving the
	  original partition and allowing you to install onto the
	  second free piece.  You first <quote>defrag</quote> your DOS
	  partition, using the DOS 6.xx <filename>DEFRAG</filename>
	  utility or the <application>Norton Disk Tools</application>,
	  then run FIPS.  It will
	  prompt you for the rest of the information it needs.
	  Afterwards, you can reboot and install &os; on the new
	  partition.  Also note that FIPS will create the second
	  partition as a <quote>clone</quote> of the first, so you'll
	  actually see that you now have two DOS Primary partitions
	  where you formerly had one.  Don't be alarmed!  You can
	  simply delete the extra DOS Primary partition (making sure
	  it's the right one by examining its size).</para>

	  <para><application>FIPS</application> does NOT currently
          work with NTFS style partitions.  To split up such a
          partition, you will need a commercial product such as
          <application>Partition Magic</application>.  Sorry, but this
          is just the breaks if you've got a Windows partition hogging
          your whole disk and you don't want to reinstall from

	<answer>
	  <para>No.  If you are using a utility such as
	  <application>Stacker</application>(tm) or
