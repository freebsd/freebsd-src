    <title>Repairing an Existing &os; Installation</title>

    <para>&os; features a <quote>fixit</quote> option in the top menu
      of the &man.sysinstall.8; installation program.  It provides a
      shell with common programs from the &os; base system; this
      environment is useful for repairing or troubleshooting an
      existing &os; installation.  To use fixit mode, you will also
      need either the <filename>fixit.flp</filename> floppy, generated
      in the same fashion as the boot floppies, or the <quote>live
      filesystem</quote> CDROM.  In multi-disk &os; distributions, the
      live filesystem image is typically located on the installation
      disk.  Note that some UNIX system administration experience is
      required to use the fixit option.</para>

    <para>Generally, there are two ways of invoking fixit mode.  Users
      who can boot from the &os; installation CDROM, should do so and
      then choose the <quote>fixit</quote> item from the main
      &man.sysinstall.8; menu.  Then select the
      <quote>CDROM/DVD</quote> option from the fixit menu.</para>

    <para>Users who cannot boot from CDROM, but can boot from floppy
      disk, require a few more steps.  In addition to the
      <filename>boot.flp</filename> and
      <filename>kern<replaceable>X</replaceable>.flp</filename> disks
      required for installation, create the
      <filename>fixit.flp</filename> floppy disk, in the same way as
      the other floppy disks.  Follow the instructions for booting the
      installation program from floppy disk until reaching the main
      &man.sysinstall.8; menu.  At that point, choose the
      <quote>fixit</quote> item from the main &man.sysinstall.8; menu.
      Then select the <quote>Floppy</quote> option from the fixit
      menu, and insert the <filename>fixit.flp</filename> floppy disk
      when prompted to do so.</para>

    <para>The CDROM and floppy fixit environments are similar, but not
      identical.  Both offer a shell with a variety of commands
      available for checking, repairing and examining filesystems and
      their contents.  The CDROM version of fixit provides all of the
      commands and programs available in the &os; base system, through
      the live filesystem.  By contrast, the floppy fixit environment
      can only offer a subset of commands due to space constraints.</para>

    <para>In the floppy version of fixit, some standalone utilities
      can be found in <filename>/stand</filename> or
      <filename>/mnt2/stand</filename>.  In the CDROM version of
      fixit, these same programs can be found in
      <filename>/stand</filename> or
      <filename>/mnt2/rescue</filename> (as well as the rest of
      the programs from the live filesystem, which can be found under
      <filename>/mnt</filename>).</para>

        <question>
          <para>My system hangs while probing hardware during boot, or it
            behaves strangely during install, or the floppy drive isn't
            probed.</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>&os; 5.0 and above makes extensive use of the system ACPI
            service on the i386 platform to aid in system configuration if it's
            detected during boot.  Unfortunately, some bugs still exist in both
            the ACPI driver and within system motherboards and BIOS.  The use
            of ACPI can be disabled by setting the
            <quote>hint.acpi.0.disabled</quote> hint in the third stage boot
            loader:</para>

          <screen>set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</screen>

          <para>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it is
            necessary to add <literal>hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</literal>
            to the file
            <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  More information about the
            boot loader can be found in the &os; Handbook.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>There are problems with the apic on this chipset and/or the

        <question>
          <para>My legacy ISA device used to be recognized in previous versions
            of &os;, but now it's not.  What happened?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Some device drivers, like matcd, were removed over time due to
            lack of maintainership or other reasons.  Others still exist but
            are disabled because of their intrusive hardware probe routines.
            The following ISA device drivers fall into this category and can
            re-enabled from the third stage boot loader: aha, ahv, aic, bt, ed,
            cs, sn, ie, fe, le, and lnc.  To do this, stop the loader during
            it's 10 second countdown and enter the following at the
            prompt:</para>

          <screen>unset hint.foo.0.disabled</screen>

          <para>where <replaceable>foo</replaceable> is the name of the driver
            to re-enable.  This can be set permanently by editing the file

        <question>
          <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time
          after installing &os;, the kernel loads and probes my
          hardware, but stops with messages like:</para>

          <screen>changing root device to ad1s1a panic: cannot mount root</screen>
          <para>What is wrong?  What can I do?</para>

          <para>What is this
          <literal>bios_drive:interface(unit,partition)kernel_name</literal>
          thing that is displayed with the boot help?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>There is a longstanding problem in the case where the
          boot disk is not the first disk in the system.  The BIOS
          uses a different numbering scheme to &os;, and working
          out which numbers correspond to which is difficult to get
          right.</para>

          <para>In the case where the boot disk is not the first disk
          in the system, &os; can need some help finding it.  There
          are two common situations here, and in both of these cases,
          you need to tell &os; where the root filesystem is.  You
          do this by specifying the BIOS disk number, the disk type
          and the &os; disk number for that type.</para>

          <para>The first situation is where you have two IDE disks,
          each configured as the master on their respective IDE
          busses, and wish to boot &os; from the second disk.  The
          BIOS sees these as disk 0 and disk 1, while &os; sees
          them as <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
          <devicename>ad2</devicename>.</para>

          <para>&os; is on BIOS disk 1, of type
          <literal>ad</literal> and the &os; disk number is 2, so
          you would say:</para>

          <screen><userinput>1:ad(2,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

          <para>Note that if you have a slave on the primary bus, the
          above is not necessary (and is effectively wrong).</para>

          <para>The second situation involves booting from a SCSI disk
          when you have one or more IDE disks in the system.  In this
          case, the &os; disk number is lower than the BIOS disk
          number.  If you have two IDE disks as well as the SCSI disk,
          the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2, type <literal>da</literal> and
          &os; disk number 0, so you would say:</para>

          <screen><userinput>2:da(0,a)kernel</userinput></screen>

          <para>To tell &os; that you want to boot from BIOS disk
          2, which is the first SCSI disk in the system.  If you only
          had one IDE disk, you would use '1:' instead.</para>

          <para>Once you have determined the correct values to use,
          you can put the command exactly as you would have typed it
          in the <filename>/boot.config</filename> file using a
          standard text editor.  Unless instructed otherwise, &os;
          will use the contents of this file as the default response
          to the <literal>boot:</literal> prompt.</para>

        <question>
	  <para>I go to boot from the hard disk for the first time
          after installing &os;, but the Boot Manager prompt just
          prints <literal>F?</literal> at the boot menu each time but
          the boot won't go any further.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
          <para>The hard disk geometry was set incorrectly in the
          Partition editor when you installed &os;.  Go back into
          the partition editor and specify the actual geometry of your
          hard disk.  You must reinstall &os; again from the
          beginning with the correct geometry.</para>

          <para>If you are failing entirely in figuring out the
	  correct geometry for your machine, here's a tip: Install a
	  small DOS partition at the beginning of the disk and install
	  &os; after that.  The install program will see the DOS
	  partition and try to infer the correct geometry from it,
	  which usually works.</para>

	  <para>The following tip is no longer recommended, but is left here
	  for reference:</para>

	  <blockquote>
            <para>If you are setting up a truly dedicated &os;
	    server or workstation where you don't care for (future)
	    compatibility with DOS, Linux or another operating system,
	    you've also got the option to use the entire disk (`A' in
	    the partition editor), selecting the non-standard option
	    where &os; occupies the entire disk from the very first
	    to the very last sector.  This will leave all geometry
	    considerations aside, but is somewhat limiting unless
	    you're never going to run anything other than &os; on a
	    disk.</para>

	  <para>The system finds my &man.ed.4; network card, but I
          keep getting device timeout errors.</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>Your card is probably on a different IRQ from what is
	  specified in the <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file.  The ed driver does
	  not use the `soft' configuration by default (values entered
	  using EZSETUP in DOS), but it will use the software
	  configuration if you specify <literal>-1</literal> in the hints
          for the interface.</para>

	  <para>Either move the jumper on the card to a hard
          configuration setting (altering the kernel settings if
          necessary), or specify the IRQ as <literal>-1</literal>
          by setting the hint <quote>hint.ed.0.irq="-1"</quote> 
          This will tell the kernel to
          use the soft configuration.</para>

          <para>Another possibility is that your card is at IRQ 9,
          which is shared by IRQ 2 and frequently a cause of problems
          (especially when you have a VGA card using IRQ 2!).  You
          should not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at all possible.</para>
