  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in &man.mksnap.ffs.8; has been fixed; it caused the creation of a
      file system snapshot to reset the flags on the file system to
      their default values.  The possible consequences depended on local
      usage, but could include disabling extended access control lists
      or enabling the use of setuid executables stored on an untrusted
      file system.  This bug also affected the &man.dump.8;
      <option>-L</option> option, which uses &man.mksnap.ffs.8;.  Note
      that &man.mksnap.ffs.8; is normally only available to the
      superuser and members of the <groupname>operator</groupname>
      group.  For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:01.mksnap_ffs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:01</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call) has been fixed.
      This bug can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the &man.jail.attach.2; system call
      has been fixed.  This error could allow a process with superuser
      privileges inside a &man.jail.8; environment to change its root
      directory to that of a different jail, and thus gain full read
      and write access to files and directories within the target
      jail.  More information can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:03.jail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:03</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A potential low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against
      the &os; TCP stack has been prevented by limiting the number of
      out-of-sequence TCP segments that can be held at one time.  More
      details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in <application>OpenSSL</application>'s SSL/TLS
      ChangeCipherSpec message processing could result in
      a null pointer dereference, has been fixed.
      This could allow a remote attacker to crash an
      <application>OpenSSL</application>-using
      application and cause a denial-of-service on the system.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the handling of some IPv6
      socket options within the &man.setsockopt.2; system call
      has been fixed.  This allows a local attacker to cause a
      system panic, and may allow to gain unauthorized access to
      parts of kernel memory, possibly resulting in disclosure
      of sensitive information, bypass of access control
      mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:06.ipv6.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:06</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Two programming errors in <application>CVS</application>
      have been fixed.  They allow a server to overwrite arbitrary
      files on the client, and a client to read arbitrary files
      on the server when accessing remote CVS repositories.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:07.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:07</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A bugfix for <application>Heimdal</application> rectifies a
      problem in which it would not perform adequate checking of
      authentication across autonomous realms.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:08.heimdal.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:08</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in <application>CVS</application> which
      allow the malicious client to overwrite arbitrary portions of
      the server's memory has been fixed.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:10.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:10</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A potential cache consistency problem of
      the implementation of the &man.msync.2; system call
      involving the <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      operation has been fixed.  However, as a side effect of closing
      this security problem, the <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      flag no longer guarantees that all pages in the range are invalidated.
      Users who require the old semantics of <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      and are not concerned with the security issue being fixed can set the
      <varname>vm.old_msync</varname> sysctl to 1 which will revert to
      the old (insecure) behavior.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:11.msync.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:11</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the &man.jail.2; system call
      which results in a failure to verify that an attempt
      to manipulate routing tables originated from a non-jailed process
      has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:12.jail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:12</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the handling of some Linux system calls which
      may result in memory locations being accessed without proper validation
      has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:13.linux.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:13</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A number of programming errors in <application>CVS</application>
      which allow information disclosure, denial-of-service, or
      possibly arbitrary code execution, have been fixed
      via an upgrade to <application>CVS</application> 1.11.17.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:14.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:14</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in <literal>CONS_SCRSHOT</literal> &man.ioctl.2;
      has been fixed; it may allow to gain unauthorized access to
      parts of kernel memory, possibly resulting in disclosure
      of sensitive information, bypass of access control
      mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para><literal>ADAPTIVE_MUTEXES</literal> has been added
      and enabled by default.  This changes the behavior
      of blocking mutexes to spin if the thread that currently
      owns the mutex is executing on another CPU.
      This feature can be disabled explicitly by setting
      a kernel option <varname>NO_ADAPTIVE_MUTEXES</varname>.</para>

    <para>A kernel option <varname>ADAPTIVE_GIANT</varname>, which
      causes the Giant lock to also be treated in
      an adaptive fashion when adaptive mutexes are enabled,
      has been added.  This improves the performance of SMP machines
      and is enabled by default on the i386.</para>

    <para>The &man.bus.dma.9; interface now supports transparently honoring
      the alignment and boundary constraints in the DMA tag
      when loading buffers, and <function>bus_dmamap_load()</function>
      will automatically use bounce buffers when needed.
      In addition, a set of sysctls <varname>hw.busdma.*</varname>
      for &man.bus.dma.9; statistics has been added.</para>

    <para>The &man.contigmalloc.9; function has been reimplemented
      with an algorithm which stands a greatly-improved chance of working
      despite pressure from running programs.  The old algorithm can be used
      by setting a sysctl <varname>vm.old_contigmalloc</varname>.  More details
      can be found in the &man.contigmalloc.9; manual page.</para>

    <para>The &man.devfs.5; path rules now work correctly on
      directories.</para>

    <para>The &man.getvfsent.3; API has been removed.</para>

    <para>The <varname>hw.pci.allow_unsupported_io_range</varname>
      loader tunable has been removed.</para>

    <para>&man.jail.2; now supports the use of raw sockets from within a jail.
      This feature is disabled by default, and controlled by using the
      <varname>security.jail.allow_raw_sockets</varname> sysctl.</para>

    <para>&man.kqueue.2; now supports a new filter
      <literal>EVFILT_FS</literal> to be used to signal generic file system
      events to the user space.  Currently, mount, unmount, and up/down
      status of NFS are signaled.</para>

    <para>KDB, a new debugger framework, has been added.
      This consists of a new GDB backend, which has been rewritten to support
      threading, run-length encoding compression, and so on, and
      the frontend that provides a framework in which multiple, different
      debugger backends can be configured and which provides
      basic services to those backends.
      The following options has been changed:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>KDB is enabled by default
	  via the kernel options <literal>options KDB</literal>,
	  <literal>options GDB</literal>, and <literal>options DDB</literal>.
	  Both <literal>DDB</literal> and
	  <literal>GDB</literal> specify which KDB backends to include.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>WITNESS_DDB</literal> has been renamed to
	  <literal>WITNESS_KDB</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>DDB_TRACE</literal> has been renamed to
	  <literal>KDB_TRACE</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>DDB_UNATTENDED</literal> has been renamed to
	  <literal>KDB_UNATTENDED</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>SC_HISTORY_DDBKEY</literal> has been renamed to
	  <literal>SC_HISTORY_KDBKEY</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>DDB_NOKLDSYM</literal> has been removed.
	  The new DDB backend supports pre-linker symbol
	  lookups as well as KLD symbol lookups at the same time.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>GDB_REMOTE_CHAT</literal> has been removed.
	  The GDB protocol hacks to allow this are &os; specific.
	  At the same time, the GDB protocol has packets for console
	  output.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>KDB also serves as the single point of contact for any and
      all code that wants to make use of the debugger functions,
      such as entering the debugger or handling of the
      alternate break sequence.
      For this purpose, the frontend has been made non-optional.
      All debugger requests are forwarded or handed over to the current
      backend, if applicable.
      Selection of the current backend is done by the
      <varname>debug.kdb.current</varname> sysctl.
      A list of configured backends can be obtained with the
      <varname>debug.kdb.available</varname> sysctl.
      One can enter the debugger by writing to the
      <varname>debug.kdb.enter</varname> sysctl.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl <varname>debug.kdb.stop_cpus</varname> has been
      added.  This controls whether or not IPI (Inter Processor Interrupts)
      to other CPUs will be delivered when entering the debugger,
      in order to stop them while in the debugger.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">Loadable kernel modules now work and are
      enabled in the amd64 build.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">Preliminary support for running 32-bit
      Linux binaries on amd64 has been added.  This feature is enabled with the
      <literal>COMPAT_LINUX32</literal> kernel option.</para>

    <para>A new kernel option <literal>MAC_STATIC</literal> which
      disables internal MAC Framework synchronization protecting against
      dynamic load and unload of MAC policies, has been added.</para>

    <para>The &man.mac.bsdextended.4; policy now supports to match and
      apply on a first rule only in place of all rules match.
      This feature can be enabled by setting a new sysctl
      <varname>mac_bsdextended_firstmatch_enabled</varname>.</para>

    <para>The &man.mac.bsdextended.4; policy can now log
      failed attempts to syslog's <literal>AUTHPRIV</literal> facility.
      This feature can be enabled by setting a new sysctl
      <varname>mac_bsdextended_logging</varname>.</para>

    <para>mballoc has been replaced with mbuma, an Mbuf and Cluster
      allocator built on top of a number of extensions to the UMA framework.
      Due to this change, the <literal>NMBCLUSTERS</literal> kernel option
      is no longer used.  The maximum number of the clusters is still
      capped off according to <literal>maxusers</literal>,
      but it can be made unlimited by setting the
      <varname>kern.ipc.nmbclusters</varname> loader tunable to zero.</para>

    <para><filename>/dev/kmem</filename>, <filename>/dev/mem</filename>,
      and <filename>/dev/io</filename> are also provided as kernel
      loadable modules now.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.mmap.2; that pages marked as <literal>PROT_NONE</literal>
      may become readable under certain circumstances, has been fixed.  &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">A new kernel option <literal>MP_WATCHDOG</literal>
      has been added; it
      allows one of the logical CPUs on a system to be used as a dedicated
      watchdog to cause a drop to the debugger and/or generate an NMI
      to the boot processor if the kernel ceases to respond.
      Several sysctls are available to enable the watchdog running out of the
      processor's idle thread; a callout is launched to reset a timer
      in the watchdog.  If the callout fails to reset the timer for ten seconds,
      the timeout process will take place.  The <varname>debug.watchdog_cpu</varname>
      sysctl allows to select which CPU will run the watchdog.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">A sysctl <varname>debug.leak_schedlock</varname>
      has been added.  This causes a sysctl handler that incorrectly leaks
      the holding sched lock, to spin the lock
      in order to trigger the watchdog provided by the
      <literal>MP_WATCHDOG</literal> option.</para>

    <para>A new loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> has been
      added and enabled by default.  This causes the &os; network stack
      to operate without the Giant lock, resulting in performance
      improvement by increasing parallelism and decreasing latency
      in network processing.  Note that enabling one of the &man.ng.tty.4;
      Netgraph node type, KAME IPsec, and IPX/SPX subsystem results in a boot-time
      restoration of Giant-enabled network operation, or run-time
      warning on dynamic load as these components require Giant lock
      for correct operation.</para>

    <para>A new kernel option <varname>NET_WITH_GIANT</varname> has been
      added.  This restores the default value of debug.mpsafenet to
      <literal>0</literal>, and is intended for use on systems compiled with
      known unsafe components, or where a more conservative configuration is
      desired.</para>

    <para>A new loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafevm</varname> has been
      added.  This currently results in almost
      Giant-free execution of zero-fill page faults.</para>

    <para arch="alpha,amd64,i386">A new kernel option
      <literal>PREEMPTION</literal> has been added.
      This allows the threads that are in the kernel to be preempted
      by higher priority threads.  It helps with interactivity and
      allows interrupt threads to run sooner rather than waiting.</para>

    <para>A devclass level has been added to the dev sysctl tree,
      in order to support per-class variables in addition to
      per-device variables.  This means that <varname>dev.foo0.bar</varname>
      is now called <varname>dev.foo.0.bar</varname>, and it is
      possible to to have <varname>dev.foo.bar</varname> as well.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl, <varname>kern.always_console_output</varname>,
      has been added.  It makes output from the kernel go to the console despite
      the use of <varname>TIOCCONS</varname>.</para>

    <para>A sysctl <varname>kern.sched.name</varname>
      which has the name of the scheduler currently in use,
      has been added, and the <varname>kern.quantum</varname> sysctl
      has been moved to <varname>kern.sched.quantum</varname>
      for consistency.</para>

    <para>The &man.pci.4; bus resource and power management have
      been updated.

      <note>
	<para>Although the &man.pci.4; bus power state management
	  has been enabled by default, it may cause problems on some systems.
	  This can be disabled by setting the tunable
	  <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate</varname> to
	  <literal>0</literal>.</para>
      </note>
    </para>

    <para>The ULE scheduler has been added as an additional scheduler.
      Note that the conventional one, which is called 4BSD, is still used
      as the default scheduler in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.
      For the average user,
      interactivity is reported to be better in many cases.  This
      means less <quote>skipping</quote> and <quote>jerking</quote> in
      interactive applications while the machine is very busy.  This
      will not prevent problems due to overloaded disk subsystems, but
      it does help with overloaded CPUs.  On SMP machines, ULE has
      per-CPU run queues which allow for CPU affinity, CPU binding,
      and advanced HyperThreading support, as well as providing a
      framework for more optimizations in the future.  As fine-grained
      kernel locking continues, the scheduler will be able to make
      more efficient use of the available parallel resources.</para>

    <para>A linear search algorithm used in
      &man.vm.map.findspace.9; has been replaced with
      an O(log n) algorithm built into the map entry splay tree.
      This significantly reduces the overhead in &man.vm.map.findspace.9;
      for applications that &man.mmap.2; many hundreds or thousands
      of regions.</para>

    <para>The loader tunables <varname>debug.witness_*</varname>
      have been renamed to <varname>debug.witness.*</varname>.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>The &os; dynamic and static linker now support Thread Local Storage (TLS),
      a <application>GCC</application> feature which supports
      a <literal>__thread</literal> modifier
      to the declaration of global and static variables.
      This extra modifier means that the variable's value is
      thread-local; one thread changing its value will not
      affect the value of the variable in any other thread.</para>

    <para>The kernel's file descriptor allocation code has been
      updated, and is now derived from similar code in OpenBSD.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">On &os;/sparc64, <varname>time_t</varname>
      has been changed from a 32-bit value to a 64-bit value.

      <note>
	<para>Since this change is not backward-compatible,
	  any programs which were built on an older system using
	  a 32-bit <varname>time_t</varname> and
	  call system routines for handling
	  <varname>time_t</varname> values, will have to be recompiled.
	  More detailed information and notice on upgrading from
	  the source can be found in
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING.64BTT</filename>.</para>
      </note>
    </para>

    <para arch="i386">It is now possible to compile the &os;/i386

      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>The EXT2FS file system code now includes partial support
	for large (&gt; 4GB) files.  This support is partial in that
	it will refuse to create large files on file systems that have

      &man.sysinstall.8; disk partition editor to correctly create a
      single &os; partition covering the entire disk. &merged;</para>

    <para><application>libdisk</application> now uses
      <varname>d_addr_t</varname> for disk addresses.
      This allows &man.sysinstall.8; to properly handle disks
      and file systems more than 1 TB.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98,amd64,ia64">The library formerly known as
      <application>libkse</application> has been renamed

      <application>GCC</application>'s <option>-pthread</option>

      rather than <application>libc_r</application>.

      <note>
	<para>Users with older binaries (for example, ports compiled

    <para><application>libpthread</application> now supports
      a <varname>LIBPTHREAD_SYSTEM_SCOPE</varname> environment
      variable to force 1:1 mode (using system scope threads).  Note that
      building <application>libpthread</application> with
      <option>-DSYSTEM_SCOPE_ONLY</option> flag also forces 1:1 mode,
      and that this option is set by default for architectures that do not
      support M:N mode yet.
      In addition, a <varname>LIBPTHREAD_PROCESS_SCOPE</varname> environment
      variable can be used to force M:N mode (using process scope
      threads).  For example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>LIBPTHREAD_SYSTEM_SCOPE=yes <replaceable>threaded_app</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>&man.make.1; now supports the POSIX-compatible
      <literal>+</literal> flag in <filename>Makefile</filename> command lines,
      which causes a line to be executed even when <option>-n</option>
      is specified.  This is useful for calls to submakes, for example.</para>

    <para>&man.make.1; now puts variable assignments from
      the command line into the <varname>MAKEFLAGS</varname>
      variable as required by POSIX.  This causes such variables
      to be pushed into all sub-makes called by the &man.make.1;
      (except when the <varname>MAKEFLAGS</varname>
      variable is explicitly changed in the sub-make's environment).
      This makes them also mostly un-overrideable

    <para>&man.newsyslog.8; now uses a new order when processing
      files to rotate.  It first rotates all files that need

      which needs to be signaled, and finally compresses
      all the files that were rotated.</para>

    <para>A &man.nextwctype.3; function to iterate over all characters

    <para>&man.od.1; now has POSIX-style support for multibyte
      characters.</para>

    <para>&man.patch.1; has been replaced with a BSD-licensed version
      from OpenBSD.  This includes a <option>--posix</option> option
      for strict POSIX conformance.</para>

    <para>The &man.pgrep.1; and &man.pkill.1; commands, which come from NetBSD,
      have been added.  They also support a <option>-M</option> option

      specified core instead of the default <filename>/dev/kmem</filename>,
      and a <option>-N</option> option to extract the name list from
      the specified system instead of the default kernel.</para>

    <para>&man.ppp.8; now supports a <quote>set rad_alive
	<replaceable>N</replaceable></quote> command
      to enable periodic RADIUS accounting information
      being sent to the RADIUS server.  &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.ppp.8; now supports a

      to configure the operating mode of an underlying
      &man.ng.pppoe.4; Netgraph node.</para>

    <para>&man.ps.1; compatibility with POSIX/SUSv3 has been improved.
      The changes include <option>-p</option> for a list of process IDs,
      <option>-t</option> for a list of terminal names,
      <option>-A</option> which is equivalent to <option>-ax</option>,
      <option>-G</option> for a list of group IDs,

    <para>The &man.resolver.3; and associated interfaces are now much
      more reentrant and thread-safe.  Multiple DNS lookups can now be
      run at the same time, showing major improvements in the

    <para>The <literal>SIZE</literal> attribute for distfiles,

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The building process for boot floppy images

      writing).  This greatly improves installations that begin with a
      boot from floppy disk, because they now use exactly the same
      kernel (and thus support the same hardware) as CDROM
      installations.  The stripped-down <filename>MFSROOT</filename>
