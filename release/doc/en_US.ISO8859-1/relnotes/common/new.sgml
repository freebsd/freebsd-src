  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

  <para>Users who are new to the &release.branch; series of &os;
    &release.type;s should also read the <quote>Early Adopters Guide
    to &os; &release.current;</quote>.  This document can generally be
    found in the same location as the release notes (either as a part of a
    &os; distribution or on the &os; Web site).  It contains important
    information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using
    &os; &release.current;, as opposed to releases based on the &os;
    4-STABLE development branch.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.

<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The latter
      items are marked as &merged;.
]]>
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in &man.mksnap.ffs.8; has been fixed; it caused the creation of a
      filesystem snapshot to reset the flags on the filesystem to
      their default values.  The possible consequences depended on local
      usage, but could include disabling extended access control lists
      or enabling the use of setuid executables stored on an untrusted
      filesystem.  This bug also affected the &man.dump.8;
      <option>-L</option> option, which uses &man.mksnap.ffs.8;.  Note
      that &man.mksnap.ffs.8; is normally only available to the
      superuser and members of the <groupname>operator</groupname>
      group.  For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:01.mksnap_ffs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:01</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call) has been fixed.
      This bug can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the &man.jail.attach.2; system call
      has been fixed.  This error could allow a process with superuser
      privileges inside a &man.jail.8; environment to change its root
      directory to that of a different jail, and thus gain full read
      and write access to files and directories within the target
      jail.  More information can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:03.jail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:03</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A potential low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against
      the &os; TCP stack has been prevented by limiting the number of
      out-of-sequence TCP segments that can be held at one time.  More
      details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in <application>OpenSSL</application>'s SSL/TLS
      ChangeCipherSpec message processing could result in
      a null pointer dereference, has been fixed.
      This could allow a remote attacker to crash an
      <application>OpenSSL</application>-using
      application and cause a denial-of-service on the system.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the handling of some IPv6
      socket options within the &man.setsockopt.2; system call
      has been fixed.  This allows a local attacker to cause a
      system panic, and may allow to gain unauthorized access to
      parts of kernel memory, possibly resulting in disclosure
      of sensitive information, bypass of access control
      mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:06.ipv6.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:06</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Two programming errors in <application>CVS</application>
      have been fixed.  They allow a server to overwrite arbitrary
      files on the client, and a client to read arbitrary files
      on the server when accessing remote CVS repositories.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:07.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:07</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A bugfix for <application>Heimdal</application> rectifies a
      problem in which it would not perform adequate checking of
      authentication across autonomous realms.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:08.heimdal.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:08</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in <application>CVS</application> which
      allow the malicious client to overwrite arbitrary portions of
      the server's memory has been fixed.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:10.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:10</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A potential cache consistency problem of
      the implementation of the &man.msync.2; system call
      involving the <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      operation has been fixed.  However, as a side effect of closing
      this security problem, the <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      flag no longer guarantees that all pages in the range are invalidated.
      Users who require the old semantics of <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
      and are not concerned with the security issue being fixed can set the
      <varname>vm.old_msync</varname> sysctl to 1 which will revert to
      the old (insecure) behavior.  For more information,
      see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:11.msync.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:11</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the &man.jail.2; system call
      which results in a failure to verify that an attempt
      to manipulate routing tables originated from a non-jailed process
      has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:12.jail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:12</ulink>. &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the handling of some Linux system calls which
      may result in memory locations being accessed without proper validation
      has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:13.linux.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:13</ulink>. &merged;</para>

      certain hardware features on Toshiba laptops.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.acpi.toshiba.4; driver now supports
      video output switching.</para>

    <para>The &man.acpi.video.4; driver has been added to provide
      control display switching and backlight brightness using the
      ACPI Video Extensions.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.acpi.4; driver now supports
      per-device sysctls (<varname>dev.root0.nexus0.acpi0.acpi_lid0.wake</varname>,
      for instance) to allow users to set whether or not a given
      device can wake the system.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.acpi.4; driver has been updated to
      be disabled automatically when the machine has well-known broken BIOS.
      This behavior can be disabled by setting a loader tunable
      <varname>hint.acpi.0.disabled</varname> to <literal>0</literal>.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.ctau.4; driver has been added for Cronyx Tau
      synchronous serial adapters. This driver was known for a long time as
      <quote>ct</quote> in its previous life outside the &os; source tree. &merged;

      <note>
	<para>The driver name has changed, but the network interface still
	  has the <quote>ct</quote> name.</para>
      </note>
    </para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The &man.cp.4; driver has been added for Cronyx Tau-PCI
      synchronous serial adapters.
    </para>

    <para>&man.devfs.5; path rules now work correctly on
      directories.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The dgb (DigiBoard intelligent serial card) driver has been
      removed due to breakage.  Its replacement is the &man.digi.4; driver,
      which supports all the hardware of the dgb driver.</para>

    <para>The &man.getvfsent.3; API has been removed.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">The &man.hme.4; driver now natively supports
      long frames, so it can be used for &man.vlan.4; with full Ethernet
      MTU size.</para>

    <para>&man.jail.2; now supports use of raw sockets from within a jail.
      This feature is disabled by default, and controlled using the
      <varname>security.jail.allow_raw_sockets</varname> sysctl.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">Loadable kernel modules now work and are
      enabled in the amd64 build.</para>

    <para>A new kernel option <literal>MAC_STATIC</literal> which
      disables internal MAC Framework synchronization protecting against
      dynamic load and unload of MAC policies, has been added.</para>

    <para>mballoc has been replaced with mbuma, an Mbuf and Cluster
      allocator built on top of a number of extensions to the UMA framework.
      Due to this change, the <varname>NMBCLUSTERS</varname> kernel option
      is no longer used.  The maximum number of the clusters is still
      capped off according to <varname>maxusers</varname>,
      but it can be made unlimited by setting the
      <varname>kern.ipc.nmbclusters</varname> loader tunable to zero.</para>

    <para>The midi driver, which supports serial port and several sound cards,
      has been removed.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.mmap.2; that pages marked as <literal>PROT_NONE</literal>
      may become readable under certain circumstances, has been fixed.  &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.nmdm.4; has been rewritten to improve the reliability.</para>

    <para>The raid(4), RAIDframe disk driver from NetBSD has been removed.
      This is currently non-functional, and would require some amount of work
      to make it work under the &man.geom.4; API in 5-CURRENT.</para>

    <para>The &man.pcm.4; driver has been modified to read
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> on startup, to allow setting
      of default values for mixer channels.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">The &man.sab.4; now supports
      <literal>BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal> kernel option.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The sx driver, which supports Specialix I/O8+ and I/O4+
      intelligent multiport serial controllers has been added.</para>

    <para>A devclass level has been added to the dev sysctl tree,
      in order to support per-class variables in addition to
      per-device variables.  This means that <varname>dev.foo0.bar</varname>
      is now called <varname>dev.foo.0.bar</varname>, and it is
      possible to to have <varname>dev.foo.bar</varname> as well.</para>

    <para>A sysctl <varname>kern.sched.name</varname>
      which has the name of the scheduler currently in use,
      has been added, and the <varname>kern.quantum</varname> sysctl
      has been moved to <varname>kern.sched.quantum</varname>
      for consistency.</para>

    <para arch="alpha,amd64,i386">For the &man.uart.4; device
      <varname>hw.uart.console</varname> and
      <varname>hw.uart.dbgport</varname> environment variables
      have been added.  They can be used to select a serial console and
      debug port respectively, as well as the attributes.</para>

    <para>The &man.ubser.4; device driver has been added to support
      BWCT console management serial adapters.</para>

    <para>The ULE scheduler is now the default scheduler in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  For the average user,
      interactivity is reported to be better in many cases.  This
      means less <quote>skipping</quote> and <quote>jerking</quote> in
      interactive applications while the machine is very busy.  This
      will not prevent problems due to overloaded disk subsystems, but
      it does help with overloaded CPUs.  On SMP machines, ULE has
      per-CPU run queues which allow for CPU affinity, CPU binding,
      and advanced HyperThreading support, as well as providing a
      framework for more optimizations in the future.  As fine-grained
      kernel locking continues, the scheduler will be able to make
      more efficient use of the available parallel resources.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>The device driver infrastructure (as well as many drivers)
      have been updated.  Among the changes: Many more drivers now use
      automatically-assigned major numbers (instead of the old static
      major numbers).  Enhanced functions to support cloning of
      pseudodevices.  Several changes to the driver API, including a
      new <varname>d_version</varname> field in <varname>struct
      cdevsw</varname>.  Note that third-party device drivers will
      require recompiling after this change.</para>

    <para>The pseudo-interface cloning has been updated and
      the match function to allow creation of &man.stf.4;
      interfaces named <devicename>stf0</devicename>,
      <devicename>stf</devicename>, or <devicename>6to4</devicename>.
      Note that this breaks backward compatibility; for example,
      now <command>ifconfig stf</command> creates
      the interface named <devicename>stf</devicename>,
      not <devicename>stf0</devicename>, and does not print
      <devicename>stf0</devicename> to stdout.</para>

    <para>The kernel's file descriptor allocation code has been
      updated, and is now derived from similar code in OpenBSD.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">On &os;/sparc64, <varname>time_t</varname>
      has been changed from a 32-bit value to a 64-bit value.

      <note>
	<para>Since this change is not backward-compatible,
	  any programs which were built on an older system using
	  a 32-bit <varname>time_t</varname> and
	  call system routines for handling
	  <varname>time_t</varname> values, will have to be recompiled.

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The building process for boot floppy images

      boot from floppy disk, because they now use exactly the same
      kernel (and thus support the same hardware) as CDROM
      installations.  The stripped-down <filename>MFSROOT</filename>
