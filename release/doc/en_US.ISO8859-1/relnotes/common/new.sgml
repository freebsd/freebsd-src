  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

  <para>Users who are new to the &release.branch; series of &os;
    &release.type;s should also read the <quote>Early Adopters Guide
    to &os; &release.current;</quote>.  This document can generally be
    found in the same location as the release notes (either as a part of a
    &os; distribution or on the &os; Web site).  It contains important
    information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using
    &os; &release.current;, as opposed to releases based on the &os;
    4-STABLE development branch.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
]]>
<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The latter
      items are marked as &merged;.
]]>
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

	machines, which may improve the usability of some PCI devices
	(particularly on laptops).</para>

      <para arch="i386">An integer overflow that could cause kernel
        panics on PAE machines of certain large memory sizes has been
        corrected.</para>

      <para arch="i386">A bug that even when no AT keyboard is connected,
        &man.atkbd.4; registers an AT keyboard during console initialization
        has been fixed.  <command>kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbd1</command>
        is no longer needed when only a USB keyboard is connected.

	working correctly at 10 Mbps has been fixed.</para>

      <para arch="i386,pc98,sparc64">The &man.harp.4; driver has been added.
        This is a pseudo physical interface driver for HARP, 
        which attaches to all netgraph ATM interface in the
        system and presents a physical interface to the HARP stack
        for each of these interfaces.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; rules now support comma-separated address lists
        (like <literal>1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8/30, 9.10.11.12/22</literal>),
        and allows spaces after commas to make lists of addresses more readable.
        &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; rules now support C++-style comment.
        The comment is stored together with the rule and appears using
        &man.ipfw.8; <literal>show</literal> command.
        &merged;</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; now allows to modify &man.ipfw.4; rules in set 31,
        which was read-only and used for the default rules.
        They can be deleted by <command>ipfw delete set 31</command>
        command but are not deleted
        by <command>ipfw flush</command> command.
        So this implements a flexible form of <quote>persistent
          rules</quote>.  More details can be found in &man.ipfw.8;.
        &merged;</para>

      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.da.4; driver no longer tries to send 6-byte
	commands to USB and Firewire devices.  The quirks for these
	devices (which hopefully are now unnecessary) have been
	disabled; to restore the old behavior, add <literal>options
	DA_OLD_QUIRKS</literal> to the kernel configuration.</para>

      <para>Various &man.geom.4; modules can now be loaded as kernel
	modules, namely:
	<filename>geom_apple</filename>,

    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>&man.arp.8; now supports a <option>-i</option> option
      to limit the scope of the current operation to the ARP entries
      on a particular interface.  This option applies to the display
      operations only.  It should be useful on routers with numerous
      network interfaces.</para>

    <para>&man.chroot.8; now allows the optional setting of a user,
      primary group, or group list to use inside the chroot
      environment via the <option>-u</option>, <option>-g</option>,
      and <option>-G</option> options respectively. &merged;</para>

    <para>The dev_db utility is unnecessary due to the mandatory
      presence of devfs, and has been removed.</para>

      to test the syntax of commands without actually changing anything.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>The <filename>libcipher</filename> DES cryptography library
      has been removed.  All of its functionality is provided by the
      <filename>libcrypto</filename> library, and all base systems
      programs that used <filename>libcipher</filename> have been
      converted to use <filename>libcrypto</filename> instead.</para>

    <para arch="i386,ia64">The <filename>libthr</filename> 1:1

      now POSIX-compliant.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.8; utility now supports to display the filesystem
      ID for each file system in addition to the normal information
      when a <option>-v</option> flag is specified,
      and &man.umount.8; utility now accepts the filesystem ID
      as well as the usual device and path names.
      This allows to unambiguously specify which file system is
      to be unmounted even when two or more file systems share
      the same device and mount point names.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.nwfs.8;, &man.mount.portalfs.8;, and
      &man.mount.smbfs.8; utilities have been moved from
      <filename>/sbin</filename> to <filename>/usr/sbin</filename>.</para>

      has been fixed.</para>

    <para>A number of utilities available in <filename>/bin</filename>
      and <filename>/sbin</filename> are now available as a
      statically-linked <quote>crunched</quote> binary that lives in
      <filename>/rescue</filename>.  This functionality is similar to
      the <filename>/stand</filename> directory installed by
      &man.sysinstall.8;, but it <filename>/rescue</filename> includes
      more functionality and is updated by as part of
      buildworld/installworld operations.  More details can be found in
      &man.rescue.8;.
