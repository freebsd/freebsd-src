  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch after &release.prev;.  Note that no further, formal
    releases on the &release.branch; branch are planned at this time.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in &man.ypserv.8;, which effectively disabled the
      <filename>/var/yp/securenets</filename> access control mechanism,
      has been corrected.  More details are available in security
      advisory
      <ulink url="http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:15.ypserv.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:15.ypserv</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in the smbfs file system, which could allow an
      attacker to escape out of &man.chroot.2 environments on an smbfs
      mounted filesystem, has been fixed.  For more details, see
      security advisory
      <ulink url="http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:16.smbfs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:16.smbfs</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A potential denial of service problem in &man.sendmail.8;
      caused by excessive recursion which leads to stack
      exhaustion when attempting delivery of a malformed
      MIME message, has been fixed.  For more details,
      see security advisory <ulink

      details on the exact impact of the bug, as well as workaround
      and patch information, can be found in security advisory

      could permit privilege escalation via a symlink attack has been
      fixed.  More information is available in

<sect1 id="upgrade">
  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"
	    ><quote>Using <command>make world</command></quote></ulink>
	  section of the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
	    >FreeBSD Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"
      ><quote>-CURRENT vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the
    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
      >FreeBSD Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
  </important>
