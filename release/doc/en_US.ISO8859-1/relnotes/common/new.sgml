  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes new features of &os; that have been added (or changed)
    since &release.prev;.  It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes. 

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>&man.acct.2; has been changed to open the accounting file in
      append mode, so that &man.accton.8; can be used to enable
      accounting to an append-only file.</para>

    <para><literal>RLIMIT_VMEM</literal> support has been added.  This
      feature defines a new resource limit that covers a process's
      entire virtual memory space, including &man.mmap.2; space.  This
      limit can be configured in &man.login.conf.5; via the new
      <varname>vmemoryuse</varname> variable.</para>

    <para>The &man.ucom.4; device driver has been added, to support USB
      modems, serial devices, and other programs that need to look
      like a tty.  The related &man.uplcom.4; and &man.uvscom.4; drivers provide specific
      support for the Prolific PL-2303 serial adapter and the SUNTAC
      Slipper U VS-10U, respectively.</para>

    <para>The &man.uvisor.4; driver for connecting Handspring Visors via USB
      has been added.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">The &man.em.4; driver now supports the
        Intel 82545EM and 82545EB chips.  It also has VLAN
        support.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.rp.4; driver has been updated to
        version 3.02 and can now be built as a module.</para>

<!-- Above this line, order network driver changes by manpage/variable name-->

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>A new version of &man.ipfw.4; 
        (commonly referred to as <quote>IPFW2</quote>) has been added
        as an option.  It now uses
        variable-sized representation of rules in the kernel, similar
        to &man.bpf.4; instructions.  Most of the externally-visible
        behavior (i.e. through &man.ipfw.8;) should be unchanged.,
        although &man.ipfw.8; now supports <literal>or</literal>
        connectives between match fields.  This new version is
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> enabled by default.  To use it:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Add <literal>options IPFW2</literal> (undocumented)
	    to the kernel configuration.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Compile and install <filename>libalias</filename> and
	    &man.ipfw.8; with the <option>-DIPFW2</option> option
	    specified to &man.make.1;.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>A bug which sometimes prevented &man.ata.4; tagged
        queueing from working correctly has been corrected.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now computes maximum transfer sizes
        correctly.  This fixes numerous <literal>READ_BIG</literal>
        and other errors that occurred when accessing certain ATA
        devices.</para>

      <para arch="i386,alpha">The mpt driver, for
	supporting the LSI Logic Fusion/MP architecture Fiber Channel
	controllers, has been added.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The pst driver, for supporting Promise
	SuperTrak ATA RAID controllers, has been
	added.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The VT8233 audio controller now has its own
        driver to facilitate supporting all known revisions of the
        hardware.  It is loadable at boot time by adding
        <literal>device pcm</literal> to the kernel configuration or
        by adding <literal>snd_via8233="YES"</literal> to
        <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  Documentation to
        support this work was provided by VIA.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>The original fix for security advisory SA-02:23 (which
      addressed the use of file descriptors by set-user-id or
      set-group-id programs) contained an error.  It was still
      possible for systems using &man.procfs.5; or &man.linprocfs.5;
      to be exploited.  This error has now been corrected; a revised
      version of security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:23.stdio.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:23</ulink>
      contains more details.</para>

    <para>A buffer overflow in the resolver, which could be exploited
      by a malicious domain name server or an attacker forging DNS
      messages, has been fixed.  See security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:28.resolv.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:28</ulink>
      for more details.</para>

    <para>A buffer overflow in &man.tcpdump.1;, which could be triggered by
      badly-formed NFS packets, has been fixed.  See security advisory
      <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:29.tcpdump.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:29</ulink>
      for more details.</para>

    <para>&man.ktrace.1; can no longer trace the operation of formerly
      privileged processes; this prevents the leakage of sensitive
      information that the process could have obtained before
      abandoning its privileges.  For a discussion of this issue, see
      security advisory
      <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:30.ktrace.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:30</ulink>
      for more details.</para>

    <para>A race condition in &man.pppd.8;, which could be used to
      change the permissions of an arbitrary file, has been corrected.
      For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:32.pppd.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:32</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Multiple buffer overflows in
      <application>OpenSSL</application> have been corrected, by way
      of an upgrade to the base system version of
      <application>OpenSSL</application>.  More details can be found
      in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:33.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:33</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A heap buffer overflow in the XDR decoder has been fixed.
      For more details, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:34.rpc.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:34</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug that could allow local users to read and write
      arbitrary blocks on an FFS filesystem has been corrected.  More
      details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:35.ffs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:35</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in the NFS server code, which could allow a remote
      denial of service attack, has been fixed.  Security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:36.nfs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:36</ulink>
      has more details.</para>

    <para>A bug that could allow local users to panic a system using
      the &man.kqueue.2; mechanism has been fixed.  More information
      is contained in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:37.kqueue.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:37</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Several bounds-checking bugs in system calls, which could
      result in some system calls returning a large portion of kernel
      memory, have been fixed.  More information can be found in
      security advisory <ulink

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
