  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.malloc_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export kernel malloc
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>vm.zone_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export &man.uma.9; allocator
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para>A new option <option>-S</option>,
	which allows setting the <filename>boot2</filename>
	serial console speed in the <filename>/boot.config</filename>
	file or on the <prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt line,
	has been added.</para>

      <para arch="i386,amd64">A new loader tunable
	<varname>comconsole_speed</varname> to change
	the serial console speed has been added.
	If the previous stage boot loader requested a serial console
	then the default speed is determined from the current serial port
	speed, and otherwise it is set to 9600 or the value of
	the kernel option <literal>BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED</literal>
	at compile time.</para>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para>The &man.acpi.thermal.4; driver now supports
	passive cooling.</para>

      <para>Support for the PadLock Security Co-processor in VIA C3
	processors has been added to the &man.crypto.9; subsystem.
	&merged;</para>

      <para>A bug which prevents the &man.ichsmb.4; kernel module
	from unloading has been fixed.</para>

      <para arch="ia64">The loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafevfs</varname>
	is set to <literal>1</literal> by default.</para>

      <para arch="amd64">The smbios(4) driver support for amd64 has been
	added.</para>

      <para arch="i386">A new loader tunable
	<varname>hw.apic.enable_extint</varname> has been added.
	This tunable can be used not to mask the ExtINT pin on the first
	I/O APIC.  At least one chipset for Intel Pentium III seems
	to need this even though all of the pins in the 8259A's are masked.
	The default is still to mask the ExtINT pin.</para>

      <sect4 id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

	<para>The &man.sound.4; driver now supports
	  wider range sampling rate, multiple precisions choice,
	  and 24/32 bit PCM format conversion.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.als4000.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.cmi.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.via8233.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para arch="amd64">The &man.snd.via8233.4; driver is now supported
	  on &os;/amd64.</para>

	<para>The &man.snd.via82c686.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

      <sect4 id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.dc.4; driver is now MPSAFE. &merged;</para>

	<para>The &man.de.4; driver has been converted to the &man.bus.dma.9;
	  API and is now MPSAFE.</para>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The &man.gre.4; driver, which is for GRE encapsulation
	found in RFC 1701 and RFC 1702 now supports IPv6 over GRE.</para>

      <para>The path MTU discovery for multicast packets in the &os;
	&man.ip6.4; stack has been disabled by default because
	notifying path MTU by a lot of routers in multicast
	can be a kind of distributed Denial-of-Service attack to a router.
	This feature can be enabled by using a new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet6.ip6.mcast_pmtu</varname>.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4;, IP packet filter now supports IPv6.
	The &man.ip6fw.8; is deprecated and will be removed
	in the future releases.</para>

      <para>The &man.natm.4;, Native Mode ATM protocol layer is now MPSAFE.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>net.inet.icmp.reply_from_interface</varname>
	has been added.  This allows the &man.icmp.4;
	reply to non-local packets generated with
	the IP address the packet came through in.
	This is useful for routers to show in &man.traceroute.8;
	the actual path a packet has taken instead of
	the possibly different return path.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>net.inet.icmp.quotelen</varname>
	has been added.  This allows to change length of
	the quotation of the original packet in an ICMP reply.
	The minimum of 8 bytes is internally enforced.
	The maximum quotation is the remaining space in the
	reply mbuf.  This option is added in response to the
	issues raised in I-D
	<filename>draft-gont-icmp-payload-00.txt</filename>.</para>

      <para>The &man.icmp.4; now always quotes the entire TCP header
	when responding and allocate an mbuf cluster if needed.
	This change fixes the TCP issues raised in I-D
	<filename>draft-gont-icmp-payload-00.txt</filename>.</para>

      <para>A new socket option <literal>IP_MINTTL</literal> has been added.
	This may be used to set the minimum acceptable
	TTL a packet must have when received on a socket.
	All packets with a lower TTL are silently dropped,
	and this works on already connected/connecting and
	listening sockets for RAW, UDP, and TCP.  This option
	is only really useful when set to 255 preventing packets
	from outside the directly connected networks reaching
	local listeners on sockets.  Also, this option allows
	userland implementation of <quote>The Generalized TTL
	  Security Mechanism (GTSM)</quote> found in RFC 3682.</para>

      <para>The stealth forwarding now supports IPv6 as well as IPv4.
	This behavior can be controlled by using a new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet6.ip6.stealth</varname>.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a workaround
	for some controllers whose DMA does not work properly
	in 48bit mode.  For the suspicious controllers
	the PIO mode will be used for access to over 137GB areas.</para>

      <para>A new GEOM class <literal>GEOM_ZERO</literal> has been added.
	It creates very huge provider (41PB) <filename>/dev/gzero</filename>
	and mainly for performance testing.
	On <literal>BIO_READ</literal> request it zero-fills
	<varname>bio_data</varname> and on <literal>BIO_WRITE</literal>
	it does nothing.</para>

      <para>The <literal>GEOM_LABEL</literal> class now supports
	Ext2FS and ReiserFS.</para>

      <para>The &man.mpt.4; driver has been updated to support
	various new features such as RAID volume and RAID member
	state/settings reporting, periodic volume re-synchronization
	status reporting, and sysctl variables for volume
	re-synchronization rate, volume member write cache status,
	and volume transaction queue depth.</para>

      <para>A new GEOM-based disk encryption facility, GEOM_ELI, has been
	added.  It uses the &man.crypto.9; framework for hardware acceleration
	and supports different cryptographic algorithms.  See &man.geli.8; for
	more information. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.umass.4; driver now supports
	<literal>PLAY_MSF</literal>,
	<literal>PLAY_TRACK</literal>,
	<literal>PLAY_TRACK_REL</literal>,
	<literal>PAUSE</literal>,
	<literal>PLAY_12</literal> commands so that
	the &man.cdcontrol.1; utility can handle USB CD drive.</para>

    <sect3 id="fs">
      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>A part of the FreeBSD NFS subsystem (the interface with
	the protocol stack and callouts) is now MPSAFE.</para>

    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>Padding of <varname>ai_addrlen</varname>
      in <varname>struct addrinfo</varname> has been removed,
      which was originally for the ABI compatibility.
      For example, this change break the ABI compatibility of
      &man.getaddrinfo.3; function on 64-bit architecture including
      &os;/alpha, &os;/amd64, &os;/ia64, and &os;/sparc64.</para>

    <para>The &man.bsdiff.1; and &man.bspatch.1; utilities
      have been added.  These are tools for constructing and
      applying binary patches.</para>

    <para>The &man.cmp.1; utility now supports an <option>-h</option>
      flag to compare the symbolic link itself rather than the
      file that the link points to.</para>

    <para>The &man.ifconfig.8; utility now supports
      a <option>-k</option> flag to allow printing
      potentially sensitive keying material to standard output.
      This sensitive information will not be printed by default.</para>

    <para>The &man.libmemstat.3; library has been added.
      This is for use by debugging and monitoring applications
      in tracking kernel memory statistics.  It provides an
      abstracted interface to &man.uma.9; and &man.malloc.9;
      statistics, wrapped around the binary stream sysctl variables
      for the allocators. &merged;</para>

    <para>A new function &man.memmem.3; has been implemented in
      <filename>libc</filename>.  This is the binary equivalent to
      &man.strstr.3; and found in <filename>glibc</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.moused.8; now supports an <option>-H</option> flag
      to enable horizontal virtual scrolling similar to a
      <option>-V</option> flag for vertical virtual scrolling.</para>

    <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports an
      <option>-h</option> flag for interface stats mode,
      which prints all interface statistics in human readable form.</para>

    <para>A new functions, &man.pidfile.3;, which allow reliable
      pidfiles handling have been implemented in
      <filename>libutil</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.ping.8; utility now supports <quote>a sweeping
	ping</quote> in which &man.icmp.4; payload of
      packets being sent is increased with given step.
      This is useful for testing problematic channels, MTU issues
      or traffic policing functions in networks.</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility now supports a
      <option>-F</option> option which allows to
      restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
      pidfile file.  When another new option <option>-L</option>
      is also specified, the pidfile file must be locked with the
      &man.flock.2; syscall or created with &man.pidfile.3;.</para>

    <para>The &man.powerd.8; program now supports a
      <option>-P</option> option which allows to specify pidfile.</para>

    <para>The shared library version number of all libraries have
      been updated due to some possible ABI changes.  The libraries
      include: snmp_*, libdialog, libg2c, libobjc,
      libreadline, libregex, libstdc++, libkrb5, libalias, libarchive,
      libbegemot, libbluetooth, libbsnmp, libbz2, libc_r, libcrypt,

      libssh, and libssl.</para>

    <para>The <function>wcsdup()</function> function has been
      implemented.  This function is popular in Microsoft and GNU
      systems.</para>

    <sect3 id="rc-scripts">
      <title><filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> Scripts</title>

      <para>The <filename>gbde_swap</filename> script has
	been removed in favor a new <filename>encswap</filename>
	script which also supports &man.geli.8; for swap
	encryption.</para>

      <para>The <filename>geli</filename> and <filename>geli2</filename>

      instead of the package name, and an <option>-O</option> flag
      to list packages whose registered origin is origin only.</para>

    <para>The &man.portsnap.8; utility (<filename>sysutils/portsnap</filename>)
      has been added into the &os; base system.  This is a secure,
