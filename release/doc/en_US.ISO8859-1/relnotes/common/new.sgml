  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para arch="i386,amd64">Because of an information disclosure vulnerability on
      processors using Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT), the
      <varname>machdep.hyperthreading_allowed</varname> sysctl
      variable has been added.  It defaults to <literal>1</literal>
      (HTT enabled) on &os; CURRENT, and <literal>0</literal> (HTT
      disabled) on the 4-STABLE and 5-STABLE development branches and
      supported security fix branches.  More information can be found
      in security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:09.htt.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:09.htt</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>A bug in the &man.tcpdump.1; utility which allows
      a malicious remote user to cause a denial-of-service
      by using specially crafted packets, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory

      </para>

    <para>Two problems in the &man.gzip.1; utility have been fixed.
      These may allow a local user to modify permissions
      of arbitrary files and overwrite arbitrary local
      files when uncompressing a file.
      For more information, see security advisory

      </para>

    <para>A bug has been fixed in &man.ipfw.4; that could cause
      packets to be matched incorrectly against a lookup table.  This
      bug only affects SMP machines or UP machines that have the
      <literal>PREEMPTION</literal> kernel option enabled.  More
      information is contained in security advisory

      </para>

    <para>Two problems in &os;'s TCP stack have been fixed.  They

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"
	    ><quote>Using <command>make world</command></quote></ulink>
	  section of the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
	    >FreeBSD Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"
      ><quote>-CURRENT vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the
    <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/"
      >FreeBSD Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
