  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para/>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="amd64">The maximum amount of memory the &os; kernel
      can address has been increased from 1TB to 4TB.</para>

    <para>A new &man.cpuset.2; API has been added
      for thread to CPU binding and CPU resource grouping and
      assignment.  The &man.cpuset.1; userland utility has been added
      to allow manipulation of processor sets.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an output capture
      facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can now be captured
      to a memory buffer for later inspection using &man.sysctl.8; or
      a textdump.  The new <command>capture</command> command controls
      this feature.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple scripting
      facility, which supports a set of named scripts consisting of a
      set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can be managed from
      within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new &man.ddb.8;
      utility.  More details can be found in the &man.ddb.4; manual
      page.</para>

    <para role="merged">The kernel now supports a new textdump format of kernel
      dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information via
      mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather than a
      simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to generate brief
      kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging information, but
      are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or precisely
      synchronized source code.  More information can be found in the
      &man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>Kernel support for M:N threading has been removed.  While
      the KSE (Kernel Scheduled Entities) project was quite successful
      in bringing threading to FreeBSD, the M:N approach taken by the
      KSE library was never developed to its full potential.
      Backwards compatibility for applications using KSE threading
      will be provided via &man.libmap.conf.5; for dynamically linked
      binaries.  The &os; Project greatly appreciates the work of
      &a.julian;, &a.deischen;, and &a.davidxu; on KSE support.</para>

    <para>The &os; kernel now exports information about certain kernel
      features via the <varname>kern.features</varname> sysctl tree.
      The &man.feature.present.3; library call provides a convenient
      interface for user applications to test the presence of
      features.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel now has support for large
      memory page mappings (<quote>superpages</quote>).</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64,powerpc" role="merged">The ULE
      scheduler is now the default process scheduler
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernels.</para>

    <sect3 xml:id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">The BTX kernel used by the boot
	loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">A new gptboot boot loader has
        been added to support booting from a GPT labeled disk.  A
        new <command>boot</command> command has been added to
        &man.gpt.8;, which makes a GPT disk bootable by writing the
        required bits of the boot loader, creating a new boot
        partition if required.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para role="merged">The &man.cmx.4; driver, a driver for Omnikey CardMan 4040
        PCMCIA smartcard readers, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.syscons.4; driver now supports Colemak keyboard layout.</para>

      <para role="merged">The &man.uslcom.4; driver, a driver for Silicon
        Laboratories CP2101/CP2102-based USB serial adapters, has been
        imported from OpenBSD.</para>

      <sect4 xml:id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

        <para>Support for version 2.0 of the USB Audio reference design
          has been added. New devices should support higher bandwidth,
          increased sampling frequency and wider dynamic range.</para>

      </sect4>

      <sect4 xml:id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	  for Atheros AR8121/AR8113/AR8114 Gigabit/Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	<para>The &man.em.4; driver has been split into two drivers
	  with some common parts.  The &man.em.4; driver will continue
	  to support adapters up to the 82575, as well as new
	  client/desktop adapters.  A new &man.igb.4; driver
	  will support new server adapters.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 xml:id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>&man.carp.4; has been rewritten to make addresses
        more sane from the viewpoint of routing daemons such as
        quagga/zebra. It also brings support for a single redundant
        address on the subnet (carpdev), switching state with
        ifconfig, better locking and using modern kernel
        interfaces to allocate multicast memberships.</para>

      <para>The &man.pf.4; firewall now supports fine-grain locking
        and better utilization on multi-cpu machines resulting in
        significant improvements in performance.</para>

      <para>Support for up to 65536 routing tables has been
        introduced.</para>

      <para>Support for setting/matching differentiated services

      <para role="merged">The &man.aac.4; driver now supports volumes larger than
        2TB in size.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a spindown command for
        disks; after a configurable amount of time, if no requests
        have been received for a disk, the disk will be spun down
        until the next request.  The &man.atacontrol.8; utility now
        supports a <command>spindown</command> command to configure
        this feature.</para>

      <para role="merged">The &man.hptrr.4; driver has been updated to version 1.2
        from Highpoint.</para>

      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>A new kernel-based iSCSI target and initiator has been
        added</para>

      <para>UFS filesystems can now be enlarged with &man.growfs.8; while
        mounted read-write. This is especially useful for virtual
        machines, allowing the addition of more harddrive space without
        interruption of service.</para>

      <para>A state of the art FUSE implementation is now part of the
        base system. It allows the use of nearly all fusefs file
        systems</para>

      <para>Support for the high performance LZ4 compression algorithm
        has been added to ZFS. LZ4 is usually faster and can achieve a
        higher compression ratio than LZJB, the default compression
        algorithm</para>

      <para>Support for L2ARC compression has been added to ZFS.</para>

      <para>ZFS will now compare the checksums of incoming writes to
        the checksum of the existing on-disk data and avoid issuing any
        write I/O for data that has not changed. This will reduce I/O
        as well as space usage because if the old block is referenced
        by a snapshot, both copies of the block are kept even though
        both contain the same data.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para role="merged">BIND has been replaced by &man.unbound.8; for
      local dns resolution in the base system.  With this change, nslookup
      and dig are no longer a part of the base system.  Users should
      instead use &man.host.1; and &man.drill.1; Alternatively,
      nslookup and dig can be obtained by installing the
      dns/bind-tools port.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.adduser.8; utility now supports
      a <option>-M</option> option to set the mode of a new user's
      home directory.</para>

      replaced their GNU counterparts.</para>

    <para role="merged">&man.chflags.1; now supports a <option>-v</option> flag for
      verbose output and a <option>-f</option> flag to ignore errors
      with the same semantics as (for example)
      &man.chmod.1;.</para>

    <para>For compatibility with other implementations, &man.cp.1; now
      supports a <option>-a</option> flag, which is equivalent to
      specifying the <option>-RrP</option> flags.</para>

    <para>BSD-licensed version of &man.cpio.1; based on
      <filename>libarchive</filename>, has replaced the GNU cpio.
      Note that the GNU cpio is still installed as
      <filename>gcpio</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.env.1; program now supports <option>-u
      <replaceable>name</replaceable></option>
      which will completely unset the given variable
      <replaceable>name</replaceable> by removing it from the environment,
      instead of just setting it to a null value.</para>

    <para>The &man.fdopendir.3; library function has been added.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.fetch.3; library now support HTTP 1.1
      If-Modified-Since behavior.  The &man.fetch.1; program now

      disable the use of TCP options.</para>

    <para>&man.nc.1;'s <option>-o</option> switch has been deprecated.
      It will be removed in a future release.</para>

    <para>The &man.ping6.8; utility now returns <literal>2</literal>
      when the packet transmission was successful but no responses
      were received (this is the same behavior as &man.ping.8;).
      It returned a non-zero value before this change.</para>

    <para>The &man.procstat.1; utility has been added to display
      detailed information about processes.</para>

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para arch="amd64,i386">Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE,
    binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the
    various security branches) are supported using the
    &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure will
    update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC or
    SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os; release.
    The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the host being
    upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

  <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
    base system from source code) from previous versions are
    supported, according to the instructions in
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
