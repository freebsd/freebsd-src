    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
      deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
      upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

    <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to
      which these release notes apply represents the latest point
      along the &release.branch; development branch since
      &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built,
      binary &release.type; distributions along this branch can be
      found at <uri
	xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri>.</para>

    <para releasetype="snapshot">The &release.type; distribution to
      which these release notes apply represents a point along the
      &release.branch; development branch between &release.prev; and
      the future &release.next;.  Information regarding pre-built,
      binary &release.type; distributions along this branch can be

    <para releasetype="release">This distribution of &os;
      &release.current; is a &release.type; distribution.  It can be
      found at <uri xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri> or
      any of its mirrors.  More information on obtaining this (or
      other) &release.type; distributions of &os; can be found in the

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata
      before installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
      to documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <para>This document describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <title>Upgrading from Previous Releases of &os;</title>

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions
      (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported
      using the &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade
      procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as
      unmodified <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel distributed as
      a part of an official &os; release.  The &man.freebsd-update.8;
      utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet
      connectivity.</para>

    <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
      base system from source code) from previous versions are
      supported, according to the instructions in
