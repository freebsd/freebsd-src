      <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
      deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
      upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is
      a &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <uri
	xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri> or any of its
      mirrors.  More information on obtaining this (or other)
      &release.type; distributions of &os; can be found in the <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
	  &os;</quote> appendix</link> to the <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
	Handbook</link>.</para>

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata
      before installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
      to documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

	Procedure</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions
	(and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported

	distributed as a part of an official &os; release.  The
