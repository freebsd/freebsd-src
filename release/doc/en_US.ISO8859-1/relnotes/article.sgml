  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink

    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

<sect1 id="new">
  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>A new &man.cpuset.2; API has been added
      for thread to CPU binding and CPU resource grouping and
      assignment.  The &man.cpuset.1; userland utility has been added
      to allow manipulation of processor sets.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an output capture
      facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can now be captured
      to a memory buffer for later inspection using &man.sysctl.8; or
      a textdump.  The new <command>capture</command> command controls
      this feature.</para>

    <para role="merged">The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple scripting
      facility, which supports a set of named scripts consisting of a
      set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can be managed from
      within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new &man.ddb.8;
      utility.  More details can be found in the &man.ddb.4; manual
      page.</para>

    <para role="merged">The kernel now supports a new textdump format of kernel
      dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information via
      mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather than a
      simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to generate brief
      kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging information, but
      are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or precisely
      synchronized source code.  More information can be found in the
      &man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>Kernel support for M:N threading has been removed.  While
      the KSE (Kernel Scheduled Entities) project was quite successful
      in bringing threading to FreeBSD, the M:N approach taken by the
      kse library was never developed to its full potential.
      Backwards compatibility for applications using KSE threading
      will be provided via &man.libmap.conf.5; for dynamically linked
      binaries.  The &os; Project greatly appreciates the work of
      &a.julian;, &a.deischen;, and &a.davidxu; on KSE support.</para>

    <para>The &os; kernel now exports information about certain kernel
      features via the <varname>kern.features</varname> sysctl tree.
      The &man.feature.present.3; library call provides a convenient
      interface for user applications to test the presence of
      features.</para>

    <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel now has support for large
      memory page mappings (<quote>superpages</quote>).</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64,powerpc" role="merged">The ULE
      scheduler is now the default process scheduler
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernels.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">The BTX kernel used by the boot
	loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" role="merged">A new gptboot boot loader has
        been added to support booting from a GPT labeled disk.  A
        new <command>boot</command> command has been added to
        &man.gpt.8;, which makes a GPT disk bootable by writing the
        required bits of the boot loader, creating a new boot
        partition if required.</para>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para role="merged">The &man.cmx.4; driver, a driver for Omnikey CardMan 4040
        PCMCIA smartcard readers, has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.em.4; driver has been split into two drivers
	  with some common parts.  The &man.em.4; driver will continue
	  to support adapters up to the 82575, as well as new
	  client/desktop adapters.  A new igb driver
	  will support new server adapters.</para>

	<para>The &man.jme.4; driver has been added to provide support
	  for PCIe network adapters based on JMicron JMC250 Gigabit
	  Ethernet and JMC260 Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	<para>The &man.malo.4; driver has been added to provide
	  support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335 based PCI network

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The &man.bpf.4; packet filter and capture facility now
        supports a zero-copy mode of operation, in which buffers are
        loaned from a user process to the kernel.  This feature can
        be enabled by setting
        the <varname>net.bpf.zerocopy_enable</varname> sysctl
        variable to <literal>1</literal>.</para>

      <para>ISDN4BSD(I4B), <filename>netatm</filename>, and all
        related subsystems have been removed due to lack of
        multi-processor support.</para>

        2TB in size.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a spindown command for
        disks; after a configurable amount of time, if no requests
        have been received for a disk, the disk will be spun down
        until the next request.  The &man.atacontrol.8; utility now
        supports a <command>spindown</command> command to configure
        this feature.</para>

        been fixed.</para>

      <para>A new kernel-mode NFS lock manager has been added,
        improving performance and behavior of NFS locking.  A new
        &man.clear.locks.8; command has been added to clear locks held
        on behalf of an NFS client.</para>

  <sect2 id="userland">

      home directory.</para>

    <para>BSD-licensed versions of &man.ar.1; and &man.ranlib.1;,

    <para>For compatiblity with other implementations, &man.cp.1; now
      supports a <option>-a</option> flag, which is equivalent to

    <para>BSD-licensed version of &man.cpio.1; based on

      Note that the GNU cpio is still installed as
      <filename>gcpio</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.env.1; program now supports <option>-u
      <replaceable>name</replaceable></option>

      provide per-CPU usage statistics.</para>

    <para>&man.traceroute.8; now has the ability to print the AS
      number for each hop with the new <option>-a</option> switch; a
