    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It
      describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
      It also provides some notes on upgrading
      from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

    <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
      apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
      branch since &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
      &release.type; distributions along this branch
      can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
      &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
      url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
      information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
      distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
      installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
      documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="kernel">
      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para>The &man.ddb.8; kernel debugger now supports a
	<command>show mount</command> subcommand.</para>

      <para>The &os; DTrace subsystem now supports a probe for
	process execution.</para>

      <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel virtual address space has
	been increased to 6GB.  This allows subsystems to use larger
	virtual memory space than before.  For example, &man.zfs.8;
	adaptive replacement cache (ARC) requires large kernel memory
	space to cache file system data, so it benefits from the
	increased address space.  Note that the ceiling on the kernel
	map size is now 60% of the size rather than an absolute
	quantity.</para>

      <para>The &man.jail.8; subsystem has been updated.  Changes include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Multiple addresses of both IPv4 and IPv6 per jail has
	    been supported.  It is even possible to have jails without
	    an IP address at all, which basically gives one a chrooted
	    environment with restricted process view and no
	    networking.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>SCTP (&man.sctp.4;) with IPv6 in jails has been
	    implemented.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Specific CPU binding by using &man.cpuset.1; has been
	    implemented.  Note that the current implementation allows
	    the superuser inside of the jail to change the CPU
	    bindings specified.  This behavior will be fixed in the
	    next release.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A &man.jail.8; can start with a specific route
	    FIB now.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <literal>show jails</literal> subcommand in
	    &man.ddb.8; has been added.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Compatibility support which permits 32-bit jail
	    binaries to be used on 64-bit systems to manage jails has
	    been added.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Note that both version numbers of
	    <literal>jail</literal> and <literal>prison</literal> in
	    the &man.jail.8; have been updated for the new
	    features.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The &man.kld.4; now supports installing 32-bit system
	calls to the &os; system call translation layer from kernel
	modules.</para>

      <para>The &man.ktr.4; now supports a new KTR tracepoint in the
	<literal>KTR_CALLOUT</literal> class to note when a callout
	routine finishes executing.</para>

      <para>Types of variables used to track the amount of allocated
	System V shared memory have been changed from
	<literal>int</literal> to <literal>size_t</literal>.  This
	makes it possible to use more than 2 GB of memory for shared
	memory segments on 64-bit architectures.  Please note the new
	BUGS section in &man.shmctl.2; and
	<filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> for limitations of this
	temporary solution.</para>

      <para>The &man.sysctl.3; leaf nodes have a flag to tag
	themselves as MPSAFE now.</para>

      <para>The &os; 32-bit system call translation layer now
	supports installing 32-bit system calls for
	<literal>VFS_AIO</literal>.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">The &os; virtual memory subsystem now
	supports fully transparent use of
	<application>superpages</application> for application memory;
	application memory pages are dynamically promoted to or
	demoted from superpages without any modification to
	application code.  This change offers the benefit of large
	page sizes such as improved virtual memory efficiency and
	reduced TLB (translation lookaside buffer) misses without
	downsides like application changes and virtual memory
	inflexibility.  This is disabled by default and can be enabled
	by setting a loader tunable
	<varname>vm.pmap.pg_ps_enabled</varname> to
	<literal>1</literal>.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para>The &man.boot.8; now supports 4-byte volume ID that
	  certain versions of &windows; put into the MBR and invoking
	  PXE by pressing F6 key on some supported BIOSes.</para>

	<para arch="i386">The &man.boot.8; BTX loader has been
	  improved.  This fixes several boot issues on recent machines
	  reported for 7.1-RELEASE and before.</para>

	<para>The &man.loader.8; is now able to obtain DHCP options
	  from network boot via &man.kenv.2; variables.</para>

	<para>A bug in the &man.loader.8; has been fixed.  Now the
	  following line works as expected:</para>

	<programlisting>loader_conf_files="<replaceable>foo</replaceable> <replaceable>bar</replaceable> ${<replaceable>variable</replaceable>}"</programlisting>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="proc">
	<title>Hardware Support</title>

	<para arch="sparc64">The &os; now supports Ultra SPARC III
	  (Cheetah) processor family.</para>

	<para>The &man.acpi.4; subsystem now supports a &man.sysctl.8;
	  variable <varname>debug.batt.batt_sleep_ms</varname>.  On
	  some laptops with smart batteries, enabling battery
	  monitoring software causes keystrokes from &man.atkbd.4; to
	  be lost.  This sysctl variable adds a delay in millisecond
	  to the status checking code as a workaround.</para>

	<para>The &man.acpi.asus.4; driver now supports Asus A8Sr
	  notebooks.</para>

	<para arch="powerpc">Support for the AltiVec, a floating point
	  and integer SIMD instruction set has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpuctl.4; driver, which provides a special
	  device <filename>/dev/cpuctl</filename> as an interface to
	  the system CPU has been added.  The &man.cpuctl.4;
	  functionality includes the ability to retrieve CPUID
	  information, read/write machine specific registers (MSR),
	  and perform CPU firmware updates.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpufreq.4; driver now supports an
	  <varname>hw.est.msr_info</varname> loader tunable.  When
	  this is set to <literal>1</literal>, it attempts to build a
	  simple list containing just the high and low frequencies if
	  it cannot obtain a frequency list from either ACPI or the
	  static tables.  This is disabled by default.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">CPU frequency change notifiers are now
	  disabled when the TSC is P-state invariant.  Also, a new
	  loader tunable
	  <varname>kern.timecounter.invariant_tsc</varname> has been
	  added to force this behavior by setting it to
	  non-zero.</para>

	<para>The &man.atkbd.4; driver now disables the interrupt
	  handler which is called from the keyboard callback function
	  when polled mode is enabled.  This fixes the problem of
	  duplicated/missing characters at the mountroot prompt on
	  multi CPU systems while &man.kbdmux.4; is enabled.</para>

	<para>In the &man.pci.4; subsystem INTx is now disabled when
	  MSI/MSIX is enabled.  This change fixes interrupt storm
	  related issues.</para>

	<para arch="sparc64">The schizo(4) driver for Schizo
	  Fireplane/Safari to PCI 2.1 and Tomatillo JBus to PCI 2.2
	  bridges has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.u3g.4; driver for USB based 3G cards and
	  dongles including Vodafone Mobile Connect Card 3G, Qualcomm
	  CDMA MSM, Huawei E220, Novatel U740, Sierra MC875U, and so
	  on has been added.  This provides support for the multiple
	  USB-to-serial interfaces exposed by many 3G USB/PC Card
	  modems, and the device is accessed through the &man.ucom.4;
	  driver which makes it behave like a &man.tty.4;.</para>

	<para>The &man.sched.ule.4; scheduler now supports a loader
	  tunable <varname>machdep.hyperthreading_enabled</varname> as
	  the &man.sched.4bsd.4; does.  Note that it cannot be
	  modified at run-time.</para>

	<sect4 id="mm">
	  <title>Multimedia Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.agp.4; driver now supports Intel G4X series
	    graphics chipsets.</para>

	  <para>The DRM, a kernel module named Direct Rendering
	    Manager that gives direct hardware access to DRI clients,
	    has been updated.  Support for AMD/ATI r500, r600, r700,
	    and IGP based chips, XGI V3XE/V5/V8, and Intel i915
	    chipsets has been improved.</para>

	  <para>A new loader tunable <varname>hw.drm.msi</varname> has
	    been added to control if DRM uses MSI or not.  This is set
	    to <literal>1</literal> (enabled) by default.</para>

	  <para>The snd_au88x0(4) driver for Aureal Vortex
	    1/2/Advantage PCI has been removed because this was
	    broken for a long time.</para>

	  <para>The &man.snd.hda.4; driver has been updated.  This
	    changes include support for multiple codec per HDA bus,
	    multiple functional groups per codec, multiple audio
	    devices per functional group, digital (SPDIF/HDMI) audio
	    input/output, suspend/resume, and part of multichannel
	    audio.</para>

	  <para>Note that due to added HDMI audio and logical audio
	    devices support, the updated driver often provides several
	    PCM devices.  This means that in some cases the system
	    default audio device no longer corresponds to the users's
	    habitual audio connectors.  In such cases the default
	    device can be specified in audio applications' setup or
	    defined globally via <varname>hw.snd.default_unit
	    sysctl</varname>, as described in the &man.sound.4; manual
	    page.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="net-if">
	  <title>Network Interface Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.ae.4; driver now supports WoL
	    (Wake on LAN).</para>

	  <para arch="amd64,i386">The &man.ale.4; driver is now
	    included in the <filename>GENERIC</filename>

	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>A bug in the &man.igb.4; driver, which prevents the
	    loader tunable <varname>hw.igb.ave_latency</varname> from

	<para>The &man.glabel.8; GEOM class now supports a new
	  UFS-based label called <literal>ufsid</literal> that can be
	  used to reference UFS-carrying devices by the unique file
	  system ID.  This file system ID is automatically generated
	  and detected when the &man.glabel.8; GEOM class is enabled.  An
	  example of this new label is:
	  <filename>/dev/ufsid/48e69c8b5c8e1b43</filename>.  The
	  benefit of using GEOM labels in general is to avoid problems
	  of device renaming when shifting drives or

	fragment numbers rather than the cg-relative numbers printed
	in the default mode.</para>

      <para>If <option>-f</option> is passed once, contiguous fragment
