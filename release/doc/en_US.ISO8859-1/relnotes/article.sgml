  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>&man.acpi.4; now has support for the HPET time counter.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.acpi.ibm.4; driver now supports setting the fan control
      mode to manual or automatic, and adjusting the fan speed if the
      fan control mode is manual.  To enable manual control of the fan speed,
      the sysctl variable <varname>dev.acpi_ibm.<replaceable>0</replaceable>.fan</varname>
      needs to be set to zero (manual).  This should only be used with
      extreme precaution, as disabling automatic fan control might
      overheat the hardware and lead to permanent damage.</para>

    <para>The &man.apm.4; suspend/resume support has been improved.</para>

    <para>Security event auditing is now supported in the &os; kernel,
      and is enabled by the <literal>AUDIT</literal> kernel
      configuration option.  The option is enabled in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  More information can be found
      in the &man.audit.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>Support for the Camellia block cipher has been added to the
      &os; kernel.  It can now be specified as a cipher in IPsec.  More
      information on Camellia can be found in RFC 4132.</para>

    <para>The <literal>options COMPAT_43</literal> kernel
      configuration option has been deemed unnecessary and has been
      removed from <filename>GENERIC</filename> and related kernel
      configurations.  This change may result in a small performance
      increase for some workloads.</para>

    <para>The dumb console driver (&man.dcons.4;) is now enabled in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now provides the <literal>show lock</literal>
      command.  If the argument has a valid lock class,
      this displays various information about the lock and calls a
      new function pointer in lock_class (lc_ddb_show) to dump class-specific
      information about the lock as well (such as the owner of a mutex or
      xlock'ed sx lock).  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now provides the <literal>show sleepq</literal>
      command.  This takes a wait channel as an argument and looks
      for a sleep queue associated with that wait channel.</para>

    <para><filename>DEFAULTS</filename> kernel configuration files
      for each platform have been added.  These files contain
      directives that are implicitly included in all kernel
      configurations, and generally include basic, mandatory
      functionality for each platform.  &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in file descriptor handling such that a simple
      <literal>close(0); dup(fd)</literal> sequence does not return
      descriptor <literal>0</literal> in some cases, has been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.firmware.9; subsystem has been added.  This
      subsystem provides a mechanism
      to load binary data into the kernel via a specially crafted module.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.gdb.1; remote debugging interface now supports
      copying console messages to a remote debugger instance.
      To enable this, set <literal>debug.gdbcons="1"</literal>
      in <filename>loader.conf</filename>, enter <literal>boot -d;
	gdb; step</literal> from the loader prompt,
      then attach &man.gdb.1; from a remote machine.
      The sysctl variable <varname>debug.gdbcons</varname> can be
      used to turn on/off this functionality.</para>

    <para>&man.hwpmc.4; and &man.pmcstat.8; now support profiling
      of dynamically loaded kernel modules and
      shared objects loaded with &man.dlopen.3;.</para>

    <para>A new <varname>kern.hostuuid</varname> sysctl variable
      has been added to hold a host's Universally Unique Identifier
      (UUID).  This UUID is computed or generated by a new
      <filename>rc.d/hostid</filename> startup script and, where
      possible, is saved to disk to be persistent across reboots.</para>

    <para>The <option>INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE</option> kernel configuration
      option has been improved.  The full configuration of a running kernel
      can now be obtained via <command>sysctl -b kern.conftxt</command>.
      It can also be extracted from a kernel file via
      <command>config -x kernelfile</command>.  To preserve the literal
      kernel configuration with all the comments included, the
      <option>-C</option> option of &man.config.8; can be used.</para>

    <para>Support for Kernel Scheduled Entities (KSE) is now a kernel
      option (previously it was a mandatory feature in the kernel).
      It is enabled in the GENERIC kernel (thus there is no change in
      functionality) for all platforms except &arch.sun4v;.</para>

    <para>The Linux ABI support was enhanced to support emulation of
      Linux 2.6.16.  This is not enabled by default.  To turn it on
      the <varname>compat.linux.osrelease</varname> sysctl variable
      has to be set to <literal>2.6.16</literal>.  Note that this
      support is still experimental.</para>

    <para>Support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) and Extended
      Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI-X) has been added to the kernel's
      PCI support code.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.priv.9; kernel interface has been added.  Its purpose
      is checking the availability of privilege for threads and credentials.
      Unlike the existing &man.suser.9; interface, &man.priv.9; exposes a
      named privilege identifier to the privilege checking code, allowing
      more complex policies regarding the granting of privilege to be
      expressed.</para>

    <para>The &man.random.4; entropy device driver is now MPSAFE.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>&os; now supports concurrent &man.read.2;/&man.readv.2;
      access to a file.</para>

    <para>The kernel's &man.sx.9; locks have been optimized to use
      simple atomic operations for the common cases of obtaining and 
      releasing shared and exclusive locks.  While this change is not
      generally user-visible, it is the basis for some substantial
      performance improvements.</para>

    <para>The ULE process scheduler has been revised to improve its
      behavior, in particular interactivity under load.  This
      implementation can commonly be referred to as <quote>ULE
      2.0</quote>.</para>

    <para>The <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> signal queuing has been
      added.  For each child process whose status has been changed,
      a <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> instance is queued.  If the signal is still pending,
      and the process changed status several times, the signal information
      is updated to reflect the latest process status.
      There is a loader tunable <varname>kern.sigqueue.queue_sigchild</varname>
      which can control the behavior, setting it to zero disables the
      <literal>SIGCHLD</literal> queuing feature.</para>

    <para>[&arch.amd64;, &arch.i386;] Instead of including all of physical
      memory in a kernel crash dump, the kernel now defaults to dumping only pages that are
      actively mapped into kernel virtual memory.  A new
      <varname>debug.minidump</varname> sysctl variable
      can be used to turn off this behavior when set to zero. &merged;</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.malloc_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows exporting of kernel malloc
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>kern.forcesigexit</varname>
      has been added.  This forces a process
      to sigexit if a trap signal is being held by the current thread or
      ignored by the current process.  It is enabled by default.</para>

    <para>The pcvt(4) driver, an alternative to &man.syscons.4;,
      has been removed, as it had fallen out of sync with the rest
      of the kernel.</para>

    <para>RedZone, a buffer corruption protection for the kernel &man.malloc.9;
      facility has been implemented.  This detects both buffer underflows and
      overflows at runtime on &man.free.9; and &man.realloc.9;,
      and prints backtraces from where memory was allocated and from where
      it was freed.  For more details, see the &man.redzone.9; manual page.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>security.mac.biba.interfaces_equal</varname>
      which makes all network interfaces be created with the label
      <literal>biba/equal(equal-equal)</literal>, has been added.
      This is useful where programs such as &man.dhclient.8; and &man.ppp.8;.
      which initialize network interfaces do not have any labeling support.
      This variable is set as <literal>0</literal> (disabled) by default.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A new loader tunable <varname>vm.kmem_size_min</varname> has been
      added.  This allows to specify a minimal size for
      <varname>vm.kmem_size</varname>.</para>

    <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>vm.zone_stats</varname>
      has been added.  This allows to export &man.uma.9; allocator
      statistics via a binary structure stream.</para>

    <para>The sysctl variable <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate</varname>
      has been split into two sysctl variables
      <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_nodriver</varname>
      and <varname>hw.pci.do_powerstate_resume</varname>.
      Also, these variables have been changed from a boolean to a range.
      <literal>0</literal> means no power management,
      <literal>1</literal> means conservative power management which
      any device class that has caused problems is added to the watch list,
      <literal>2</literal> means aggressive power management where

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; firewall system now supports
	a <literal>tablearg</literal> feature, which allows
	values obtained from a table lookup to be used as part of a
	rule.  	&merged;
	This feature can be used to optimize some rulesets
	or to implement policy-based routing inside a firewall.
	For example, the following rules will throw different
	packets to different pipes:</para>

      <programlisting>pipe 1000 config bw 1000Kbyte/s
pipe 4000 config bw 4000Kbyte/s
table 1 add x.x.x.x 1000
table 1 add x.x.x.y 4000
pipe tablearg ip from table(1) to any</programlisting>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; packet filter now supports
	<literal>tag</literal> and <literal>untag</literal> rule keywords.
	When a packet matches a rule with the <literal>tag</literal>
	keyword, the numeric tag for the given number in the range
	from 0 to 65535 will be attached to the packet.
	The tag acts as an internal marker (it is not sent out over
	the wire) that can be used to identify these packets later on,
	for example, by using <literal>tagged</literal>
	rule option.  For more details, see &man.ipfw.8;. &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; packet filter now supports filtering on
	Routing Header Type 0 and Mobile IPv6 Routing Header Type 2
	in addition to filtering on the non-differentiated presence
	of any Routing Header.</para>

      <para>The <literal>IPFIREWALL_FORWARD_EXTENDED</literal> kernel
	option has been removed.  This option was used to permit
	&man.ipfw.4; to redirect packets with local destinations.
	This behavior is now always enabled when
	the <literal>IPFIREWALL_FORWARD</literal> kernel option is
	enabled. &merged;</para>

      <para>The ip6fw(8) packet filter has been removed.  Since &man.ipfw.4; has gained
        IPv6 support, it should be used instead.  Please note that some rules might need

      <para>Support for tunneling IPX over IP has been removed.</para>

      <para>The &man.lagg.4; driver, ported from OpenBSD and NetBSD,

      <para>A bug has been fixed in which NFS over TCP would not reconnect
	when the server sent a FIN.  This problem had occurred
	with Solaris NFS servers.  &merged;</para>

      <para>The default retransmit timer for NFS over TCP is now 60 seconds.
	This change prevents the unnecessary retransmission of
	non-idempotent NFS requests.  The <varname>nfs_access_cache</varname>
	variable in &man.rc.conf.5; has also been changed to 60.</para>

      <para>The default minimum number of nfsiod kernel threads
	(&man.sysctl.8; variable <varname>vfs.nfs.iodmin</varname>)

	can be used with IPv6 now. &merged;</para>

      <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>net.inet.icmp.reply_from_interface</varname>
	has been added.  This allows the &man.icmp.4;
	reply to non-local packets to be generated with
	the IP address the packet came through in.
	This is useful for routers to show in &man.traceroute.8;
	the actual path a packet has taken instead of
	the possibly different return path.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl variable <varname>net.inet.icmp.quotelen</varname>
	has been added.  This allows to change length of
	the quotation of the original packet in an ICMP reply.
	The minimum of 8 bytes is internally enforced.
	The maximum quotation is the remaining space in the
	reply mbuf.  This option is added in response to the
	issues raised in I-D
	<filename>draft-gont-icmp-payload-00.txt</filename>.</para>

      <para>The &man.icmp.4; now always quotes the entire TCP header
	when responding and allocate an mbuf cluster if needed.
	This change fixes the TCP issues raised in I-D
	<filename>draft-gont-icmp-payload-00.txt</filename>.</para>

      <para>A new socket option <literal>IP_MINTTL</literal> has been added.
	This may be used to set the minimum acceptable
	TTL a packet must have when received on a socket.
	All packets with a lower TTL are silently dropped.
	This works on already connected/connecting and
	listening sockets for RAW, UDP, and TCP.  This option
	is only really useful when set to <literal>255</literal>, preventing packets
	from outside the directly connected networks reaching
	local listeners on sockets.  Also, this option allows
	userland implementation of <quote>The Generalized TTL

	Multicast (SSM) socket API.  More details can be found in
	the &man.sourcefilter.3; manual page.</para>

      <para>Support has been added for the Stream Control Transmission
	Protocol (SCTP).  SCTP implements a reliable, message-oriented
	transport protocol, and is defined in RFC 3268.  It is enabled
	in &os; with the <literal>SCTP</literal> kernel option and is
	part of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  More

      <para>The <literal>TCP_DROP_SYNFIN</literal> kernel option is now
	included in the kernel by default.  The
	<varname>net.inet.tcp.drop_synfin</varname> sysctl variable still
	defaults to <literal>0</literal>.</para>

      <para>The TCP bandwidth-delay product limiting feature has
	been disabled when the RTT is below a certain threshold.
	This optimization does not make sense on a LAN, as it has
	trouble figuring out the maximal bandwidth due to the coarse
	tick granularity.  A new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet.tcp.inflight.rttthresh</varname> specifies
	the threshold in milliseconds below which this feature
	will disengage.  It defaults to 10ms.  &merged;</para>

      <para>The &os; network stack now has support for TCP
	Segmentation Offload (TSO).  TSO reduces the overhead of
	sending bulk TCP data by allowing a network interface to
	convert a large data transfer into multiple TCP segments to be
	sent on the network.  This functionality can be enabled or
	disabled on a per-interface basis with
	the <literal>tso</literal> and <literal>-tso</literal> flags
	to &man.ifconfig.8;.  Network interfaces and drivers
	supporting TSO currently include &man.em.4;,
	&man.mxge.4; and &man.cxgb.4;.</para>

      <para>&os; now supports auto-sizing of TCP socket buffers.  This
	allows the socket buffer sizes to adapt dynamically to network
	conditions, rather than being set statically.  The behavior of
	this feature can be controlled using
	the <varname>net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_*</varname>
	and <varname>net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_*</varname> sysctl
	variables.</para>

      <para>The <varname>net.link.tap.up_on_open</varname> sysctl variable

    <para>The &man.libmemstat.3; library has been added.
      This is for use by debugging and monitoring applications
      in tracking kernel memory statistics.  It provides an
      abstracted interface to &man.uma.9; and &man.malloc.9;
      statistics, wrapped around the binary stream sysctl variables
      for the allocators. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.ln.1; utility now supports

      time for sorting. &merged;</para>

    <para>A new &man.malloc.3; implementation has been introduced.
      This implementation, sometimes referred to
      as <quote>jemalloc</quote>, was designed to improve the
      performance of multi-threaded programs, particularly on SMP
      systems, while preserving the performance of single-threaded
      programs.  Due to the use of different algorithms and data
      structures, jemalloc may expose some previously-unknown bugs in
      userland code, although most of the &os; base system and common
      ports have been tested and/or fixed.  Note that jemalloc uses
      &man.mmap.2; to obtain memory and only uses &man.sbrk.2; under
      limited circumstances (and then only for 32-bit architectures).
      As a result, the <literal>datasize</literal> resource limit
      has little practical effect for typical applications.  The
      <literal>vmemoryuse</literal> resource limit, however, can be
      used to bound the total virtual memory used by a process, as
      described in &man.limits.1;.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdconfig.8; utility now supports producing
      device listings formatted as XML.  Currently, the

      by comma character.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdmfs.8; utility now supports a <option>-P</option> flag
      to allow skipping the &man.newfs.8; process
      when using a vnode-backed disk.</para>

    <para>The &man.mdmfs.8; utility now supports a <option>-E</option> flag
      to allow to specify location of the &man.mdconfig.8;
      utility instead of using the default one
      (<filename>/sbin/mdconfig</filename>).</para>

    <para>A new function &man.memmem.3; has been implemented in
      <filename>libc</filename>.  This is the binary equivalent to
      &man.strstr.3; and found in <filename>glibc</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.mergemaster.8; utility now supports
      an <option>-A</option> option to explicitly specify

      has been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.mount.8; utility now supports a
      <literal>late</literal> keyword in &man.fstab.5;, along with a
      corresponding <option>-l</option> command-line option to specify
      that these <quote>late</quote> file systems should be
      mounted. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.moused.8; daemon now supports an <option>-H</option> flag
      to enable horizontal virtual scrolling similar to the
      <option>-V</option> flag for vertical virtual scrolling.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>The mrouted(8) multicast routing daemon has been removed
      from the &os; base system.  It implements the DVMRP multicast
      routing protocol, which has largely been replaced by PIM in many
      multicast installations.  The related map-mbone(8) and mrinfo(8)
      utilities have also been removed.  These programs are now
      available in the &os; Ports Collection
      as <filename role="package">net/mrouted</filename>.</para>

    <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports an
      <option>-h</option> flag for interface stats mode,
      which prints all interface statistics in human readable form. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports
      printing &man.ipsec.4; protocol statistics if the
      kernel was compiled with <literal>FAST_IPSEC</literal>
      rather than the KAME IPSEC stack.
      Note that the output of <command>netstat -s -p ipsec</command>
      differs depending on which stack is compiled into
      the kernel since they each keep different statistics.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports printing
      &man.sctp.4; protocol statistics.</para>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file is now

    <para>The objformat(1) utility and getobjformat(3) library (the
      last remnants of a.out object file support) have been removed.</para>

    <para>The &man.pam.nologin.8; module no longer provides a
      an authentication function; instead it now provides an account
      management function.  Third-party files in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/pam.d</filename> may  
      need manual editing; specifically, lines in these files of
      the form:

      <screen>auth    required        pam_nologin.so  no_warn</screen></para>

    <para>These lines need to have the word <literal>auth</literal>
      replaced with the word <literal>account</literal>.</para>

    <para>The &man.periodic.8; daily script now supports
      display of the status of &man.gmirror.8;, &man.graid3.8;,
      &man.gstripe.8;, and &man.gconcat.8; devices.
      Note that these are disabled by default.  &merged;</para>

      This is useful for testing problematic channels, MTU issues
      or traffic policing functions in networks.  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.ping.8; command now supports a <option>-W</option>
      option to specify the maximum time to wait for an echo reply.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility now supports a
      <option>-F</option> option which allows to
      restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
      pidfile file.  When another new option <option>-L</option>
      is also specified, the pidfile file must be locked with the
      &man.flock.2; syscall or created with &man.pidfile.3;.</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility now supports a
      <option>-I</option> flag which works like <option>-i</option>
      of &man.rm.1;.  When this flag is specified, &man.pkill.1;
      will ask for confirmation before sending a signal to
      each matching process.</para>

    <para>The &man.pkill.1; utility (also known as &man.pgrep.1;) has
      been moved from <filename>/usr/bin</filename>
      to <filename>/bin</filename> so that it can be used by startup
      scripts.  Symbolic links from its former location have been
      created for backward compatibility. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.pmcstat.8; program has seen several enhancements:
      It can now log over a network socket to a remote host.  The
      <option>-c</option> now takes a comma-seperated list of CPUs
      to configure for PMC allocation.  The <option>-t</option> option
      has been enhanced to take a regular expression for selecting
      processes based on their command names.  &man.pmcstat.8; now
      allocates system PMCs on all CPUs by default, not just CPU 0.</para>

    <para>The &man.powerd.8; program now supports a
      <option>-P</option> option, which specifies a pidfile to use.</para>

    <para>An extensible implementation of &man.printf.3;, compatible
      with GLIBC, has been added to <filename>libc</filename>.  It is
      only used if the environment variable
      <varname>USE_XPRINTF</varname> is defined, one of the extension
      functions is called, or the global variable
      <varname>__use_xprintf</varname> is set to a value greater than
      <literal>0</literal>.  Five extensions are currently supported:
      <literal>%H</literal> (hex dump),
      <literal>%T</literal> (<varname>time_t</varname> and
      time-related structures),
      <literal>%M</literal> (errno message),

      LAN (LAN Access Using PPP), and SP (Serial Port).  &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.rpcbind.8; program can now bind its TCP listening
      socket to an IP address other than INADDR_ANY using the
      <option>-h</option> flag.  The new <option>-6</option> flag allows
      it to bind to IPv6 addresses only.</para>

    <para>The &man.rpcgen.1; utility now generates headers and stub files
      that can be used with ANSI C compilers by default.</para>

      <para>The <filename>geli</filename> and <filename>geli2</filename>

      <para>The <filename>ike</filename> script for

	is included in the base system.</para>

      <para>The <filename>hcsecd</filename> and

	These daemons can run even if no Bluetooth devices

	This is a replacement of the <filename>ramdisk</filename>
	script, and all of variables in <varname>ramdisk_*</varname>
	have been changed to <varname>mdconfig_*</varname>.
	Also, two new &man.rc.conf.5; variables
	<varname>mdconfig_<replaceable>*</replaceable>_files</varname>
	and
	<varname>mdconfig_<replaceable>*</replaceable>_cmd</varname>

      <para>The <filename>netif</filename> script now supports

      <para>The <filename>rcconf.sh</filename> script in <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename>
	has been removed and a variable <varname>early_late_divider</varname>,
	which designates the script to separate the early and late stages
	of the boot process, has been added.</para>

      <para>The <filename>rc.initdiskless</filename> script now uses &man.tar.1;
	instead of &man.pax.1; because &man.pax.1; needs a writable
	temporary directory that may not be available when this script
	runs.</para>

      <para>The <filename>pccard</filename> script has been removed

      <para>The <filename>sendmail</filename> script no longer rebuilds

	has been removed.</para>

      <para>A new keyword <literal>NOAUTO</literal> in
