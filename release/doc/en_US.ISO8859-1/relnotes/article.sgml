  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

  <para>Users who are new to the &release.branch; series of &os;
    &release.type;s should also read the <quote>Early Adopters Guide
    to &os; &release.current;</quote>.  This document can generally be
    found in the same location as the release notes (either as a part of a
    &os; distribution or on the &os; Web site).  It contains important
    information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using
    &os; &release.current;, as opposed to releases based on the &os;
    4-STABLE development branch.</para>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
<![ %include.historic; [
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.
      In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
      branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
]]>
<![ %no.include.historic; [
      many of the user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.  It includes items that are unique to the
      &release.branch; branch, as well as some features that may have been
      recently merged to
      other branches (after &os; &release.prev.historic;).  The latter
      items are marked as &merged;.
]]>
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in &man.mksnap.ffs.8; has been fixed; it caused the creation of a
      filesystem snapshot to reset the flags on the filesystem to
      their default values.  The possible consequences depended on local
      usage, but could include disabling extended access control lists
      or enabling the use of setuid executables stored on an untrusted
      filesystem.  This bug also affected the &man.dump.8;
      <option>-L</option> option, which uses &man.mksnap.ffs.8;.  Note
      that &man.mksnap.ffs.8; is normally only available to the
      superuser and members of the <groupname>operator</groupname>
      group.  For more information, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:01.mksnap_ffs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:01</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call) has been fixed.
      This bug can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A programming error in the &man.jail.attach.2; system call
      has been fixed.  This error could allow a process with superuser
      privileges inside a &man.jail.8; environment to change its root
      directory to that of a different jail, and thus gain full read
      and write access to files and directories within the target
      jail.  More information can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:03.jail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:03</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A potential low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against
      the &os; TCP stack has been prevented by limiting the number of
      out-of-sequence TCP segments that can be held at one time.  More
      details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in <application>OpenSSL</application>'s SSL/TLS
      ChangeCipherSpec message processing could result in
      a null pointer dereference, has been fixed.
      This could allow a remote attacker to crash an
      <application>OpenSSL</application>-using
      application and cause a denial-of-service on the system.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink

    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.acpi.toshiba.4; driver has been added
      to use Toshiba's Hardware Control Interface to manipulate
      certain hardware features on Toshiba laptops.</para>

    <para>The &man.acpi.video.4; driver has been added to provide
      control display switching and backlight brightness using the
      ACPI Video Extensions.</para>

    <para>&man.devfs.5; path rules now work correctly on
      directories.</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The dgb (DigiBoard intelligent serial card) driver has been
      removed due to breakage.  Its replacement is the &man.digi.4; driver,
      which supports all the hardware of the dgb driver.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The loran (Loran-C receiver) driver has been removed due to
      breakage and lack of maintainership.</para>

    <para>The raid(4), RAIDframe disk driver from NetBSD has been removed.
      This is currently non-functional, and would require some amount of work
      to make it work under the &man.geom.4; API in 5-CURRENT.</para>

    <para arch="alpha,amd64,i386">For the &man.uart.4; device
      <varname>hw.uart.console</varname> and
      <varname>hw.uart.dbgport</varname> environment variables
      have been added.  They can be used to select a serial console and
      debug port respectively, as well as the attributes.</para>

    <para>The &man.ubser.4; device driver has been added to support
      BWCT console management serial adapters.</para>

    <para>The ULE scheduler is now the default scheduler in the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  For the average user,
      interactivity is reported to be better in many cases.  This
      means less <quote>skipping</quote> and <quote>jerking</quote> in
      interactive applications while the machine is very busy.  This
      will not prevent problems due to overloaded disk subsystems, but
      it does help with overloaded CPUs.  On SMP machines, ULE has
      per-CPU run queues which allow for CPU affinity, CPU binding,
      and advanced HyperThreading support, as well as providing a
      framework for more optimizations in the future.  As fine-grained
      kernel locking continues, the scheduler will be able to make
      more efficient use of the available parallel resources.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>The device driver infrastructure (as well as many drivers)
      have been updated.  Among the changes: Many more drivers now use
      automatically-assigned major numbers (instead of the old static
      major numbers).  Enhanced functions to support cloning of
      pseudodevices.  Several changes to the driver API, including a
      new <varname>d_version</varname> field in <varname>struct
      cdevsw</varname>.  Note that third-party device drivers will
      require recompiling after this change.</para>

    <para>The kernel's file descriptor allocation code has been
      updated, and is now derived from similar code in OpenBSD.</para>

    <para arch="sparc64">On &os;/sparc64, <varname>time_t</varname>
      has been changed from a 32-bit value to a 64-bit value.

      <note>
	<para>Since this change is not backward-compatible,
	  any programs which were built on an older system using
	  a 32-bit <varname>time_t</varname> and
	  call system routines for handling
	  <varname>time_t</varname> values, will have to be recompiled.
	  More detailed information and notice on upgrading from
	  the source can be found in
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING.64BTT</filename>.</para>

	the rdp driver for RealTek RTL 8002-based pocket ethernet adapters,
	the spigot driver for the Creative Labs Video Spigot video-acquisition board,
	the stl and stli drivers for Stallion Technologies multiport serial
	controllers, and the wt driver for Archive/Wangtek cartridge tapes.
	They are currently non-functional, and would require a considerable
	amount of work to make them work under the new API in 5-CURRENT.
	The userland support such as related ioctls and utilities including
	sasc and sgsc has also been removed.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="i386">A serial console-capable version of
	<filename>boot0</filename> has been added.  It can be written
	to a disk using &man.boot0cfg.8; and specifying
	<filename>/boot/boot0sio</filename> as the argument to the
	<option>-b</option> option.</para>

      <para arch="i386"><filename>cdboot</filename> now works around a

      <para arch="i386">&os; now provides a binary compatibility layer
	for using &microsoft.windows; NDIS drivers for network
	adapters under &os;/i386.  It includes a relocator/linker for
	&windows; <filename>.SYS</filename> files to interface with
	the &os; kernel and emulates various parts of the NDIS API
	using native &os; kernel functions.  This system supports PCI

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The &man.gre.4; tunnel driver now supports WCCP version
	2.</para>

      <para>Some bugs in the IPsec implementation from the KAME
	Project have been fixed.  These bugs were related to freeing
	memory objects before all references to them were removed, and
	could cause erratic behavior or kernel panics after flushing
	the Security Policy Database (SPD).</para>

      <para>The <literal>PFIL_HOOKS</literal> option is now enabled by
	default in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  The most
	notable effect of this change is to make
	<application>IPFilter</application> work correctly when loaded
	as a kernel module.</para>

      <para>The following TCP features are now enabled by default: RFC
	3042 (Limited Retransmit), RFC 3390 (increased initial
	congestion window sizes), TCP bandwidth-delay product
	limiting.  More information can be found in &man.tcp.4;.</para>

      <para>&os;'s TCP implementation now includes support for a

	variable).  Connections exceeding this limit may be reset and
	dropped.  This feature provides protection against a class of
	resource exhaustion attacks.</para>

      <para>The TCP implementation now includes partial (output-only)
	support for RFC 2385 (TCP-MD5) digest support.  This feature,
	enabled with the <literal>TCP_SIGNATURE</literal> and
	<literal>FAST_IPSEC</literal> kernel options, is a TCP option
	for authenticating TCP sessions.  &man.setkey.8; now includes
	support for the TCP-MD5 class of security associations.

      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>The EXT2FS file system code now includes partial support
	for large (&gt; 4GB) files.  This support is partial in that
	it will refuse to create large files on filesystems that have
	not been upgraded to <literal>EXT2_DYN_REV</literal> or that
	don not have the
	<literal>EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE</literal> flag set

    <para arch="i386,pc98">The building process for boot floppy images
      has been completely overhauled.  The most significant change is
      that the loader now boots a stock <filename>GENERIC</filename>
      kernel split across multiple disks (two at the time of this
      writing).  This greatly improves installations that begin with a
      boot from floppy disk, because they now use exactly the same
      kernel (and thus support the same hardware) as CDROM
      installations.  The stripped-down <filename>MFSROOT</filename>
      kernel is no longer needed, and the <filename>mfsroot</filename>
      image no longer requires kernel modules.  The
      <filename>boot.flp</filename> and
      <filename>driver.flp</filename> images are also obsolete and no
