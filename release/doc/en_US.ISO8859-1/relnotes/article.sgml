  <sect1 id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It
      describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
      It also provides some notes on upgrading
      from previous versions of &os;.</para>

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
      &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
      url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
      information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
      distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
      &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os; Handbook</ulink>.</para>

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
      installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
      documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <sect1 id="new">
    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have
	been fixed.  For more information, consult the individual
	advisories available from
	<ulink url="http://security.FreeBSD.org/"></ulink>.</para>

    <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE, binary
      upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
      security branches) are supported using the
      &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure
      will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified
      GENERIC or SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os;
      release.  The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the
      host being upgraded has Internet connectivity.</para>

    <para>An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the
      <command>Upgrade</command> option from the main
      &man.sysinstall.8; menu on CDROM distribution media.  This type
      of binary upgrade may be useful on non-&arch.i386;,
      non-&arch.amd64; machines or on systems with no Internet
      connectivity.</para>

    <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
      base system from source code) from previous versions are
      supported, according to the instructions in
      <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
	backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
	files.</para>
