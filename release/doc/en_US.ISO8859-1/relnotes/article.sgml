<![ %release.type.release [

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
      &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
      url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
      information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
      distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
      installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
      documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have
	been fixed.  For more information, consult the individual

    <sect2 id="kernel">
      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para>The &os; DTrace subsystem now supports a probe for
	process execution.</para>

      <para arch="amd64">The &os; kernel virtual address space has
	been increased to 6GB and the ceiling on the kmem map size
	to 3.6GB.  Note that the ceiling as a fraction of the kernel
	map size rather than an absolute quantity.</para>

      <para>The &man.jail.8; subsystem has been updated.  Changes include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Multiple addresses of both IPv4 and IPv6 per jail has
	    been supported.  It is even possible to have jails without
	    an IP address at all, which basically gives one a chrooted
	    environment with restricted process view and no
	    networking.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>SCTP (&man.sctp.4;) with IPv6 in jails has been supported.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Specific CPU binding by using &man.cpuset.1; has been supported.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>A <literal>show jails</literal> subcommand in
	    &man.ddb.8; has been added.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Compatibility support which permits 32bit jail
	    binaries to be used on 64bit systems to manage jails has
	    been added.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Note that both version numbers of
	    <literal>jail</literal> and <literal>prison</literal> in
	    the &man.jail.8; have been updated for the new
	    features.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The &man.jail.8; subsystem now supports SCTP(&man.sctp.4;)
	with IPv6 in jails.</para>

      <para>The &man.kld.4; now supports installing 32-bit system
	call to the &os; system call translation layer from kernel
	modules.</para>

      <para>The &man.ktr.4; now supports a new KTR tracepoint in the
	<literal>KTR_CALLOUT</literal> class to note when a callout
	routine finishes executing.</para>

      <para>Types of variables used to track amount of allocated
	System V shared memory from <literal>int</literal> to
	<literal>size_t</literal>.  This makes it possible to use more
	than 2 GB shared memory segments on 64-bit architectures.
	Please note the new BUGS section in &man.shmctl.2; and
	<filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> for limitations of this
	temporal solution.</para>

      <para>The &os; 32-bit system call translation layer now
	supports installing 32-bit system calls for
	<literal>VFS_AIO</literal>.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">The &os; virtual memory subsystem now
	supports Superpages.  The Superpages is a feature in modern
	CPUs that enables each entry in the TLB (translation lookaside
	buffer) to map a large physical memory region into a virtual
	address space.  This provides possible memory savings for
	applications that share large amounts of memory between the
	address spaces and performance improvements due to fewer TLB
	misses.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para>The &man.boot.8; now supports 4-byte volume ID that
	  certain versions of &windows; put into the MBR and invoking
	  PXE by pressing F6 key on some supported BIOSes.</para>

	<para>The &man.loader.8; is now able to obtain DHCP options
	  via &man.kenv.2; variables in the case of network boot.</para>

	<para>A bug in the &man.loader.8; has been fixed.  Now the
	  following line works as expected:</para>

	<programlisting>loader_conf_files="<replaceable>foo</replaceable> <replaceable>bar</replaceable> ${<replaceable>variable</replaceable>}"</programlisting>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="proc">
	<title>Hardware Support</title>

	<para>The &man.acpi.4; subsystem now supports a &man.sysctl.8;
	  variable <varname>debug.batt.batt_sleep_ms</varname>.  On
	  some laptops with smart batteries, enabling battery
	  monitoring software causes keystrokes from &man.atkbd.4; to
	  be lost.  This sysctl variable adds a delay in millisecond
	  to the status checking code as a workaround.</para>

	<para>The &man.acpi.asus.4; driver now supports Asus A8Sr
	  notebooks.</para>

	<para arch="powerpc">Support for the AltiVec, a floating point
	  and integer SIMD instruction set has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpuctl.4; driver, which provides a special
	  device <filename>/dev/cpuctl</filename> as an interface to
	  the system CPU and functionality to retrieve CPUID
	  information, read/write machine specific registers (MSR) and
	  perform CPU firmware updates.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpufreq.4; driver now supports a
	  <varname>hw.est.msr_info</varname> loader tunable.  When
	  this set to <literal>1</literal>, it attempts to build a
	  simple list containing just the high and low frequencies if
	  it cannot obtain a frequency list from either ACPI or the
	  static tables.  This is disabled by default.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">CPU frequency change notifiers are now
	  disabled when the TSC is P-state invariant.  Also, a new
	  loader tunable
	  <varname>kern.timecounter.invariant_tsc</varname> has been
	  added to force this behavior by setting it to
	  non-zero.</para>

	<para>In the &man.pci.4; subsystem INTx is now disabled when
	  MSI/MSIX is enabled.  This change fixes interrupt storm
	  related issues.</para>

	<para>A &man.sysctl.3; leaf node has a flag to tag itself as
	  MPSAFE now.</para>

	<sect4 id="mm">
	  <title>Multimedia Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.agp.4; now supports Intel G4X series graphics
	    chipsets.</para>

	  <para>The DRM, a kernel module named Direct Rendering
	    Manager that gives direct hardware access to DRI clients,
	    has been updated.  Support for AMD/ATI r500 and IGP based
	    chips, XGI V3XE/V5/V8, and Intel i915 chipsets has been
	    improved.</para>

	  <para>A new loader tunable <varname>hw.drm.msi</varname>
	    which controls if DRM uses MSI or not.  This is set to
	    <literal>1</literal> (enabled) by default.</para>

	  <para>The snd_au88x0(4) driver for Aureal Vortex
	    1/2/Advantage PCI has been removed because this was
	    broken for a long time.</para>

	  <para>The &man.snd.hda.4; driver has been updated.  Changes
	    include: multiple codec per HDA bus, multiple functional
	    groups per codec, multiple audio devices per functional
	    group, digital (SPDIF/HDMI) audio input/output,
	    suspend/resume, and part of multichannel audio.</para>

	  <para>Note that due to added HDMI audio and logical audio
	    devices support, updated driver often provides several PCM
	    devices.  In some cases it can make system default audio
	    device no longer corresponding to the users's habitual
	    audio connectors.  In such cases the default device can be
	    specified in audio application setup or defined globally
	    via <varname>hw.snd.default_unit sysctl</varname>
	    as described in the &man.sound.4; manual page.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="net-if">
	  <title>Network Interface Support</title>

	  <para arch="amd64,i386">The &man.ale.4; driver are now
	    included in the <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	    kernel.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ath.hal.4;, Atheros Hardware Access Layer,
	    has been updated to the open source version.</para>

	  <para>The &man.axe.4; driver has been improved in
	    performance by eliminating extra context switch and now
	    supports Apple USB Ethernet adapter.</para>

	  <para>The ciphy(4) driver now supports Vitesse VSC8211
	    PHY.</para>

	  <para>The &man.fxp.4; driver has been improved.  Changes include:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>

	      <para>The checksum offload feature can be controlled by
		&man.ifconfig.8;.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Rx checksum offload support for 82559 or later

	    <listitem>
	      <para>WoL (Wake on LAN) support for 82550, 82551, 82558,
		and 82559-based controllers has been added.  Note that
		ICH based controllers are treated as 82559, and 82557,
		earlier revision of 82558, and 82559ER have no WOL
		capability.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>VLAN hardware tag insertion/stripping support and
		Tx/Rx checksum offload for VLAN frames support have

	  <para>The &man.jme.4; driver now supports newer JMicron
	    JMC250/JMC260 revisions.</para>

	  <para>The &man.msk.4; driver has been improved.  An issue
	    which makes it hang up in a certain condition has been
	    fixed.</para>

	  <para>The &man.mxge.4; driver now supports some newer
	    revisions and 10GBASE-LRM and 10GBASE-Twinax* media
	    types.</para>

      <para>The &man.du.1; utility now supports an <option>-l</option>
	flag.  When specified, the &man.du.1; counts a file with
	multiple hard links as multiple different files.</para>

      <para>The &man.dumpfs.8; utility now supports an
	<option>-f</option> flag, which causes it to list all free
	fragments in the file system by fragment (block) number.  This
	new mode does the necessary arithmetic to generate absolute
	fragment numbers rather than than the cg-relative numbers
	printed in the default mode.</para>

      <para>If <option>-f</option> is passed once, contiguous fragment
	ranges are collapsed into an X-Y format as free block lists are
	currently printed in regular dumpfs output, but if specified twice,
	all block numbers are printed individually, allowing both compact
	and more script-friendly representation.</para>

      <para>The &man.fetch.1; utility now supports an
	<option>-i</option> flag which supports If-Modified-Since HTTP
	1.1 request.  If specified it will cause the file to be
	downloaded only if it is more recent than the mtime of the
	file.  Also, <application>libfetch</application> now accepts
	the mtime in the url structure and a flag to indicate when
	this behavior is desired.</para>

      <para>The &man.fsck.8; utility now supports a
	<option>-D</option> flag for damaged recovery mode, which
	will enable certain aggressive operations that can make
	&man.fsck.8; to survive with file systems that has very
	serious data damage, which is an useful last resort when on
	disk data damage is very serious and causes &man.fsck.8; to
	crash otherwise.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.ipfw.8; utility which displays extra
	messages for a NAT rule even when a <option>-q</option> flag
	is specified.</para>

      <para>The &man.ln.1; utility now supports a <option>-w</option>
	flag to check if the source file actually exists.  When the
	flag is specified and the file does not exist, the &man.ln.1;
	will put a warning message.</para>

      <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now reports &man.unix.4;
	sockets listen queue statistics when an <option>-L</option>
	flag.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.netstat.1; utility has been fixed.  It
	crashed with the following options in the previous
	versions:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; netstat -m -N foo</screen>

      <para>A bug in the &man.netstat.1; utility has been fixed.  The
	<option>-ss</option> now works in the icmp6 section as

      <para>The &man.pciconf.8; utility now supports a
	<option>-b</option> flag, which lists any base address
	registers (BAR) that are assigned resources for each
	device.</para>

      <para>The &man.powerd.8; program has been improved.  Changes
	include reasonable CPU load estimation on SMP systems and a
	new mode named as <literal>hiadaptive</literal> for AC-powered
	systems which rises frequency twice faster, drops it 4 times
	slower, prefers twice lower CPU load and has additional delay
	before leaving the highest frequency after the period of
	maximum load.</para>

      <para>The &man.stat.1; utility now displays an octal
	representation of suid, sgid and sticky bits when an
	<option>-x</option> flag is specified.</para>

      <para>The &man.strndup.3; function has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.wc.1; utility now supports an <option>-L</option>
	flag to output the number of characters in the longest input
	line.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.rpc.yppasswdd.8; program which leaves a
	zombie process when a password or default shell is changed has

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE, binary
      upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
      security branches) are supported using the
      &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure
      will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified
      GENERIC or SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os;
      release.  The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the
      host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

    <para>An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the
      <command>Upgrade</command> option from the main
      &man.sysinstall.8; menu on CDROM distribution media.  This type
      of binary upgrade may be useful on non-&arch.i386;,
      non-&arch.amd64; machines or on systems with no Internet
      connectivity.</para>

    <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
