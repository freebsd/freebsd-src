  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev.historic;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in the &man.fetch.1; utility which allows
      a malicious HTTP server to cause arbitrary portions of the client's
      memory to be overwritten, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:16.fetch.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:16.fetch</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.procfs.5; and &man.linprocfs.5;
      which could cause a malicious local user could perform a local
      denial of service attack by causing a system panic, or the user
      could read parts of kernel memory, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:17.procfs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:17.procfs</ulink>.

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="i386">Support for 80386 processors (the
      <literal>I386_CPU</literal> kernel configuration option) has
      been removed.  Users running this class of CPU should use &os;
      5.<replaceable>X</replaceable> or earlier.</para>

    <para arch="alpha,amd64,i386">The loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafevm</varname>
      has been enabled by default.  &merged;</para>

    <para>&man.memguard.9;, a kernel memory allocator designed to help detect
      <quote>tamper-after-free</quote> scenarios, has been added.
      This must be explicitly enabled via <literal>options
      DEBUG_MEMGUARD</literal>, plus small kernel modifications.  It
      is generally intended for use by kernel developers.</para>

    <para>A number of bugs have been fixed in the ULE
      scheduler. &merged;</para>

    <para>Fine-grained locking to allow much of the VFS stack to run
      without the Giant lock has been added.  This is enabled by default
      on alpha, amd64, and i386 architecture, and can be disabled
      by setting the loader tunable (and sysctl variable)
      <varname>debug.mpsafevfs</varname> to
      <literal>0</literal>.</para>

    <para arch="i386">A bug in Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI)
      handling, which could cause SMP systems to crash under heavy
      load, has been fixed.  More details are contained in errata note
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ERRATA/notices/FreeBSD-EN-05:03.ipi.asc">FreeBSD-EN-05:03.ipi</ulink>.
      &merged;</para>

    <para>System V IPC objects (message queues, semaphores, and shared
      memory) now have support for Mandatory Access Control policies,
      notably &man.mac.biba.4;, &man.mac.mls.4;, &man.mac.stub.4;, and
      &man.mac.test.4;.</para>

    <para arch="i386">Memory allocation for legacy PCI bridges has
      been limited to the top 32MB of RAM.  Many older, legacy bridges
      only allow allocation from this range and this only applies
      to devices which don't have their memory assigned by the BIOS.
      This change fixes the <quote>bad Vcc</quote> error of CardBus
      bridges (&man.pccbb.4;). &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.sysctl.3; MIBs beginning with <quote>debug</quote>
      now require the kernel option <literal>options SYSCTL_DEBUG</literal>.
      This option is disabled by default.</para>

    <para>The generic &man.tty.4; driver interface has been added
      and many device drivers including
      &man.cx.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}x</literal>),
      &man.cy.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}c</literal>),
      &man.digi.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}D</literal>),
      &man.rc.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}m</literal>),
      &man.rp.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}R</literal>),
      &man.sab.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}z</literal>),
      &man.si.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}A</literal>),
      &man.sio.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}d</literal>),
      sx (<literal>{tty,cua}G</literal>),
      &man.uart.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}u</literal>),
      &man.ubser.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}y</literal>),
      &man.ucom.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}U</literal>), and
      &man.ucycom.4; (<literal>{tty,cua}y</literal>)
      have been rewritten to use it.  Note that <filename>/etc/remote</filename>
      and <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> have been updated as well.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para arch="i386,amd64,ia64">The default <varname>HZ</varname>
      parameter (which controls various kernel timers) has been
      increased from <literal>100</literal> to <literal>1000</literal>
      on the i386 and ia64.  It has been reduced from
      <literal>1024</literal> to <literal>1000</literal> on the amd64
      to reduce synchronization effects with other system
      clocks.</para>

    <para>The maximum length of shell commands has changed from 128
      bytes to <varname>PAGE_SIZE</varname>.  By default, this value
      is either 4KB (i386, pc98, amd64, and powerpc) or 8KB (sparc64
      and ia64).  As a result, compatibility modules need to be
      rebuilt to stay synchronized with data structure changes in the
      kernel.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para arch="i386">A serial console-capable version of
	<filename>boot0</filename> has been added.  It can be written
	to a disk using &man.boot0cfg.8; and specifying
	<filename>/boot/boot0sio</filename> as the argument to the
	<option>-b</option> option.</para>

      <para arch="i386"><filename>cdboot</filename> now works around a
	BIOS problem observed on some systems when booting from USB
	CDROM drives.</para>

      <para>The <command>autoboot</command> loader command
	now supports the prompt parameter.</para>

      <para>A loader menu option to set <varname>hint.atkbd.0.flags=0x1</varname>
	has been added.  This setting allows USB keyboards to work
	if no PS/2 keyboard is attached.</para>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para arch="sparc64">The &man.auxio.4; driver has been to drive
	some auxiliary I/O functions found on various SBus/EBus
	&ultrasparc; models. &merged;</para>

      <para>A framework for flexible processor speed control has been
	added.  It provides methods for various drivers to control CPU
	power utilization by adjusting the processor speed.  More
	details can be found in the &man.cpufreq.4; manual page.
	Currently supported drivers include acpi_perf (ACPI CPU
	performance states), ichss (Intel SpeedStep for ICH), and
	acpi_throttle (ACPI CPU throttling).</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support for the OLDCARD subsystem has

	cards.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.pbio.4; driver,
	which supports direct access to
	the Intel 8255A programmable peripheral interface (PPI)
	chip running in mode 0 (simple I/O) has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.psm.4; driver now has improved support for
	Synaptics Touchpad users.  It now has better tracking of
	slow-speed movement and now has support for various extra

	  the kernel configuration when using the &man.ath.4;
	  driver.</para>

	<para>The &man.bge.4; driver now supports the &man.altq.4;
	  framework.</para>

	<para>The &man.cp.4; driver is now MPSAFE. &merged;</para>

	  could cause panics, page faults, aborted SSH connections, or
	  corrupted file transfers.  More details can be found in
	  errata note
	  <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ERRATA/notices/FreeBSD-EN-05:02.sk.asc">FreeBSD-EN-05:02.sk</ulink>.

      </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The MTU feedback in IPv6 has been disabled when the sender writes
	data that must be fragmented.  &merged;</para>

      <para>CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol) has
	been implemented.  CARP comes from OpenBSD and allows
	multiple hosts to share an IP address, providing
	high availability and load balancing.
	For more information, see &man.carp.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; <literal>IPDIVERT</literal> option has been
	available as a kernel loadable module.
	If this module is not loaded, &man.ipfw.4; will refuse to
	install <literal>divert</literal> rules and &man.natd.8;
	will put an error message <quote>protocol not supported</quote>.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; now supports classification and tagging
	of the &man.altq.4;, packets via a divert socket,
	and TCP data length.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; <literal>ipfw fwd</literal> rule now supports
	the full packet destination manipulation when the kernel option
	<literal>options IPFIREWALL_FORWARD_EXTENDED</literal> is specified
	in addition to <literal>options IPFIRWALL_FORWARD</literal>.
	This kernel option disables all restrictions to ensure proper
	behavior for locally generated packets and allows to redirect
	packets destined to locally configured IP addresses.
	Note that &man.ipfw.8; rules have to be carefully crafted to
	make sure that things like PMTU discovery do not break.</para>

      <para>Ongoing work is reducing the use of the Giant lock by the
	network protocol stack and improving the locking
	strategies.</para>

      <para>The &man.sppp.4; driver now includes Frame Relay
	support. &merged;</para>

      <para>A bug in TCP that sometimes caused RST packets to
	be ignored if the receive window was zero bytes has been
	fixed. &merged;</para>

      <para>Several bugs in the TCP SACK implementation have been
	fixed. &merged;</para>

      <para>RFC 1644 T/TCP support has been removed.  This is because
	the design is based on an weak security model that can result
	in the ease of denial-of-service attacks and this TCP
	extension has been considered as a defective one in
	the recent Internet Draft.</para>

      <para>Random ephemeral port number allocation has led to some
        problems with port reuse at high connection rates.  This
        feature is now disabled during periods of high connection
        rates; whenever new connections are created faster than
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomcps</varname> per second,
        port number randomization is disabled for the next
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomtime</varname>
        seconds.  The default values for these two sysctl variables
        are <literal>10</literal> and <literal>45</literal>,
        respectively.</para>

      <para>Fine-grained locking has been applied to many of the data
	structures in the IPX/SPX protocol stack.  While not fully
	MPSAFE at this point, it is generally safe to use IPX/SPX
	without the Giant lock (in other words, the
	<varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> sysctl variable may be set
	to <literal>1</literal>).</para>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.amr.4; driver is now safe for use on systems
	using &man.pae.4;. &merged;</para>

      <para>The SHSEC GEOM class has been added.  It provides for the
	sharing of a secret between multiple GEOM providers.  All of
	these providers must be present in order to reveal the
	secret.  This feature is controlled by the &man.gshsec.8;
	utility.</para>

      <para>The &man.hptmv.4; driver, which supports HighPoint
	RocketRAID 182x series has been added.  &merged;</para>

      <para>The &man.matcd.4; driver has been removed.</para>

      <para>The default SCSI boot-time probe delay in the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel has been reduced from
	fifteen seconds to five seconds.</para>

      <para arch="pc98">The &man.wd.4; driver has been removed.  The
	&man.ata.4; driver has been found to work well enough on the
	pc98 platform that there is no need for the older &man.wd.4;
	driver.</para>

      <para>Information about newly-mounted cd9660 file systems (such
	as the presence of Rockridge extensions) is now only printed
	if the kernel was booted in verbose mode.  This change was
	made to reduce the amount of (generally unnecessary) kernel
	log messages. &merged;</para>

    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.burncd.8; utility now allows commands (such as

      disk.</para>

    <para>The <literal>create</literal> command of the &man.gpt.8;

    <para>The &man.dump.8; utility now supports a <option>-n</option>
      flag to suppress the creation of a <filename>.snap</filename>
      directory on new file systems.  This feature is intended for use
      on memory or vnode file systems that will not require snapshot
      support.</para>

    <para>The &man.ifconfig.8; utility has been restructured.  It is
      now more modular and flexible with respect to supporting
      interface-specific functionality.  The 802.11 support has been
      updated to support recent changes to the 802.11 subsystem and
      drivers.</para>

    <para>Support for abbreviated forms of a number of &man.ipfw.8;

      indicated the correct full form when one of these abbreviations
      is detected.</para>

    <para>The <filename>libarchive</filename> library (as well as the
      &man.tar.1; command that uses it) now has support for reading ISO
      images (with optional RockRidge extensions) and ZIP archives
      (with <literal>deflate</literal> and <literal>none</literal>
      compression). &merged;</para>

    <para>The <literal>NO_NIS</literal> compile-time knob for userland
      has been added.  As its name implies, enabling this
      <filename>Makefile</filename> variable will cause NIS support to
      be excluded from various programs and will cause the NIS
      utilities to not be built. &merged;</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.mkuzip.8;, which is a non-GPL
      utility to compress file system images for use with
      <literal>GEOM_UZIP</literal> &man.geom.4; module,
      has been added.</para>

    <para>The &man.newsyslog.8; utility now supports
	a <option>-d</option> option to specify an alternate root for log files
	similar to <varname>DESTDIR</varname> in the BSD make process.
	This only affects log file paths, not config file (<option>-f</option>)
	or archive directory (<option>-a</option>) paths.</para>

    <para>The &man.ncal.1; utility now supports a <option>-m</option>
      flag to generate a calendar for a specified month in the current

      have been converted to the
      <varname>NO_<replaceable>FOO</replaceable></varname> form.  The
      file <filename>/usr/share/mk/bsd.compat.mk</filename> has a
      complete list of these variables; it also implements some
      temporary backward compatibility for the old names.</para>

    <para>The &man.ppp.8; program now implements an
      <option>echo</option> parameter, which allows LCP ECHOs to be
      enabled independently of LQR reports.  Older versions of
      &man.ppp.8; would revert to LCP ECHO mode on negotiation
      failure.  It is now necessary to specify <command>enable
      echo</command> to get this behavior. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.rm.1; utility now supports an <option>-I</option>
      option that asks for confirmation once if recursively
      removing directories or if more than 3 files are listed in the
      command line.</para>

    <para>An &man.rpmatch.3; library function has been added to check
      a string for being an affirmative or negative response in the
      current locale.</para>

    <para>The rune(3) non-standard multibyte and wide character support
      interface has been removed.</para>

    <para>The &man.syslogd.8; utility now opens an additional domain
      socket <filename>/var/run/logpriv</filename> by default,
      with <literal>0600</literal> permissions to be used
      by privileged programs.  This prevents the privileged
      programs from locking when the domain sockets
      run out of the buffer space due to
      local denial-of-service attack.</para>

    <para>The <option>-f</option> option of &man.tail.1; utility
      now supports more than one file at a time.</para>

    <para>The &man.telnet.1; and &man.telnetd.8; programs now support
      the <option>-S</option> option for specifying a numeric TOS
      byte.</para>

    <para>The &man.tcpdrop.8; command, which closes a selected TCP
      connection, has been added.  It was obtained from
      OpenBSD.</para>

    <para>&man.whois.1; now supports
      a <option>-k</option> flag
      for querying <hostid role="fqdn">whois.krnic.net</hostid>
      (the National Internet Development Agency of Korea)
      which hold details of IP address allocations within
      Korea. &merged;</para>

    <para>The <option>-I</option> option of the &man.xargs.1; command
      has been changed to confirm IEEE Std 1003.1-2004.
      The standard requires that the constructed
      arguments cannot grow larger than 255 bytes.</para>

    <sect3 id="rc-scripts">
      <title><filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> Scripts</title>

      <para>&man.rc.conf.5; now supports change of the interface name
	on boot time.  For example:</para>

      <programlisting>ifconfig_fxp0_name="net0"
ifconfig_net0="inet 10.0.0.1/16"</programlisting>

      <para>The <filename>rc.d/moused</filename> script now
	start/stop/check on a specific device when
	the device name as the second argument to the script:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; /etc/rc.d/moused start ums0</screen>

      <para>To use different &man.rc.conf.5; knobs with different
	mice use the device name as part of the knob.
	For example, if the mouse device is <filename>/dev/ums0</filename>
	the following lines can be used:</para>

	<programlisting>moused_ums0_enable=yes
moused_ums0_flags="-z 4"
moused_ums0_port="/dev/ums0"</programlisting>
