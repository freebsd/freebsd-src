    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain a summary
      of the changes made to the &os; base system on the
      &release.branch; development line.
      This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since
      the last release, as well as significant changes to the &os;
      kernel and userland.
      Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.	 More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.	 Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <sect1 id="new">
    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have

      <para revision="219559,219561" arch="amd64,i386">The &os;
	&man.dtrace.1; framework now supports
	<literal>systrace</literal> for system calls of
	<literal>linux32</literal> and <literal>freebsd32</literal> on
	&os;/&arch.amd64;.  Two new
	<filename>systrace_linux32</filename> and
	<filename>systrace_freebsd32</filename> kernel modules provide
	support for tracing compat system calls in addition to the native
	system call tracing provided by the
	<filename>systrace</filename> module.</para>

      <para revision="216758,216615">The &man.hhook.9; (Helper Hook)
	and &man.khelp.9; (Kernel Helpers) KPIs have been implemented.
	These are a kind of superset of &man.pfil.9; framework for
	more general use in the kernel.  The &man.hhook.9; KPI
	provides a way for kernel subsystems to export hook points
	that &man.khelp.9; modules can hook to provide enhanced or new
	functionality to the kernel.  The &man.khelp.9; KPI provides a
	framework for managing &man.khelp.9; modules, which indirectly
	use the &man.hhook.9; KPI to register their hook functions
	with hook points of interest within the kernel.  These allow a
	structured way to dynamically extend the kernel at runtime in
	an ABI preserving manner.</para>

      <para revision="224516" arch="amd64,i386,pc98">A &man.loader.8;
	tunable <varname>hw.memtest.tests</varname> has been added.
	This controls whether to perform memory testing at boot time
	or not.  The default value is <literal>1</literal> (perform a
	memory test).</para>

      <para revision="219999">The &man.open.2; and &man.fhopen.2;
	system calls now support the <literal>O_CLOEXEC</literal> flag,
	which allows setting the <literal>FD_CLOEXEC</literal> flag for the
	newly created file descriptor.  This is standardized in IEEE
	Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX, Single UNIX Specification Version
	4).</para>

      <para revision="220791">The &man.posix.fallocate.2; system call has
	been implemented.  This is a function in POSIX to ensure that
	a part of the storage for regular file data is allocated on the
	file system storage media.</para>

	  <para revision="217902">The &man.re.4; driver now supports

	    <varname>dev.re.<replaceable>N</replaceable>.int_rx_mod</varname>
	    has been added to control amount of time to delay RX
	    interrupt processing, in units of microsecond.  Setting it

	<para revision="223666">&man.ipfw.8; now supports the

	  HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512) as described in RFC 4868.
	  This was a fixed 96-bit length in prior releases because the
	  implementation was based on an old Internet draft
	  draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-sha-256-00.  Note that this means

	<para revision="225682">A bug in the

	<para revision="217806">An &man.h.ertt.4; (Enhanced Round Trip

	<para revision="216796">The &os; Fast File System now

	  blocks.  A new flag <option>-t</option> in the &man.newfs.8;
	  and &man.tunefs.8; utilities sets the TRIM-enable flag for a

	  send a delete request to the underlying device for each

	  should only be used only if the data on the server changes

	  this flag keyword.</para>

	<para revision="225537">A &man.loader.8; tunable
	  <varname>vfs.typenumhash</varname> has been added.  Setting
	  this to <literal>1</literal> enables to use a hash
