$FreeBSD$

The release notes and other documentation files formerly in this
directory are now rendered from SGML as part of the release build.

If you are a committer wishing to update the release documentation,
please edit the SGML files under src/release/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/ or
send a message to freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org with a plain-text
submission.

ASCII text versions appear on the floppy images (as before), while
both ASCII and HTML versions are included in the CDROM and FTP
directory trees.

Renditions of the release documentation files for FreeBSD -CURRENT,
FreeBSD 4-STABLE, and selected releases are available at:

http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bmah/relnotes/

For more information, please see src/release/doc/README.
