--      --------------------

We have `underlined' text which represents user input with `-' symbols
throughout this document to differentiate it from the machine output.

1.      Default (GENERIC) Configuration
--      -------------------------------

The following table contains a list of all of the devices that are
present in the GENERIC kernel.  This is the essential part of the 
operating system that is placed in your root partition during the 
installation process.  A compressed version of the GENERIC kernel is
also used on the installation floppy diskette and DOS boot image.

The table describes the various parameters used by the driver to
communicate with the hardware in your system.  There are four
parameters in the table, though not all are used by each and every
device:

   Port   The starting I/O port used by the device, shown in hexadecimal.

   IOMem  The lowest (or starting) memory address used by the device,
          also shown in hexadecimal.

   IRQ    The interrupt the device uses to alert the driver to an event,
          given in decimal.

   DRQ    The DMA (direct memory access) channel the device uses to move
          data to and from main memory, also given in decimal.

If an entry in the table has `n/a' for a value then it means that the
parameter in question does not apply to that device.  A value of `dyn'
means that the correct value should be determined automatically by the
kernel when the system boots and that you don't need to worry about
it.

If an entry is marked with an *, it means that support is currently
not available for it but should be back as soon as someone converts
the driver to work within the new 4.0 framework.

If the hardware in your computer is not set to the same settings as
those shown in the table and the item in conflict is not marked 'dyn',
you will have to either reconfigure your hardware or use UserConfig
to reconfigure the kernel to match the way your hardware is currently set
(see the next section).

If the settings do not match, the kernel may be unable to locate
or reliably access the devices in your system.


2.      Using UserConfig to change FreeBSD kernel settings
--      --------------------------------------------------

The FreeBSD kernel on the install floppy contains drivers for every
piece of hardware that could conceivably be used to install the rest
of the system with.  Unfortunately, PC hardware being what it is, some
of these devices can be difficult to detect accurately, and for some,
the process of detecting another can cause irreversible confusion.

To make this process easier, FreeBSD provides UserConfig.  With this
tool the user can configure and disable device drivers before
the kernel is loaded, avoiding potential conflicts, and eliminating
the need to reconfigure hardware to suit the default driver settings.

Once FreeBSD is installed, it will remember the changes made using
UserConfig, so that they only need be made once.

It is important to disable drivers that are not relevant to a system
in order to minimize the possibility of interference, which can cause
problems that are difficult to track down.

UserConfig features a command line interface for users with serial
consoles or a need to type commands, and a full screen 'visual'
interface, which provides point-and-shoot configuration functionality.

Here is a sample UserConfig screen shot in 'visual' mode:

---Active Drivers---------------------------10 Conflicts------Dev---IRQ--Port--

---Parameters-for-device-ed0---------------------------------------------------
 Port address : 0x280      Memory address : 0xd8000
 IRQ number   : 5          Memory size    : 0x2000
 Flags        : 0x0000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  IO Port address (Hexadecimal, 0x1-0x2000)
  [TAB]   Change fields           [Q]   Save device parameters


  The screen is divided into four sections :

 - Active Drivers.  Listed here are the device drivers that are currently
   enabled, and their basic parameters.
 - Inactive Drivers.  These drivers are present, but are disabled.
 - Parameter edit field.  This area is used for editing driver parameters.
 - Help area.  Keystroke help is displayed here.

One of the Active and Inactive lists is always in use, and the current
entry in the list will be shown with a highlight bar.  If there are
more entries in a list than can be shown, it will scroll.  The bar can
be moved up and down using the cursor keys, and moved between lists
with the TAB key.

Drivers in the Active list may be marked "CONF".  This indicates that
one or more of their parameters conflicts with another device, and
indicates a potential for problems.  The total number of conflicts is
displayed at the top of the screen.

As a general rule, conflicts should be avoided, either by disabling
conflicting devices that are not present in the system, or by altering
their configuration so that they match the installed hardware.

In the list areas, drivers are grouped by their basic function.
Groups can be 'Collapsed' to simplify the display (this is the default
state for all groups).  If a group is collapsed, it will be shown with
'(Collapsed)' in the list, as above.  To Expand a Collapsed group,
position the highlight bar over the group heading and press Enter.  To
Collapse it again, repeat the process.

When a device driver in the Active list is highlighted, its full
parameters are displayed in the Parameter edit area.  Note that not
all drivers use all possible parameters, and some hardware supported
by drivers may not use all the parameters the driver supports.

To disable a driver, go to the Active list, Expand the group it is in,
highlight the driver and press Del.  The driver will move to its group
in the Inactive list.  (If the group is collapsed or off the screen,
you may not see the driver in its new location.)

To enable a driver, go to the Inactive list, Expand the group it is
in, highlight the driver and press Enter.  The highlight will move to
the Active list, and the driver you have just enabled will be
highlighted, ready to be configured.

To configure a driver, go to the Active list, Expand the group it is
in, highlight the driver and press Enter.  The cursor will move to the
Parameter edit area, and the device's parameters may be edited.

While editing parameters, the TAB and cursor keys can be used to move
between fields.  Most numeric values (except IRQ) are entered in
hexadecimal, as indicated by the '0x' at the beginning of the field.
The allowable values for a given field are show in the Key Help area
when the field is active.

To finish configuring a driver, press 'Q'.

Note that PCI, Microchannel and EISA devices can be probed reliably,
therefore they are not shown in the table above nor can their settings
be changed using UserConfig.


3.      LINT - other possible configurations
--      ------------------------------------

The following drivers are not in the GENERIC kernel but remain
available to those who do not mind compiling a custom kernel (see
section 6 of FreeBSD.FAQ).  The LINT configuration file
(/sys/i386/conf/LINT) also contains prototype entries for just about
every device supported by FreeBSD and is a good general reference.

The device names and a short description of each are listed below.  The port
numbers, etc, are not meaningful here since you will need to compile a
custom kernel to gain access to these devices anyway and can thus
adjust the addresses to match the hardware in your computer in the process.
The LINT file contains prototype entries for all of the below which you
can easily cut-and-paste into your own file (or simply copy LINT and edit
it to taste):

4.      Supported Hardware
--      ------------------

FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA,
Microchannel and PCI bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium
class machines (though the 386sx is not recommended).  Support for
generic IDE drive configurations, various SCSI controllers,
network and serial cards is also provided.

What follows is a list of all peripherals currently known to work with
FreeBSD.  Other configurations may also work, we have simply not as yet
received confirmation of this.
