                                 RELEASE NOTES
                           FreeBSD Release 3.2-RELEASE

Welcome to 3.2-RELEASE, a full follow-on to the 3.1-RELEASE
released Feburary 1999 and which marked the beginning of the
3.0-STABLE branch.  In the 4 months since 3.1 was released, many
hundreds of bug fixes and general enhancements were made to the
system.  Please see relevant details below.

Any installation failures or crashes should be reported by using the
send-pr command (those preferring a WEB based interface can also see
http://www.freebsd.org/send-pr.html).

For information about FreeBSD and the layout of the 3.2-RELEASE
directory (especially if you're installing from floppies!), see
ABOUT.TXT.  For installation instructions, see the INSTALL.TXT and
HARDWARE.TXT files.

1. What's new since 3.1-RELEASE
---------------------------------

1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

Added driver support for PCI gigabit ethernet adapters based on
the Alteon Networks Tigon 1 and Tigon 2 chipsets, including the
Alteon AceNIC, 3Com 3c985 and Netgear GA620.

Support for USB devices further improved.

Support has been added for direct access to NTFS filesystems.

Support has been added for Joliet extensions on ISO 9660 filesystems.
Only iso8859-1 characters (latin-1) are supported at this time, though.

Support has been added for Adaptec 2930U2 and 3950U2 SCSI cards.

There have been a couple of kernel changes that will break the binary
interface for clients of the CAM passthrough interface or the devstat(9)
statistics interface.  These changes were made to fix some interface
deficiencies.  We regret any inconvenience this will cause, but we
anticipate that this will have minimal impact as there are no known
commercial binary-only applications that use either interface.  This will
require that programs that use those two interfaces be recompiled.  Ports
that use the CAM interface include xmcd, tosha, SANE, cdrecord and cdda2wav.
Ports that use the devstat interface include xsysinfo and xperfmon.

1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------
The Internet Software Consortium's DHCP client has been added to the 
base system.
 
Sendmail upgraded to version 8.9.3.

Tar now supports compressing via bzip2 with the new
-y/--bzip2/--bunzip2 flags.

TCP Wrappers is now part of the base system.  inetd, the port mapper,
and sendmail are now linked agaist libwrap.  The "PROCESS_OPTIONS"
syntax is the default.  See `man 5 hosts_options' for more information.

Gdb has been updated to version 4.18 and is now part of the standard
release for FreeBSD/alpha.

Camcontrol now allows users to view the number of tagged openings for
any given device, and allows users to set the number of tagged openings
for any device that supports tagged queueing.

Camcontrol also now allows users to change SCSI negotiation parameters
(e.g. sync rate, offset, bus width, disconnection) for devices on certain
controllers.  Note that this feature is only fully functional for Adaptec
7xxx series controllers, Advansys narrow controllers and NCR/Symbios
controllers.

Systat, vmstat, and iostat now print out statistics in a more "interesting"
order based on "importance" of the device vs. the probe order.

And quite a number of bugs, both in the user and kernel, fixed as
a result of user feedback for 3.1-RELEASE.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------
FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA and PCI bus
based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium class machines (though the
386sx is not recommended).  Support for generic IDE or ESDI drive
configurations, various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is
also provided.

What follows is a list of all peripherals currently known to work with
FreeBSD.  Other configurations may also work, we have simply not as yet
received confirmation of this.

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:

3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.freebsd.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 3.2-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite F
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 2.2.x or 2.1.x (in some lesser number of cases) and some of the
following issues may affect you, depending of course on your chosen
method of upgrading.  There are two popular ways of upgrading
FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

In the case of using sources, there are simply two targets you need to
be aware of: The standard ``upgrade'' target, which will upgrade a 2.x
or 3.0 system to 3.2 and the ``world'' target, which will take an
already upgraded system and keep it in sync with whatever changes have
happened since the initial upgrade.

In the case of using the binary upgrade option, the system will go
straight to 3.2/ELF but also populate the /<basepath>/lib/aout
directories for backwards compatibility with older binaries.

In either case, going to ELF will mean that you'll have somewhat
smaller binaries and access to a lot more compiler goodies which have
been already been ported to other ELF environments (our older and
somewhat crufty a.out format being largely unsupported by most other
software projects).  Those who wish to retain access to the older
a.out dynamic executables should be sure and install the compat22
distribution. Notice that the a.out libraries won't be accessible
until the system is rebooted, which may cause trouble with certain
a.out packages.

Also, do not use install disks or sysinstall from previous versions,
as version 3.1 introduced a new bootstrapping procedure, requiring
new boot blocks to be installed (because of elf kernels), and version
3.2 has further modifications to the bootstrapping procedure.

[ other important upgrading notes should go here]


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.freebsd.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!
