Most information here is also available from the Documentation menu
during installation.

  ERRATA.TXT    Read this file!  It will tell you where to look for the
                latest information on problems which have been found and
                fixed since this release was created (and may bite you).

  README.TXT    This file

  ABOUT.TXT     All about FreeBSD, including contact information

  RELNOTES.TXT  Release Notes - what's new & different in this release

  LAYOUT.TXT    Information about the layout of the release directory.
                If you are installing from floppies, it is especially
                important that you read this section!

  HARDWARE.TXT  Information about the configuration of the GENERIC kernel
                and supported hardware.  New installers should read this
                file.

  INSTALL.TXT   Installation instructions - new installers should read this.

  UPGRADE.TXT   Upgrading an existing FreeBSD installation

  TROUBLE.TXT   General troubleshooting information


o It is, again, very important to check the ERRATA.TXT file for any
  late-breaking issues with this release.  If you don't read the ERRATA,
  you will probably fall right into the same problems that have already
  been reported (and fixed as noted in the ERRATA).


If you're a developer/hobbiest and not interested in QA'd releases
so much as simply keeping up to date on the latest FreeBSD technology,
you can also install one of our "snapshot" releases:

For the most up-to-date software along the RELENG_4 branch
(also known as 4.3-stable), now proceeding towards the release
of FreeBSD 4.4, please install your snapshots from:

        ftp://releng4.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/

For the latest 5.0-current (HEAD branch) snapshot releases,
please install from:

        ftp://current.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD

If you plan to run either -Stable or -Current you MUST be
subscribed to the appropriate mailing list, either
freebsd-stable or freebsd-current.  For information on
subscribing to either list (or both), send an e-mail to
majordomo@freebsd.org with the following in the body, not
the subject, of the letter as appropriate:

subscribe freebsd-stable
subscribe freebsd-current
end

We hope you enjoy using FreeBSD as much as we enjoyed
creating it!
