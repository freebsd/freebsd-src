                                 RELEASE NOTES
                            FreeBSD Release 5.0-SNAP

This is a 5.0-CURRENT release SNAPshot of FreeBSD, an active
development branch which will produce its first release in early
March 2001.  Those features which have also been back-ported to
the 4.x-stable branch (the next release for which will be 4.2)
are marked [MERGED].

Any installation failures or crashes should be reported by using the
send-pr command (those preferring a Web-based interface can also see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html).

For information about FreeBSD and the layout of the 5.0-RELEASE
directory (especially if you're installing from floppies!), see

1. What's new since the 4.0/5.0 branch
--------------------------------------
All changes described here are unique to the 5.0 branch unless
specifically marked as [MERGED] features.


1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

A new event notification facility called kqueue was added to the
FreeBSD kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to replace
poll/select, offering improved performance, as well as the ability
to report many different types of events.  Support for monitoring
changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files are present, as well as
for signals and processes. [MERGED]

Support for named extended attributes was added to the FreeBSD kernel.
This allows the kernel, and appropriately privileged userland processes,
to tag files and directories with attribute data.  Extended attributes
were added to support the TrustedBSD Project, in particular ACLs,
capability data, and mandatory access control labels.

Support for Intel's Wired for Management 2.0 (PXE) was added to
the FreeBSD boot loader.  Due to API differences, the older PXE
versions are not supported.  This allow network booting using DHCP. [MERGED]

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed. [MERGED]

Added support for PCI ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 chipset, including the NetGear FA312-TX.

Due to a licensing change, softupdates have been integrated into the
main portion of the kernel source tree.  As a consequence, softupdates
are now available with the GENERIC kernel. [MERGED]

A driver for AGP hardware has been added. [MERGED]

ipfilter has been updated to 3.4.12.

Various fixes and improvements to the IPv6 code have been merged in
from the KAME project, including significantly-improved IPSEC
functionality. [MERGED]

twe 3ware ATA RAID driver added. [MERGED]

The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged 
configurations, has been added.  [MERGED]

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added.
[MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers.  In
addition, it now supports the ServerWorks ROSB4 ATA33 chipset, the CMD
648 ATA66 and CMD 649 ATA100 chipsets, and the Cyrix 5530. [MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for tagged queueing, which is
enabled by the ATA_ENABLE_TAGS option. [MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA "pseudo" RAID controllers as
the Promise Fasttrak and HighPoint HPT370 controllers. [MERGED]

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit cards. [MERGED]

The mly(4) driver, for Mylex PCI to SCSI AccelRAID and eXtremeRAID
controllers with firmware 6.x and later, has been added. [MERGED]

The asr(4) driver, which provides support for the Adaptec SCSI RAID
controller family, as well as the DPT SmartRAID V and VI families, has
been added. [MERGED]

SMP support has been largely reworked, incorporating code from BSD/OS
5.0.  One of the main features of SMPng ("SMP Next Generation") is to
allow more processes to run in kernel, without the need for spin locks
that can dramatically reduce the efficiency of multiple processors.
Interrupt handlers now have contexts associated with them that allow 
them to be blocked, which reduces the need to lock out interrupts.

The xl(4) driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B MiniPCI
adapters used on some laptops. [MERGED]

The kernel and modules have been moved to the directory /boot/kernel,
so they can be easily manipulated together.  The boot loader has been
updated to make this change as seamless as possible.

A filesystem snapshot capability has been added to FFS.  Details can 
be found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ffs/README.snapshot.

Support for the Adaptec FSA family of PCI-SCSI RAID controllers has
been added, in the form of the aac(4) driver.

The ng_mppc(4) and ng_bridge(4) node types have been added to the
netgraph subsystem.  The ng_ether(4) node is now dynamically loadable.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made. [MERGED]

The pcn(4) driver, which supports the AMD PCnet/FAST, PCnet/FAST+,
PCnet/FAST III, PCnet/PRO, PCnet/Home, and HomePNA adapters, has been added.
Although these cards are already supported by the lnc(4) driver, the pcn
driver runs these chips in 32-bit mode and uses the RX alignment feature to
achieve zero-copy receive.  This driver is also machine-independent,
so it will work on both the i386 and alpha platforms.  The lnc driver
is still needed to support non-PCI cards. [MERGED]

The i386 boot loader now has support for a "nullconsole" console type,
for use on systems with neither a video console nor a serial
port. [MERGED]

The pcm(4) driver now supports the ESS Solo 1, Maestro-1, Maestro-2,
and Maestro-2e; Forte Media fm801, ESS Maestro-2e, and VIA Technologies
VT82C686A sound card/chipsets, and has received some other updates.
[MERGED]

Replace the PQ_*CACHE options with a single PQ_CACHESIZE option to be
set to the cache size in kilobytes.  The old options are still
supported for backwards compatibility. [MERGED]

The NCPU, NAPIC, NBUS, and NINTR kernel configuration options,
for configuring SMP kernels, have been removed.  NCPU is now set to a 
maximum of 16, and the other, aforementioned options are now dynamic.
[MERGED]

The ahc(4) driver has been updated.  [MERGED]

ACPI support has been merged in from the FreeBSD-ACPI project.

isdn4bsd has been updated to version 0.96.00

Support for Fujitsu MB86960A/MB86965A based Ethernet PC-Cards is back.
[MERGED]

devfs, which allows entries in the /dev directory to be built
automatically and supports more flexible attachment of devices,
has been largely reworked.

Preliminary Cardbus support under NEWCARD has been added.  This supports
TI113X, TI12XX, TI125X, Ricoh 5C46/5C47, Topic 95/97/100 and
Cirrus Logic PD683X bridges.  16-bit PC Card support under this is not yet
functional.

Write combining for crashdumps has been implemented.  This feature
is useful when write caching is disabled on both SCSI and IDE disks,
where large memory dumps could take up to an hour to complete.

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.15.  New tuner types have
been added, and improvememts to the KLD module and to memory
allocation have been made. [MERGED]

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.17.  This fixes bugs in devfs
when unloading and reloading, and syncs with some NetBSD
changes. [MERGED]

The bktr(4) driver has been updated to 2.18.  This adds support for
new Hauppauge Model 44xxx WinTV Cards (the ones with no audio mux).

Extremely large swap areas (>67 GB) no longer panic the system.

The snc(4) driver for the National Semiconductor DP8393X (SONIC)
Ethernet controller.  Curently, this driver is only used on the PC-98
architecture. [MERGED]

The ich(4) driver for the Intel 82801AA (ICH) SMBus controller and
compatibles has been added. [MERGED]

The Inode Filesystem (IFS) has been added; more information can be
found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ifs/README.

The uscanner(4) driver for basic USB scanner support using SANE. See
the SANE home page for supported scanners. HP ScanJet 4100C, 5200C
and 6300C are known to be working.

The umodem(4) driver for USB modems. Supported so far is only the 
3Com 5605 USB modem.

The ncv, nsp, and stg drivers have been ported from NetBSD/pc98. 
They supports NCR 53C50 / Workbit Ninja SCSI-3 / TMC 18C30, 18C50 
based PC-Card/ISA SCSI controllers.

The cd(4) driver now has support for write operations.  This allows
writing to DVD-RAM, PD and similar drives that probe as CD devices.
Note that change affects only random-access writeable devices, not
sequential-only writeable devices such as CD-R drives, which are
supported by cdrecord.


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------

sysinstall(8) now allows the user to select one of three "security
profiles" at install-time.  These profiles enable different levels of
system security by enabling or disabling various system services in
rc.conf(5) on new installs. [MERGED]

rlogind(8), rshd(8), and fingerd(8) are now disabled by default in
/etc/inetd.conf.  This only affects new installations.  [MERGED]

String-handling library calls in many programs were fixed to reduce the
possibility of buffer overflow-related exploits.  [MERGED]

TCP now uses stronger randomness in choosing its initial sequence 
numbers (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-00:52). [MERGED]


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

cdcontrol(1) now supports a "cdid" command, which calculates and
displays the CD serial number, using the same algorithm used by the CDDB
database. [MERGED]

mtree(8) now includes support for a file listing pathnames to be excluded
when creating and verifying prototypes.  This makes it easier to use
mtree as a part of an intrusion-detection system.  [MERGED]

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.5a, which includes numerous bugfixes
and enhancements. [MERGED]

The OPIE one-time-password suite has been updated to 2.32. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.1.0, which provides support for the
SSH2 protocol, including DSA keys.  Therefore, OpenSSH users in the US
no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed RSAREF toolkit
which is required to handle RSA keys.  OpenSSH 2.1 interoperates well
with other SSH2 clients and servers, including the ssh2 port.  See
http://www.openssh.com for more details. [MERGED]

OpenSSH can now authenticate using OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.
Support is not yet available in SSH2 mode. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.2.0.  ssh-add(1) and ssh-agent(1) can now
handle DSA keys.  An sftp server interoperable with ssh.com clients
and others has been added.  scp(1) can now handle files >2GB.
Interoperability with other ssh2 clients/servers has been improved.  A
new feature to limit the number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh
connections in sshd has been added. [MERGED]

Support for USB devices was added to the GENERIC kernel and to the
installation programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that
an AT keyboard must still be used during the initial install, but it
should work fine afterwards. [MERGED]

The entire i386 bootstrap was revamped to support automatic detection and
use of the Enhanced Disk Drive BIOS extensions to support booting beyond
the 1023rd cylinder.  As part of this change, the FreeBSD boot manager
(boot0) was increased from 1 sector in size (512 bytes), to 2 sectors in
length (1024 bytes).  As a result, several userland changes were made to
cope with MBR boot loaders of varying sizes. [MERGED]

The csh(1) shell has been replaced by tcsh(1), although it can still
be run as csh(1). [MERGED]

The more(1) command has been replaced by less(1), although it can still
be run as more(1). [MERGED]

ls(1) can produce colorized listings with the -G flag (and appropriate
terminal support). [MERGED]

libalias(3) and natd(8) now support RFC 2391 (Load Sharing using IP
Network Address Translation), as well as new translation options.
[MERGED]

FreeBSD can now be installed over an IPv6-only network. [MERGED]

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.1.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README); newaliases is limited to root and
trusted users; STARTTLS encryption; and the MSA port (587) is turned on by
default.  See /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more
information. [MERGED]

mail.local(8) is no longer installed as a set-user-id binary.  If you are
using a /etc/mail/sendmail.cf from the default sendmail.cf included with
FreeBSD any time after 3.1.0, you are fine.  If you are using a
hand-configured sendmail.cf and mail.local for delivery, check to make sure
the F=S flag is set on the Mlocal line.  Those with .mc files who need to
add the flag can do so by adding the following line to their your .mc file
and regenerating the sendmail.cf file:
    MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+S')dnl
Note that FEATURE(`local_lmtp') already does this. [MERGED]

The default /etc/mail/sendmail.cf disables the SMTP EXPN and VRFY
commands. [MERGED]

vacation(1) has been updated to use the version included with
sendmail. [MERGED]

The sendmail(8) configuration building tools are installed in
/usr/share/sendmail/cf/. [MERGED]

awk has been upgraded from gawk-3.0.4 to gawk-3.0.6.  This fixes a number
of non-critical bugs and includes a few performance tweaks.

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22. [MERGED]

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length
of files, has been added.  [MERGED]

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request. [MERGED]

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added. 
[MERGED]

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
and /etc/periodic.conf. [MERGED]

boot98cfg(8), a PC-98 boot manager installation and configuration
utility, has been added. [MERGED]

logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog. [MERGED]

GDB now supports hardware watchpoints (using the kernel's debug register
support that has been introduced in FreeBSD 4.0). [MERGED]

which(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.

killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1). [MERGED]

finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file. [MERGED]

nsswitch support has been merged from NetBSD.  By creating an
nsswitch.conf(5) file, FreeBSD can be configured so that various 
databases such as passwd(5) and group(5) can be looked up using flat 
files, NIS, or Hesiod.  The old hosts.conf(5) file is no longer used.

sshd X11Forwarding is now turned on by default on server (any risk is
to the client, where it is already disabled by default).

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer
required for USA residents. [MERGED]

sshd now enabled by default on new installs. [MERGED]

perl has been updated to version 5.6.0.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.0. [MERGED]

libreadline has been upgraded to 4.1. [MERGED]

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an interface. 
[MERGED]

setproctitle(3) has been moved from libutil to libc. [MERGED]

chio(1) now has the ability to specify elements by volume tag instead
of by their physical location as well as the ability to return an
element to its previous location. [MERGED]

sed(1) now takes a -E option for extended regular expression
support. [MERGED]

ln(1) now takes an -i option to request user configuration before
overwriting an existing file. [MERGED]

Version numbers of installed packages have a new (backward-compatible)
syntax, which supports the "PORTREVISION" and "PORTEPOCH" variables in
ports collection makefiles.  These changes help keep track of changes
in the ports collection entries such as security patches or
FreeBSD-specific updates, which aren't reflected in the original,
third-party software distributions.  pkg_version(1) can now compare
these new-style version numbers.  [MERGED]

cvs(1) has been updated to 1.11. [MERGED]

tcpdump(1) has received some updates and bugfixes. [MERGED]

User-land ppp(8) has received a number of updates and bugfixes. [MERGED]

To improve performance and disk utilization, the "ports skeletons" in
the FreeBSD Ports Collection have been restructured.  Installed ports
and packages should not be affected. [MERGED]

make(1) has gained the :C/// (regexp substitution), :L (lowercase),
and :U (uppercase) variable modifiers.  These were added to reduce the
differences between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD/NetBSD make programs. [MERGED]

fsck wrappers have been imported; this feature provides infrastructure
for fsck(8) to work on different types of filesystems (analogous to
mount(8) and mount_*(8)).

ncurses has been updated to ncurses-5.1-20001009. [MERGED]

gperf has been updated to 2.7.2.

style.perl.7, a style guide for Perl code in the FreeBSD base system,
has been added.

The ISC library from the BIND distribution is now built as
libisc. [MERGED]

The "in use" percentage metric displayed by netstat(1) now really
reflects the percentage of network mbufs used. [MERGED]

mergemaster(8) has gained some new features, has been cleaned up
somewhat, and is now more cross-platform friendly.

The compiler chain now uses the FSF-supplied C/C++ runtime
initialization code.  This change brings about better compatability
with code generated from the various egcs and gcc ports, as well as
the stock public FSF source. [MERGED]

BIND has been updated to v8.2.3-T6B.


2. Supported Configurations
---------------------------

FreeBSD currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA, MCA and PCI
bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium class machines (though the
386sx is not recommended).  Support for generic IDE or ESDI drive
configurations, various SCSI controller, network and serial cards is
also provided.

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.FreeBSD.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.x-RELEASE and 3.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite D
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.FreeBSD.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you should
definitely join the -current mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!
