1. What's new since the 4.0/5.0 branch
--------------------------------------
All changes described here are unique to the 5.0 branch unless
specifically marked as [MERGED] features.


1.1. KERNEL CHANGES
-------------------

A new event notification facility called kqueue was added to the
FreeBSD kernel.  This is a new interface which is able to replace
poll/select, offering improved performance, as well as the ability
to report many different types of events.  Support for monitoring
changes in sockets, pipes, fifos, and files are present, as well as
for signals and processes. [MERGED]

Support for named extended attributes was added to the FreeBSD kernel.
This allows the kernel, and appropriately privileged userland processes,
to tag files and directories with attribute data.  Extended attributes
were added to support the TrustedBSD Project, in particular ACLs,
capability data, and mandatory access control labels.

Support for Intel's Wired for Management 2.0 (PXE) was added to
the FreeBSD boot loader.  Due to API differences, the older PXE
versions are not supported.  This allow network booting using DHCP. [MERGED]

POSIX.1b Shared Memory Objects are now supported.  The implementation
uses regular files, but automatically enables the MAP_NOSYNC flag
when they are mmap(2)ed. [MERGED]

Added support for PCI ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 chipset, including the NetGear FA312-TX.

Due to a licensing change, softupdates have been integrated into the
main portion of the kernel source tree.  As a consequence, softupdates
are now available with the GENERIC kernel. [MERGED]

A driver for AGP hardware has been added. [MERGED]

ipfilter has been updated to 3.4.9.

Various fixes and improvements to the IPv6 code have been merged in
from the KAME project, including significantly-improved IPSEC
functionality. [MERGED]

twe 3ware ATA RAID driver added. [MERGED]

The tap driver, a virtual Ethernet device driver for bridged 
configurations, has been added.  [MERGED]

accept_filters, a kernel feature to reduce overheads when accepting
and reading new connections on listening sockets, has been added.
[MERGED]

The ata(4) driver now has support for ATA100 controllers. [MERGED]

The ti(4) driver now supports the Alteon AceNIC 1000baseT Gigabit
Ethernet and Netgear GA620T 1000baseT Gigabit cards. [MERGED]

The mly(4) driver, for Mylex PCI to SCSI AccelRAID and eXtremeRAID
controllers with firmware 6.x and later, has been added.

The asr(4) driver, which provides support for the Adaptec SCSI RAID
controller family, as well as the DPT SmartRAID V and VI families, has
been added.

SMP support has been largely reworked, incorporating code from BSD/OS
5.0.

The xl(4) driver now supports the 3Com 3C556 and 3C556B MiniPCI
adapters used on some laptops. [MERGED]

The boot loader has been updated.  The new default kernel is now 
/boot/kernel/kernel.ko.  The new default module location is 
/boot/kernel/.

A filesystem snapshot capability has been added to FFS.  Details can 
be found in /usr/src/sys/ufs/ffs/README.snapshot.

Support for the Adaptec FSA family of PCI-SCSI RAID controllers has
been added, in the form of the aac(4) driver.

The ng_mppc(4) and ng_bridge(4) node types have been added to the
netgraph subsystem.  The ng_ether(4) node is now dynamically loadable.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements have also been made. [MERGED]


1.2. SECURITY FIXES
-------------------


1.3. USERLAND CHANGES
---------------------

cdcontrol(1) now supports a "cdid" command, which calculates and
displays the CD serial number, using the same algorithm used by the CDDB
database. [MERGED]

mtree(8) now includes support for a file listing pathnames to be excluded
when creating and verifying prototypes.  This makes it easier to use
mtree as a part of an intrusion-detection system.  [MERGED]

OpenSSL has been upgraded to 0.9.5a, which includes numerous bugfixes
and enhancements. [MERGED]

The OPIE one-time-password suite has been updated to 2.32. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.1.0, which provides support for the
SSH2 protocol, including DSA keys.  Therefore, OpenSSH users in the US
no longer need to rely on the restrictively-licensed RSAREF toolkit
which is required to handle RSA keys.  OpenSSH 2.1 interoperates well
with other SSH2 clients and servers, including the ssh2 port.  See
http://www.openssh.com for more details. [MERGED]

OpenSSH can now authenticate using OPIE passwords in SSH1 mode.
Support is not yet available in SSH2 mode. [MERGED]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to 2.2.0.  ssh-add(1) and ssh-agent(1) can now
handle DSA keys.  An sftp server interoperable with ssh.com clients
and others has been added.  scp(1) can now handle files >2GB.
Interoperability with other ssh2 clients/servers has been improved.  A
new feature to limit the number of outstanding unauthenticated ssh
connections in sshd has been added.

Support for USB devices was added to the GENERIC kernel and to the
installation programs to support USB devices out of the box.  Note that
an AT keyboard must still be used during the initial install, but it
should work fine afterwards. [MERGED]

The entire i386 bootstrap was revamped to support automatic detection and
use of the Enhanced Disk Drive BIOS extensions to support booting beyond
the 1023rd cylinder.  As part of this change, the FreeBSD boot manager
(boot0) was increased from 1 sector in size (512 bytes), to 2 sectors in
length (1024 bytes).  As a result, several userland changes were made to
cope with MBR boot loaders of varying sizes. [MERGED]

The csh(1) shell has been replaced by tcsh(1), although it can still
be run as csh(1). [MERGED]

The more(1) command has been replaced by less(1), although it can still
be run as more(1). [MERGED]

ls(1) can produce colorized listings with the -G flag (and appropriate
terminal support). [MERGED]

libalias(3) and natd(8) now support RFC 2391 (Load Sharing using IP
Network Address Translation), as well as new translation options.
[MERGED]

FreeBSD can now be installed over an IPv6-only network. [MERGED]

sendmail upgraded from version 8.9.3 to version 8.11.0.  Important changes
include: new default file locations (see
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README); newaliases is limited to root and
trusted users; and the MSA port (587) is turned on by default.  See
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more information. [MERGED]

awk has been upgraded from gawk-3.0.4 to gawk-3.0.6.  This fixes a number
of non-critical bugs and includes a few performance tweaks.

routed(8) has been updated to version 2.22. [MERGED]

The truncate(1) utility, which truncates or extends the length
of files, has been added.  [MERGED]

syslogd(8) can take a -n option to disable DNS queries for every
request. [MERGED]

kenv(1), a command to dump the kernel environment, has been added. 
[MERGED]

The behavior of periodic(8) is now controlled by /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
and /etc/periodic.conf. [MERGED]

boot98cfg(8), a PC-98 boot manager installation and configuration
utility, has been added. [MERGED]

logger(1) can now send messages directly to a remote syslog. [MERGED]

GDB now supports hardware watchpoints (using the kernel's debug register
support that has been introduced in FreeBSD 4.0). [MERGED]

which(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.

killall(1) is now a C program, rather than a Perl script.  As a
result, killall's -m option now uses the regular expression syntax of
regex(3), rather than that of perl(1). [MERGED]

finger(1) now has the ability to support fingering aliases, via the
finger.conf(5) file. [MERGED]

nsswitch support has been merged from NetBSD.  By creating an
nsswitch.conf(5) file, FreeBSD can be configured so that various 
databases such as passwd(5) and group(5) can be looked up using flat 
files, NIS, or Hesiod.  The old hosts.conf(5) file is no longer used.

sshd X11Forwarding is now turned on by default on server (any risk is
to the client, where it is already disabled by default).

RSA Security has waived all patent rights to the RSA algorithm (two
weeks before the patent was due to expire).  As a result, the native
OpenSSL implementation of the RSA algorithm is now activated by
default, and the rsaref port and librsaUSA are no longer
required for USA residents. [MERGED]

sshd now enabled by default on new installs. [MERGED]

perl has been updated to version 5.6.0.

Binutils have been upgraded to 2.10.0. [MERGED]

libreadline has been upgraded to 4.1. [MERGED]

The ifconfig(8) command can set the link-layer address of an interface. 
[MERGED]

bktr(4) driver update to 2.1.5.  New tuner types have been added, 
and improvememts to the KLD module and to memory allocation have been
made. [MERGED]


2. Supported Configurations

3. Obtaining FreeBSD
--------------------

You may obtain FreeBSD in a variety of ways:


3.1. FTP/Mail
-------------

You can ftp FreeBSD and any or all of its optional packages from
`ftp.freebsd.org' - the official FreeBSD release site.

For other locations that mirror the FreeBSD software see the file
MIRROR.SITES.  Please ftp the distribution from the site closest (in
networking terms) to you.  Additional mirror sites are always welcome!
Contact freebsd-admin@FreeBSD.org for more details if you'd like to 
become an official mirror site.

If you do not have access to the Internet and electronic mail is your
only recourse, then you may still fetch the files by sending mail to
`ftpmail@ftpmail.vix.com' - putting the keyword "help" in your message
to get more information on how to fetch files using this mechanism.
Please do note, however, that this will end up sending many *tens of
megabytes* through the mail and should only be employed as an absolute
LAST resort!


3.2. CDROM
----------

FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE and 3.x-RELEASE CDs may be ordered on CDROM from:

        Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite D
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-925-674-0783, +1-925-674-0821 (FAX)

Or via the Internet from orders@cdrom.com or http://www.cdrom.com.
Their current catalog can be obtained via ftp from:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/cdrom/catalog

Cost per -RELEASE CD is $39.95 or $24.95 with a FreeBSD subscription.
FreeBSD SNAPshot CDs, when available, are $39.95 or $14.95 with a
FreeBSD-SNAP subscription (-RELEASE and -SNAP subscriptions are entirely
separate).  With a subscription, you will automatically receive updates as
they are released.  Your credit card will be billed when each disk is
shipped and you may cancel your subscription at any time without further
obligation.

Shipping (per order not per disc) is $5 in the US, Canada or Mexico
and $9.00 overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American
Express or checks in U.S. Dollars and ship COD within the United
States.  California residents please add 8.25% sales tax.

Should you be dissatisfied for any reason, the CD comes with an
unconditional return policy.


4. Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD
----------------------------------------------

If you're upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD, most likely
it's 3.0 and there may be some issues affecting you, depending
of course on your chosen method of upgrading.  There are two popular
ways of upgrading FreeBSD distributions:

        o Using sources, via /usr/src
        o Using sysinstall's (binary) upgrade option.

Please read the UPGRADE.TXT file for more information, preferably
before beginning an upgrade.


5. Reporting problems, making suggestions, submitting code.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions, bug reports and contributions of code are always
valued - please do not hesitate to report any problems you may find
(preferably with a fix attached, if you can!).

The preferred method to submit bug reports from a machine with
Internet mail connectivity is to use the send-pr command or use the CGI
script at http://www.freebsd.org/send-pr.html.  Bug reports
will be dutifully filed by our faithful bugfiler program and you can
be sure that we'll do our best to respond to all reported bugs as soon
as possible.  Bugs filed in this way are also visible on our WEB site
in the support section and are therefore valuable both as bug reports
and as "signposts" for other users concerning potential problems to
watch out for.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the send-pr command to
submit a bug report, you can try to send it to:

                freebsd-bugs@FreeBSD.org

Note that send-pr itself is a shell script that should be easy to move
even onto a totally different system.  We much prefer if you could use
this interface, since it make it easier to keep track of the problem
reports.  However, before submitting, please try to make sure whether
the problem might have already been fixed since.


Otherwise, for any questions or tech support issues, please send mail to:

                freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.org


If you're tracking the -current development efforts, you should
definitely join the -current mailing list, in order to keep abreast
of recent developments and changes that may affect the way you
use and maintain the system:

		freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org


Additionally, being a volunteer effort, we are always happy to have
extra hands willing to help - there are already far more desired
enhancements than we'll ever be able to manage by ourselves!  To
contact us on technical matters, or with offers of help, please send
mail to:

                freebsd-hackers@FreeBSD.org


Please note that these mailing lists can experience *significant*
amounts of traffic and if you have slow or expensive mail access and
are only interested in keeping up with significant FreeBSD events, you
may find it preferable to subscribe instead to:

                freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org


All of the mailing lists can be freely joined by anyone wishing
to do so.  Send mail to MajorDomo@FreeBSD.org and include the keyword
`help' on a line by itself somewhere in the body of the message.  This
will give you more information on joining the various lists, accessing
archives, etc.  There are a number of mailing lists targeted at
special interest groups not mentioned here, so send mail to majordomo
and ask about them!
