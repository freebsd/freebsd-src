1.  What and Where is XFree86?
------------------------------

XFree86 is a port of X11R6 that supports several versions of Intel-
based Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2, which was the X server
distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many new features
and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The release
is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6 code, as
well as binary distributions for many architectures.

See the Copyright Notice (COPYRIGHT.html).

The sources for XFree86 are available as part of the FreeBSD 2.1
distribution, or by anonymous ftp from:

ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current
(ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current)


Binaries for XFree86 on FreeBSD are also available as part of
2.0.5 or from:

ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current/binaries/FreeBSD-2.0

comments or suggestions about this file and we'll revise it.


2.  Installing the Binaries
---------------------------

In the FreeBSD 2.1 distribution, XFree86 comes in 3 major sections:
"basic" distributions, fonts and servers.  At the minimum, you will
need the binaries and libraries from the basic distribution, the
"misc" fonts collection and at least one server.  The smallest usable
distribution is around 9MB.

If you can't decide what to pick and you have 52Mb of disk
space, it's safe to unpack everything.

What follows is a description of the various distribution files
comprising XFree86.  If you are installing this as part of FreeBSD 2.1
then there's no need to use these files directly: You may simply check
the desired components off the installation menus provided for that
purpose.  If you're installing this manually, then the following
information should prove useful:

   Required (6.7Mb):

      X312bin.tgz
         all the executable X client applications and shared libs

      X312fnts.tgz
         the misc and 75 dpi fonts

      X312lib.tgz
         data files needed at runtime


   Required unless you have already customized your configuration
      files:

      X312xicf.tgz
         customizable xinit runtime configuration file

      X312xdcf.tgz
         customizable xdm runtime configuration file

   Choose at least one server ( 2.3Mb):

         (.5Mb) PEX fonts and shared libs needed by PEX applications.

      X312lbx.tgz
         (.2Mb) low bandwidth X proxy server and libraries.

Note that there is no longer a separate xdm archive.  FreeBSD 2.0
and later handles this in shared libraries now, so that the xdm
binary does not itself contain des and there is no more need for
us to provide separate tar balls.


2.1.  Full Install:
-------------------

[ Note:  Unless you're installing XFree86 3.1.2 manually, that is
  to say not as part of the FreeBSD 2.1 installation, you may skip
  to section 2.3 ]

   1. You must be logged in as root to unpack the archives because
      several executables are set-user-id.  Otherwise the server may
      abort if you unpack it as an ordinary user.  You must also use a
      ``umask'' value of 022 because the X server requires special
      permissions.

         % su
         # umask 022


   2. If you have 52Mb free in the /usr partition ``cd /usr'' and skip
      to no. 3.  Otherwise, create a directory on another partition
      and sym link it into /usr:

         # cd /usr/local
         # mkdir X11R6
         # ln -s /usr/local/X11R6 /usr/X11R6


   3. Unpack everything:

      If you are using sh (as root usually does):

         # for i in X312*.tgz; do
         #   tar -xzf $i
         # done


   Else, if you are using csh:

         % foreach i (X312*.tgz)
         %   tar -xzf $i
         % end


   4. Create a symbolic link ``X'' that points to the server that
      matches your video card.  The XF86_* man pages list which vga
      chip sets are supported by each server.  For example, if you
      have an ET4000 based card you will use the XF86_SVGA server:

         # cd /usr/X11R6/bin; rm X; ln -s XF86_SVGA X


2.2.  Minimal Install:
----------------------

First do numbers 1 and 2 above. Then unpack the required archives:

      # for i in bin fnts lib xicf; do
      #   tar -xzf  X312$i.tgz
      # done


Then unpack a server archive corresponding to your vga card.  The
server man pages, X11R6/man/man1/XF86_*, list the vga chip sets
supported by each server.  For example, if you have an ET4000 based
card you will use the XF86_SVGA server:

      # tar -xzf X312SVGA.tgz
      # cd /usr/X11R6/bin; rm X; ln -s XF86_SVGA X


2.3.  After either Full or Minimal Install above:
-------------------------------------------------

Add /usr/X11R6/bin to the default path for sh in /etc/profile and for
csh in /etc/csh.login if they are not already there:

      # echo 'set path = ($path /usr/X11R6/bin)' >>/etc/csh.login
      # echo 'PATH=$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin' >>/etc/profile


Or make sure all who use X put /usr/X11R6/bin in their shell's
``path'' variable.

Next either reboot or invoke ldconfig as root to put the shared
libraries in ld.so's cache:

      # ldconfig /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/X11R6/lib


If you had already configured X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc or
X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/* omit the xinit-config or xdm-config archive or
unpack it separately and merge in your customizations.

The fscl and f100 archives are optional and can be omitted if you are
short on space.  The optional link archive allows you to reconfigure
and customize a X server binary.  The optional prog archive is needed
only for writing or compiling X applications.  The optional pex
archive contains pex clients and libraries for building 3D graphics
applications.

     NOTE: You don't need to uncompress the font files, but if
     you uncompress them anyway you must run mkfontdir in the
     corresponding font directory; otherwise your server will
     abort with the message ``could not open default font
     'fixed'''.

3.  Installing The Display Manager (xdm)
----------------------------------------

The display manager makes your PC look like an X terminal.  That is,
it presents you with a login screen that runs under X.

The easiest way to automatically start the display manager on boot is
to add a line in /etc/ttys to start it on one of the unoccupied
virtual terminals:

      ttyv4  "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon" xterm    on secure

You should also make sure that /usr/X11R6/bin/X is a symbolic link to
the Xserver that matches your video card or edit the file Xservers in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm to specify the pathname of the X server.

The change to /etc/ttys won't take effect until you either reboot or
``kill -HUP 1'' to force initd to reread /etc/ttys.  You can also test
the display manager manually by loging in as root on the console and
typing ``xdm -nodaemon''.


4.  Configuring X for Your Hardware
-----------------------------------

The XF86Config file tells the X server what kind of monitor, video
card and mouse you have.  You must create it to tell the server what
specific hardware you have.

If you are installing XFree86 as part of FreeBSD 2.1, you may invoke
XF86Config automatically from the FreeBSD configuration menu.  You
should still read this document first, however, as it contains
valuable information on mouse and VGA card selection below.

XFree86 3.1 uses a new configuration file format. Consult the
XF86Config man page and the general INSTALL (INSTALL.html) file for
instructions.

If you have a Xconfig file for XFree86 2.x, use reconfig to translate
part of it into the new format:

      # reconfig <Xconfig >XF86Config

and complete the rest according to the XF86Config man page and the
XF86Config.sample file as a template.

In order to protect your hardware from damage, the server no longer
will read XF86Config files from a user's home directory, but requires
that it be in /etc/XF86Config, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.hostname
or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.

You'll need info on your hardware:

   o  Your mouse type, baud rate and it's /dev entry.

   o  The video card's chipset (e.g. ET4000, S3, etc).

   o  Your monitor's sync frequencies.

Bus Mice:

In FreeBSD, the bus mouse is generally found on /dev/mse0.  Specify
/dev/mse0 when asked, and in case of failure ensure that your Bus
mouse was indeed "probed" when the system was booted.  To make
sure of this, type:

      % dmesg | grep mse

If you do not see something like this:
      mse0 at 0x23c irq 5 on isa

then it means that your bus mouse was not detected properly and you
should reboot with the `-c' flag and verify that the device entry for
mse0 matches your bus mouse settings.

If the mouse is probed properly but still fails to function then you
might double check that the /dev entry for the bus mouse exists.  Use
the script /dev/MAKEDEV to create the entry if it doesn't already
exist, e.g:

      % cd /dev
      % sh MAKEDEV mse0


Serial Mice:

The easiest way to find which port your mouse is plugged into is to
use ``cat'' or ``kermit'' to look at the output of the mouse.  Connect
to it and just make sure that it generates output when the mouse is
moved or clicked.  If your mouse is plugged into the first serial port
(COM1), for example, you could do this:

      % cat < /dev/cuaa0

Where /dev/cuaa0 represents the first serial port, /dev/cuaa1 the
second, /dev/cuaa2 the third and so on.

If you can't find the right mouse port then use ``dmesg | grep sio''
to get a list of serial devices that were detected at boot time:

      % dmesg|grep sio
      sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa

The presence of sio0 will indicate that COM1 was found.  If you see
sio1, sio2 or sio3 then it means that a serial port was found at one
of the other com addresses and you should use the appropriate
/dev/cuaa<n> device entry to talk to it.

If things still aren't working then double check that the /dev entries
corresponding to these devices exist.  Use the script /dev/MAKEDEV to
create entries if they don't already exist, e.g:

      % cd /dev
      % sh MAKEDEV cuaa0 [cuaa1, cuaa2, etc..]

If you plan to fine tune the screen size or position on your monitor
you'll need the specs for sync frequencies from your monitor's manual.


5.  Running X
-------------

8mb of memory is a recommended minimum for running X.  The server,
window manager, display manager and an xterm take about 8Mb of virtual
memory themselves.  Even if their resident set size is smaller, on a
8Mb system that leaves very space for other applications such as gcc
that expect a few meg free.  The R6 X servers may work with 4Mb of
memory, but in practice compilation while running X can take 5 or 10
times as long due to constant paging.

The easiest way for new users to start X windows is to type ``startx
>& startx.log''.  Error messages are lost unless you redirect them
because the server takes over the screen.

To get out of X windows, type: ``exit'' in the console xterm.  You can
customize your X by creating .xinitrc, .xserverrc, and .twmrc files in
your home directory as described in the xinit and startx man pages.


6.  Rebuilding Kernels for X
----------------------------

The GENERIC FreeBSD 2.x kernel supports XFree86 without any
modifications required.  You do not need to make any changes to the
GENERIC kernel or any kernel configuration which is a superset.

For a general description of BSD kernel configuration get
smm.02.config.ps.Z
(ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/BSD/manuals/smm.02.config.ps.Z).  It is
a ready-to-print postscript copy of the kernel configuration chapter
from the system maintainers manual.

Alternatively, you can read the kernel configuration section of the
FreeBSD handbook (http://www.freebsd.org/handbook).

If you do decide to reduce your kernel configuration file, do not
remove the two lines below (in /sys/arch/i386/conf).  They are both
required for X support:

      options                XSERVER                 #Xserver
      options                UCONSOLE                #X Console support

The generic FreeBSD 2.x kernel is configured by default with the
syscons driver.  To configure your kernel similarly, it should have a
line like this in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC:

      device         sc0     at isa? port "IO_KBD" tty irq 1 vector scintr

The maximum number of virtual consoles can be set using the MAXCONS
option:

      options                "MAXCONS=4"               #4 virtual consoles


Otherwise, the default without a line like this is 12.  You must have
more VTs than gettys as described in the end of section 3, and 4 is a
reasonable minimum.

The server supports several console drivers: pccons, syscons and pcvt.
The syscons driver is the default in FreeBSD 1.1.5 and higher.  They
are detected at runtime and no configuration of the server itself is
required.

The pcvt console driver is bundled into FreeBSD and may be enabled
by changing the `sc0' line in your kernel configuration file to
`vt0'.  See /sys/i386/conf/LINT for more details.

The XFree86 servers include support for the MIT-SHM extension.  The
GENERIC kernel does not support this, so if you want to make use of
this, you will need a kernel configured with SYSV shared memory
support.  To do this, add the following line to your kernel config
file:

      options                SYSVSHM                 # System V shared memory
      options                SYSVSEM                 # System V semaphores
      options                SYSVMSG                 # System V message queues


If you are using a SoundBlaster 16 on IRQ 2 (9), then you need a patch
for sb16_dsp.c.  Otherwise a kernel configured with the SoundBlaster
driver will claim interrupt 9 doesn't exist and X server will lock up.

S3 cards and serial port COM 4 cannot be installed together on a
system because the I/O port addresses overlap.


7.  Rebuilding XFree86
----------------------

The server link kit allows you to build an X server using a minimum
amount of disk space.  Just unpack it, make the appropriate changes to
site.def, type ``./mkmf' and ``make'' to link the server.  See
README.LinkKit (LinkKit.html) for more info.

The source tree takes about 114Mb before compiling and an additional
100Mb after ``make World''.  You should configure the distribution by
editing xf86site.def and site.def in xc/config/cf before compiling.
By default, the config files are set up to build shared libraries.  If
you are running a version of FreeBSD that doesn't include shared
library support, add the following line to site.def:

      #define BuildBsdSharedLibs             NO

If your system doesn't have support or SYSV shared memory (for
example, if you don't have the <sys/shm.h> header), you should disable
the MIT-SHM extension by adding the following line to site.def:

      #define HasShm                         NO

To compile the sources on FreeBSD 1.1 and later, type:

      make World


8.  Building Other X Clients
----------------------------

The easiest way to build a new client (X application) is to use xmkmf
if an Imakefile is included with it.  Type ``xmkmf -a'' to create the
Makefiles, then type ``make''.  Whenever you install additional man
pages you should update whatis.db by running ``makewhatis
/usr/X11R6/man''.

Note: Starting with XFree86 2.1 and FreeBSD 1.1, the symbol __386BSD__
no longer gets defined either by the compiler or via the X config
files for FreeBSD systems.  When porting clients to BSD systems, make
use of the symbol BSD for code which is truly BSD-specific.  The value
of the symbol can be used to distinguish different BSD releases.  For
example, code specific to the Net-2 and later releases can use:

     #if (BSD >= 199103)

To ensure that this symbol is correctly defined, include <sys/param.h>
in the source that requires it.  Note that the symbol CSRG_BASED is
defined for *BSD systems in XFree86 3.1.1 and later.  This should be
used to protect the inclusion of <sys/param.h>.

For code that really is specific to a particular i386 BSD port, use
__FreeBSD__ for FreeBSD, __NetBSD__ for NetBSD, __386BSD__ for 386BSD,
and __bsdi__ for BSD/386.
