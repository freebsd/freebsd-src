# bininst - perform the last stage of installation by somehow getting
# a bindist onto the user's disk and unpacking it.  The name bininst
# is actually something of a misnomer, since this utility will install
# more than just the bindist set.

If you didn't create any users with adduser, you can at least log in

that you can easily wipe out your system if you're not careful!

There are many useful pre-compiled packages for ${DISTNAME}
available which you may also wish to investigate.  Look in:
