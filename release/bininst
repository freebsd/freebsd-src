# is actually something of a misnomer, since this utility will install
# more than just the bindist set.

make sure your cables are plugged in and ready to go.  If you're

At the very least, you may wish to check out the 'tzsetup' command;
it will at least handle the first checklist item for you. \n

There are also many useful pre-compiled packages for ${DISTNAME}
available which you may wish to investigate.  Look in:
