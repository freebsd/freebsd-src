---- System Update Information:

o  Root mountpoint change which affects those upgrading via "make world"
   or a FreeBSD 2.2.6 upgrade.

Fix:  2.2.6 introduces a change in the naming of the device from
which the root filesystem is mounted.  This change affects all systems,
however user intervention is only required for systems undergoing an
upgrade installation.

Previously, the root filesystem was always mounted from the
compatibility slice, while other partitions on the same disk were
mounted from their true slice.  This might, for example, have resulted
in an /etc/fstab file like:

# Device      Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
/dev/wd0s2b   none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/wd0a     /               ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/wd0s2f   /local0         ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/wd0s2e   /usr            ufs     rw              1       1

For FreeBSD 2.2.6 and later, this format changes so that the device for
'/' is consistent with others, ie.

# Device      Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
/dev/wd0s2b   none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/wd0s2a   /               ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/wd0s2f   /local0         ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/wd0s2e   /usr            ufs     rw              1       1


If /etc/fstab is not updated manually in this case, the system will
issue a warning message whenever / is mounted (normally at startup)
indicating the change that must be made.  In addition, trouble may be
experienced if the root filesystem is not correctly unmounted, whereby
the root filesystem will not be marked clean at the next reboot.

This change should be made as soon as the upgraded system has been
successfully rebooted.
