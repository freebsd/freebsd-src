---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 2.2.7:	None

---- System Update Information:

o XFree86:  The XF86Setup utility sometimes fails with an XIO
  error (visible on the 2nd VTY) rather than starting properly if you
  run it during system installation time.  This is not a new bug and
  has been seen in previous releases of FreeBSD, but it seems to happen
  far more reliably with 2.2.7 now (for some as yet unknown reason).

Fix: Should this happen to you, run /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86Setup by hand
     after the system comes up off the hard disk for the first time.
     For some reason, when not run off the boot floppy or CD, it works
     perfectly (making this one somewhat more difficult to debug).


o    Release notes state that Texas Instruments ThunderLAN PCI NICs are
     supported in 2.2.7.

Fix: This was an embarassing mis-merge from the 3.0 release notes and,
     indeed, those cards are only supported in 3.0-current.  Please ignore
     this section of the release notes and any other docs which claim that
     the ThunderLAN NICs are supported in 2.2.7.
 

o    rshd was broken during -Wall cleanup, as noted in PR#7500

Fix: This was fixed in the 2.2-stable branch as of 1998/07/24 04:32:21
     in revision 1.9.2.9 of /usr/src/libexec/rshd/rshd.c.  Obtain the
     fixed version via CVSup (see instructions in handbook or simply 
     ``pkg_add ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CVSup/cvsupit.tgz''
     and follow the instructions) or get it from FTP at:
     ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-stable/src/libexec/rshd/rshd.c
