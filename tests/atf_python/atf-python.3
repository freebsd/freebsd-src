.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-python
.Nd Automated Testing Framework for Python-based network and system testing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
Importing modules:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
from atf_python.sys.net.tools import ToolsHelper
from atf_python.sys.net.vnet import VnetTestTemplate
from atf_python.sys.net.vnet import SingleVnetTestTemplate
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atf-python
framework is a comprehensive Python-based automated testing library,
specifically designed for testing network functionality and behavior on
.Fx
systems.
It integrates network configuration utilities, jail-based virtual networks
(VNET), and routing socket operations.
This facilitates detailed and reproducible system-level testing.
ATF wraps around Pytest, allowing you to write ATF tests similarly to Pytest.
.Pp
The library is structured around several key modules:
.Bl -tag -width "SingleVnetTestTemplate"
.It Sy ToolsHelper
Provides utility functions to interact with system network tools like
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
and
.Xr pfctl 8 .
It supports execution of shell commands, retrieving routing information,
and fetching link-local IPv6 addresses.
Key methods include:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Fn get_output cmd verbose
Execute shell commands and capture output.
.It
.Fn get_routes family fibnum
Fetch routing tables for IPv4 or IPv6 in JSON format.
.El
.It Sy VnetTestTemplate
An extensible base class for tests involving multiple virtual networks
(VNETs).
It supports complex topologies, automatic jail creation, interface
configuration, and subprocess management.
Topology definitions are dictionaries mapping virtual networks (VNET) to
their respective interfaces.
.It Sy SingleVnetTestTemplate
A simplified version of
.Em VnetTestTemplate
optimized for scenarios with a single virtual network.
It automatically sets up a basic VNET topology, significantly reducing
boilerplate code for simple test cases.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Fetch IPv6 routes from FIB 0:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ipv6_routes = ToolsHelper.get_routes("inet6")
.Ed
.Pp
Create and manage a single VNET test:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
class TestMySimpleExample(SingleVnetTestTemplate):
    IPV4_PREFIXES = ["192.0.2.1/24"]

    def test_interface_up(self):
        iface = self.vnet.iface_alias_map["if1"]
        assert "UP" in ToolsHelper.get_output(f"ifconfig {iface.name}")
.Ed
.Pp
Test prefix route switchover upon address deletion:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
class TestIfOps(VnetTestTemplate):
    TOPOLOGY = {
        "vnet1": {"ifaces": ["if1", "if2"]},
        "if1": {"prefixes4": [], "prefixes6": []},
        "if2": {"prefixes4": [], "prefixes6": []},
    }

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("family", ["inet", "inet6"])
    @pytest.mark.require_user("root")
    def test_change_prefix_route(self, family):
        vnet = self.vnet_map["vnet1"]
        first_iface = vnet.iface_alias_map["if1"]
        second_iface = vnet.iface_alias_map["if2"]

        if family == "inet":
            first_addr = ipaddress.ip_interface("192.0.2.1/24")
            second_addr = ipaddress.ip_interface("192.0.2.2/24")
        else:
            first_addr = ipaddress.ip_interface("2001:db8::1/64")
            second_addr = ipaddress.ip_interface("2001:db8::2/64")

        first_iface.setup_addr(str(first_addr))
        second_iface.setup_addr(str(second_addr))

        routes = ToolsHelper.get_routes(family)
        px = [r for r in routes if r["destination"] ==
              str(first_addr.network)][0]
        assert px["interface-name"] == first_iface.name

        first_iface.delete_addr(first_addr.ip)

        routes = ToolsHelper.get_routes(family)
        px = [r for r in routes if r["destination"] ==
              str(first_addr.network)][0]
        assert px["interface-name"] == second_iface.name
