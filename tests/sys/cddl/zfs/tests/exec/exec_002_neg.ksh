# ID: exec_002_neg
# 
# DESCRIPTION:
# When set property exec=off on a filesystem, processes can not be executed from
# this filesystem.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pool and file system.
# 2. Copy '/bin/ls' to the ZFS file system.
# 3. Setting exec=off on this file system.
# 4. Make sure '/bin/ls' can not work in this ZFS file system.
# 5. Make sure mmap which is using the PROT_EXEC calls failed.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-11)
