#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Verify that NFS share options are propagated correctly.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a ZFS file system.
# 2. For each option in the list, set the sharenfs property.
# 3. Verify through the share command that the options are propagated.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-04)
