#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Zpool upgrade should be able to upgrade pools to a given version using -V
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. For all versions pools that can be upgraded on a given OS version
#    (latest pool version - 1)
# 2. Pick a version that's a random number, greater than the version
#    we're running.
# 3. Attempt to upgrade that pool to the given version
# 4. Check the pool was upgraded correctly.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2007-09-27)
