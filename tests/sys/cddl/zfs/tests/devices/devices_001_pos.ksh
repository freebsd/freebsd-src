# DESCRIPTION:
# When set property devices=on on file system, devices files can be used in
# this file system. 
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create pool and file system.
# 2. Set devices=on on this file system.
# 3. Separately create block device file and character file.
# 4. Separately read from those two device files.
# 5. Check the return value, and make sure it succeeds.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-11)
