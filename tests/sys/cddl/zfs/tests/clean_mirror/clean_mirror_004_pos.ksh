# ID: clean_mirror_004_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# The secondary side of a zpool mirror can be mangled without causing damage
# to the data in the pool
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Write several files to the ZFS filesystem in the mirrored pool
# 2) dd from /dev/urandom over the secondary side of the mirror
# 3) verify that all the file contents are unchanged on the file system
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-04)
