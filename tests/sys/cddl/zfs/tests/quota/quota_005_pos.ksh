# ID: quota_005_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Verify that quota doesn't inherit its value from parent.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1) Set quota for parents
# 2) Create a filesystem tree
# 3) Verify that the 'quota' for descendent doesnot inherit the value.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2006-08-17)
