#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Zone cloning via ZFS snapshots works as expected.
# We can clone zones where the zonepath is the top level of a ZFS filesystem
# using snapshots. Where the zone is not at the top level of a ZFS filesystem,
# cloning the zone uses the normal method of copying the files when
# performing the clone operation.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. The setup script should have created the zone.
#       2. Clone a zone-on-ZFS
#	3. Verify that ZFS snapshots were taken and used for the clone and that
#	   the new zone is indeed a clone (in the ZFS sense)
#	4. Clone a normal zone & verify that no snapshots were taken.
#	5. Clone a zone-on-ZFS, but specify the "copy" method & verify that no
#	   snapshots were taken.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2006-10-12)
