# ID:  zones_004_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Deleting a zone, where the zonepath parent dir is the top level of a ZFS
# file system, causes that underlying filesystem to be deleted. Deleting
# the non-ZFS zone does not delete any filesystems.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. The setup script should have created the zone.
#       2. Delete our ZFS rooted zone, verify the filesystem has been deleted.
#	3. Delete our non-ZFS rooted zone, the zonepath dir should still exist.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2006-10-11)
