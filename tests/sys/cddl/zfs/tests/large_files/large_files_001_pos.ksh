#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Write a file to the allowable ZFS fs size.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. largest_file will write to a file and increase its size
# to the maximum allowable.
# 2. The last byte of the file should be accessbile without error.
# 3. Writing beyond the maximum file size generates an 'errno' of
# EFBIG.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-04)
