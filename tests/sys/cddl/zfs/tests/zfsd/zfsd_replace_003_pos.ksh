# Outline
# Use gnop on top of file-backed md devices
# * file-backed md devices so we can destroy them and recreate them with
#   different devnames
# * gnop so we can destroy them while still in use
# Create a double-parity pool
# Remove two vdevs
# Destroy the md devices and recreate in the opposite order
# Check that the md's devnames have swapped
# Verify that the pool regains its health
