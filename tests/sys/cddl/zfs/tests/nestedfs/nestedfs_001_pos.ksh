# ID: nestedfs_001_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Given a pool create a nested file system and a ZFS file system
# in the nested file system. Populate the file system.
#
# As a sub-assertion, the test verifies that a nested file system with
# a mounted file system cannot be destroyed.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a file in the new mountpoint
# 2. Unmount the new mountpoint
# 3. Show a nested file system with file systems cannot be destroyed
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-04)
