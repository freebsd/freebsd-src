# ID: mmap_write_001_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Writing to a file and mmaping that file at the
# same time does not result in a deadlock.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Make sure this test executes on multi-processes system.
# 2. Call mmapwrite binary.
# 3. wait 120s and make sure the test file existed.
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2005-07-04)
