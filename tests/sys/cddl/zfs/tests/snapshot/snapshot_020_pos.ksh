#
# ID: snapshot_020_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that snapshots can be mounted in the ctldir, then renamed, then
#	destroyed.  The original bug that this regresses was that the rename
#	command failed to unmount the snapshot from its old location, leaving
#	the user unable to either mount it or destroy it.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create snapshot
#	2. Access the snapshot through the ctldir to automount it
#	3. Rename the snapshot
#	4. Destroy the snapshot
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2014-06-02)
