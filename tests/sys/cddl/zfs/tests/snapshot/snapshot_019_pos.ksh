# ID: snapshot_019_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Accessing snapshots and unmounting them in parallel does not panic.
#	FreeBSD PR kern/184677
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a dataset
#	2. Set the snapdir property to visible
#	3. Do the following in parallel
#	   a. Repeatedly access the snapshot
#	   b. Repeatedly unmount the snapshot
#	4. Verify that the system does not panic
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2013-12-23)
