# This is a wrapper script to run tools-posix.test on UFS filesystem.
#
# If any of the tests fails, here is how to debug it: go to
# the directory with problematic filesystem mounted on it,
# and do /path/to/test run /path/to/test tools-posix.test, e.g.
#
# /usr/src/tools/regression/acltools/run /usr/src/tools/regression/acltools/tools-posix.test
#
# Output should be obvious.
