SCP(1)                      General Commands Manual                     SCP(1)

NAME
     scp M-bM-^@M-^S OpenSSH secure file copy

SYNOPSIS
     scp [-346ABCpqrTv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
         [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
         source ... target

DESCRIPTION
     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed
     for authentication.

     The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host
     with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the form
     scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit
     using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names
     containing M-bM-^@M-^X:M-bM-^@M-^Y as host specifiers.

     When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a port
     may only be specified on the target if the -3 option is used.

     The options are as follows:

     -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
             host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
             the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the
             progress meter and selects batch mode for the second host, since
             scp cannot ask for passwords or passphrases for both hosts.

     -4      Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.  The
             default is not to forward an authentication agent.

     -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     -C      Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable
             compression.

     -c cipher
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -F ssh_config
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -i identity_file
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     -J destination
             Connect to the target host by first making an scp connection to
             the jump host described by destination and then establishing a
             TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple
             jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This
             is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -l limit
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     -o ssh_option
             Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate scp command-line flag.  For full details of
             the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     -P port
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital M-bM-^@M-^XPM-bM-^@M-^Y, because -p is already
             reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.

     -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
             original file.

     -q      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows
             symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     -S program
             Name of program to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
             must understand ssh(1) options.

     -T      Disable strict filename checking.  By default when copying files
             from a remote host to a local directory scp checks that the
             received filenames match those requested on the command-line to
             prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files.
             Because of differences in how various operating systems and
             shells interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause
             wanted files to be rejected.  This option disables these checks
             at the expense of fully trusting that the server will not send
             unexpected filenames.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
             about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.

EXIT STATUS
     The scp utility exitsM-BM- 0 on success, andM-BM- >0 if an error occurs.
