This is the top level of the FreeBSD source directory.  This file

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this

sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree, the most
commonly used one being ``world'', which rebuilds and installs
everything in the FreeBSD system from the source tree except the
kernel.  Please see the top of the Makefile for more information on
the standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel with config(8) is a somewhat more involved process,
documentation for which can be found at:
   http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html
And in the config(8) man page.

The sample kernel configuration files reside in the sys/i386/conf
sub-directory (assuming that you've installed the kernel sources), the
file named GENERIC being the one used to build your initial installation
kernel.  The file LINT contains entries for all possible devices, not
just those commonly used, and is meant more as a general reference
than an actual kernel configuration file (a kernel built from it
wouldn't even run).
