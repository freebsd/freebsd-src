For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some
sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree.  See build(7)
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
for more information, including setting make(1) variables.

The `buildkernel` and `installkernel` targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat more involved process.  See build(7), config(8),
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html
for more information.

Note: If you want to build and install the kernel with the
`buildkernel` and `installkernel` targets, you might need to build
world before.  More information is available in the handbook.

The kernel configuration files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf
sub-directory.  GENERIC is the default configuration used in release builds.
NOTES contains entries and documentation for all possible
devices, not just those commonly used.
