Makefiles for tool generation from the unix tarball
---------------------------------------------------

These makefiles are intended to generate the ACPICA utilities in
a Linux or Unix-like environment, from the ACPICA source code
as released in the unix tarball.

Windows binary versions of these tools are available at:

http://www.acpica.org/downloads/binary_tools.php

Documentation is available at acpica.org:

http://www.acpica.org/documentation/

The acpica/source/tools directory contains the following utilities.
Note: These utilities are tested and supported in both 32-bit
and 64-bit versions.

acpibin
acpiexec
acpihelp
acpinames
acpisrc
acpixtract
iasl


Requirements
------------

make
gcc compiler (4+)
bison or yacc
flex or lex


Configuration
-------------

The Makefiles contain this configuration information:

HOST =       _LINUX             /* Host system, must appear in acenv.h */
CC =         gcc                /* C compiler */


1) acpibin, an AML file tool

acpibin compares AML files, dumps AML binary files to text files,
extracts binary AML from text files, and other AML file
manipulation.

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpibin
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


2) acpiexec, a user-space AML interpreter

acpiexec allows the loading of ACPI tables and execution of control
methods from user space. Useful for debugging AML code and testing
the AML interpreter. Hardware access is simulated.

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpiexec
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


3) acpihelp, syntax help for ASL operators and reserved names

acpihelp displays the syntax for all of the ASL operators, as well
as information about the ASL/ACPI reserved names (4-char names that
start with underscore.)

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpihelp
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


4) acpinames, load and dump acpi namespace

acpinames loads an ACPI namespace from a binary ACPI table file.
This is a smaller version of acpiexec that loads an acpi table and
dumps the resulting namespace. It is primarily intended to demonstrate
the configurability of ACPICA.

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpinames
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


5) acpisrc, a source code conversion tool

acpisrc converts the standard form of the acpica source release (included
here) into a version that meets Linux coding guidelines. This consists
mainly of performing a series of string replacements and transformations
to the code. It can also be used to clean the acpica source and generate
statistics.

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpisrc
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


6) acpixtract, extract binary ACPI tables from an acpidump

acpixtract is used to extract binary ACPI tables from the ASCII text
output of an acpidump utility (available on several different hosts.)

To compile:

cd acpica/source/tools/acpixtract
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */


7) iasl, an optimizing ASL compiler/disassembler

iasl compiles ASL (ACPI Source Language) into AML (ACPI Machine
Language). This AML is suitable for inclusion as a DSDT in system
firmware. It also can disassemble AML, for debugging purposes.

To compile:

cd acpica/source/compiler
make
make install   /* install the binary to /usr/bin */
