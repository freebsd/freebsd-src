.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck
.Nd file system consistency check and interactive repair
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op Fl dvplfyn
.Op Fl l Ar maxparallel
.Op Fl t Ar fstype 
.Op Fl T Ar fstype:fsoptions 
.Op special | node ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command invokes filesystem-specific programs to check
the special devices listed in the 
.Xr fstab 5
file or in the command line for consistency.
.Pp
It is normally used in the script
.Pa /etc/rc
during automatic reboot.
If no filesystems are specified, and ``preen'' mode is enabled (
.Fl p
option)
.Nm
reads the table
.Pa /etc/fstab
to determine which filesystems to check.
Only partitions in fstab that are mounted ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro''
and that have non-zero pass number are checked.
Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally just the root filesystem)
are checked one at a time.
When pass 1 completes, all remaining filesystems are checked,
running one process per disk drive.
The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the longest prefix
of the device name that ends in a digit; the remaining characters are assumed
to be the partition designator.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Debugging mode. Just print the commands without executing them. Available
only if
.Nm
is compiled to support it.
.It Fl f
Force checking of filesystems, even when they are marked clean (for filesystems
that support this).
.It Fl l Ar maxparallel
Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified in
the following argument. By default, the limit is the number of
disks, running one process per disk. If a smaller limit is giv-
en, the disks are checked round-robin, one filesystem at a time.
.It Fl n
Causes
.Nm
to assume no as the answer to all operator questions, except "CONTINUE?".
.It Fl p
Enter preen mode.
.It Fl t Ar fstype
Invoke
.Nm
only for the comma separated list of filesystem types. If the
list starts with
.Dq no
then invoke
.Nm
for the filesystem types that are not specified in the list.
.It Fl v
Print the commands before executing them.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
.It Fl T Ar fstype:fsoptions
List of comma separated file system specific options for the specified
file system type, in the same format as
.Xr mount 8 .
