.Sh NAME
.Nm st
.Nd magnetic tape manipulating program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm st
.Op Fl f Ar tapename
.Ar command
.Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm St
is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.
By default
.Nm st
performs the requested operation once.  Operations
may be performed multiple times by specifying
.Ar count  .
Note
that
.Ar tapename
must reference a raw (not block) tape device.
.Pp
The tape drive will hold density and blocking parameters until the next 
unmount. In the case of rst0, this is immediately and is therefore of
not much use with this device. In the case of nrst0 this
may be after several commands when either an offline command is issued or
rst0 is openned and closed. If parameters are to be held across 
unmounts, then they should be made to the control device for each
mode.. i.e. the devices with a submode of 3 (minors 3,7,11,15 for example).
It is suggested that the operator keep the control device unreadble
and unwritable to normal system users, while giving them access to
the non-rewind device (e.g. nrst0) on demand.
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.  Only as many
characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
.Bl -tag -width "eof, weof"
.It Cm eof , weof
Write
.Ar count
end-of-file marks at the current position on the tape.
.It Cm fsf
Forward space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm fsr
Forward space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm bsf
Back space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm bsr
Back space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm rewind
Rewind the tape
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm offline , rewoffl
Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (possibly eject)
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm blocksize
Sets the block size characteristics of the openned 
device to value specified in
.Ar count.
A 0 means variable sized blocks, and anything else means fixed block, 
with blocksize as that of
.Ar count.
.It Cm density
Set the density for the openned device  (bits 2,3 of minor number)
.Ar count
density code as specified by the SCSI II specification. Valid values
are from 0  to 0x17.
.It The different density codes are as follows:
0x0	default for device
.br
0xE	reserved for ECMA

Information is printed out about the present active parameters and
also the four Operating modes available.
.El
.Pp
If a tape name is not specified, and the environment variable
.Ev TAPE

.Nm St
returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful,
1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by
.Nm st .
