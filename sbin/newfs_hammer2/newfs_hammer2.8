.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_hammer2
.Nd construct a new HAMMER2 file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar bootsize
.Op Fl r Ar auxsize
.Op Fl V Ar version
.Op Fl L Ar label ...
.Ar special ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prepares a
.Nm HAMMER2
volume on the specified block device.
.Nm HAMMER2
volumes can contain any number of named PFSs (Pseudo FileSystems).
.Pp
The
.Nm
program always creates a PFS called "LOCAL" which may be used for
device-specific configuration.  This PFS should never be used for generic
data.
.Pp
If no
.Fl L
option is specified,
.Nm
will create "DATA".
.Pp
You can override the default PFS name by specifying one or more
.Fl L
options.
.Pp
You can specify
.Fl L Ar none
if you do not want
.Nm
to create any PFSs other than "LOCAL".
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are sector-size agnostic, however the
.Dx
implementation requires the sector size to be no larger than 16K.
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems start at a relative offset of 0 and leave no room for
in-band disklabels (old, traditional BSD labels).
They may only be created using out-of-band disk labels, which is the
default on
.Dx
via
.Po
.Xr disklabel 5
or
.Xr gpt 8
labels
.Pc ,
or with
old style disklabels as long as
the partition does not overlap the label area (have a starting sector
greater than 16).
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are designed for large storage systems, up to 1 Exabyte, and
may not operate efficiently on small storage systems.
The minimum recommended file system size is 50GB.
In addition,
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems operating normally, with automatic snapshots, do not
immediately reclaim space when files are deleted.
A regular system maintenance job runs once a day by
.Xr periodic 8
to handle reclamation.
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
works best when the machine's normal workload would not otherwise fill
the file system up in the course of 60 days of operation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar bootsize
Specify a fixed area in which a boot related kernel and data can be stored.
The
.Ar bootsize
is specified in bytes.
By default a boot area of approximately 64MB will be created.
This area is not currently used for booting and may be repurposed in the
future.
.It Fl r Ar auxsize
Specify a fixed area in which an aux related kernel and data can be stored.
The
.Ar auxsize
is specified in bytes.
By default an aux area of approximately 256MB will be created.
This area is not currently used and may be repurposed in the
future.
.It Fl V Ar version
Specify the
.Nm HAMMER2
file system version to format.
By default
.Nm
formats the file system using the highest production version number
supported by the
.Nm HAMMER2
VFS by checking the
.Va vfs.hammer2.supported_version
sysctl.
If you need to maintain compatibility with an older version of
.Nm HAMMER2
you may specify the version with this option.
.It Fl L Ar label
By default
.Nm
always creates a local master PFSs on the new volume called "LOCAL"
and "DATA".
.Pp
If you specify one or more label options to create your own named local
PFSs,
.Nm
will not create any conditional PFSs.
However, "LOCAL" is still always created and should not be
specified with this option.
If you don't want any PFSs to be created (other than "LOCAL"), use
.Fl L Ar none .
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar bootsize
and
.Ar auxsize
must be given with a suffix of
.Cm K , M , G
or
.Cm T
meaning kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte.
Lower case can also be used for suffix.
These options create reserved blocks of space on the target volume
but are not currently used by the filesystem for anything.
