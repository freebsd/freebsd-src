.Dt MOUNT_MSDOS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdos
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl M Ar mask
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl 9
.\".Op Fl G
.Op Fl L Ar locale
.Op Fl W Ar table
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the MS-DOS filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 ,
or one of the MSDOS filesystem-specific options
.Ar shortnames ,
.Ar longnames
or
.Ar nowin95 ,
all of which can be used to affect Windows name translation in the
underlying filesystem.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a
.Ar mask
of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The value of
.Ar -M
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -m
is omitted.
The default
.Ar mask
is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl M Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for directories
in the file system.
The value of
.Ar -m
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -M
is omitted.
See the previous option's description for details.
.It Fl s
Force behaviour to
ignore and not generate Win'95 long filenames.
.It Fl l
Force listing and generation of
Win'95 long filenames
and separate creation/modification/access dates.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl s
nor
.Fl l
are given,
.Nm
searches the root directory of the filesystem to
be mounted for any existing Win'95 long filenames.
If no such entries are found, but short DOS filenames are found,
.Fl s
is the default.
Otherwise
.Fl l
is assumed.
.It Fl 9
Ignore the special Win'95 directory entries even
if deleting or renaming a file.
This forces
.Fl s .
.\".It Fl G
.\"This option causes the filesystem to be interpreted as an Atari-Gemdos
.\"filesystem. The differences to the MS-DOS filesystem are minimal and
.\"limited to the boot block. This option enforces
.\".Fl s .
.It Fl L Ar locale
Specify locale name used for internal uppercase and lowercase conversions
for DOS and Win'95 names.
By default ISO 8859-1 assumed as local character set.
.It Fl W Ar table
Specify text file with 3 conversion tables:
.Bl -enum
.It
Local character set to Unicode conversion table (upper half) for Win'95 long
names, 128 Unicode codes separated by 8 per row.
If some code not present in Unicode, use
0x003F code ('?') as replacement.
.It
DOS to local character set conversion table (upper half) for DOS names,
128 character codes separated by 8 per row.
Code 0x3F ('?') used for impossible translations.
.It
Local character set to DOS conversion table (upper half) for DOS names,
128 character codes separated by 8 per row.
Some codes have special meaning:
.Bl -hang
.It 0x00
character disallowed in DOS file name;
.It 0x01
character should be replaced by '_' in DOS file name;
.It 0x02
character should be skipped in DOS file name;
.El
.El
.Pp
By default ISO 8859-1 assumed as local character set.
If file path isn't absolute,
.Pa /usr/libdata/msdosfs/
prefix prepended.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/libdata/msdosfs -compact
.It Pa /usr/libdata/msdosfs
default place for character sets conversion tables
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh CAVEATS
The use of the
.Fl 9
flag could result in damaged filesystems,
albeit the damage is in part taken care of by
procedures similar to the ones used in Win'95.
.Pp
.Fx 2.1
and earlier versions could not handle cluster sizes larger than 16K.
Just mounting an MS-DOS file system could cause corruption to any
mounted file system.
Cluster sizes larger than 16K are unavoidable for file system sizes
larger than 1G, and also occur when filesystems larger than 1G are
shrunk to smaller than 1G using FIPS.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 2.0 .
Its predecessor, the
.Nm mount_pcfs
utility appeared in
.Fx 1.0 ,
and was abandoned in favor
of the more aptly-named
.Nm .
