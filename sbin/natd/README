	A Network Address Translation Daemon for FreeBSD


1. WHAT IS NATD ?

	This is a simple daemon based on FreeBSD divert sockets
	which performs network address translation (or masquerading)
	for IP packets (see related RFCs 1631 and 1918).
	It is based on packet aliasing package (see README.alias)
	written by Charles Mott <cm@linktel.net>.

	This package works with any network interface (doesn't have
	to be ppp). I run it on a computer having two ethernet cards,
	one connected to internet and the other one to local network.

2. GETTING IT RUNNING

	1) Get FreeBSD 2.2 - I think the divert sockets are
	   not available on earlier versions,

	2) Compile this software by executing "make".

	3) Install the software by executing "make install".

	4) See man natd for further instructions.

3. FTP SITES FOR NATD

	This package is available at ftp://ftp.suutari.iki.fi/pub/natd.
