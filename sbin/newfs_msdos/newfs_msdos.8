.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32 file system on device or file named
.Ar special ,
using
.Xr disktab 5
entry
.Ar disktype
to determine geometry, if required.
.Pp
If
.Ar special
does not contain a
.Ar /
and
.Fl C
is not used, it is assumed to be a device name and
.Ar /dev/
is prepended to the name to construct the actual device name.
To work a file in the current directory use
.Ar ./filename
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Do not create a file system: just print out parameters.
.It Fl @ Ar offset
Build the filesystem at the specified offset in bytes in the device or file.
A suffix s, k, m, g (lower or upper case)
appended to the offset specifies that the
number is in sectors, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes, respectively.
.It Fl A
Attempt to cluster align the data area, useful for flash based storage.
This option is enabled by default, unless a number of reserved sectors
is specified using the
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl B Ar boot
Get bootstrap from file.
.It Fl C Ar create-size
Create the image file with the specified size.
A suffix character appended to the size is interpreted as for the
.Fl @
option.
The file is created by truncating any existing file with the same name and
resizing it to the requested size.
If the file system supports sparse files, the space occupied on disk may be
smaller than the size specified as parameter.
.It Fl F Ar FAT-type
FAT type (one of 12, 16, or 32).
.It Fl I Ar VolumeID
Volume ID, a 32 bit number in decimal or hexadecimal (0x...) format.
.It Fl L Ar label
Volume label (up to 11 characters).
The label should consist of
only those characters permitted in regular DOS (8+3) filenames.
.It Fl O Ar OEM
OEM string (up to 8 characters).
The default is
.Qq Li "BSD4.4  " .
.It Fl S Ar sector-size
Number of bytes per sector.
Acceptable values are powers of 2
in the range 512 through 32768, inclusive.
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
Create the filesystem as though the current time is
.Ar timestamp .
The default filesystem volume ID is derived from the time.
.Ar timestamp
can be a pathname (where the timestamp is derived from
that file) or an integer value interpreted
as the number of seconds since the Epoch.
.It Fl a Ar FAT-size
Number of sectors per FAT.
.It Fl b Ar block-size
File system block size (bytes per cluster).
This should resolve to an
acceptable number of sectors per cluster (see below).
.It Fl c Ar cluster-size
Sectors per cluster, also called allocation size.
Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the range
1 through 128.
If the block or cluster size are not specified, the code
uses a cluster between 512 bytes and 32K depending on
the filesystem size.
.It Fl e Ar DirEnts
Number of root directory entries (FAT12 and FAT16 only).
.It Fl f Ar format
Specify a standard (floppy disk) format.
The standard formats
are (capacities in kilobytes): 160, 180, 320, 360, 640, 720, 1200,
1232, 1440, 2880.
.It Fl h Ar heads
Number of drive heads.
.It Fl i Ar info
Location of the file system info sector (FAT32 only).
A value of 0xffff signifies no info sector.
.It Fl k Ar backup
Location of the backup boot sector (FAT32 only).
A value
of 0xffff signifies no backup sector.
.It Fl m Ar media
Media descriptor (acceptable range 0xf0 to 0xff).
.It Fl n Ar FATs
Number of FATs.
Acceptable values are 1 to 16 inclusive.
The default
is 2.
.It Fl o Ar hidden
Number of hidden sectors.
.It Fl r Ar reserved
Number of reserved sectors.
If the
.Fl r
option is not used, the number of reserved sectors is set to a value that
aligns the start of the data area to a multiple of the cluster size.
.It Fl s Ar total
File system size.
.It Fl u Ar track-size
Number of sectors per track.
.El
.Sh NOTES
If some parameters (e.g., size, number of sectors, etc.) are not specified
through options or disktype, the program tries to generate them automatically.
In particular, the size is determined as the device or file size minus the
offset specified with the
.Fl @
option.
When the geometry is not available, it is assumed to be 63 sectors, 255 heads.
The size is then rounded to become a multiple of the track size and avoid
complaints by some filesystem code.
.Pp
FAT file system parameters occupy a "Boot Sector BPB (BIOS Parameter
Block)" in the first of the "reserved" sectors which precede the actual
file system.
For reference purposes, this structure is presented
below.
