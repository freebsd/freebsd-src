.Sh NAME
.Nm quotacheck
.Nd filesystem quota consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar filesystem
.Ar
.Nm quotacheck
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quotacheck
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default both user and group quotas are checked.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
If supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm
will check all the filesystems indicated in
.Pa /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are checked.
.It Fl g
Only group quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are to be checked.
.It Fl v
.Nm Quotacheck
reports discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas and other additional diagnostic messages.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
using the pass numbers in
.Pa /etc/fstab
in an identical fashion to
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
operates silently.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
quota files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If a file is not present, 
.Nm
will create it.
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
is normally run at boot time from the
.Pa /etc/rc
file.
The rc startup procedure is controlled by the 
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
variable 
.Ar check_quotas .
Note that to enable this functionality in 
.Pa /etc/rc
you also need to enable startup quota procedures
with the variable
.Ar enable_quotas 
in 
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
.Nm Quotacheck
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.Nm
is running.
