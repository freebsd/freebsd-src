.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm growfs
.Nd grow size of an existing ufs file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ny
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
extends the 
.Xr newfs 8
program.
Before running 
.Nm
the disk must be labeled to a bigger size using 
.Xr disklabel 8 .
If you are using volumes you must grow them using 
.Xr vinum 8 .
.Nm
extends the size of the file system on the specified special file.
Currently
.Nm 
can only grow unmounted file systems.
Do not try growing a mounted file system, your system may panic and you will
not be able to use the file system any longer.
Most of the options you have used with
.Xr newfs 8
once can not be changed.
In fact you can only increase the size of the file system.
Use 
.Xr tunefs 8
for other changes.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Cause the new file system parameters to be printed out without actually growing
the file system.
.It Fl y
.Dq Expert mode .
Normally 
.Nm 
will ask you, if you took a backup of your data before and will do some tests
if 
.Ar special 
is currently mounted or if there are any active snapshots on the filesystem
specified.
This will be suppressed.
So use this option with great care!
.It Fl s Ar size
The
.Ar size
of the file system after growing in sectors.
This value defaults to the size of the raw partition specified in
.Ar special 
(in other words,
.Nm
will grow the file system to the size of the entire partition).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl growfs -s 4194304 /dev/vinum/testvol
.Pp
will grow
.Pa /dev/vinum/testvol
up to 2GB if there is enough space in 
.Pa /dev/vinum/testvol .
.Sh BUGS
In some cases on
.Fx
3.x it is possible, that
.Nm
did not recognize exactly, if the file system is mounted or not and 
exits with an error message, then use 
.Nm
.Fl y
if you are sure, that the file system is not mounted.
It is also recommended to always use
.Xr fsck 8
after growing just to be on the safe side.
.Pp
Pay attention, as in certain cases we have to change the location of an file
system internal structure which had never been moved before.
Almost everything works perfect with this relocated structure except the
.Xr fsck 8
utility.
There is a patch available for
.Xr fsck 8 .
For growing above certain limits it is essential to have some free blocks
available in the first cylinder group.
To avoid the relocation of that structure it is currently recommended to use
.Nm ffsinfo
.Fl c Ar 0
on the first cylinder group and check that
.Em nbfree
in the CYLINDER SUMMARY (internal cs) of the CYLINDER GROUP
.Em cgr0
has enough blocks.
As a rule of thumb for default filesystem parameters a block is needed for
every 2 GB of total filesystem size.
