.Sh NAME
.Nm growfs
.Nd grow size of an existing ufs file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm growfs
.Op Fl Ny
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Growfs
extends the 
.Xr newfs 8
program.
Before running 
.Nm
the disk must be labeled to a bigger size using 
.Xr disklabel 8 .
If you are using volumes you must grow them using 
.Xr vinum 8 .
.Nm Growfs
extends the size of the file system on the specified special file.
Currently
.Nm 
can only grow unmounted file systems. Do not try growing an mounted file system,
your system may panic and you will not be able to use the file system any longer.
Most of the options you have used with
.Xr newfs 8
once can not be changed. In fact you can only increase the size of the file
system. Use 
.Xr tunefs 8
for other changes.
Typically the defaults are reasonable, however
.Nm
has some options to allow the defaults to be overridden.
.\".Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
Cause the new file system parameters to be printed out
without realy growing the file system.
.It Fl y
.Dq Expert mode
Normally 
.Nm 
will ask you, if you took a backup of your data before und will do some tests
if 
.Ar special 
is currently mounted or if there are any active snapshots on the filesystem
specified. This will be supressed. So use this option with care!
.It Fl s Ar size
The size of the file system after growing in sectors.  This value defaults
to the size of the raw partition specified in
.Ar special 
(in other words,
.Nm
will grow the file system to the size of the entire partition).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Dl growfs -s 4194304 /dev/vinum/testvol
.Pp
will grow /dev/vinum/testvol up to 2GB if there is enough space in 
/dev/vinum/testvol .
.Sh BUGS
In some cases on
.Bx Free
3.x it is possible, that
.Nm
did not recognize exactly, if the file system is mounted or not and 
exits with an error message, then use 
.Nm
-y if you are sure, that the file system is not mounted.
It is also recommended to always use
.Nm fsck
after growing just to be on the safe side.
.Pp
Pay attention, as in certain cases we have to change the location of an file
system internal structure which had never been moved before. Almost everything
works perfect with this relocated structure except the
.Nm fsck(8)
utility. There is a patch available for
.Nm fsck(8) .
For growing above certain limits it is essential to have some free blocks
available in the first cylinder group. To avoid the relocation of that
structure it is currently recommended to use
.Nm ffsinfo -c 0
on the first cylinder group and check that
.Nm nbfree
in the CYLINDER SUMMARY (internal cs) of the CYLINDER GROUP
.Nm cgr0
has enough blocks. As a rule of thumb for default filesystem parameters a block
is needed for every 2 GB of total filesystem size.
