.Sh DESCRIPTION
NVM Express (NVMe) is a storage protocol standard, for SSDs and other
high-speed storage devices over PCI Express.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl nvmecontrol devlist
.Pp
Display a list of NVMe controllers and namespaces along with their device nodes.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol identify nvme0
.Pp
Display a human-readable summary of the nvme0 IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER data.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol identify -x -v nvme0ns1
.Pp
Display a hexadecimal dump of the nvme0 IDENTIFY_NAMESPACE data for namespace
1.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol perftest -n 32 -o read -s 512 -t 30 nvme0ns1
.Pp
Run a performance test on nvme0ns1 using 32 kernel threads for 30 seconds.  Each
thread will issue a single 512 byte read command.  Results are printed to
stdout when 30 seconds expires.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol reset nvme0
.Pp
Perform a controller-level reset of the nvme0 controller.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol logpage -p 1 nvme0
.Pp
Display a human-readable summary of the nvme0 controller's Error Information Log.
Log pages defined by the NVMe specification include Error Information Log (ID=1),
SMART/Health Information Log (ID=2), and Firmware Slot Log (ID=3).
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol logpage -p 1 -x nvme0
.Pp
Display a hexidecimal dump of the nvme0 controller's Error Information Log.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol firmware -s 2 -f /tmp/nvme_firmware nvme0
.Pp
Download the firmware image contained in "/tmp/nvme_firmware" to slot 2 of the
nvme0 controller, but do not activate the image.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol firmware -s 4 -a nvme0
.Pp
Activate the firmware in slot 4 of the nvme0 controller on the next reset.
.Pp
.Dl nvmecontrol firmware -s 7 -f /tmp/nvme_firmware -a nvme0
.Pp
Download the firmware image contained in "/tmp/nvme_firmware" to slot 7 of the
nvme0 controller and activate it on the next reset.
