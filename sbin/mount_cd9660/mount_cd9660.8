.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Nd mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Op Fl egr
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar special | node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_cd9660
command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Enable the use of extended attributes.
.It Fl g
Do not strip version numbers on files.
(By default, if there are files with different version numbers on the disk,
only the last one will be listed.)
In either case, files may be opened without explicitly stating a
version number.
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.It Fl r
Do not use any Rockridge extensions included in the filesystem.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh BUGS
The cd9660 filesystem does not support the original "High Sierra"
("CDROM001") format.
.Pp
POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.
.Pp
Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.
In this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without
version numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not
the one with the highest.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_cd9660
utility first appeared 4.4BSD.
