.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Nd mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl begjrv
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl s Ar startsector
.Ar special | node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Relax checking for Supplementary Volume Descriptor Flags field
which is set to a wrong value on some Joliet formatted disks.
.It Fl e
Enable the use of extended attributes.
.It Fl g
Do not strip version numbers on files.
(By default, if there are files with different version numbers on the disk,
only the last one will be listed.)
In either case, files may be opened without explicitly stating a
version number.
.It Fl j
Do not use any Joliet extensions included in the filesystem.
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
The following cd9660 specific options are available:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "nostrictjoliet" -compact
.It Cm extatt
Same as
.Fl e .
.It Cm gens
Same as
.Fl g .
.It Cm nojoliet
Same as
.Fl j .
.It Cm norrip
Same as
.Fl r .
.It Cm nostrictjoliet
Same as
.Fl b .
.El
.It Fl r
Do not use any Rockridge extensions included in the filesystem.
.It Fl s Ar startsector
Start the filesystem at
.Ar startsector .
Normally, if the underlying device is a CD-ROM drive,
.Nm
will try to figure out the last track from the CD-ROM containing
data, and start the filesystem there.  If the device is not a CD-ROM,
or the table of contents cannot be examined, the filesystem will be
started at sector 0.  This option can be used to override the behaviour.
Note that
.Ar startsector
is measured in CD-ROM blocks, with 2048 bytes each.  This is the same
as for example the
.Cm info
command of
.Xr cdcontrol 1
is printing.
You may mount an arbitrary session of a multi-session CD by specifying
the correct
.Ar startsector
here.
.It Fl v
Be verbose about the starting sector decisions made.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command can be used to mount a Kodak Photo-CD :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_cd9660 -o rw -v -s 0 /dev/cd0c /cdrom
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cdcontrol 1 ,
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh BUGS
POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.
.Pp
Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.
In this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without
version numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not
the one with the highest.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
