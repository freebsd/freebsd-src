# There are sample scripts for IPsec configuration by manual keying.
# A security association is uniquely identified by a triple consisting
# of a Security Parameter Index (SPI), an IP Destination Address, and a
# security protocol (AH or ESP) identifier.  You must take care of these
# parameters when you configure by manual keying.

# ESP transport mode is recommended for TCP port number 110 between
# Host-A and Host-B. Encryption algorithm is aes-cbc whose key
# is "kamekamekamekamekamekamekamekame", and authentication algorithm is
# hmac-sha2-512 whose key is "this is the test key".
