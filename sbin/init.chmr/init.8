.Os 386BSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm init
.Nd ancestor of all user-level processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl d Ar level
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl S
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm init
is started by the Operating System kernel as the first user-level process
(PID 1).
It creates more processes to execute the system startup script
.Pa /etc/rc
and enable users to login. If the system startup fails for any reason,
it gives the system administrator a shell on the console.
Note that you cannot execute the
.Nm init
program directly (except if you are a UNIX kernel, which seems unlikely).
.Pp
.Em Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Fl s
Starts a singleuser shell instead of booting the system to multiuser mode
.It Fl f
Fast boot. Calls the
.Pa /etc/rc
script without the
.Sy autoboot
argument, which causes it to skip disk checks
.It Fl d Ar level
Sets the debug level to the specified number.
.It Fl C Ar file
Causes
.Nm init
to read its configuration from file
.Ar file
instead of the default /etc/init.conf .
.It Fl S
Only checks the configuration file for syntax errors and exits immediately
afterwards.
.El
.Pp
.Em Singleuser and multiuser modes
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Nm
knows of two states:
.Em singleuser
and
.Em multiuser
\&. The normal state is multiuser, where system daemons such as
.Xr crond 8
or
.Xr inetd 8
are active and the system accepts logins from direct connect ttys (with 
.Xr getty 8
) and from the network. In singleuser mode, all daemons and user processes
terminated, and
.Nm
starts a shell on the system console. This shell can be used by the 
system manager for administrative purposes. Because no proceses are running
that have files open, all file systems except the root file system can be
unmounted.
.Ed
.Pp
.Em System startup and shutdown
.Bd -filled -offset indent
When the system is booted, it creates process 1 and executes the file
.Pa /sbin/init
in it. The arguments that are given to the kernel are passed on to
the
.NM
program. Unless the
.Fl s
flag is specified,
.Nm
starts a shell to execute the
.Pa /etc/rc
script with the argument
.Sy "autoboot"
(Unless the
.Fl f
flag is specified, in which case the script is called without arguments).
This script checks and mounts file systems and starts
system daemons. If the script fails (exits with a status unequal to zero),
a shell is started on the console to enable the system administrator to
cure the problem. When this shell terminates,
.Nm
starts over by executing
.Pa /etc/rc
again (without arguments). When finally this script terminates with
an exit status of zero (signaling success),
.Nm
starts multiuser mode by reading the file
.Pa /etc/ttys
and starting getty processes for the terminals that are marked active
in this file.
.Pp
To bring the system from multiuser to singleuser mode, you can use
the
.Xr shutdown 8
program.
.Ed
.Pp
.Em Signals
.Bd -filled -offset indent
The following list of signals is only here for completeness; You should
not send any signals to
.Nm init
directly, but instead use the
.Xr shutdown 8
command to perform a state change.
.Bl -tag -width SIGTERM
.It SIGTERM
go to singleuser mode immediately. All processes are terminated, and then
a singleuser shell is started on the console.
.It SIGHUP
Reread the
.Pa /etc/ttys
file.
.It SIGTSTP
Drain the system. No new processes are created. The only way out of
this pseudo-state is another SIGHUP or SIGTERM signal.
.It SIGTTIN
Re-read the configuration file. Only valid when in Singleuser mode.
.It SIGUSR1
Increase debugging level (if debugging is compiled in)
.It SIGUSR2
Turn off debugging
.El
.Ed
.Pp
.Em Configuration
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Upon startup,
.Nm 
reads the file
.Pa /etc/init.conf
or the file specified with the
.Fl C
option.
Each line in this file specifies a thing to configure.
Empty lines and lines with a hash character
.Sy #
as the first character are ignored.
.Bd -literal
limit LIMIT VALUE
hlimit LIMIT VALUE
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
set a soft or hard limit, respectively. LIMIT can be one of
.Sy cputime ,
.Sy filesize ,
.Sy datasize ,
.Sy stacksize ,
.Sy coredumpsize ,
.Sy memoryuse ,
.Sy memorylocked ,
.Sy maxproc ,
.Sy openfiles .
The VALUE is specified in bytes or seconds. See
.Xr setrlimit 2
for more information.
.Pp
Note that you cannot raise hard limits.
Note also that the specified limits are not used for
.Nm init
itself, but for all processes it creates.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
setenv VARIABLE "VALUE"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Sets the specified environment-variable VAR with the specified VALUE. 
VALUE can be ommitted. This setting is valid for all processes
on the system, except
.Nm init
itself.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
debug LEVEL
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Sets the debug level of init to the specified value. Note that a level
specified with the
.Fl d
option takes precedence over this.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
startup_state { singleuser | multiuser }
.Ed 
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Sets the default runlevel to singleuser or multiuser mode, respectively.
If
.Fl s
is specified, it always goes to singleuser mode.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
include "FILE"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Reads further configuration instructions from file "FILE" and continues in the
current file afterwards. Include commands can be nested up to a level of 50.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
singleusershell "COMMAND"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Lets you specify a command to execute as a singleuser shell. Note that the
first argument you specify is the 0th argument passed to the program.
Default is "/bin/sh -".
.Ed
.Bd -literal
singleuserterminal "TYPE"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Lets you specify a terminal type that is passed in the TERM environment
variable to the singleusershell. Default is "pc3".
.Ed
.Bd -literal
singleuserdevice "DEVICE"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Lets you specify a terminal device where the singleusershell will be started.
Default is "/dev/console".
.Ed
.Bd -literal
autobootcommand "COMMAND"
fastbootcommand "COMMAND"
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Lets you specify a command that is executed when the system goes to multiuser
mode. The difference between the two is that autobootcommand is only executed
when the system starts multiuser mode immediately after boot, and only if
.Fl f
has not been specified.
If the system has already been in singleuser mode or
.Fl f
was used, fastbootcommand is used instead. The defaults are
"/bin/sh sh /etc/rc autoboot" for autobootcommand, and "/bin/sh sh /etc/rc"
for fastbootcommand.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
timeout shutdown sigterm TIME
timeout shutdown sigkill TIME
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Normally, if you shutdown to singleuser mode,
.Nm init
sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes to give them a chance to
terminate gracefully, waits 10 seconds, then sends a SIGKILL to all 
remaining processes and waits up to 30 seconds. You can change these timeouts
if you like.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
timeout error-retry TIME
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
If
.Nm init
encouters a serious problem (such as "fork failed" or "out of memory"), it 
does not terminate, but instead continues its work and retries the operation
at a later time. The default is to retry after 300 seconds.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
respawn checkstatus { yes | no }
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Specifies whether
.Nm init
should check the termination status of its children, in order to see if these
children fail (e.g. a getty on a non-existent device). The default is yes,
but you may want to switch it off if you have programs that don't return any
useful exit status.
.Ed
.Bd -literal
respawn checktime { yes | no | TIME }
.Ed
.Bd -filled -offset indent
Specifies whether or not
.Nm init
should assume that children that did not live longer than TIME seconds
were failing. The default is yes, which is equivalent to a time of 5 seconds.
0 is equivalent to no.
.Ed
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The UNIX kernel sets up the environment for
.Nm init
as part of its initialisation.
Specifically,
.Nm
is called without any files open.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/init.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/init.conf
Configuration file for
.Nm init
(See
.Sx DESCRIPTION
above)
.It Pa /etc/rc
System Startup Script
.It Pa /etc/ttys
specifies on which terminals to create login processes
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm init
logs all messages via
.Xr syslogd 8
with the
.Sy LOG_DAEMON
facility.
If it cannot open a connectoin to a syslogd, it prints the message
to the console. Fatal errors (such as a segmentaion fault) cause
the kernel to panic with the message "init died".
