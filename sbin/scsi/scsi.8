.Sh NAME
.Nm scsi
.Nd program to assist with scsi devices.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal -offset
Usage:
scsi -f device -d debug_level                    # To set debug level
scsi -f device [-v] -z seconds                   # To freeze bus
scsi -f device -m page [-P pc] [-e]              # To read mode pages
scsi -f device -p [-b bus] [-l lun]              # To probe all devices
scsi -f device -r [-b bus] [-t targ] [-l lun]    # To reprobe a device
scsi -f device [-v] [-s seconds] -c cmd_fmt [arg0 ... argn] # A command...
               -o count out_fmt [arg0 ... argn]  #   EITHER (for data out)
               -i count in_fmt                   #   OR     (for data in)
.Pp
"out_fmt" can be "-" to read output data from stdin;
"in_fmt" can be "-" to write input data to stdout;
.Pp
If debugging is not compiled in the kernel, "-d" will have no effect
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm scsi
program is used to send commands to a scsi device. It is also
a sample usage of the user level SCSI commands.
.Pp
The
.Fr -d
option sets the SCSI kernel debug level.  The kernel must have been compiled
with the
.Em SCSIDEBUG
option.  See
.Fr /sys/scsi/scsi_debug.h
to figure out what to set the kernel debug level to.
.Pp
The
.Fr -z
option freezes all activity on all SCSI busses for a given number of
seconds.  If
.Fr -v
is also specified then a BEL character is sent to the standard
output at the start and finish of the bus freeze.
This requires that the kernel be built with the SCSI_FREEZE kernel option.
This kernel code is not committed yet.
.Pp
The
.Fr -m
option is used to read a device mode page.  The file
.Fr /usr/share/misc/scsi_modes
is read to look at for how to interpret the mode data.  The environment
variable SCSI_MODES can specify a different file to use.
.Pp
.in +.25i
The
.Fr -P
option can be used to specify a page control field.  The page control
fields are
.Bd -literal -offset
0 Current Values
1 Changeable Values
2 Default Values
3 Saved Values
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fr -e
option permits you to edit the fields.  It will use the editor specified
by your EDITOR environment variable.  To store changes permanently, 
edit page control 3 using the
.Fr -P
flag.
.in -.25i
.Pp
The
.Fr -p
option can be used against the "super scsi" device
.Fr /dev/scsi/super
to probe all devices with a given SCSI lun on a given SCSI bus.
The bus can be selected with the -b option and the default is 0.
The lun can be selected with the -l option and the default is 0.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of the "super scsi" device.
.Pp
The
.Fr -r
option can be used in 
.Tn FreeBSD 
1.1 to reprobe a specific SCSI device at a given
Bus, Target and Lun.
This is not needed in
.Fx 2.1 ,
since opening a fixed SCSI device
has the side effect of reprobing it, and probing with the bus with the
-p option should bring on line any newly found devices.
See
.Xr scsi 4
for a description of fixed scsi devices.
.Pp
The
.Fr -c
option permits you to send user level SCSI commands specified on
the command line to a
device.  The command is sent using the SCIOCCOMMAND ioctl, so the
device you are accessing must permit this ioctl. See
.Xr scsi 4
for full details of which minor devices permit the ioctl, and
.Xr scsi 3
for the full details on how to build up the commands and data phases
using the format arguments.
.in +.25i
.Pp
.Fr -v
turns on more verbose information.
.Pp
.Fr -s
sets the command timeout in seconds.  The default is two seconds.
.Pp
.Fr "-c cmd_fmt"
specifies the command as described in
.Xr scsi 3 "."
The additional arguments provide values for any variables
specified in the command format.
.Pp
.Fr "-o count out_fmt arg0 ... argn"
indicates that this is a data out command (i.e., data will be sent from
the system to the device) with
.Fr count
bytes of data. The data out is built up using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
using the provided arguments to fill in any integer variables.
.Fr out_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen ("-") to indicate that the
.Fr count
bytes of data should be read from the standard input.
.Pp
.Fr "-i count in_fmt"
indicates that this is a data in command (i.e., data will be read from
the device into the system) with
.Fr count
bytes of data read in.  The information is extracted according to
.Fr in_fmt
using the facilities described in
.Xr scsi 3
and displayed on the standard output.
.Fr in_fmt
can be specified as a hyphen ("-") to indicate that the
.Fr count
bytes of data input should be written to the standard output.
.in -.25i
.Sh EXAMPLES
To verify that the device type for the disk /dev/rsd0c is 0
(direct access device):
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "*b3 b5"
0
.Ed
.Pp
To do an inquiry to /dev/rsd2c:
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -c "12 0 0 0 64 0" -i 64 "s8 z8 z16 z4"
FUJITSU M2654S-512 010P
.Pp
To edit mode page 1 on /dev/rsd2c, and store it permanently on the
drive:
.Bd -literal -offset
root# scsi -f /dev/rsd2c -m 1 -e -P 3
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SU_DEBUG_OUTPUT variable can be set to a file to send debugging
output to that file.
.Pp
The SU_DEBUG_LEVEL variable can be set to a non-zero integer to increase
the level of debugging.  Currently this is a on or off thing; it should
perhaps use the ioctl to set the debug level in the kernel and then set
it back to zero at program exit.
.Pp
The SU_DEBUG_TRUNCATE variable can be set to an integer to limit the
amount of data phase output sent to the debugging file.
.Pp
The EDITOR variable determines the editor to use for the mode editor.

.Xr scsi 3 ,
.Xr scsi 4
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
This command wasn't ready for inclusion in 2.0R and so is missing in
that release.
.Pp
Some devices respond to an inquiry for all LUNS.  This will cause them
to come on line to 8 times during reprobe to different logical units.
.Pp
The "-i" option to do an inquiry went away in 2.1.  The new facilities
provided by "-c" supercede that.
.Pp
Check your permissions carefully.
"scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -c "4 0 0 0 0 0" permits anyone who can open
/dev/rsd0c to format the disk drive.  This must be changed to
at least require write access to the drive.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm scsi
command appeared in 386BSD 0.1.2.4/FreeBSD to support the new reprobe
and user SCSI commands.
