.TH FORE_DNLD 8 "1996-12-03" "HARP"
.SH NAME
fore_dnld \- Download FORE Systems' microcode into host ATM adapter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fore_dnld
[-i intf]
[-d path]
[-f objfile]
.sp
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fore_dnld
downloads FORE Systems' microcode into the host ATM adapter(s).
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i intf
Specify which ATM interface to download microcode to.
Default is to load microcode into all FORE Systems host adapters.
.TP
.B -d path
Specify the path to prepend to the "objfile" name.
Default is to use current directory.
.TP
.B -f objfile
Specify the microcode binary file.
Defaults are:
"sba200.obj" for SBA-200 adapters,
"sba200e.obj" for SBA-200E adapters, and
"pca200e.bin" for PCA-200E adapters. 
.fi
.SH NOTES
.PP
For the PCA200E adapter, if no file is specified on the command
line a built-in copy of version 3.0.1 microcode is used.
.PP
Microcode as distributed by FORE Systems is not ready for downloading
directly into SBA host ATM adapters.
Instead, the supplied microcode needs
to be processed with the "objcopy" command to create an image suitable
for downloading.
Arguments to "objcopy" are "-S -l -Fcoff".
.PP
Microcode as
distibuted by FORE Systems for the PCA host ATM adapter does not need
to be processed.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

adapters.
