.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility program to communicate with the \fBVinum\fP\| logical volume
manager.  See
.Xr vinum 4
for more information about the volume manager.
.Xr vinum 8
is designed either for interactive use, when started without a command, or to
execute a single command if the command is supplied as arguments to
.Nm vinum .
In interactive mode, 
.Nm
maintains a command line history.
.Ss OPTIONS
.Nm
commands may optionally be followed by an option.  Any of the following options
may be specified with any command, but in some cases they do not make any
difference: cases, the options are ignored.  For example, the
.Nm stop
command ignores the 
.Fl v
and
.Fl V
options.
.Bl -hang
.It Cd -v
The
.Nm -v
option can be used with any command to request more detailed information.  
.It Cd -V
The
.Nm -V
option can be used with any command to request more detailed information than
the
.Nm -v
option provides.
.It Cd -f
The
.Nm -f
option overrides safety checks.  Use with extreme care.  This option is for
emergency use only.  For example, the command
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
rm -f myvolume
.Ed
.Pp
removes
.Nm myvolume
even if it is open.  Any subsequent access to the volume will almost certainly
cause a panic.
.It Cd -r
The
.Nm -r
(``recursive'') option is used by the list commands to display information not
only about the specified objects, but also about subordinate objects.  For
example, in conjnction with the
.Nm lv
command, the
.Nm -r
option will also show information about the plexes and subdisks belonging to the
volume.
.It Cd -s
The
.Nm -s
option is used by the list commands to display statistical information.
.El
.Pp
.Ss COMMANDS IN DETAIL
.Pp
.Nm
commands perform the following functions:
.Bl -hang
.It Nm attach Ar plex Ar volume
.Op Nm rename
.if n .sp -1v
.if t .sp -.6v
.It Nm attach Ar subdisk Ar plex Ar [offset]
.Op Nm rename
.sp
.Nm
.Ar attach
inserts the specified plex or subdisk in a volume or plex.  In the case of a
subdisk, an offset in the plex may be specified.  If it is not, the subdisk will
be attached at the first possible location.  After attaching a plex to a
non-empty volume,
.Nm
reintegrates the plex.
.Pp
If the keyword
.Nm rename
is specified,
.Nm
renames the object (and in the case of a plex, any subordinate subdisks) to fit
in with the default
.Nm 
naming convention.
.Pp
A number of considerations apply to attaching subdisks:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Subdisks can normally only be attached to concatenated plexes.
.It
If a striped or RAID-5 plex is missing a subdisk (for example after drive
failure), it may be replaced by a subdisk of the same size only.  No other
attachment of subdisks is currently allowed.
.It
For concatenated plexes, the
.Ar offset
parameter specifies the offset in blocks from the beginning of the plex.  For
striped and RAID-5 plexes, it specifies the offset of the first block of the
subdisk: in other words, the offset is the numerical position of the subdisk
multiplied by the stripe size.  For example, in a plex of block size 256k, the
first subdisk will have offset 0, the second offset 256k, the third 512k, etc.
This calculation ignores parity blocks in RAID-5 plexes.
.El
.It Nm create Fl f Ar description-file
.sp
.Nm
.Ar create
is used to create any object.  In view of the relatively complicated
relationship and the potential dangers involved in creating a
.Nm
object, there is no interactive interface to this function.  See the section
CONFIGURATION FILE below for more information.
.Pp
Note that the
.Nm
.Ar create
function is additive: if you run it multiple times, you will create multiple
copies of all unnamed objects.
.Pp
Normally the
.Nm create
command will not change the names of existing
.Nm
drives, in order to avoid accidentally erasing them.  The correct way to dispose
of no longer wanted
.Nm
drives is to reset the configuration with the
.Nm resetconfig
command.  In some cases, however, it may be necessary to create new data on 
.Nm
drives which can no longer be started.  In this case, use the 
.Nm create Fl f
command.
.It Nm debug
.Pp
.Nm
.Ar debug
is used to enter the remote kernel debugger.  It is only activated if
.Nm
is built with the 
.Ar VINUMDEBUG 
option.  This option will stop the execution of the operating system until the
kernel debugger is exited.  If remote debugging is set and there is no remote
connection for a kernel debugger, it will be necessary to reset the system and
reboot in order to leave the debugger.
.It Nm debug
.Ar flags
.Pp
Set a bit mask of internal debugging flags.  These will change without warning
as the product matures; to be certain, read the header file
.Pa sys/dev/vinumvar.h .
The bit mask is composed of the following values:
.Bl -hang
.It DEBUG_ADDRESSES (1)
.br
Show buffer information during requests
.It DEBUG_NUMOUTPUT (2)
.br
Show the value of 
.Dv vp->v_numoutput.
.It DEBUG_RESID (4)
.br
Go into debugger in 
.Fd complete_rqe.
.It DEBUG_LASTREQS (8)
.br
Keep a circular buffer of last requests.
.It DEBUG_REVIVECONFLICT (16)
.br
Print info about revive conflicts.
.It DEBUG_EOFINFO (32)
.br
Print information about internal state when returning an EOF on a striped plex.
.It DEBUG_MEMFREE (64)
.br
Maintain a circular list of the last memory areas freed by the memory allocator.
.It DEBUG_REMOTEGDB (256)
.br
Go into remote
.Ic gdb
when the
.Nm debug
command is issued.
.El
.It Nm detach Op Fl f 
.Ar plex
.if n .sp -1v
.if t .sp -.6v
.It Nm detach Op Fl f 
.Ar subdisk
.sp
.Nm
.Ar detach
removes the specified plex or subdisk from the volume or plex to which it is
attached.  If removing the object would impair the data integrity of the volume,
the operation will fail unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.  If the object is named after the object above it (for
example, subdisk vol1.p7.s0 attached to plex vol1.p7), the name will be changed
by prepending the text ``ex-'' (for example, ex-vol1.p7.s0).  If necessary, the
name will be truncated in the process.
.Pp
.Nm detach
does not reduce the number of subdisks in a striped or RAID-5 plex.  Instead,
the subdisk is marked absent, and can later be replaced with the
.Nm attach
command.
.It Nm info
.br
.Nm
.Ar info
displays information about
.Nm
memory usage.  This is intended primarily for debugging.  With the 
.Fl v
option, it will give detailed information about the memory areas in use.
.Pp
With the
.Fl V
option,
.Ar info
displays information about the last up to 64 I/O requests handled by the
.Nm
driver.  This information is only collected if debug flag 8 is set.  The format
looks like:

.Ed
.Pp
The 
.Ar Buf
field always contains the address of the user buffer header.  This can be used
to identify the requests associated with a user request, though this is not 100%
reliable: theoretically two requests in sequence could use the same buffer
header, though this is not common.  The beginning of a request can be identified
by the event
.Ar 1VS .
The example above shows the requests involved in a single user request.
.Pp
The
.Ar Event
field contains information related to the sequence of events in the request
chain.  The digit
.Ar 1
to 
.Ar 6
indicates the approximate sequence of events, and the two-letter abbreviation is
a mnemonic for the location
.Bl -hang
.It 1VS
(vinumstrategy) shows information about the user request on entry to
.Fd vinumstrategy .
The device number is the
.Nm
device, and offset and length are the user parameters.  This is always the
beginning of a request sequence.
.It 2LR
(launch_requests) shows the user request just prior to launching the low-level
.Nm
requests in the function
.Fd launch_requests.
The parameters should be the same as in the
.Ar 1VS
information.
.Pp
In the following requests,
.Ar Dev
is the device number of the associated disk partition,
.Ar Offset 
is the offset from the beginning of the partition,
.Ar SD
is the subdisk index in 
.Dv vinum_conf ,
.Ar SDoff
is the offset from the beginning of the subdisk,
.Ar Doffset
is the offset of the associated data request, and
.Ar Goffset
is the offset of the associated group request, where applicable.
.It 3RQ
(request) shows one of possibly several low-level
.Nm
requests which are launched to satisfy the high-level request.  This information
is also logged in 
.Fd launch_requests.
.It 4DN
(done) is called from 
.Fd complete_rqe,
showing the completion of a request.  This completion should match a request
launched either at stage
.Ar 4DN
from 
.Fd launch_requests, 
or from 
.Fd complete_raid5_write
at stage
.Ar 5RD
or
.Ar 6RP .
.It 5RD
(RAID-5 data) is called from 
.Fd complete_raid5_write
and represents the data written to a RAID-5 data stripe after calculating
parity.
.It 6RP
(RAID-5 parity) is called from 
.Fd complete_raid5_write
and represents the data written to a RAID-5 parity stripe after calculating
parity.
.El
.\" XXX
.It Nm init Ar plex
.Pp
.Nm
.Ar init
initializes a plex by writing zeroes to all its subdisks.  This is the only way
to ensure consistent data in a plex.  You must perform this initialization
before using a RAID-5 plex.  It is also recommended for other new plexes.
.Pp
.Nm 
initializes all subdisks of a plex in parallel.  Since this operation can take a
long time, it is performed in the background.  
.Nm
prints a console message when the initialization is complete.
.It Nm label
.Ar volume
.Pp
The
.Nm label
command writes a
.Ar ufs
style volume label on a volume.  It is a simple alternative to an appropriate
call to
.Ar disklabel . 
This is needed because some
.Ar ufs
commands still read the disk to find the label instead of using the correct
.Ar ioctl
call to access it.
.Nm
maintains a volume label separately from the volume data, so this command is not
needed for
.Ar newfs .
This command is deprecated.

.Op Fl V
.Op volume
.Pp
.Ar list
is used to show information about the specified object.  If the argument is
omitted, information is shown about all objects known to
.Nm vinum .
The
.Ar l
command is a synonym for
.Ar list .
.Pp
The
.Fl r
option relates to volumes and plexes: if specified, it recursively lists
information for the subdisks and (for a volume) plexes subordinate to the
objects.  The commands
.Ar lv ,
.Ar lp ,
.Ar ls 
and 
.Ar ld
commands list only volumes, plexes, subdisks and drives respectively.  This is
particularly useful when used without parameters.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option causes
.Nm
to output device statistics, the
.Op Fl v
(verbose) option causes some additional information to be output, and the
.Op Fl V
causes considerable additional information to be output.
.It Nm makedev
.br
The
.Nm makedev
command removes the directory /dev/vinum and recreates it with device nodes
which reflect the current configuration.  This command is not intended for
general use, and is provided for emergency use only.
.Pp
.It Nm quit
Exit the
.Nm
program when running in interactive mode.  Normally this would be done by
entering the
.Ar EOF
character.
.It Nm printconfig Pa file
Write a copy of the current configuration to
.Pa file 
in a format that can be used to recreate the
.Nm
configuration.  Unlike the configuration saved on disk, it includes definitions
of the drives.
.It Nm read
.Ar disk Op disk...
.Pp
The
.Nm read
command scans the specified disks for
.Nm 
partitions containing previously created configuration information.  It reads
the configuration in order from the most recently updated to least recently
updated configuration.
.Nm
maintains an up-to-date copy of all configuration information on each disk
partition.  You must specify all of the slices in a configuration as the
parameter to this command.
.Pp
The
.Nm read
command is intended to selectively load a
.Nm
configuration on a system which has other
.Nm
partitions.  If you want to start all partitions on the system, it is easier to
use the
.Nm start
command.
.Pp
If
.Nm
encounters any errors during this command, it will turn off automatic
configuration update to avoid corrupting the copies on disk.  This will also
happen if the configuration on disk indicates a configuration error (for
example, subdisks which do not have a valid space specification).  You can turn
the updates on again with the
.Nm setdaemon
and
.Nm saveconfig
commands.  Reset bit 4 of the daemon options mask to re-enable configuration
saves.
.It Nm rename
.Op Fl r
.Ar [ drive | subdisk | plex | volume ]
.Ar newname
.Pp
Change the name of the specified object.  If the
.Fl r
option is specified, subordinate objects will be named by the default rules:
plex names will be formed by appending .p\f(BInumber\fP to the volume name, and
subdisk names will be formed by appending .s\f(BInumber\fP to the plex name.
.It Nm replace
.Ar [ subdisk | plex ]
.Ar newobject
.Pp
Replace the object with an identical other object.  This command has not yet
been implemented.
.It Nm resetconfig
.Pp
The
.Nm resetconfig
command completely obliterates the
.Nm
configuration on a system.  Use this command only when you want to completely
delete the configuration.
.Nm
will ask for confirmation: you must type in the words NO FUTURE exactly
as shown:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
# \f(CBvinum resetconfig\f(CW

WARNING!  This command will completely wipe out your vinum
configuration.  All data will be lost.  If you really want
to do this, enter the text

NO FUTURE
Enter text -> \f(BINO FUTURE\fP
Vinum configuration obliterated
.Ed
.ft R
.Pp
As the message suggests, this is a last-ditch command.  Don't use it unless you
have an existing configuration which you never want to see again.
.It Nm resetstats
.Op Fl r
.Op volume | plex | subdisk
.Pp
.Nm
maintains a number of statistical counters for each object.  See the header file
.Fi vinumvar.h
for more information.
.\" XXX put it in here when it's finalized
Use the 
.Nm resetstats
command to reset these counters.  In conjunction with the
.Fl r
option, 
.Nm
also resets the counters of subordinate objects.
.It Nm rm 
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl r
.Ar volume | plex | subdisk
.Pp
.Nm rm
removes an object from the
.Nm
configuration.  Once an object has been removed, there is no way to recover it.
Normally
.Nm
performs a large amount of consistency checking before removing an object.  The
.Fl f
option tells
.Nm
to omit this checking and remove the object anyway.  Use this option with great
care: it can result in total loss of data on a volume.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
refuses to remove a volume or plex if it has subordinate plexes or subdisks
respectively.  You can tell
.Nm
to remove the object anyway by using the
.Fl f
flag, or you can cause
.Nm
to remove the subordinate objects as well by using the
.Fl r
(recursive) flag.  If you remove a volume with the
.Fl r
flag, it will remove both the plexes and the subdisks which belong to the
plexes.
.It Nm saveconfig
.Pp
Save the current configuration to disk.  This is primarily a maintenance
function.  For example, if an error occurs on startup, updates will be
disabled.  When you reenable them, the configuration is not automatically saved
to disk.  Use this command to save the configuration.
.ig
.It Nm set
.Op Fl f
.Ar state
.Ar volume | plex | subdisk | disk
.Nm set
sets the state of the specified object to one of the valid states (see OBJECT
STATES below).  Normally
.Nm
performs a large amount of consistency checking before making the change.  The
.Fl f
option tells
.Nm
to omit this checking and perform the change anyway.  Use this option with great
care: it can result in total loss of data on a volume.
.\"XXX
.Nm This command has not yet been implemented.
..
.It Nm setdaemon
.Op value
.Pp
.Nm setdaemon
sets a variable bitmask for the
.Nm
dæmon.  This command is temporary and will be replaced.  Currently, the bit mask
may contain the bits 1 (log every action to syslog) and 4 (don't update
configuration).  Option bit 4 can be useful for error recovery.
.It Nm start
.Op volume | plex | subdisk
.Pp
.Nm start
starts one or more
.Nm
objects.  If no object names are specified,
.Nm 
scans the disks known to the system for
.Nm
drives and then reads in the configuration as described under the
.Nm read
commands.  The
.Nm
drive contains a header with all information about the data stored on the drive,
including the names of the other drives which are required in order to represent
plexes and volumes.
.Pp
If
.Nm
encounters any errors during this command, it will turn off automatic
configuration update to avoid corrupting the copies on disk.  This will also
happen if the configuration on disk indicates a configuration error (for
example, subdisks which do not have a valid space specification).  You can turn
the updates on again with the
.Nm setdaemon
and
.Nm saveconfig
command.  Reset bit 4 of the daemon options mask to re-enable configuration
saves.
.Pp
If object names are specified,
.Nm
starts them.
.Pp
To start a plex in a multi-plex volume, the data must be copied from another
plex in the volume.  Since this frequently takes a long time, it is done in the
background.
.It Nm stop
.Op Fl f
.Op volume | plex | subdisk
.Pp
If no parameters are specified,
.Nm stop
removes the
.Nm
kld and stops
.Xr vinum 8 .
This can only be done if no objects are active, In particular, the
.Fl f
flag does not override this requirement.  This command can only work if
.Nm
has been loaded as a kld, since it is not possible to unload a statically
configured driver, 
.\" XXX why?
and it must be issued at a command prompt: the command 
.Nm vinum stop
will not work.
.Nm 
.Nm stop
will fail if
.Nm
is statically configured.
.Pp
If object names are specified,
.Nm stop
disables access to the objects.  If the objects have  subordinate objects, they
subordinate objects must either already be inactive (stopped or in error), or
the
.Fl r
and
.Fl f
flags must be specified.  This command does not remove the objects from the
configuration.  They can be accessed again after a
.Nm start 
command.
.Pp
By default, 
.Nm
does not stop active objects.  For example, you cannot stop a plex which is
attached to an active volume, and you cannot stop a volume which is open.  The
.Fl f
option tells
.Nm
to omit this checking and remove the object anyway.  Use this option with great
care and understanding: used incorrectly, it can result in serious data
corruption.
.El
.Ss CONFIGURATION FILE
.Nm
requires that all parameters to the
.Nm create
commands must be in a configuration file.  Entries in the configuration file
define volumes, plexes and subdisks, and may be in free format, except that each
entry must be on a single line.
.Pp
Some configuration file parameters specify a size (lengths, stripe sizes).
These lengths can be specified as bytes, as sectors of 512 bytes (by appending
the letter \f(CWb\fR), as kilobytes (by appending the letter \f(CWk\fR), as
megabytes (by appending the letter \f(CWm\fR) or as gigabytes (by appending the
letter \f(CWg\fR).  These quantities represent the values 2**10, 2**20 and 2**30
respectively.  For example, the value \f(CW16777216\fR bytes can also be written
as \f(CW16m\fR, \f(CW16384k\fR or \f(CW32768b\fR.
.Pp
The configuration file can contain the following entries:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width 4n
.It Nm volume
.Ar name 
.Op options
.Pp
Define a volume with name
.Ar name .
.Pp
Options are:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width 18n
.It Nm plex Ar plexname
Add the specified plex to the volume.  If
.Ar plexname
is specified as 
.Ar * ,
.Nm
will look for the definition of the plex as the next possible entry in the
configuration file after the definition of the volume.
.It Nm readpol Ar policy
Define a
.Ar read policy
for the volume.
.Ar policy
may be either 
.Nm round
or
.Nm prefer Ar plexname .
.Nm
satisfies a read request from only one of the plexes.  A
.Ar round
read policy specifies that each read should be performed from a different plex
in \fIround-robin\fR\| fashion.  A
.Ar prefer
read policy reads from the specified plex every time.
.It Nm setupstate
When creating a multi-plex volume, assume that the contents of all the plexes
are consistent.  This is normally not the case, and correctly you should use the
.Nm init
command to first bring them to a consistent state.  In the case of striped and
concatenated plexes, however, it does not normally cause problems to leave them
inconsistent: when using a volume for a file system or a swap partition, the
previous contents of the disks are not of interest, so they may be ignored.
If you want to take this risk, use this keyword.  It will only apply to the
plexes defined immediately after the volume in the configuration file.  If you
add plexes to a volume at a later time, you must integrate them.
.Pp
Note that you \fImust\fP\| use the
.Nm init
command with RAID-5 plexes: otherwise extreme data corruption will result if one
subdisk fails.
.fi
.El
.It Nm plex Op options
.Pp
Define a plex.  Unlike a volume, a plex does not need a name.  The options may
be:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width 18n
.It Nm name Ar plexname
Specify the name of the plex.  Note that you must use the keyword
.Ar name
when naming a plex or subdisk.
.sp
.It Nm org Ar organization Op stripesize
.Pp
Specify the organization of the plex.
.Ar organization
can be one of 
.Ar concat ,
.Ar striped
or
.Ar raid5 .
For
.Ar striped
and
.Ar raid5 
plexes, the parameter
.Ar stripesize
must be specified, while for
.Ar concat
it must be omitted.  For type
.Ar striped ,
it specifies the width of each stripe.  For type
.Ar raid5 ,
it specifies the size of a group.  A group is a portion of a plex which
stores the parity bits all in the same subdisk.   It must be a factor of the plex size (in
other words, the result of dividing the plex size by the stripe size must be an
integer), and it must be a multiple of a disk sector (512 bytes).
.sp
For optimum performance, stripes should be at least 128 kB in size: anything
smaller will result in a significant increase in I/O activity due to mapping of
individual requests over multiple disks.  The performance improvement due to the
increased number of concurrent transfers caused by this mapping will not make up
for the performance drop due to the increase in latency.  A good guideline for
stripe size is between 256 kB and 512 kB.
.Pp
A striped plex must have at least two subdisks (otherwise it is a concatenated
plex), and each must be the same size.  A RAID-5 plex must have at least three
subdisks, and each must be the same size.  In practice, a RAID-5 plex should
have at least 5 subdisks.
.Pp
.It Nm volume Ar volname
Add the plex to the specified volume.  If no
.Nm volume
keyword is specified, the plex will be added to the last volume mentioned in the
configuration file.
.sp
.It Nm sd Ar sdname Ar offset
Add the specified subdisk to the  plex at offset
.Ar offset .
.br
.fi
.El
.It Nm subdisk Op options
.Pp
Define a subdisk.  Options may be:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width 18n
.nf
.sp
.It Nm name Ar name
Specify the name of a subdisk.  It is not necessary to specify a name for a
subdisk\(emsee OBJECT NAMING above.  Note that you must specify the keyword
.Ar name
if you wish to name a subdisk.
.sp
.It Nm plexoffset Ar offset
Specify the starting offset of the subdisk in the plex.  If not specified,
.Nm
allocates the space immediately after the previous subdisk, if any, or otherwise
at the beginning of the plex.
.sp
.It Nm driveoffset Ar offset
Specify the starting offset of the subdisk in the drive.  If not specified,
.Nm
allocates the first contiguous
.Ar length
bytes of free space on the drive.
.sp
.It Nm length Ar length
Specify the length of the subdisk.  This keyword must be specified.  There is no
default.
.Nm length
may be shortened to 
.Nm len .
.sp
.It Nm plex Ar plex
Specify the plex to which the subdisk belongs.  By default, the subdisk belongs
to the last plex specified.
.sp
.It Nm drive Ar drive
Specify the drive on which the subdisk resides.  By default, the subdisk resides
on the last drive specified.
.br
.fi
.El
.It Nm drive Ar name Op options
.Pp
Define a drive.  The option must be:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width 18n
.It Nm device Ar devicename
Specify the device on which the drive resides.

.Ss DRIVE LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS
.Nm
drives are currently BSD disk partitions.  They must be of type
.Ar vinum 
in order to avoid overwriting file systems.  For compatibility reasons,
.Nm 
currently accepts partitions of type
.Ar unused ,
but the next release will not allow this kind of partition.
.Nm
prints a warning message when reading a configuration from a partition of type
.Ar unused .
Use
.Nm disklabel
.Ar -e
to edit a partition type definition.  The following display shows a typical
partition layout as shown by
.Nm disklabel:
.Bd -literal
8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  a:    81920   344064    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.  240*- 297*)
  b:   262144    81920      swap                        # (Cyl.   57*- 240*)
  c:  4226725        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 2955*)
  e:    81920        0    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 57*)
  f:  1900000   425984    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.  297*- 1626*)
  g:  1900741  2325984     vinum        0     0     0   # (Cyl. 1626*- 2955*)
.Ed
.sp
In this example, partition 
.Nm g
may be used as a
.Nm
partition.  Partitions 
.Nm a ,
.Nm e 
and
.Nm f
may be used as
.Nm UFS
file systems or
.Nm ccd
partitions.  Partition 
.Nm b
is a swap partition, and partition
.Nm c
represents the whole disk and should not be used for any other purpose.
.Pp
.Nm
uses the first 265 sectors on each partition for configuration information, so
the maximum size of a subdisk is 265 sectors smaller than the drive.
.Sh GOTCHAS
The following points are not bugs, and they have good reasons for existing, but
they have shown to cause confusion.  Each is discussed in the appropriate
section above.
.Bl -enum
.It
.Nm
will not create a device on UFS partitions.  Instead, it will return an error
message ``wrong partition type''.  The partition type should be
.Ar vinum ,
though currently partitions of type
.Ar unused 
are also accepted.
.It
When you create a volume with multiple plexes,
.Nm 
does not automatically initialize the plexes.  This means that the contents are
not known, but they are certainly not consistent.  As a result, by default 
.Nm
sets the state of all newly-created plexes except the first to
.Ar stale .
In order to synchronize them with the first plex, you must
.Nm start
their subdisks, which causes
.Nm
to copy the data from a plex which is in the 
.Ar up
state.  Depending on the size of the subdisks involved, this can take a long
time.
.Pp
In practice, people aren't too interested in what was in the plex when it was
created, and other volume managers cheat by setting them 
.Ar up
anyway.
.Nm
provides two ways to ensure that newly created plexes are
.Ar up :
.Bl -bullet
.It
Create the plexes and then synchronize them with
.Nm vinum start .
.It
Create the volume (not the plex) with the keyword
.Ar setupstate ,
which tells
.Nm
to ignore any possible inconsistency and set the plexes to be
.Ar up .
.El
.It
Some of the commands currently supported by
.Nm
are not really needed.  For reasons which I don't understand, however, I find
that users frequently try the
.Nm label
and 
.Nm resetconfig
commands, though especially
.Nm resetconfig
outputs all sort of dire warnings.  Don't use these commands unless you have a
good reason to do so.
.It
Some state transitions are not very intuitive.  In fact, it's not clear whether
this is a bug or a feature.  If you find that you can't start an object in some
strange state, such as a
.Ar reborn
subdisk, try first to get it into
.Ar stopped
state, with the
.Nm stop
or
.Nm stop Ar -f
commands.  If that works, you should then be able to start it.  If you find 
that this is the only way to get out of a position where easier methods fail,
please report the situation.
.It
If you build the kernel module with the
.Ar -DVINUMDEBUG
option, you must also build
.Nm vinum(8)
with the
.Ar -DVINUMDEBUG
option, since the size of some data objects used by both components depends on
this option.  If you don't do so, commands will fail with the message
.Ar Invalid argument ,
and a console message will be logged such as
.Pp
.Bd -literal
vinumioctl: invalid ioctl from process 247 (vinum): c0e44642
.Ed
.Pp
This error may also occur if you use old versions of kld or userland program.
