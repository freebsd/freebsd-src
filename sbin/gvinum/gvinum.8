.Sh NAME
.Nm gvinum
.Nd Logical Volume Manager control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar command
.Op Fl options
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Xo
.Ic checkparity
.Op Fl f
.Ar plex
.Xc 
Check the parity blocks of a RAID-5 plex.  The parity check will start at the
beginning of the plex if the 
.Fl f
flag is specified, or otherwise at the location of the parity check pointer,
the first location at which plex's parity is incorrect.  All subdisks in the
plex must be up for a parity check.
.It Xo
.Ic create
.Op Ar description-file
.Xc
Create a volume as described in
.Ar description-file .
If no
.Ar description-file 
provided, opens an editor and provides the current 
.Nm
configuration for editing.
.It Xo
.Ic help
.Xc
Provides a synopsis of 
.Nm 
commands and arguments.
.It Xo
.Ic l | list
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar volume | plex | subdisk
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic ld
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar drive ...
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic ls
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar subdisk ...
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic lp
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar plex ...
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic lv
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar volume ...
.Xc
List information about the relevant object(s).  The
.Fl r
flag provides recursive display, showing each object's subordinate objects in
proper relation.  The 
.Fl v
and 
.Fl V
flags provide progressively more detailed output.
.It Xo
.Ic move | mv
.Fl f
.Ar drive subdisk 
.Op Ar ...
.Xc
Move the subdisk(s) to the specified drive.  The 
.Fl f 
flag is required, as all data on the indicated subdisk(s) will be destroyed as
part of the move.  This can currently only be done when the subdisk is
not being accessed.
.Pp
If the subdisk(s) form part of a RAID-5 plex, the disk(s) will need to be set
to the 'up' state and the plex will require a 
.Ic rebuildparity
command; if the subdisk(s) form part of a plex that is mirrored with other
plexes, the plex will require restarting and will sync once restarted.  Moving
more than one subdisk in a RAID-5 plex or subdisks from both sides of a
mirrored plex volume will destroy data.  Note that parity rebuilds and syncing
must be started manually after a move.
.It Xo
.Ic printconfig
.Xc
Write a copy of the current configuration to standard output.
.It Xo
.Ic quit
.Xc
Exit 
.Nm
when running in interactive mode.  Normally this would be done by entering the
EOF character.
.It Xo
.Ic rename
.Op Fl r
.Ar drive | subdisk | plex | volume
.Ar newname
.Xc
Change the name of the specified object.  The 
.Fl r
flag will recursively rename subordinate objects.
.Pp
Note that device nodes will not be renamed until 
.Nm
is restarted.
.It Xo
.Ic rebuildparity
.Op Fl f
.Ar plex
.Xc
Rebuild the parity blocks of a RAID-5 plex.  The parity rebuild will start at
the beginning of the plex if the 
.Fl f
flag is specified, or otherwise at the location of the parity check pointer.
All subdisks in the plex must be up for a parity check.
.It Xo
.Ic rm
.Op Fl r
.Ar volume | plex | subdisk
.Xc
Remove an object and, if 
.Fl r
is specified, its subordinate objects.
.It Xo
.Ic saveconfig
.Xc
Save 
.Nm
configuration to disk after configuration failures.
.It Xo
.Ic setstate
.Op Fl f
.Ar state
.Ar volume | plex | subdisk | drive
.Xc
Set state without influencing other objects, for diagnostic purposes 
only.  The 
.Fl f
flag forces state changes regardless of whether they are legal.
.It Xo
.Ic start
.Xc 
Read configuration from all vinum drives.
.It Xo
.Ic start
.Op Fl S Ar size
.Ar volume | plex | subdisk
.Xc
Allow the system to access the objects.  The
.Fl S
flag is currently ignored.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the kernel component of the GVinum logical volume
manager.  It is designed either for interactive use, when started without
command line arguments, or to execute a single command if the command is
supplied on the command line.  In interactive mode, 
.Nm
maintains a command line history.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
commands may be followed by an option.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
The
.Fl f
.Pq Dq force
option overrides safety checks.  It should be used with extreme caution.  This
option is required in order to use the 
.Ic move
command.
.It Fl r
The 
.Fl r
.Pq Dq recursive
option applies the command recursively to subordinate objects.  For example, in
conjunction with the
.Ic lv
command, the 
.Fl r
option will also show information about the plexes and subdisks belonging to
the volume.  It is also used by the 
.Ic rename
command to indicate that subordinate objects such as subdisks should be renamed
to match the object(s) specified and by the 
.Ic rm
command to delete plexes belonging to a volume and so on.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
.Pq Dq verbose
option provides more detailed output.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V
.Pq Dq very verbose
option provides even more detailed output than
.Fl v .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in 
.Fx 5.3 .  The 
.Nm vinum 
utility, on which
.Nm 
is based, was written by Greg Lehey.
.Pp
.Nm 
was written by Lukas Ertl.  The move and rename commands and 
documentation were added by Chris Jones through the 2005 Google Summer 
of Code program.
.Sh BUGS
.Xr gvinum 8 does not rename devices in
.Pa /dev/gvinum 
until reloaded.
.Pp
The 
.Fl S
initsize flag to 
.Ic start
is ignored.
.Pp
The 
.Ic stop
command does not work.
.Pp
Moving subdisks that are not part of a mirrored or RAID-5 volume will 
destroy data.  It is perhaps a bug to permit this.  
.Pp
Plexes in which subdisks have been moved do not automatically sync or 
rebuild parity.  This may leave data unprotected and is perhaps unwise.
.Pp
.Xr gvinum 8 does not yet fully implement all functions found in  
.Xr vinum 4 .  Specifically, the following commands from 
.Xr vinum 4 are not supported:
