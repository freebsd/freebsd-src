.Sh NAME
.Nm fsirand
.Nd randomize inode generation numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl p
.Ar special
.Op Ar "special ..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs random generation numbers on all the inodes for
each file system specified on the command line by
.Ar special .
This increases the security of NFS-exported file systems by making
it difficult to ``guess'' filehandles.
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Xr newfs 8
now does the equivalent of
.Nm
itself so it is no longer necessary to
run
.Nm
by hand on a new file system.
It is only used to
re-randomize or report on an existing file system.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility should only be used on an unmounted file system that
has been checked with
.Xr fsck 8
or a file system that is mounted read-only.
The
.Nm
utility may be used on the root file system in single-user mode
but the system should be rebooted via ``reboot -n'' afterwards.
.Sh OPTIONS
The available options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Use the default block size (usually 512 bytes) instead
of the value gleaned from the disklabel.
.It Fl f
Force
.Nm
to run even if the file system on
.Ar special
is not marked as clean.
.It Fl p
Print the current generation numbers for all inodes instead of
generating new ones.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in SunOS 3.x.
.Pp
This version of
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 2.1 .

A
.Fx
version first appeared in
.Fx 2.2.5 .

.Sh CAVEATS
Since
.Nm
allocates enough memory to hold all the inodes in
a given cylinder group it may use a large amount
of memory for large disks with few cylinder groups.
