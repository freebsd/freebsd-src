/* EXAMPLES TO END OF FILE

# Examples of notify hooks.  A notify is a generic way for a kernel
# subsystem to send event notification to userland.

# Here are some examples of ACPI notify handlers.  ACPI subsystems that
# generate notifies include the AC adapter, power/sleep buttons,
# control method batteries, lid switch, and thermal zones.
#
# Information returned is not always the same as the ACPI notify
# events.  See the ACPI specification for more information about
# notifies.  Here is the information returned for each subsystem:
#
# ACAD:            AC line state (0 is offline, 1 is online)
# Button:          Button pressed (0 for power, 1 for sleep)
# CMBAT:           ACPI battery events
# Lid:             Lid state (0 is closed, 1 is open)
# Suspend, Resume: Suspend and resume notification
# Thermal:         ACPI thermal zone events
#
# This example calls a script when the AC state changes, passing the
# notify value as the first argument.  If the state is 0x00, it might
# call some sysctls to implement economy mode.  If 0x01, it might set
# the mode to performance.
notify 10 {
	match "system"		"ACPI";
	match "subsystem"	"ACAD";
	action			"/etc/acpi_ac $notify";
};

# This example works around a memory leak in PostgreSQL, restarting
# it when the "user:postgres:swap:devctl=1G" rctl(8) rule gets triggered.
notify 0 {
	match "system"		"RCTL";
	match "rule"		"user:770:swap:.*";
	action			"service postgresql restart";
};

# Handle userland coredumps.
# This commented out handler makes it possible to run an
# automated debugging session after the core dump is generated.
# Replace action with a proper coredump handler, but be aware that
# it will run with elevated privileges.

	match "system"          "kernel";
	match "subsystem"       "signal";
	match "type"            "coredump";
	action "logger $comm $core";
};

# Let the init(8) know there's a new USB serial interface it might
# want to run getty(8) for.  This includes device-side tty created
# by usb_template(4).
