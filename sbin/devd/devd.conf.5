.Sh NAME
.Nm devd.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr devd 8
.Sh OVERVIEW
.Ss General Syntax
A
.Xr devd 8
configuration consists of two general features, statements
and comments.
All statements end with a semicolon.
Many statements can contain substatements, which are each also
terminated with a semicolon.
.Pp
The following statements are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 0n
.It Ic options
specifies various options and parameters for the operation of
.Xr devd 8 .
.It Ic attach
specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
a newly attached device matches said criteria.
.It Ic detach
specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
a newly attached device matches said criteria.
.It Ic nomatch
specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
no device driver currently loaded in the kernel claims a (new)
device.
.El
.Pp
Statements may occur in any order in the config file, and may be
repated as often as required.
Further details on the syntax and meaning of each statement, and their
substatements is explained below.
.Pp
Comments may appear anywhere that whitespace may appear in a
configuration file.  To appeal to programmers of all kinds, they can
be written in C, C++, or shell/perl constructs.
.Pp
C-style comments start with the two characters
.Li /*
(slash, star) and end with
.Li */
(star, slash).
Because they are completely delimited with these characters,
they can be used to comment only a portion of a line or to span
multiple lines.
.Pp
C-style comments cannot be nested.  For example, the following is
not valid because the entire comment ends with the first
.Li */ :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/* This is the start of a comment.
   This is still part of the comment.
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */
   This is no longer in any comment. */
.Ed
.Pp
C++-style comments start with the two characters
.Li //
(slash, slash) and continue to the end of the physical line.
They cannot be continued across multiple physical lines; to have
one logical comment span multiple lines, each line must use the
.Li //
pair.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
// This is the start of a comment.  The next line
// is a new comment, even though it is logically
// part of the previous comment.
