.Dt REBOOT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm reboot ,
.Nm halt ,
.Nm fastboot ,
.Nm fasthalt
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl nqp
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl dnqp
.Nm fasthalt
.Op Fl nqp
.Nm fastboot
.Op Fl dnqp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes
a
.Dv SIGTERM
(and subsequently a
.Dv SIGKILL )
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the
.Xr wtmp 5
file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The system is requested to create a crash dump.  This option is
supported only when rebooting, and it has no effect unless a dump
device has previously been specified with
.Xr dumpon 8 .
.It Fl n
The file system cache is not flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl q
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
.Fl n
is not specified).
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl p
The system will turn off the power
if it can.
This is of course likely to make 
.Nm
rather similar to 
.Nm halt .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm fasthalt
and
.Nm fastboot
utilities are nothing more than aliases for the
.Nm halt
and
.Nm
utilities.
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom and cleanly terminating
specific programs.
