.Sh NAME
.Nm dumpon
.Nd "specify a device for crash dumps"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar special_file
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar off
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to specify a device where the kernel can save a crash dump in
the case of a panic.
.Pp
Calls to
.Nm
normally occur from the system multi-user initialization file
.Pa /etc/rc ,
controlled by the
.Dq dumpdev
variable in the boot time configuration file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
The size of the specified dump device must be at least 64 KB greater
than the size of physical memory.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
flag causes
.Nm
to be verbose about its activity.
.Sh NOTES
Since a
.Xr panic 9
condition may occur in a situation
where the kernel cannot trust its internal representation
of the state of any given file system,
one of the system swap devices,
and
.Em not
a device containing a file system,
should be used as the dump device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility operates by setting the
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB variable
.Dq kern.dumpdev
to the device number of the designated
.Ar special_file
or to
.Dv NODEV
(meaning that no dumps are to be taken) if
.Ar special_file
is the text string:
.Dq Li off .
.Pp
Since
.Nm
cannot be used during kernel initialization, the
.Va dumpdev
variable of
.Xr loader 8
must be used to enable dumps for system panics which occur
during kernel initialization.

.El
.Sh BUGS
Because the file system layer is already dead by the time a crash dump
is taken, it is not possible to send crash dumps directly to a file.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 2.1 .
