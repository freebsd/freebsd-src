.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rtquery
is used to query a RIP network routing daemon,
.Xr routed 8
or
.Xr gated 8 ,
for its routing table by sending a
.Em request
or
.Em poll
command.
The routing information in any routing
.Em response
packets returned is displayed numerically and symbolically.
.Pp
.Nm Rtquery
by default uses the
.Em request
command.
When the
.Fl p
option is specified,
.Nm
uses the
.Em poll
command, an
undocumented extension to the RIP protocol supported by
.Xr gated 8 .
When querying
.Xr gated 8 ,
the
.Em poll
command is preferred over the
.Em request
command because the response is not subject to Split Horizon and/or
Poisoned Reverse, and because some versions of gated do not answer the
.Em request
command.
.Xr Routed 8
does not answer the
.Em poll
command, but recognizes
.Em requests
coming from
.Nm
and so answers completely.
.Pp
.Nm Rtquery
is also used to turn tracing on or off in
.Xr routed 8 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
displays only the numeric network and host numbers instead of both
numeric and symbolic.
.It Fl p
uses the
.Em poll
command to request full routing information from
.Xr gated 8 .
This is an undocumented extension RIP protocol supported only by
.Xr gated 8 .
.It Fl 1
queries using RIP version 1 instead of RIP version 2.
.It Fl w Ar timeout
changes the delay for an answer from each host.
By default, each host is given 15 seconds to respond.
.It Fl r Ar addr
asks about the route to destination
.Em addr .
.It Fl a Ar passwd=XXX
.It Fl a Ar md5_passwd=XXX|KeyID
causes the query to be sent with the indicated cleartext or MD5 password.
.It Fl t Ar op
changes tracing, where
.Em op
is one of the following.
Requests from processes not running with UID 0 or on distant networks
are generally ignored by the daemon except for a message in the system log.
.Xr Gated 8
is likely to ignore these debugging requests.
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent-two
.It Em on=tracefile
turns tracing on into the specified file.
That file must usually have been specified when the daemon was
started or be the same as a fixed name, often
.Pa /etc/routed.trace .
.It Em more
increases the debugging level.
.It Em off
turns off tracing.
.It Em dump
dumps the daemon's routing table to the current tracefile.
