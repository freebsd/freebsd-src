.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsiod
.Nd local
.Tn NFS
asynchronous I/O server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsiod
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nfsiod
runs on an
.Tn NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to its server.
It improves performance but is not required for correct operation.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, a single server is started.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Specify how many servers are to be started.
.El
.Pp
A client should run enough daemons to handle its maximum
level of concurrency, typically four to six.
.Pp
If
.Nm nfsiod
detects that the running kernel does not include
.Tn NFS
support, it will attempt to load a loadable kernel module containing
.Tn NFS
code, using
.Xr modload 8
by way of
.Xr vfsload 3 .
If this fails, or no
.Tn NFS
LKM was available,
.Nm nfsiod
exits with an error.
.Pp
The
.Nm nfsiod
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr nfssvc 2 ,
.Xr modload 8 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr portmap 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm nfsiod
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
