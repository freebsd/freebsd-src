.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a control program that provides the user access and control to the
.Fx
.Xr ata 4
subsystem.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
can cause severe system crashes and loss of data if used improperly.
Please
exercise caution when using this command!
.Pp
The
.Ar channel
argument is the ATA channel device (e.g., ata0) on which to operate.
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "rebuild"
.It Ic attach
Attach an ATA
.Ar channel .
Devices on the channel are probed and attached as
is done on boot.
.It Ic detach
Detach an ATA
.Ar channel .
Devices on the channel are removed from the kernel,
and all outstanding transfers etc.\& are returned back to the system marked
as failed.
.It Ic reinit
Reinitialize an ATA
.Ar channel .
Both devices on the channel are reset and
initialized to the parameters the ATA driver has stored internally.
Devices that have gone bad and no longer respond to the probe, or devices
that have physically been removed, are removed from the kernel.
Likewise are devices that show up during a reset, probed and attached.
.It Ic create
Create a
.Ar type
ATA RAID.
The type can be
.Cm RAID0
(stripe),
.Cm RAID1
(mirror),
.Cm RAID0+1 ,
.Cm SPAN
or
.Cm JBOD .
In case the RAID has a
.Cm RAID0
component,
the
.Ar interleave
must be specified in number of sectors.
The RAID will be created
of the individual disks named
.Bk -words
.Ar disk0 ... diskN .
.Ek
.Pp
Although the ATA driver allows for creating an ATA RAID on disks with any
controller, there are restrictions.
It is only possible to boot on
an array if it is either located on a
.Dq real
ATA RAID controller like
the Promise or Highpoint controllers, or if the RAID declared is of
.Cm RAID1
or
.Cm SPAN
type; in case of a
.Cm SPAN ,
the partition to boot must
reside on the first disk in the SPAN.
.It Ic delete
Delete a RAID array on a RAID capable ATA controller.
.It Ic addspare
Add a spare disk to an existing RAID.
.It Ic rebuild
Rebuild a RAID1 array on a RAID capable ATA controller.
.It Ic status
Get the status of an ATA RAID.
.It Ic mode
Without the mode argument, the current transfer modes of the
device are printed.
If the mode argument is given, the ATA driver
is asked to change the transfer mode to the one given.
The ATA driver
will reject modes that are not supported by the hardware.
Modes are given like
.Dq Li PIO3 ,
.Dq Li udma2 ,
.Dq Li udma100 ,
case does not matter.
.Pp
Currently supported modes are:
.Cm PIO0 , PIO1 , PIO2 , PIO3 , PIO4 ,
.Cm WDMA2 ,
.Cm UDMA2
(alias
.Cm UDMA33 ) ,
.Cm UDMA4
(alias
.Cm UDMA66 ) ,
.Cm UDMA5
(alias
.Cm UDMA100 )
and
.Cm UDMA6
(alias
.Cm UDMA133 ) .
The device name and manufacture/version strings are shown.
.It Ic cap
Show detailed info about the device on
.Ar device .
.It Ic info
Show info about the attached devices on the
.Ar channel .
.It Ic list
Show info about all attached devices on all active controllers.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To get information on devices attached to a channel,
use the command line:
.Pp
.Dl "atacontrol info ata0"
.Pp
To see the devices' current access modes, use the command line:
.Pp
.Dl "atacontrol mode ad0"
.Pp
which results in the modes of the devices being displayed as a string
like this:
.Pp
.Dl "current mode = UDMA100"
.Pp
You can set the mode with
.Nm
and a string like the above,
for example:
.Pp
.Dl "atacontrol mode ad0 PIO4"
.Pp
The new modes are set as soon as the
.Nm
command returns.
