.Sh NAME
.Nm nextboot
.Nd install a default bootstring block on the boot disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b
.Ar filename bootstring
.Ar
.Nm
.Op Fl ed
.Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fx
program
.Nm
controls the actions of the boot blocks at the time of the next boot.
If compiled with the correct option,
the boot blocks will check the nameblock for a magic number and a
default name to use for booting.
If compiled to do so they will also
delete the name from the block, ensuring that if the boot should fail,
then it will not be tried again.
It is the job of
.Pa /etc/rc
to use
.Nm
to re-install the string if that boot is found to have succeeded.
This allows a one-time only boot string to be used for such applications
as remote debugging, and installation of new, untrusted kernels.
The nameblock is defined at compile time to be the second physical block
on the disk.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Is used for bootstrapping (initially configuring) the nameblock.
Without
this,
.Nm
will refuse to write to a block that does not already contain the magic
number.
.It Fl d
Disable (temporarily) an existing name block by changing a bit
in the magic number.
.It Fl e
Restore the good magic number on a block disabled by
.Fl d .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl e
and
.Fl d
flags are mutually exclusive.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nextboot
first checks that the disk has an fdisk table and checks that none of the
partitions defined in that table include the nameblock.
If the name block is
shown to be unused, it will install the bootstrings given as arguments,
one after the other, each preceded by a small magic number, and NULL
terminated.
The end of the list of strings is delimited by a sequence of
0xff bytes.
If the boot blocks are compiled to write back the nameblock
after each boot, it will zero out the supplied names as it uses them,
one per boot,
until it reaches the 0xff, at which time it will revert to the compiled in
boot string.
At this time the nameblock will contain only zeroed out names.
.Pp
An example of usage might be:
.Bd -literal
   nextboot -b  /dev/rad0 1:da(0,a)/kernel.experimental ad(0,a)/kernel.old
.Ed
.Pp
Which would instruct the boot blocks at the next boot,
to try boot the experimental kernel off the SCSI disk.
If for any reason this failed, the next boot attempt would
boot the kernel
.Pa /kernel.old
off the IDE drive.  (Assuming the write-back option were enabled) If this
in turn failed.
The compiled in default would be used.
.Pp
If the write-back feature is disabled, the nextboot program is a convenient way
to change the default boot string.
Note, that should the file specified in
the nameblock be non-existent, then the name compiled into the boot blocks
will be used for the boot rather than the next name in the nameblock.
The
nameblock is only consulted
.Em once
per boot.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot 8 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8
.Sh BUGS
This program works only in conjunction with the legacy boot code.
.Pp
The entire program should be made more user-friendly.
The option of whether to write back or not should be stored on the
disk and not a compile time option.
I want to rethink this at some
later stage to make it co-exist with disks that do not have
a fdisk partitioning table (i.e. purely disklabel'd systems).
.Pp
Whether to write back or not should be specified at run-time in the nameblock
so that the boot blocks need not be altered to get this feature.
