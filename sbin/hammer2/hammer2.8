.Nd hammer2 file system utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl h
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar path
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides miscellaneous support functions for a
read-only HAMMER2 file system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Ar path
Specify the path to a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem.
At least one PFS on a HAMMER2 filesystem must be mounted for the system
to act on all PFSs managed by it.
Every HAMMER2 filesystem typically has a PFS called "LOCAL" for this purpose.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
directives are as shown below.
Note that most directives require you to either be CD'd into a hammer2
filesystem, specify a path to a mounted hammer2 filesystem via the
.Fl s
option, or specify a path after the directive.
It depends on the directive.
All hammer2 filesystem have a PFS called "LOCAL" which is typically mounted
locally on the host in order to be able to issue commands for other PFSs
on the filesystem.
The mount also enables PFS configuration scanning for that filesystem.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" ==== pfs-list ====
.It Cm pfs-list Op path...
List all PFSs associated with all mounted hammer2 storage devices.
The list may be restricted to a particular filesystem using
.Fl s Ar mount .
.Pp
Note that hammer2 PFSs associated with storage devices which have not been
mounted in any fashion will not be listed.
At least one hammer2 label must be mounted for the PFSs on that device to be
visible.
.\" ==== pfs-clid ====
.It Cm pfs-clid Ar label
Print the cluster id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== pfs-fsid ====
.It Cm pfs-fsid Ar label
Print the unique filesystem id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== stat ====
.It Cm stat Op path...
Print the inode statistics, compression, and other meta-data associated
with a list of paths.
.\" ==== show ====
.It Cm show Ar devpath
Dump the radix tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== freemap ====
.It Cm freemap Ar devpath
Dump the freemap tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== volhdr ====
.It Cm volhdr Ar devpath
Dump the volume header for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== volume-list ====
.It Cm volume-list Op path...
List all volumes associated with all mounted hammer2 storage devices.
The list may be restricted to a particular filesystem using
.Fl s Ar mount .
.Pp
Note that hammer2 volumes associated with storage devices which have not been
mounted in any fashion will not be listed.
At least one hammer2 label must be mounted for the volumes on that device to be
visible.
.\" ==== printinode ====
.It Cm printinode Ar path
Dump inode.
