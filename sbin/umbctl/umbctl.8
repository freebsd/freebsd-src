.Sh NAME
.Nm umbctl
.Nd display or set MBIM cellular modem interface parameters (4G/LTE)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar ifname
.Op Ar parameter Op Ar value
.Ar ...
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Fl f Ar config-file
.Ar ifname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "-f config_file"
.It Fl f Ar config-file
Parse
.Ar config-file
for
.Ar parameter Ns Op \&= Ns Ar value
pairs, one per line, as if they had been specified on the command line.
This allows the password or PIN codes to be not passed as command line
arguments.
Comments starting with # to the end of the current line are ignored.
.It Fl v
Enables verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr umb 4
driver may require a number of additional arguments or optional
parameters besides the settings that can be adjusted with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
These may be credentials or other tunable connectivity variables.
The
.Nm
utility can be used to display the current settings, or to adjust these
parameters as required.
.Pp
For whatever intent
.Nm
is being called, at least the parameter
.Ar ifname
needs to be specified, naming the interface for which the settings
are to be performed or displayed.
Use
.Xr ifconfig 8
or
.Xr netstat 1
to see which interfaces are available.
.Pp
If no other parameter is given,
.Nm
will just list the current status for
.Ar ifname
and exit.
.Pp
If any additional parameter is supplied, superuser privileges are
required, and the command works in
.Ql set
mode.
This is normally done quietly, unless the option
.Fl v
is also enabled, which will cause a final printout of the status as
described above once all other actions have been taken.
.Pp
The parameters currently supported include:
.Bl -tag -width "username=username"
.It Ar apn Ns \&= Ns Em access-point
Set the APN to
.Em access-point .
.It Ar username Ns \&= Ns Em username
Set the username to
.Em username .
.It Ar password Ns \&= Ns Em password
Set the password to
.Em password .
.It Ar pin Ns \&= Ns Em pin-code
Enter the PIN
.Em pin-code .
.It Ar puk Ns \&= Ns Em puk-code
Enter the PUK
.Em puk-code .
.It Ar roaming
Allow data connections when roaming.
.It Ar -roaming
Deny data connections when roaming.
.El
