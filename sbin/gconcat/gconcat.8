.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for device concatenation configuration.
The concatenation can be configured using two different methods:
.Dq manual
or
.Dq automatic .
When using the
.Dq manual
method, no metadata are stored on the devices, so the concatenated
device has to be configured by hand every time it is needed.
The
.Dq automatic
method use on-disk metadata to detect devices.
Once devices are labeled, they will be automatically detected and
configured.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm create
Concatenate the given devices with specified
.Ar name .
This is the
.Dq manual
method.
The kernel module
.Pa geom_concat.ko
will be loaded if it is not loaded already.
.It Cm label
Concatenate the given devices with the specified
.Ar name .
This is the
.Dq automatic
method, where metadata are stored in every device's last sector.
The kernel module
.Pa geom_concat.ko
will be loaded if it is not loaded already.
.It Cm destroy
Turn off existing concatenate device by its
.Ar name .
.It Cm clear
Clear metadata on given devices.
.It Cm list
List currently configured devices.
.El
.Pp
Additional options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Force the removal of the specified concatenated device.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to configure four disks for automatic
concatenation, create file system on it, and mount it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gconcat label -v data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2 /dev/da3
newfs /dev/data.concat
mount /dev/data.concat /mnt
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.
