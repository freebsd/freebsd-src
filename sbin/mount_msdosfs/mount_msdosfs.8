.Dt MOUNT_MSDOSFS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdosfs
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 9ls
.Op Fl D Ar DOS_codepage
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl L Ar locale
.Op Fl M Ar mask
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl W Ar table
.Ar special node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attaches the MS-DOS file system residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
The following MSDOS file system-specific options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm longnames
Force Windows 95 long filenames to be visible.
.It Cm shortnames
Force only the old MS-DOS 8.3 style filenames to be visible.
.It Cm nowin95
Completely ignore Windows 95 extended file information.
.El
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a
.Ar mask
of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The value of
.Ar -M
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -m
is omitted.
The default
.Ar mask
is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl M Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for directories
in the file system.
The value of
.Ar -m
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -M
is omitted.
See the previous option's description for details.
.It Fl s
Force behaviour to
ignore and not generate Win'95 long filenames.
.It Fl l
Force listing and generation of
Win'95 long filenames
and separate creation/modification/access dates.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl s
nor
.Fl l
are given,
.Nm
searches the root directory of the file system to
be mounted for any existing Win'95 long filenames.
If no such entries are found, but short DOS filenames are found,
.Fl s
is the default.
Otherwise
.Fl l
is assumed.
.It Fl 9
Ignore the special Win'95 directory entries even
if deleting or renaming a file.
This forces
.Fl s .
.\".It Fl G
.\"This option causes the file system to be interpreted as an Atari-Gemdos
.\"file system.
.\"The differences to the MS-DOS file system are minimal and
.\"limited to the boot block.
.\"This option enforces
.\".Fl s .
.It Fl L Ar locale
Specify locale name used for file name conversions
for DOS and Win'95 names.
By default ISO 8859-1 assumed as local character set.
.It Fl D Ar DOS_codepage
Specify the MS-DOS code page (aka IBM/OEM code page) name used for
file name conversions for DOS names.
.It Fl W Ar table
.Bf Em
This option is preserved for backward compatibility purpose only,
and will be removed in the future.
Please avoid using this option.
.Ef
.Pp
Specify text file name with conversion table:
.Pa iso22dos , iso72dos , koi2dos , koi8u2dos .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a Russian MS-DOS file system located in
.Pa /dev/ad1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount_msdosfs -L ru_RU.KOI8-R -D CP866 /dev/ad1s1 /mnt"
.Pp
To mount a Japanese MS-DOS file system located in
.Pa /dev/ad1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount_msdosfs -L ja_JP.eucJP -D CP932 /dev/ad1s1 /mnt"

.Sh CAVEATS
The use of the
.Fl 9
flag could result in damaged file systems,
albeit the damage is in part taken care of by
procedures similar to the ones used in Win'95.
.Pp
.Fx 2.1
and earlier versions could not handle cluster sizes larger than 16K.
Just mounting an MS-DOS file system could cause corruption to any
mounted file system.
Cluster sizes larger than 16K are unavoidable for file system sizes
larger than 1G, and also occur when file systems larger than 1G are
shrunk to smaller than 1G using FIPS.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 2.0 .
Its predecessor, the
.Nm mount_pcfs
utility appeared in
.Fx 1.0 ,
and was abandoned in favor
of the more aptly-named
.Nm .
.Pp
The character code conversion routine was added by
.An Ryuichiro Imura Aq imura@ryu16.org
at 2003.
