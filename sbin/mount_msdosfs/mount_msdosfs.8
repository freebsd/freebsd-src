.Dt MOUNT_MSDOS 8
.Os FreeBSD 2.0
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdos
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_msdos
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_msdos
command attaches the MS-DOS filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a mask of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.)
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The default mask is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm msdos
filesystem is not known to work reliably with filesystems created by versions
of MS-DOS later than version 3.3.
.Pp
The limitations on file names imposed by MS-DOS are strange, at best.
For instance, they are
limited to single-case, 8 character names with 3 character extensions.
.Pp
If you see the warning:
.Pp
mountmsdosfs(): Warning: root directory is not a multiple of the clustersize in length
.Pp
then it is possible that writing to the MS-DOS filesystem would
produce corruption on the disk. This is a shortcoming in the code
which needs to be addressed.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_msdos
utility first appeared in FreeBSD 2.0.
Its predecessor, the
.Nm mount_pcfs
utility appeared in FreeBSD 1, and was abandoned in favor
of the more aptly-named
.Nm mount_msdos .
