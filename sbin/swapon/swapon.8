.Sh NAME
.Nm swapon , swapoff
.Nd "specify devices for paging and swapping"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm swap[on|off]
.Fl a
.Nm swap[on|off]
.Ar special_file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm swapon
utility is used to specify additional devices on which paging and swapping
are to take place.
The system begins by swapping and paging on only a single device
so that only one disk is required at bootstrap time.
Calls to
.Nm swapon
normally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
.Pa /etc/rc
making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping
activity is interleaved across several devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm swapoff
utility disables paging and swapping on a device.
Calls to
.Nm swapoff
succeed only if disabling the device would leave enough
remaining virtual memory to accomodate all running programs.
.Pp
Normally, the first form is used:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
All devices marked as ``sw''
swap devices in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are added to or removed from the pool of available swap
unless their ``noauto'' option is also set.
.El
.Pp
The second form is used to configure or disable individual devices.
