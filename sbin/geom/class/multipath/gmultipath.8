.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl v

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for device multipath configuration.
.Pp
Only automatic configuration is supported at the present time via the
.It Cm label
command.
This operation writes a label on the last sector of the underlying
disk device with a contained name and UUID.
The UUID guarantees uniqueness
in in a shared storage environment but is in general too cumbersome to use.
The name is what is exported via the device interface.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm label
Label the given underlying device with the specified
.Ar name .
The kernel module
.Pa geom_multipath.ko
will be loaded if it is not loaded already.
.It Cm clear
Clear metadata on the given device.
.It Cm list
See
.Xr geom 8 .
.It Cm status
See
.Xr geom 8 .
.It Cm load
See
.Xr geom 8 .
.It Cm unload
See
.Xr geom 8 .

.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variable can be used to control the behavior of the
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va kern.geom.multipath.debug : No 0
Debug level of the
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class.
This can be set to 0 (default) or 1 to disable or enable various
forms of chattiness.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.
.Sh MULTIPATH ARCHITECTURE
.Pp
This is an active/passive
multiple path architecture with no device knowledge or presumptions other
than size matching built in.
Therefore the user must exercise some care
in selecting providers that do indeed represent multiple paths to the
same underlying disk device.
The reason for this is that there are several
criteria across multiple underlying transport types that can
.Ar indicate
identity, but in all respects such identity can rarely be considered
.Ar definitive .
.Pp
For example, if you use the World Word Port Name of a Fibre Channel
disk object you might believe that two disks that have the same WWPN
on different paths (or even disjoint fabrics) might be considered
the same disk.
Nearly always this would be a safe assumption, until
you realize that a WWPN, like an Ethernet MAC address, is a soft
programmable entity, and that a misconfigured Director Class switch
could lead you to believe incorrectly that you have found multiple
paths to the same device.
This is an extreme and theoretical case, but
it is possible enough to indicate that the policy for deciding which
of multiple pathnames refer to the same device should be left to the
system operator who will use tools and knowledge of their own storage
subsystem to make the correct configuration selection.
.Pp
As an active/passive architecture, only one path has I/O moving on it
at any point in time.
This I/O continues until an I/O is returned with
a generic I/O error or a "Nonexistent Device" error.
When this occurs,
the active device is kicked out of the
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class and the next in a list is selected, the failed I/O reissued
and the system proceeds.
.Pp
When new devices are added to the system the
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class is given an opportunity to taste these new devices.
If a new
device has a
.Nm MULTIPATH
label, the device is used to either create a new
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM, or to attach to the end of the list of devices for an existing
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM.
.Pp
It is this mechanism that works reasonably with
.Xr isp 4
and
.Xr mpt 4
based Fibre Channel disk devices.
For these devices, when a device disappears
(due e.g., to a cable pull or power failure to a switch), the device is
proactively marked as gone and I/O to it failed.
This causes the
.Nm MULTIPATH
failure event just described.
.Pp
When Fibre Channel events inform either
.Xr isp 4
or
.Xr mpt 4
host bus adapters that new devices may have arrived (e.g., the arrival
of an RSCN event from the Fabric Domain Controller), they can cause
a rescan to occur and cause the attachment and configuration of any
(now) new devices to occur, causing the taste event described above.
.Pp
This means that this active/passive architecture is not a one-shot path
failover, but can be considered to be steady state as long as failed
paths are repaired (automatically or otherwise).
.Pp
Automatic rescanning is not a requirement.
Nor is Fibre Channel.
The
same failover mechanisms work equally well for traditional "Parallel"
SCSI but require manual intervention with
.Xr camcontrol 8
to cause the reattachment of repaired device links.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to use
.Xr camcontrol 8
to find possible multiple path devices and to create a
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class for them.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mysys# camcontrol devlist
<ECNCTX @WESTVILLE >   at scbus0 target 0 lun 0 (da0,pass0)
<ECNCTX @WESTVILLE >   at scbus0 target 0 lun 1 (da1,pass1)
<ECNCTX @WESTVILLE >   at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (da2,pass2)
<ECNCTX @WESTVILLE >   at scbus1 target 0 lun 1 (da3,pass3)
mysys# camcontrol inquiry da0 -S
ECNTX0LUN000000SER10ac0d01
mysys# camcontrol inquiry da2 -S
ECNTX0LUN000000SER10ac0d01
.Ed
.Pp
Now that you have used the Serial Number to compare two disk paths
it is not entirely unreasonable to conclude that these are multiple
paths to the same device.
However, only the user who is familiar
with their storage is qualified to make this judgement.
.Pp
You can then use the
.Nm
command to label and create the
.Nm MULTIPATH
GEOM class named 
.Ar data .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gmultipath label -v Fred /dev/da0 /dev/da2
disklabel -Brw /dev/multipath/Fred auto
newfs /dev/multipath/Freda
mount /dev/mutlpath/Freda /mnt....
.Ed
.Pp
The resultant console output looks something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
GEOM_MULTIPATH: adding da0 to Fred/b631385f-c61c-11db-b884-0011116ae789
GEOM_MULTIPATH: da0 now active path in Fred
GEOM_MULTIPATH: adding da2 to Fred/b631385f-c61c-11db-b884-0011116ae789

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
should allow for a manual method of pairing disks.
.Pp
There is currently no way for
.Pa geom_multipath.ko
to distinguish between various label instances of the same provider.
That
is devices such as
.Ar da0
and
.Ar da0c
can be tasted and instantiated as multiple paths for the same device.
Technically, this is correct, but pretty useless.
This will be fixed soon
(I hope), but to avoid this it is a good idea to destroy any label on
the disk object prior to labelling it with
.Nm .
