.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control various GEOM classes.
A class has to be aware of
.Nm
communication methods, but there are also some standard commands
which can be used for existing
.Nm
unaware classes.
Here is the list of standard commands:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm help
List all available commands for the given class.
.It Cm list
Print detailed information (within the given class) about all geoms
(if no additional arguments were specified) or the given geoms.
This command is only available if the given class exists in the kernel.
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width "-a"
.It Fl a
Print information for geoms without providers.
.El
.It Cm status
Print general information (within the given class) about all geoms
(if no additional arguments were specified) or the given geoms.
This command is only available if the given class exists in the kernel.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width "-s"
.It Fl a
When used with
.Fl g ,
print status for geoms without providers.
.It Fl g
Report statuses for geoms instead of providers.
.It Fl s
Produce script-friendly output.
.El
.It Cm load
Load the kernel module that implements the given class.
This command is only available if the class does not yet exist in the kernel and
the file
.Pa geom_ Ns Ao Ar class Ac Ns Pa .ko
can be found in one of the directories specified in
.Va kern.module_path
sysctl.
.It Cm unload
Unload the kernel module which implements the given class.
This command is only available if the given class is loaded as a
kernel module.
.El
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p Ar provider-name
Print detailed information about the geom which provides
.Ar provider-name .
.It Fl t
Display geoms hierarchy as a tree.
.El
.Pp
Class-specific commands are implemented as shared libraries which
are stored in
.Pa /lib/geom/
directory and are loaded via
.Xr dlopen 3
function when the class name is known.
When a class-specific shared library exists, a direct utility should also be
available under the name of
.Nm g Ns Ar class .
.Pp
Currently, classes aware of
.Nm
are:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
CACHE
.It
CONCAT
.It
ELI
.It
JOURNAL
.It
LABEL
.It
MIRROR
.It
MOUNTVER
.It
MULTIPATH
.It
NOP
.It
PART
.It
RAID
.It
RAID3
.It
SCHED
.It
SHSEC
.It
STRIPE
.It
UNION
.It
VIRSTOR
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "GEOM_LIBRARY_PATH"
.It Ev GEOM_LIBRARY_PATH
Specifies the path where shared libraries are stored instead of
.Pa /lib/geom/ .
Multiple paths can be specified with a colon-separated list of paths.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to set up a stripe on three disks for automatic
configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
geom stripe label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2
.Ed
.Pp
or:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gstripe label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2
.Ed
.Pp
Print the list of all providers from the DISK class:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
geom disk list
.Ed
.Pp
Unload a kernel module which implements the MD class:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
geom md unload
.Ed
