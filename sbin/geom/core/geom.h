/*
 * The G_FLAG_VERBOSE flag on a command specification means that the
 * command will accept a -v option and the GEOM framework will print
 * out status information after the command when it is run with -v.
 * Additionally a GEOM command can explicitly specify a -v option and
 * handle it as it would any other option. If both a -v option and
 * G_FLAG_VERBOSE are specified for a command then both types of verbose
 * information will be output when that command is run with -v.
 *
 * When the G_FLAG_LOADKLD is specified for a command, the GEOM kernel
 * module will be loaded when that command is run if it has not yet been
 * loaded. This flag is typically specified for the `create' command.
