.Dt KLDCONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kldconfig
.Nd display or modify the kernel module search path
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfimnUv
.Op Fl S Ar sysctlname
.Op Ar path ...
.Nm
.Fl r
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
displays or modifies the search path used by the kernel when loading modules
using the
.Xr kldload 8
utility or the
.Xr kldload 2
syscall.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Remove the specified paths from the module search path.
.It Fl f
Do not fail if a path specified for adding is already present in the search
path, or if a path specified for removing is not present in the search path.
This may be useful in startup/shutdown scripts for adding a path to
a file system which is still not mounted, or in shutdown scripts for
unconditionally removing a path that may have been added during startup.
.It Fl i
Add the specified paths to the beginning of the search path, not to the end.
This option can only be used when adding paths.
.It Fl m
Instead of replacing the module search path with the set of paths
specified,
.Dq merge
in the new entries.
.It Fl n
Do not actually change the module search path.
.It Fl r
Display the current search path.
This option cannot be used if any paths are also specified.
.It Fl S Ar sysctlname
Specify the sysctl name to use instead of the default
.Va kern.module_path .
.It Fl U
.Dq Unique-ify
the current search path - if any of the directories is repeated one
or more times, only the first occurrence remains.
This option implies
.Fl m .
.It Fl v
Verbose output: display the new module search path.
If the path has been changed, and the
.Fl v
flag is specified more than once, the old path is displayed as well.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /boot/kernel , /boot/modules , /modules
The default module search path used by the kernel.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Show the module search path
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -r
/boot/kernel;/boot/modules;/boot/dtb;/boot/dtb/overlays
.Ed
.Pp
Try to delete the
.Pa /boot
directory from the search path.
The command will fail:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -d /boot
kldconfig: not in module search path: /boot
$ echo $?
1
.Ed
.Pp
Same as above but forcing the operation.
This time the command will succeed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -d -f /boot
$ echo $?
0
.Ed
.Pp
Add the
.Pa /boot
directory to the beginning of the search path and display extra verbose output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -i -m -vv /boot
/boot/kernel;/boot/modules -> /boot;/boot/kernel;/boot/modules
.Ed
.Pp
Without
.Fl m
the
.Fl i
flag will overwrite the contents of the search path list:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -i -vv /boot
/boot;/boot/kernel;/boot/modules;/boot/dtb;/boot/dtb/overlays -> /boot
.Ed
.Pp
Same as above but using
.Fl n
to simulate the operation without actually doing it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -i -n -vv /boot
/boot;/boot/kernel;/boot/modules;/boot/dtb;/boot/dtb/overlays -> /boot
.Ed
.Pp
Add directories to the search path removing duplicates.
Note the need of
.Fl f
to force the operation in case any of the directories is already in the
search path.
The
.Pa /boot/kernel
directory will be added once:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kldconfig -f -U /boot/kernel /boot/kernel /boot/modules /boot/dtb /boot/dtb/overlays
.Ed
