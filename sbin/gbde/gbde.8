.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -emphasis
NOTICE:
Please be aware that this code has not yet received much review
and analysis by qualified cryptographers and therefore should be considered
a slightly suspect experimental facility.
.Pp
We cannot at this point guarantee that the on-disk format will not change
in response to reviews or bug-fixes, so potential users are adviced to
be prepared that
.Xr dump 8 Ns / Ns
.Xr restore 8
based migrations may be called for in the future.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is the only official operation and management interface for the
.Xr gbde 4
GEOM based disk encryption kernel facility.
The interaction between the
.Nm
program and the kernel part is not a published interface.
.Pp
The operational aspect consists of two subcommands:
one to open and attach 
a device to the in-kernel cryptographic gbde module,
and one to close and detach a device.
.Pp
The management part allows initialization of the master key and lock sectors
on a device, initialization and replacement of pass-phrases and
key invalidation and blackening functions.
.Pp
The
.Fl l Ar lockfile
argument is used to supply the lock selector data.
If no
.Fl l
option is specified, the first sector is used for this purpose.
.Pp
The
.Fl L Ar new-lockfile
argument
specifies the lock selector file for the key modified with the
.Ar setkey subcommand.
.Pp
The
.Fl n Ar key
argument can be used to specify which of the four keys
to which the operation applies.
A value of 1 to 4 selects the specified key, a value of 0 (the default)
means
.Dq "this key"
(i.e., the key used to gain access to the device)
and a value of -1 means
.Dq "all keys" .
.Pp
The
.Fl f Ar filename
specifies an optional parameter file for use under initialization.
.Pp
Alternatively, the
.Fl i
option toggles an interactive mode where a template file with descriptions
of the parameters can be interactively edited.
.Pp
The
.Fl p Ar pass-phrase
argument
specifies the pass-phrase used to opening the device.
If not specified, the controlling terminal will be used to prompt the user
for the pass-phrase.
Be aware that using this option may expose the pass-phrase to other
users who happen to run
.Xr ps 1
or similar while the command is running.
.Pp
The
.Fl P Ar new-pass-phrase
argument
can be used to specify the new pass-phrase to the
.Cm init
and 
.Cm setkey
subcommands.
If not specified, the user is prompted for the new pass-phrase on the
controlling terminal.
Be aware that using this option may expose the pass-phrase to other
users who happen to run
.Xr ps 1
or similar while the command is running.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To initialize a device, using default parameters:
.Dl # gbde init /dev/ad0s1f -l /etc/ad0s1f.lock
.Pp
To attach an encrypted device:
.Dl # gbde attach ad0s1f -l /etc/ad0s1f.lock
.Pp
To detach an encrypted device:
.Dl # gbde detach ad0s1f
.Pp
To initialize the second key using a detached lockfile and a trivial
pass-phrase:
.Dl # gbde setkey ad0s1f -n 2 -P foo -L key2.lockfile
.Pp
To destroy all copies of the masterkey:
.Dl # gbde destroy ad0s1f -n -1

The cryptographic algorithms and the overall design has not been
attacked mercilessly for over 10 years by a gang or cryptoanalysts.
