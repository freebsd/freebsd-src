.Nd "GEOM Gate network daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl a Ar address
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl F Ar pidfile
.Op Fl R Ar rcvbuf
.Op Fl S Ar sndbuf
.Op Ar "exports file"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a network server for the GEOM Gate class.
It runs on a server machine to service GEOM Gate requests from workers
placed on a client machine.
Keep in mind, that connections between
.Xr ggatec 8
and
.Nm
are not encrypted.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar exports\ file"
.It Fl a Ar address
Specifies an IP address to bind to.
.It Fl h
Print available options.
.It Fl n
Do not use
.Dv TCP_NODELAY
option on TCP sockets.
.It Fl p Ar port
Port on which
.Nm
listens for connections.
Default is 3080.
.It Fl F Ar pidfile
PID file that
.Nm
uses.
.It Fl R Ar rcvbuf
Size of receive buffer to use.
Default is 131072 (128kB).
.It Fl S Ar sndbuf
Size of send buffer to use.
Default is 131072 (128kB).
.It Fl v
Do not fork, run in foreground and print debug information on standard
output.
.It Ar "exports file"
An alternate location for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
The format of an exports file is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
1.2.3.4		RO		/dev/cd0
1.2.3.0/24	RW		/tmp/test.img
hostname	WO		/tmp/image
hostname	RW,DIRECT	/tmp/direct-image
hostname	RW,NODIRECT	/tmp/nodirect-image
.Ed
.Pp
The first colunm specifies the ip, network with netmask, or the hostname
that the export applies to.
.Pp
The next column is the access flags that apply to the export
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm NODIRECT"
.It Cm RO
Read-Only the path specified will be exported to the client read only.
.It Cm WO
Write-Only the path specified will be exported to the client write only.
.It Cm RW
Read-Write the path specified will be exported to the client read-write.
.It Cm DIRECT
The path specified will always be opened with O_DIRECT for clients.
.It Cm NODIRECT
The path specified will never be opened with O_DIRECT for clients.
.El
.Pp
The final column specifies the path to export.
.Pp
Files are opened with the least common flags between the client and the
server.  A client may request read or write only to a read-write export
and the server will honor the client request and open the file in the
requested mode.  A client requesting greater access than permissions listed
in the file will be rejected.
.Pp
DIRECT and NODIRECT are used to coerce the use of the O_DIRECT flag to
.Xr open 2 when the specified path is opened. If DIRECT is specified the
path is always opened with O_DIRECT. If NODIRECT is specified the path is
never opened with O_DIRECT. DIRECT access limits the cache effects of
IO operaions on the file.  This has the effect of having clients accessing
exports to not impact the cache of the local machine, however it
will cause greater IO utilization to the devices on which the files reside.
.Pp
If neither is specified the server will use
the preference specified by the client, with the default to not use O_DIRECT.
If the client specifies a preference against the server's configuration the
client preference will be silently ignored.
.Pp
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/run/ggated.pid" -compact
.It Pa /var/run/ggated.pid
The default location of the
.Nm
PID file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.
To get details about the failure,
.Nm
should be called with the
.Fl v
option.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Export CD-ROM device, a file, and a file with
.Dv O_DIRECT
option:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# echo "1.2.3.0/24 RO /dev/cd0" > /etc/gg.exports
# echo "client RW /image" >> /etc/gg.exports
# echo "client RW,DIRECT /image2" >> /etc/gg.exports
# echo "client RW,NODIRECT /image3" >> /etc/gg.exports
# ggated
