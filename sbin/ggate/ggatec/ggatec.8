.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a network client for the GEOM Gate class.
It is responsible for the creation of
.Nm ggate
devices and forwarding I/O requests between the
.Nm GEOM Gate
kernel subsystem and the
.Xr ggated 8
network daemon.
Available commands:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm create
Connect to a
.Xr ggated 8
daemon on the specified host and create a

process has died or been killed.
The new connection to the
.Xr ggated 8
daemon handles pending and future requests.
.It Cm destroy
Destroy the given
.Nm ggate
provider.
.It Cm list
