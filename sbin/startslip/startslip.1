.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm Startslip
opens the specified
.Ar device .
Once carrier is asserted (if modem control is enabled)
.Nm startslip
attempts to login as the specified
.Ar user
with the given
.Ar password .
Standard login: & Password: scheme assumed unless Annex option
specified (see
.Fl A ) .
If successful, it puts the device into the slip line discipline,
calls
.Ar upscript
and goes to wait mode.
If carrier drops (modem control enabled) or a
.Dv SIGHUP
is sent to
.Nm startslip ,
it closes the device, calls
.Ar downscript
and attempts to repeat the dialup and login sequence.
If a
.Dv SIGTERM
is send to
.Nm startslip ,
it closes the device, calls
.Ar downscript
and exits.
When
.Nm startslip
called twice on the same device, previous copy killed by a
.Dv SIGTERM
before any operation.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl d
.Nm Startslip
prints out debugging information about what it is trying to do.
.It Fl b Ar speed
Determines the baud rate used for
.Ar device .
Default value is 9600.
.It Fl t Ar script_timeout
Set login script timeout in seconds, default value is 90.
.It Fl w Ar retry_pause
Set connecting retry pause in seconds (increased from one retry to another),
default value is 60.
.It Fl W Ar maxtries
Set maximum number of connection retries for one session,
default value is 6.
Value 0 means infinite count.
.It Fl s Ar stringN
The optional
.Ar stringN
is written to
.Ar device .
Return character is added automatically.
For a dialup modem,
the string is used to specify a dial sequence.
No string written by default.
You can specify several
.Fl s Ar stringN
arguments to use with each try, f.e. several host phone numbers.
.It Fl A Ar annexname
.Nm Startslip
assumes it is connecting to a Xylogics Annex box and engages in an
appropriate dialog using the
.Ar user
and
.Ar passwd
arguments.
The
.Ar annexname
argument is a string that is used to match against the Annex prompt
to determine when a connection has been established.
.It Fl h
Use hardware (CTS/RTS) flow control for
.Ar device .
Default value is no flow control.
.It Fl l
Disable modem control (waiting for carrier and carrier drop sense) for
.Ar device .
Modem control is enabled by default.
.It Fl U Ar upscript
Specifies a script to run when a SLIP interface becomes connected.  This may
contain ifconfig, route, and other appropriate commands.  The arguments that
are passed to the script are "slX up".
Default value is "/sbin/ifconfig".
Dial sequence number (see
.Fl s )
passed via
.Dv LINE
environment variable.
.It Fl D Ar downscript
Specifies a script to run when a SLIP connection goes away.  The arguments that
are passed to the script are "slX down". Default value is "/sbin/ifconfig".
Dial sequence number (see
.Fl s )
passed via
.Dv LINE
environment variable.
.It Fl K Ar keepalive
Set SLIP "keep alive" timeout in seconds. If FRAME_END not received during this
time period, a reconnect will occur. Active "out fill" timeout expected from other
side.
Default value is no timeout.
.It Fl O Ar outfill
Set SLIP "out fill" timeout in seconds. It causes at least one FRAME_END
to be sent during this timeout.
Needed for "keep alive" timeout on other side.
Default value is no timeout.
.It Fl S Ar unit
Set SLIP unit number directly. Use with caution, no check for two
interfaces with same number made.
Default is dynamic assignment.
.It Fl L
Use uucp-style device locking. You need it unless you start
.Nm startslip
from external program which already does uucp locking.
Default case is no uucp locking to satisfy such programs.
