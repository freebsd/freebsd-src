.Nm lmcconfig
.Nd configuration program for
.Tn SBE
(formerly
.Tn LMC )
wide-area network interface cards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar interface

.Nm
.Ar interface

.Op Fl aABceEfFgiIlLpPstTuUxX

.Fl 3
.Op Fl aABcefFlLsSv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is the configuration program for the
.Xr lmc 4
wide-area network device driver.
It sets control values, such as T3 framing format,
and it displays status, such as that of integrated modems,
that are beyond the scope of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
displays the interface status when no parameters are specified;
see example below.
For this case only, if no
.Ar interface
is specified, it defaults to
.Dq Li lmc0 .
.Pp
Only the super-user may modify the configuration of a network interface.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar interface
This is the name of the interface; the default is
.Dq Li lmc0 .
If
.Xr netgraph 4
is present and the interface name ends with a colon
then Netgraph control messages are used,
otherwise the
.Xr ifnet 9
kernel interface and socket
.Xr ioctl 2
system calls are used.
.It Fl 1
All parameters after this apply to the T1E1 card.
.It Fl 3
All parameters after this apply to the T3 card.
.El
.Ss Commands for all cards
The following parameters apply to more then one card type.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar number
Set Transmitter clock source to
.Ar number .
.Pp
.Bl -column "1" "External connector" "T1E1, HSSIc" -offset 2m -compact
.It "1" Ta "TxClk from modem"   Ta "T1E1, HSSI"  Ta "default"

.It "3" Ta "RxClk from modem"   Ta "T1E1, HSSIc" Ta "loop timed"
.It "4" Ta "External connector" Ta "T1E1, HSSIc"
.El
.Pp
An HSSI card normally takes its Tx clock from the modem connector
(it is a DTE) but can use the PCI bus clock (typically 33 MHz)
for loopback and null modem testing; values 3 and 4 are only
applicable to a few rare CompactPCI/HSSI cards.
.Pp
A T1E1 card uses an on-board synthesized oscillator
if the value is 1 or 2; it
.Em loop times
(uses the clock recovered by the receiver as the transmitter clock)
if the value is 3; and it uses a clock from a header connector on
the card if the value is 4.
.Pp
TxClk source is not applicable to other card types.
.It Fl b
Read BIOS ROM.
Print the first 256 locations.
The BIOS ROM is not used and not present on some cards.
.It Fl B
Write BIOS ROM.
Write the first 256 locations with an address pattern.
.It Fl c
Use HDLC's 16-bit CRC polynomial: X^16+X^12+X^5+1 (default).
.It Fl C
Use HDLC's 32-bit CRC polynomial:
X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X+1
.It Fl d
Clear the driver-level debug flag.
Non-critical log messages are suppressed.
.It Fl D
Set the driver-level debug flag.
The driver generates more log messages.
The driver also generates more log messages if the interface-level debug
flag is set by
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Fl e
Set DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) mode (default).
An SSI card transmitter uses the Tx clock signal from the modem connector
and receives the Data Carrier Detect pin (DCD).
DTE/DCE is not applicable to other card types except
a few rare CompactPCI/HSSI cards.
.It Fl E
Set DCE (Data Communication Equipment) mode.
An SSI card transmitter uses an on-board synthesized oscillator
and drives the Data Carrier Detect pin (DCD).
.It Fl f Ar number
Set the frequency of the built-in synthesized oscillator to
.Ar number
bits/second.
The nearest frequency that the synthesizer can generate will be used.
Only SSI cards and a few rare CompactPCI/HSSI cards have synthesizers.
.It Fl F
Set SPPP line protocol to Frame-Relay.
Only works for
.Fx 5.4
and later.
.It Fl h
Print help (usage message).

.Ss Event Counters
The device driver counts many interesting events such as
packets in and out, errors and discards.
The table below lists the event counters and describes what they count.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va underruns"
.It Va ibytes
Bytes received in packets with good ending status.
.It Va obytes
Bytes transmitted.
.It Va ipackets
Packets received with good ending status.
.It Va opackets
Packets transmitted.
.It Va ierrors
Packets received with bad ending status.
.It Va oerrors
Packets transmitted with bad ending status.
.It Va idiscards
Packets received but discarded because
the input queue was full or the interface was down.
.It Va odiscards
Packets presented for transmission but discarded because
the output queue was full or the interface was down.
.It Va txdma
Packets presented for transmission but queued and retried later
because no DMA descriptors were available.
This can happen during normal operation and is not an indication of trouble.
.It Va fifo-overrun
Packets that started to arrive, but were aborted because
the card was unable to DMA data to memory fast enough
to prevent the receiver fifo from overflowing.
.It Va fifo-underrun
Packets that started to transmit but were aborted because
the card was unable to DMA data from the memory fast enough
to prevent the transmitter fifo from underflowing.
When this happens, the transmitter threshold is increased,
so that more bytes are required to be in the fifo
before the transmitter is started.
.It Va missed
Packets that are missed because the receiver is stopped.
.It Va overruns
Packets that are missed because the receiver
had no DMA descriptors available.
.It Va fdl_pkts
Packets received on the T1 Facility Data Link.
.It Va crc-errs
Cyclic Redundancy Checksum errors detected by the CRC-6 in
T1 Extended SuperFrames (ESF) or the CRC-4 in E1 frames.
.It Va lcv-errs
Line Coding Violation errors:
Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) errors for T1-SF,
Bipolar 8-Zero Substitution (B8ZS) errors for T1-ESF, or
High Density Bipolar with 3-Zero Substitution (HDB3) errors for E1 or
Bipolar 3-Zero Substitution (B3ZS) errors for T3.
.It Va frm-errs
T1 or T3 bit errors in the frame alignment signal.
.It Va febe-errs
Far End Block Errors:
T1 or T3 bit errors detected by the device at the far end of the link.
.It Va par-errs
T3 bit errors detected by the hop-by-hop parity mechanism.
.It Va cpar-errs
T3 bit errors detected by the end-to-end parity mechanism.
.It Va mfrm-errs
T3 bit errors in the multi-frame alignment signal.
.El
.Ss Transmit Speed
The hardware counts transmit clocks divided by 2048.
The software computes
.Dq "Tx speed"
from this (see
.Sx EXAMPLES
below).
The transmit clock is the bit rate of the circuit divided by two if the
circuit is idle and divided by four if the circuit is carrying a packet.
So an idle circuit reports a Tx speed equal to its bit rate,
and a busy circuit reports a Tx speed equal to half its bit rate.
.Pp
This
.Dq "bit rate"
does not include circuit-level overhead bits
(such as T1 or T3 frame bits) but does include HDLC stuff bits.
An idle T1 circuit with a raw bit rate of 1544000 and a
bit-rate-minus-overhead of 1536000 will report a
.Dq "Tx speed"
of ((1536000 bitand 4095) plus or minus 4096).
Sometimes it will even get the correct answer of 1536000, and
if the link is fully loaded it will report about 768000 bits/sec.
.Pp
It is not a perfect bit rate meter (the circuit must be idle),
but it is a useful circuit utilization meter if you know the
circuit bit rate and do some arithmetic.
Software recalculates
Tx speed once a second; the measurement period has some jitter.
