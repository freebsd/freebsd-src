.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_crypto_destroy ,
.Nm krb5_crypto_init
.Nd encryption support in krb5
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_crypto_init "krb5_context context" "krb5_keyblock *key" "krb5_enctype enctype" "krb5_crypto *crypto"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_crypto_destroy "krb5_context context" "krb5_crypto crypto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Heimdal exports parts of the Kerberos crypto interface for applications.
.Pp
Each kerberos encrytion/checksum function takes a crypto context.
.Pp
To setup and destroy crypto contextes there are two functions
.Fn krb5_crypto_init
and
.Fn krb5_crypto_destroy .
The encryption type to use is taken from the key, but can be overridden
with the
.Fa enctype parameter .
This can be useful for encryptions types which is compatiable (DES for
example).
