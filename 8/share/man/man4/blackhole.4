.Dt BLACKHOLE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm blackhole
.Nd a
.Xr sysctl 8
MIB for manipulating behaviour in respect of refused TCP or UDP connection
attempts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd sysctl net.inet.tcp.blackhole[=[0 | 1 | 2]]
.Cd sysctl net.inet.udp.blackhole[=[0 | 1]]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.Xr sysctl 8
MIB is used to control system behaviour when connection requests
are received on TCP or UDP ports where there is no socket listening.
.Pp
Normal behaviour, when a TCP SYN segment is received on a port where
there is no socket accepting connections, is for the system to return
a RST segment, and drop the connection.
The connecting system will
see this as a
.Dq Connection refused .
By setting the TCP blackhole
MIB to a numeric value of one, the incoming SYN segment
is merely dropped, and no RST is sent, making the system appear
as a blackhole.
By setting the MIB value to two, any segment arriving
on a closed port is dropped without returning a RST.
This provides some degree of protection against stealth port scans.
.Pp
In the UDP instance, enabling blackhole behaviour turns off the sending
of an ICMP port unreachable message in response to a UDP datagram which
arrives on a port where there is no socket listening.
It must be noted that this behaviour will prevent remote systems from running
.Xr traceroute 8
to a system.
.Pp
The blackhole behaviour is useful to slow down anyone who is port scanning
a system, attempting to detect vulnerable services on a system.
It could potentially also slow down someone who is attempting a denial
of service attack.
.Sh WARNING
The TCP and UDP blackhole features should not be regarded as a replacement
for firewall solutions.
Better security would consist of the
.Nm
.Xr sysctl 8
MIB used in conjuction with one of the available firewall packages.
.Pp
This mechanism is not a substitute for securing a system.
It should be used together with other security mechanisms.
