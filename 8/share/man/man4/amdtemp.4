.Sh NAME
.Nm amdtemp
.Nd device driver for AMD K8, K10 and K11 on-die digital thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device amdtemp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
amdtemp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensor present
in AMD K8, K10 and K11 processors.
.Pp
For the K8 family, the
.Nm
driver reports each core's temperature through a sysctl node in the
corresponding CPU devices's sysctl tree, named
.Va dev.amdtemp.%d.sensor{0,1}.core{0,1} .
The driver also creates
.Va dev.cpu.%d.temperature
displaying the maximum temperature of the two sensors 
located in each CPU core.
.Pp
For the K10 and K11 families, the driver creates
.Va dev.cpu.%d.temperature
with the temperature of each core.
.Sh BUGS
AMD K9 is not supported because temperature reporting has been replaced
by Maltese.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 7.1 .
