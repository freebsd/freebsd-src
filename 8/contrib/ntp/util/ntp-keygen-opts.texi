This program has no explanation.

If there is no new host key, look for an existing one.
If one is not found, create it.

the aginfo template and the option descriptions for the @command{ntp-keygen} program.  It documents the ntp-keygen usage text and option meanings.

Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name
or by a single hyphen and the flag character.

The following option preset mechanisms are supported:
 - reading file /users/stenn/.ntprc
 - reading file /deacon/backroom/snaps/ntp-stable/util/.ntprc
 - examining environment variables named NTP_KEYGEN_*

If there is no new host key, look for an existing one.
If one is not found, create it.
