% Procedures that let you print any number of pages on each sheet of paper. It's
% far from perfect and won't handle everything (eg. it's not recursive), but should
% be good enough for now. Assumes the default page coordinate system has been set
% up before setupforms is called. lastpage makes certain the last page is printed,
% and should be called immediately after the %%Trailer comment.
%
% Three lines of code needed for page image clipping have been commented out for
% now. It works, but can really slow things down on some versions of PostScript.
% Uncomment them if you want to clip pages.
