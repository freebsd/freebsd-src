.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdpost\fR translates \fIfiles\fR created by 
\fItroff\fR(1)
into PostScript and writes the results on the standard output.
If no
\fIfiles\fR are specified, or if \- is one of the input \fIfiles\fR,
the standard input
is read.
The following options are accepted:
.TP 15
\fB\-c\fR\fI num\fR
Print \fInum\fR copies of each page.
By default
only one copy is printed.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR\fI num\fR
Sets the text encoding level to \fInum\fR.
The recognized choices are
digits between 0 and 5.
\fB0\fR uses the PostScript \fBashow\fR operator, and produces
output essentially identical to previous versions of \fIdpost\fR.
\fB1\fR also uses \fBashow\fR but integrates motion commands
with text commands.
\fB2\fR uses the PostScript \fBawidthshow\fR operator,
computing space widths in PostScript.
\fB3\fR also uses \fBawidthshow\fR
but computes space widths in \fIdpost\fR.
\fB4\fR uses \fBashow\fR, storing position as differences.
\fB5\fR emits the same commands as 4
but in a binary PostScript Level 2 representation.
The default is 3 with the \fBps\fR device.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR\fI num\fR
Magnify each logical page by the factor \fInum\fR.
Pages are scaled
uniformly about the origin,
which is located near the upper left corner of each page.
The default
magnification is \fB1.0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR\fI num\fR
Print \fInum\fR logical pages on each piece of paper, where \fInum\fR
can be any positive integer.
By default, \fInum\fR is set to \fB1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR\fI list\fR
Print those pages for which numbers are given in the comma-separated
\fIlist\fR.
The list
contains single numbers \fIN\fR and ranges \fIN1\fR\fB\(mi\fR\fIN2.\fR
A missing \fIN1\fR means the lowest
numbered page, a missing \fIN2\fR means the highest.
The page range is
an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper.
For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of \fB4\fR, then two sheets
of paper would print, containing four page layouts.
If you specified a
page range of \fB3-4\fR, when requesting
two logical pages to a sheet; then \fIonly\fR page 3 and page 4 layouts
would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR\fI mode\fR
Print \fIfiles\fR in either \fBportrait\fR or \fBlandscape\fR \fImode\fR.
Only
the first character of \fImode\fR is significant.
The default
\fImode\fR is portrait.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR\fI num\fR
Set the line width used to implement \fItroff\fR graphics commands to
\fInum\fR
points, where a point is approximately 1/72 of an inch.
By default,
\fInum\fR is set to \fB0.3\fR points.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR\fI num\fR
Translate the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive x axis.
The
default coordinate system
has the origin fixed near the upper left corner of the page, with
positive x to the right and positive y down the page.
Positive
\fInum\fR moves everything right.
The default offset
is \fB0\fR inches.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR\fI num\fR
Translate the origin \fInum\fR inches along the positive y axis.
Positive \fInum\fR moves text up the page.
The default offset is
\fB0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR\fI dir\fR
Use \fIdir\fR as the font directory.
The default \fIdir\fR is
\fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font\fR, and \fIdpost\fR reads binary font files from
directory \fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps\fR.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR\fI dir\fR
Use \fIdir\fR as the host resident font directory.
Files in this
directory should be complete
PostScript font descriptions, and must be assigned a name that
corresponds to the appropriate two-character \fItroff\fR font name.
Each font file is copied to the output file only when needed
and at most once during each job.
There is no default directory.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR\fI file\fR
Use \fIfile\fR as the PostScript prologue which, by default, is
\fB/usr/lib/lp/postscript/dpost.ps\fR.
.TP
\fB\-M \fImarks\fR
Print marks (in combination with the \fB\%trimat\fR \fItroff\fR request).
Valid types of \fImarks\fR are:
\fB\%cutmarks\fR,
\fB\%registrationmarks\fR,
\fB\%startargets\fR,
\fB\%colorbars\fR,
and
\fB\%all\fR.
Mark names can be abbreviated and combined by colons,
e.g. \fB\-Mcut:reg\fR will print cut marks and registration marks.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR
Disables PostScript picture inclusion.
A recommended option when
\fIdpost\fR is run by a spooler in a networked environment.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR\fI name\fR
Use font files for device \fIname\fR as the best description of
available PostScript fonts.
By default, \fIname\fR is set to \fBps\fR and \fIdpost\fR reads
files from \fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps\fR.
.PP
The \fIfiles\fR should be prepared by \fItroff\fR.
The default font
files in \fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps\fR produce the best output.
They assume a resolution of 72000 dpi, and can be used to format files by
adding the \fB\-Tps\fR option to the \fItroff\fR call.
.PP
\fIdpost\fR makes no assumptions about resolutions.
The first
\fBx\ res\fR command sets the resolution used to translate the input
\fIfiles\fR, the \fBDESC\fR file, usually
\fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps/DESC\fR,
defines the resolution used in
the binary font files, and the PostScript prologue is responsible for
setting up an appropriate
user coordinate system.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following exit values are returned:
.TP 10
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
Successful completion.
.TP
\fBnon-zero\fR
An error occurred.
.SH NOTES
Although \fIdpost\fR can handle files formatted for any device,
emulation is expensive and can easily double the print time and the
size of the output file.
No attempt has been made to
implement the character sets or fonts available on all devices
supported by \fItroff\fR.
Missing characters will be replaced by white
space, and unrecognized fonts will usually default to one
of the Times fonts (that is, \fBR\fR, \fBI\fR, \fBB\fR, or \fBBI\fR).
.PP
An \fBx res\fR command must precede the first \fBx init\fR command,
and all the input \fIfiles\fR should have been prepared for the same
output device.
.PP
Use of the \fB\-T\fR option is not encouraged.
Its only purpose is to
enable the use of other PostScript font and device description files,
that perhaps use different resolutions, character
sets, or fonts.
