.Nd exploring The Dungeons of Doom
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl r
.Op Ar save_file
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a computer fantasy with a new twist.
It is CRT oriented and the object of the game is to survive
the attacks of various monsters and gather a lot of gold, rather
than the puzzle solving orientation of most computer fantasy games.
.Pp
To get started you really only need to know two commands.
The command
.Ic ?\&
will give you a list of the available commands and the command
.Ic /
will identify the things you see on the screen.
.Pp
To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high
scores) you must locate the
.Em Amulet of Yendor
which is somewhere below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out.
Nobody has achieved this
yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in history as a hero
among heroes.
.Pp
When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you (by
some miracle) manage to win,
.Nm
will give you a list of the top-ten scorers.
The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get.
There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.
.Pp
If
.Ar save_file
is specified,
.Nm
will be restored from the specified saved game file.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option will print out the list of scores.
.Pp

.Sh BUGS
Probably infinite, although none are known.
However, that Ice Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is
.Em not
a bug.
It's a feature.
