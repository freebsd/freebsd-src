.SH NAME
trek \- trekkie game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/trek
[ [
.B \-a
] file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trek
is a game of space glory and war.  Below is a summary of commands.
For complete documentation, see
.IR Trek
by Eric Allman.
.PP
If a filename is given, a log of the game is written onto that file.
If the
.B \-a
flag is given before the filename, that file is appended to, not truncated.
.PP
The game will ask you what length game you would like.
Valid responses are \*(lqshort\*(rq, \*(lqmedium\*(rq, and \*(lqlong\*(rq.
You may also type \*(lqrestart\*(rq, which restarts a previously saved game.
You will then be prompted for the skill, to which you must respond
\*(lqnovice\*(rq, \*(lqfair\*(rq, \*(lqgood\*(rq, \*(lqexpert\*(rq,
\*(lqcommodore\*(rq, or \*(lqimpossible\*(rq.
You should normally start out with a novice and work up.
.PP
In general, throughout the game, if you forget what is appropriate
the game will tell you what it expects if you just type in a question mark.
