**  Schedule Ship.damages to a Device

**	Device `dev1' is damaged in an amount `dam'.  Dam is measured
**	in stardates, and is an additional amount of damage.  It should
**	be the amount to occur in non-docked mode.  The adjustment
**	to docked mode occurs automatically if we are docked.
**
**	Note that the repair of the device occurs on a DATE, meaning
**	that the dock() and undock() have to reschedule the event.
