.Dt MORSE 6

.Sh NAME
.Nm morse
.Nd reformat input as morse code
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl w Ar speed
.Op Fl f Ar frequency
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar string ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The command
.Nm
read the given input and reformat it in the form of morse code.
Acceptable input are command line arguments or the standard input.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl s
The
.Fl s
option produces dots and dashes rather than words.
.It Fl p
Send morse the real way. This only works if your system has
.Xr speaker 4
support.
.It Fl w Ar speed
Set the sending speed in words per minute. If not specified the default
speed of 20 WPM is used.
.It Fl f Ar frequency
Set the sidetone frequency to something other than the default 600 Hz.
.It Fl d Ar device
Similar to
.Fl p ,
but use the RTS line of
.Ar device
(which must by a tty device)
in order to emit the morse code.
.It Fl e
echo each character before it is sent, used together with either
.Fl p
or
.Fl d .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl w
and
.Fl f
flags only work in conjunction with either the
.Fl p
or the
.Fl d
flag.
.Pp
Not all prosigns have corresponding characters. Use
.Ql #
for
.Em AS ,
.Ql @
for
.Em SK ,
.Ql *
for
.Em VE
and
.Ql %
for
.Em BK .
The more common prosigns are
.Ql =
for
.Em BT ,
.Ql \&(
for
.Em KN
and
.Ql +
for
.Em AR .
.Pp
Using flag
.Fl d Ar device
it is possible to key an external device, like a sidetone generator with
a headset for training purposes, or even your ham radio transceiver.  For
the latter, simply connect an NPN transistor to the serial port
.Ar device ,
emitter connected to ground, base connected through a resistor
(few kiloohms) to RTS, collector to the key line of your transceiver
(assuming the transceiver has a positive key supply voltage and is keyed
by grounding the key input line).  A capacitor (some nanofarads) between
base and ground is advisable to keep stray RF away,
and to suppress the
minor glitch that is generated during program startup.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/speaker -compact
.It Pa /dev/speaker

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE -compact
.It Ev LC_ALL
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LANG
If one of these variables (in this priority) is set to a locale ending in
.Ql KOI8-R ,
characters with the high-order bit set are being interpreted as
Cyrillic characters.  In all other cases, they are being interpreted
as belonging to the
.Ql ISO8859-1
character set.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr speaker 4
.Sh HISTORY
Sound support for
.Nm
added by
.An Lyndon Nerenberg (VE7TCP/VE6BBM) Aq lyndon@orthanc.com .
.Pp
Ability to key an external device added by
.An J\(:org Wunsch
(DL8DTL).
.Sh BUGS
Does only understand a few European characters (namely German and
French), but neither Asian ones, or the continental landline code.
.Pp
Sends a bit slower than it should due to system overhead. Some people
would call this a feature.
