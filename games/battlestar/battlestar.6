.SH NAME
battlestar \- a tropical adventure game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B battlestar
[
.B -r (recover a saved game)
]
.br
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Battlestar
is an adventure game in the classic style.  However, it's slightly less
of a
puzzle and more a game of exploration.  There are a few magical words
in the game, but on the whole, simple English
should suffice to make one's desires understandable to the parser.
.SH "THE SETTING"
In the days before the darkness came, when battlestars ruled the
heavens...
.br
.nf

		Three He made and gave them to His daughters,
		Beautiful nymphs, the goddesses of the waters.
		One to bring good luck and simple feats of wonder,
		Two to wash the lands and churn the waves asunder,
		Three to rule the world and purge the skies with thunder.
		
.fi
.PP
In those times great wizards were known and their powers were beyond
belief.  They could take any object from thin air, and, uttering the
word `su' could disappear.
.PP
In those times men were known for their lust of gold and desire to
wear fine weapons.  Swords and coats of mail were fashioned that could
withstand a laser blast.
.PP
But when the darkness fell, the rightful reigns were toppled.  Swords
and helms and heads of state went rolling across the grass.  The entire
fleet of battlestars was reduced to a single ship.
.SH "SAMPLE COMMANDS"

Notice that the "shadow" of the next word stays around if you
want to take advantage of it.  That is, saying "take knife" and then
"drop"
will drop the knife you just took.
.SH "SCORE & INVEN"
The two commands "score" and "inven" will print out your current status
in
the game.
.SH "SAVING A GAME"
The command "save" will save your game in a file called "Bstar."  You
can
recover a saved game by using the "-r" option when you start up the
game.
.SH DIRECTIONS
The compass directions N, S, E, and W can be used if you have a compass.
If you don't have a compass, you'll have to say R, L, A, or B, which
stand for
Right, Left, Ahead, and Back.  Directions printed in room descriptions
are
always printed in R, L, A, & B relative directions.
.SH HISTORY
I wrote Battlestar in 1979 in order to experiment with the niceties of
the C Language.
Most interesting things that happen in the game are hardwired into the
code, so don't 
send me any hate mail about it!  Instead, enjoy art for art's sake!
