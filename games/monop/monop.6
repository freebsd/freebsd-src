.SH NAME
monop \- Monopoly game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/games/monop
[ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Monop
is reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game Monopoly, and
monitors a game between 1 to 9 users.
It is assumed that the rules of Monopoly are known.
The game follows the standard rules, with the exception that,
if a property goes up for auction and there are only two solvent players,
no auction is held and the property remains unowned.
.PP
The game, in effect, lends the player money,
so it is possible to buy something which you cannot afford.
However, as soon as a person goes into debt,
he must \*(lqfix the problem\*(rq,
.IR i.e. ,
make himself solvent, before play can continue.
If this is not possible, the player's property reverts to his debtee,
either a player or the bank.
A player can resign at any time to any person or the bank,
which puts the property back on the board, unowned.
.PP
Any time that the response to a question is a
.IR string ,
e.g., a name, place or person, you can type `?' to get a list of valid answers.
It is not possible to input a negative number, nor is it ever necessary.
.Sc
.IR "A Summary of Commands" :
.Cm quit
quit game: This allows you to quit the game.  It asks you if you're sure.
.Cm print
print board: This prints out the current board.
The columns have the following meanings (column headings are the same for the
.BR where ,
.BR "own holdings" ,
and
.B holdings
commands):
.PP
.RS 10
.TP "\w'Name\ \ 'u"
Name
The first ten characters of the name of the square
.TP
Own
The \fInumber\fR of the owner of the property.
.TP
Price
The cost of the property (if any)
.TP
Mg
This field has a `*' in it if the property is mortgaged
.TP
#
If the property is a Utility or Railroad, this is the number
of such owned by the owner.
If the property is land, this is the number of houses on it.
.TP
Rent
Current rent on the property.  If it is not owned, there is no rent.
.RE
.Cm where
where players are: Tells you where all the players are.
A `*' indicates the current player.
.Cm "own\ holdings"
List your own holdings,
.IR i.e. ,
money, get-out-of-jail-free cards, and property.
.Cm holdings
holdings list: Look at anyone's holdings.
It will ask you whose holdings you wish to look at.
When you are finished, type \*(lqdone\*(rq.
.Cm shell
shell escape: Escape to a shell.  When the shell dies,
the program continues where you left off.
.Cm mortgage
mortgage property:
Sets up a list of mortgageable property, and asks which you wish to mortgage.
.Cm unmortgage
unmortgage property:
Unmortgage mortgaged property.
.Cm buy
buy houses:
Sets up a list of monopolies on which you can buy houses.
If there is more than one, it asks you which you want to buy for.
It then asks you how many for each piece of property,
giving the current amount in parentheses after the property name.
If you build in an unbalanced manner
(a disparity of more than one house within the same monopoly),
it asks you to re-input things.
.Cm sell
sell houses:
Sets up a list of monopolies from which you can sell houses.
It operates in an analogous manner to
.I buy.
.Cm card
card for jail:
Use a get-out-of-jail-free card to get out of jail.
If you're not in jail, or you don't have one, it tells you so.
.Cm pay
pay for jail:
Pay $50 to get out of jail, from whence you are put on Just Visiting.
Difficult to do if you're not there.
.Cm trade
This allows you to trade with another player.
It asks you whom you wish to trade with,
and then asks you what each wishes to give up.
You can get a summary at the end, and, in all cases,
it asks for confirmation of the trade before doing it.
.Cm resign
Resign to another player or the bank.
If you resign to the bank, all property reverts to its virgin state,
and get-out-of-jail free cards revert to the deck.
.Cm save
save game:
Save the current game in a file for later play.
You can continue play after saving,
either by adding the file in which you saved the game after the
.I monop
command, or by using the
.I restore
command (see below).
It will ask you which file you wish to save it in,
and, if the file exists, confirm that you wish to overwrite it.
.Cm restore
restore game:
Read in a previously saved game from a file.
It leaves the file intact.
.Cm roll
Roll the dice and move forward to your new location.  
If you simply hit the <RETURN> key instead of a command,
it is the same as typing
.IR roll .
