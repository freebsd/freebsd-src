.Sh NAME
.Nm gssd
.Nd "Generic Security Services Daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl s Ar dir-list
.Op Fl c Ar file-substring
.Op Fl r Ar preferred-realm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides support for the kernel GSS-API implementation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will not fork when it starts.
.It Fl h
Enable support for host-based initiator credentials.
This permits a kerberized NFS mount to use a service principal in
the default Kerberos 5 keytab file for access.
Such access is enabled via the
gssname
option for the
.Xr mount_nfs 8
command.
.It Fl v
Run in verbose mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will log activity messages to syslog using LOG_INFO | LOG_DAEMON or to
stderr, if the
.Fl d
option has also been specified.
The minor status is logged as a decimal number, since it is actually a
Kerberos return status, which is signed.
.It Fl s Ar dir-list
Look for an appropriate credential cache file in this list of directories.
The list should be full pathnames from root, separated by ':' characters.
Usually this list will simply be "/tmp".
Without this option,
.Nm
assumes that the credential cache file is called /tmp/krb5cc_<uid>,
where <uid> is the effective uid for the RPC caller.
.It Fl c Ar file-substring
Set a file-substring for the credential cache file names.
Only files with this substring embedded in their names will be
selected as candidates when
.Fl s
has been specified.
If not specified, it defaults to "krb5cc_".
.It Fl r Ar preferred-realm
Use Kerberos credentials for this realm when searching for
credentials in directories specified with
.Fl s .
If not specified, the default Kerberos realm will be used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/krb5.keytab" -compact
.It Pa /etc/krb5.keytab
Contains Kerberos service principals which may be used as credentials
by kernel GSS-API services.
