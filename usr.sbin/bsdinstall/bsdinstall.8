.Sh NAME
.Nm bsdinstall
.Nd system installer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar target
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for installation of new systems, both for system setup from
installation media (e.g. CD-ROMs) and for use on live systems to prepare
VM images and jails.
.Pp
Much like
.Xr make 1 , Nm
takes a target and possible parameters of the target as arguments. If
invoked with no arguments, it will invoke the
.Cm auto
target, which provides a standard interactive installation, invoking the
others in sequence. To perform a scripted installation, these subtargets
can be invoked separately by an installation script.
.Sh TARGETS
Most of the following targets are only useful for scripting the installer.
For interactive use, most users will be interested only in the
.Cm auto
and
.Cm jail
targets.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm jail Ar destination"
.It Cm auto
Run the standard interactive installation, including disk partitioning.
.It Cm jail Ar destination
Sets up a new chroot system at
.Pa destination ,
suitable for use with
.Xr jail 8 .
Behavior is generally similar to
.Cm auto ,
except that disk partitioning and network setup are skipped and a kernel is
not installed into the new system.
.It Cm keymap
If the current controlling TTY is a
.Xr syscons 4
console, asks the user to set the current keymap, and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm hostname
Prompts the user for a host name for the new system and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also sets the host name of the current system.
.It Cm netconfig
Interactively configures network interfaces (first invoking
.Cm wlanconfig
on wireless interfaces), saving the result to the new system's
.Pa rc.conf 
and
.Pa resolv.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also configures the network interfaces of the current system to match.
.It Cm autopart
Provides the installer's interactive guided disk partitioner for single-disk
installations. Partitions disks, runs
.Xr newfs 8 ,
and writes the new system's
.Pa fstab .
.It Cm partedit
Provides the installer's interactive manual disk partitioner, with support
for multi disk setups, non-UFS file systems, and manual selection of
partition schemes. Partitions disks, runs
.Xr newfs 8 ,
and writes the new system's
.Pa fstab .
.It Cm mount
Mounts the file systems previously configured by
.Cm autopart
or
.Cm partedit
under
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm distfetch
Fetches the distributions in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
to
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR
from
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE .
.It Cm checksum
Verifies the checksums of the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
against the distribution manifest.
.It Cm distextract
Extracts the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
into
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm rootpass
Interactively invokes
.Xr passwd 1
in the new system to set the root user's password.
.It Cm adduser
Interactively invokes
.Xr adduser 8
in the new system.
.It Cm time
Interactively sets the time, date, and time zone of the new system.
.It Cm services
Queries the user for the system daemons to begin at system startup,
writing the result into the new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm config
Installs the configuration files destined for the new system (e.g. rc.conf
fragments generated by
.Cm netconfig ,
etc.) onto the new system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables control various aspects of the installation
process. Many are used internally during installation and have reasonable
default values for most installation scenarios. Others are set by various
interactive user prompts, and can be usefully overridden when making scripted
or customized installers.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR"
.It Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
The set of distributions to install (e.g. "base kernel ports"). Default: none
.It Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR
The directory in which the distribution files can be found (or to which they
should be downloaded). Default:
.Pa /usr/freebsd-dist
.It Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT
The directory into which the distribution files should be unpacked and the
directory at which the root file system of the new system should be mounted.
Default:
.Pa /mnt
.It Ev BSDINSTALL_LOG
Path to a log file for the installation. Default:
.Pa /tmp/bsdinstall_log
.It Ev BSDINSTALL_TMPETC
Directory where files destined for the new system's
.Pa /etc
will be stored until the
.Cm config
target is executed. If this directory does not already exist, it will be
created. Default:
.Pa /tmp/bsdinstall_etc
.El
