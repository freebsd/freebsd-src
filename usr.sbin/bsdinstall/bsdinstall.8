.Sh NAME
.Nm bsdinstall
.Nd system installer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar target
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for installation of new systems, both for system setup from
installation media, e.g., CD-ROMs, and for use on live systems to prepare
VM images and jails.
.Pp
Much like
.Xr make 1 , Nm
takes a target and possible parameters of the target as arguments.
If invoked with no arguments, it will invoke the
.Cm auto
target, which provides a standard interactive installation, invoking the
others in sequence.
To perform a scripted installation,
these subtargets can be invoked separately by an installation script.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
supports the following options, global to all targets:
.Bl -tag -width indent+
.It Fl D Ar file
Provide a path for the installation log file
.Pq overrides Ev BSDINSTALL_LOG .
See
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
for more information on
.Ev BSDINSTALL_LOG .
.El
.Sh TARGETS
Most of the following targets are only useful for scripting the installer.
For interactive use, most users will be interested only in the
.Cm auto ,
.Cm jail ,
and
.Cm script
targets.
.Bl -tag -width "jail destination"
.It Cm auto
Run the standard interactive installation, including disk partitioning.
.It Cm jail Ar destination
Sets up a new chroot system at
.Pa destination ,
suitable for use with
.Xr jail 8 .
Behavior is generally similar to
.Cm auto ,
except that disk partitioning and network setup are skipped and a kernel is
not installed into the new system.
.It Cm script Ar script
Runs the installation script at
.Pa script .
See
.Sx SCRIPTING
for more information on this target.
.It Cm keymap
If the current controlling TTY is a
.Xr syscons 4
or
.Xr vt 4
console, asks the user to set the current keymap, and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm hostname
Prompts the user for a host name for the new system and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also sets the host name of the current system.
.It Cm netconfig
Interactively configures network interfaces (first invoking
.Cm wlanconfig
on wireless interfaces), saving the result to the new system's
.Pa rc.conf
and
.Pa resolv.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also configures the network interfaces of the current system to match.
.It Cm autopart
Provides the installer's interactive guided disk partitioner for single-disk
installations.
Defaults to UFS.
.It Cm bootconfig
Detects an appropriate partition and installs UEFI boot loader files.
.It Cm zfsboot
Provides a ZFS-only automatic interactive disk partitioner.
Creates a single
.Ic zpool
with separate datasets for
.Pa /home ,
.Pa /tmp ,
.Pa /usr ,
.Pa /usr/ports ,
.Pa /usr/src ,
and
.Pa /var .
Optionally can set up
.Xr geli 8
to encrypt the disk.
.It Cm partedit
Provides the installer's interactive manual disk partitioner with an interface
identical to
.Xr sade 8 .
Supports multiple disks as well as UFS, ZFS, and FAT file systems.
ZFS is set up with one pool and dataset per partition.
.It Cm scriptedpart Ar parameters
Sets up disks like
.Cm autopart
and
.Cm partedit ,
but non-interactively according to the disk setup specified in
.Ar parameters .
Each disk setup is specified by a three-part argument:
.Pp
.Ar disk
.Op Ar scheme
.Op Ar {partitions}
.Pp
Multiple disk setups are separated by semicolons.
The
.Ar disk
argument specifies the disk on which to operate (which will be erased),
or the special value
.Em DEFAULT ,
which will result in either a selection window (as in
.Cm autopart )
for the destination disk or, if there is only one possible disk, will
automatically select it.
The
.Ar scheme
argument specifies the
.Xr gpart 8
partition scheme to apply to the disk.
If
.Ar scheme
is unspecified,
.Cm scriptedpart
will apply the default bootable scheme on your platform.
The
.Ar partitions
argument is also optional and specifies how to partition
.Ar disk .
It consists of a comma-separated list of partitions to create enclosed in
curly braces.
Each partition declaration takes the form
.Pp
.Ar size
.Ar type
.Op Ar mount point
.Pp
.Ar size
specifies the partition size to create in bytes (K, M, and G suffixes
can be appended to specify kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes respectively),
while the
.Em auto
keyword causes the partition to take all the remaining space on the disk.
The
.Ar type
option chooses the
.Xr gpart 8
filesystem type, e.g., freebsd-ufs, freebsd-zfs, or freebsd-swap.
The optional
.Ar mount point
argument sets where the created partition is to be mounted in the installed
system.
As an example, a typical invocation looks like:
.Pp
bsdinstall scriptedpart ada0 { 20G freebsd-ufs /, 4G freebsd-swap, 20G freebsd-ufs /var, auto freebsd-ufs /usr }
.Pp
Note that the list of partitions should
.Em not
include boot partitions (e.g. EFI system partitions), which will be created automatically on whatever disk includes /.
.Pp
A shorter invocation to use the default partitioning (as
.Cm autopart
would have used) on the same disk:
.Pp
bsdinstall scriptedpart ada0
.Pp
or, even shorter:
.Pp
bsdinstall scriptedpart DEFAULT
.It Cm mount
Mounts the file systems previously configured by
.Cm autopart ,
.Cm partedit ,
or
.Cm scriptedpart
under
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm distfetch
Fetches the distributions in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
to
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR
from
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE .
.It Cm checksum
Verifies the checksums of the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
against the distribution manifest.
.It Cm distextract
Extracts the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
into
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm rootpass
Interactively invokes
.Xr passwd 1
in the new system to set the root user's password.
.It Cm adduser
Interactively invokes
.Xr adduser 8
in the new system.
.It Cm time
Interactively sets the time, date, and time zone of the new system.
.It Cm services
Queries the user for the system daemons to begin at system startup,
writing the result into the new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm entropy
Reads a small amount of data from
.Pa /dev/random
and stores it in a file in the new system's root directory.
.It Cm config
Installs the configuration files destined for the new system, e.g.,
.Xr rc.conf 5
fragments generated by
.Cm netconfig ,
etc.) onto the new system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables control various aspects of the installation
process.
Many are used internally during installation and have reasonable default values
for most installation scenarios.
Others are set by various interactive user prompts, and can be usefully
overridden when making scripted or customized installers.
.Bl -tag -width "BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE"
.It Ev TMPDIR
The directory to use for temporary files.

Default: unset
.It Ev PARTITIONS
The partitioning of the disk onto which the system is being installed.
See

.It Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE
URL from which the distribution files should be downloaded if they are not
already present in the directory defined by
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR .
This should be a full path to the files, including architecture and release
names.
Most targets, e.g.,
.Cm auto
and
.Cm jail ,
that prompt for a
.Fx
mirror will skip that step if this variable is already defined in the
environment.
Example:
.Pa https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/powerpc/powerpc64/13.1-RELEASE/
or
.Pa http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/old-releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/ .

its default value.
.It Ev ZFSBOOT_CONFIRM_LAYOUT
If set and the installation is interactive, allow the user to confirm
the layout before continuing with the installation.
Default:
.Dq 1
.El
.Sh SCRIPTING
.Nm
supports unattended, or minimally-attended, installations using scripting.
This can be used with either modified physical installation media or with
.Xr diskless 8
installations over the network; information on preparing such media can be
found in
.Sx BUILDING AUTOMATIC INSTALL MEDIA
.Pp
Scripted installations follow an essentially identical path to interactive
installations, though with some minor feature differences (for example,
scripted installations do not support fetching of remote distribution files
since scripted installations normally install the same files and the distributions
can be added directly to the installation media).
.Nm
scripts consist of two parts: a
.Em preamble
and a
.Em setup script .
The preamble sets up the options for the installation (how to partition the
disk[s], which distributions to install, etc.) and the optional second part is
a shell script run under
.Xr chroot 8
in the newly installed system before
.Nm
exits.
The two parts are separated by the usual script header (#!), which also sets
the interpreter for the setup script.
.Pp
A typical bsdinstall script, using the default filesystem layout and the UFS
filesystem, looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
PARTITIONS=DEFAULT
DISTRIBUTIONS="kernel.txz base.txz"

#!/bin/sh
sysrc ifconfig_DEFAULT=DHCP
sysrc sshd_enable=YES
pkg install puppet
.Ed
.Pp
For a scripted installation involving a ZFS pool spanning multiple disks,
the script instead looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
DISTRIBUTIONS="kernel.txz base.txz"
export ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE=stripe
export ZFSBOOT_DISKS="ada0 ada1"
export nonInteractive="YES"

#!/bin/sh
echo "ifconfig_DEFAULT=DHCP" >> /etc/rc.conf
echo "sshd_enable=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
pkg install puppet
.Ed
.Pp
On
.Fx
release media, such a script placed at
.Pa /etc/installerconfig
will be run at boot time and the system will be rebooted automatically after
the installation has completed.
This can be used for unattended network installation of new systems; see
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.Ss PREAMBLE
The preamble consists of installer settings.
These control global installation parameters (see
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES )
as well as disk partitioning.
The preamble is interpreted as a
.Xr sh 1
script run at the very beginning of the install.
If more complicated behavior than setting these variables is desired,
arbitrary commands can be run here to extend the installer.
In addition to the variables in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ,
in particular
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS ,
the preamble can contain a variable
.Ev PARTITIONS
which is passed to the
.Cm scriptedpart
target to control disk setup.
.Pp
Alternatively,
to use
.Cm zfsboot
instead of
.Cm partedit ,
the preamble can contain the variable
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
instead of
.Ev PARTITIONS
(see below).
If using
.Cm zfsboot ,
the variables
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DISKS
and
.Ev ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE
must be set to create the pool of disks for the base system.
Usually, for a mirrored booting disk, these two variables look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ZFSBOOT_DISKS="ada0 ada1"
ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE=mirror
.Ed
.Pp
Remember to export all the variables for the
.Cm zfsboot
command, otherwise installation will fail.
.Ss SETUP SCRIPT
Following the preamble is an optional shell script, beginning with a #!
declaration.
This script will be run at the end of the installation process inside a
.Xr chroot 8
environment in the newly installed system and can be used to set up
configuration files, install packages, etc.
Note that newly configured system services, e.g., networking have not
been started in the installed system at this time and only installation
host services are available.
.Ss ZFS DATASETS
If using
.Cm zfsboot
in an installation script, the
.Cm zfsboot
partitioning tool takes the
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
variable to create the ZFS datasets on the base system.
This variable definition can become large if the pool contains many datasets.
The default value of
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# DATASET	OPTIONS (comma or space separated; or both)

# Boot Environment [BE] root and default boot dataset
/$ZFSBOOT_BEROOT_NAME				mountpoint=none
/$ZFSBOOT_BEROOT_NAME/$ZFSBOOT_BOOTFS_NAME	mountpoint=/

# Home directories separated so they are common to all BEs
/home		mountpoint=/home

# Compress /tmp, allow exec but not setuid
/tmp		mountpoint=/tmp,exec=on,setuid=off

# Do not mount /usr so that 'base' files go to the BEROOT
/usr		mountpoint=/usr,canmount=off

# Ports tree
/usr/ports	setuid=off

# Source tree (compressed)
/usr/src

# Create /var and friends
/var		mountpoint=/var,canmount=off
/var/audit	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/crash	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/log	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/mail	atime=on
/var/tmp	setuid=off
.Ed
.Pp
The first column is the name of the dataset to be created as part of the
.Ev ZFSBOOT_POOL_NAME
pool and the remainder of each line contains the options to be set on each dataset.
If multiple options are given, they can be separated by either commas or whitespace;
everything following a pound/hash character is ignored as a comment.
.Ss BUILDING AUTOMATIC INSTALL MEDIA
If building automatic install media, use tar to extract a release ISO:
.Dl mkdir release-media
.Dl tar -C release-media -xvf FreeBSD-13.0-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso
.Pp
Then place a script as above in
.Pa etc/installerconfig
.Pp
This directory can then be used directly as an NFS root for
.Xr diskless 8
installations or it can be rebuilt into an ISO image using the release scripts in
.Pa /usr/src/release .
For example, on amd64:
.Dl sh /usr/src/release/amd64/mkisoimages.sh -b '13_0_RELEASE_AMD64_CD' output.iso release-media
