This program is an automounter.

This automounter is a value-added, replacement for the SunOS 4
automount(8) program.  Though based on that program in spirit, it
contains no proprietary UN*X source code.

The version you have here is release 5.3Alpha.

This program is NOT in the Public Domain - it is covered by
the usual Berkeley software distribution license - but feel free
to take it and change it.

It is believed to work correctly on Sun-3's (SunOS 3.5, 4.0, 4.1),
Sun-4's (SunOS 4.0, 4.1), HP-9000/300 (HP-UX, MORE/bsd & BSD 4.3 Reno),
IBM RTs (AOS 4.3), IBM RISC System/6000 (AIX 3.1), VAXen (Ultrix 4.0,
MORE/bsd & BSD 4.3 Reno) and a wide variety of other systems.  If
your machine is not supported please feel free to try a port, but be
sure to send me a record of the changes you had to make.


This is the file text/README.

See the file text/INSTALL for installation instructions.

The documentation is in doc/amdref.texinfo.  This is in GNU TeXinfo format
and you will need a TeX system before you can print it out.

Please forward *all* bug reports to Jan-Simon Pendry <jsp@doc.ic.ac.uk>
quoting the details of the release and your configuration, which can be
obtained by running the command "amd -v".  Also send any additional
information which may be relevant such as command line options and the maps
being used.  Thanks.

The manual page (amd/amd.8) only lists the command line options.  See the
texinfo document doc/amdref.texinfo for a more detailed discussion.
