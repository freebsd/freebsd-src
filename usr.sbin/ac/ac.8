.Sh NAME
.Nm ac
.Nd connect time accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dp
.\".Op Fl c Ar console
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl w Ar wtmp
.Op Ar users ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the file
.Pa /var/log/utx.log
exists, a record of individual login and logout
times are written to it by
.Xr login 1
and
.Xr init 8 ,
respectively.
The
.Nm
utility
examines these records and writes the accumulated connect time (in hours)
for all logins to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indentXXX
.It Fl d
Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.
.\" .It Fl c Ar console
.\" Use
.\" .Ar console
.\" as the name of the device that local X sessions (ut_host of ":0.0")
.\" originate from.  If any login has been recorded on
.\" .Ar console
.\" then these X sessions are ignored unless COMPAT_SUNOS was defined at
.\" compile time.
.It Fl p
Print individual users' totals.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.
The
.Ar tty
specification can start with '!' to indicate not this
.Ar tty
and end with '*' to indicate all similarly named ttys.
Multiple
.Fl t
flags may be specified.
.It Fl w Ar wtmp
Read connect time data from
.Ar wtmp
instead of the default file,
.Pa /var/log/utx.log .
.It Ar users ...
Display totals for the given individuals only.
.El
.Pp
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
displays the total connect time for all
accounts with login sessions recorded in
.Pa utx.log .
.Pp
The default
.Pa utx.log
file will increase without bound unless it is truncated.
It is normally truncated by the daily scripts run
by
.Xr cron 8 ,
which rename and rotate the
.Pa utx.log
files, keeping a week's worth of data on
hand.
No login or connect time accounting is performed if
.Pa /var/log/utx.log
does not exist.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/utx.log -compact
.It Pa /var/log/utx.log
connect time accounting file
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Allow times recorded in
.Pa modems
to be charged out at a different rate than
.Pa other :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ac -p -t "ttyd*" > modems
ac -p -t "!ttyd*" > other
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr getutxent 3 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sa 8
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v5 .
This version of
.Nm
was written for
.Nx 0.9a
from the specification provided by various systems' manual pages.
.\" .Sh NOTES
.\" If COMPAT_SUNOS is defined
.\" .Nm ac
.\" ignores the fact that entries with ut_host of ":0.0" are not real
.\" login sessions.  Normally such entries are ignored except in the case
.\" of a user being logged in when the
.\" .Pa wtmp
.\" file was rotated, in which case a login with ut_host of ":0.0" may
.\" appear without any preceding console logins.
.\" If no one is logged in on the console, the user is deemed to have
.\" logged in on at the earliest time stamp found in
.\" .Pa wtmp .
.\" Use of
.\" .Pa console
.\" allows
.\" .Nm ac
.\" to identify and correctly process a logout for the user.  The default
.\" value for
.\" .Pa console
.\" is usually correct at compile time.
