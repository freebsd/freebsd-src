# If "CONSOLE_TTY" is not defined, this program is compatible with the
# traditional implementation (using SunOS 4.x as the sample traditional
# implementation).  This is the default.
#
# If "CONSOLE_TTY" is defined, it must be defined to the appropriate
# console name, e.g. "vga".  Additionally, the various commented-out
# sections of the man page should be uncommented.  This is not the
# default because of the inability to detect the proper console name
# easily, especially on m68k systems, which can share binaries.
