.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B pkg_manage
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pkg_manage is an interactive tool with which you can install, 
delete and view packages. It is a 
front-end to the pkg_add(1), pkg_info(1) and pkg_delete(1) programs.

Pressing F1 (or '?') at anytime during the program will bring up 
online-help.  (Pressing '?' will not invoke help when in character 
input fields)

.SH NAVIGATING THE MENU
When starting pkg_manage you will be put in a menu with the following 
choices:

.TP
.B 1. View installed.
You will be offered an overview of the installed 
packages. Moving the cursor to a packagename and pressing 'enter'
will show additional information for the package. Use the 
.B PgUp
and 
.B PgDn
keys to page through the information. Press
.B Enter
(this selects the 
.B <EXIT>
button) to return to the 'View installed Packages' menu. 

When done viewing packages move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button with the right-arrow key (or left-arrow key) 
and press enter. This will return you to the main-menu.

.TP
.B 2. Delete installed
You can choose a package from the installed ones to delete. Move the 
cursor to the package you wish to delete and press enter. This will
bring up another menu from which you can choose to either:

.B 1. Simulate delete:
Have a look at the commands that are going to be executed (recommended).
.B 2. Delete:
Execute the commands to delete the package.
.B 3. Cancel:
Do 
.B NOT
execute the commands to delete the package and return to the 
previous menu.

Choose the 
.B <Cancel>
button if you don't want to delete any packages 
and return to the main-menu.

.TP
.B 3. Preview package
Take a look at the commands that will be executed upon installation 
of a package.
Choose a package with the fileselector. See below for a description of 
the usage of the fileselector.

.TP
.B 4. Install packages
Install packages of your choice. Use the directoryselector to select a 
directory containing your packages. Move the cursor to 
.B <OK>
to continue, 
.B <Cancel>
to back out.
Once a directory has been chosen, it will be scanned for packages files,
typically files ending in '.tgz'. These will be listed in
a listbox (the one on the left) as well as the already installed 
packages, that will be listed in a similar box (on the right side).
Use TAB or SHIFT-TAB to move from field to field. 
Packages can be selected in the left listbox, using either the 
space bar, to mark/unmark a single package at a time, or by using
\'*', '-' to mark/unmark all packages at once. 
Once the packages have been selected move to the 
.B <Install marked>
button and press enter. If you want to back out, press either ESC 
or move to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button and press enter. 
Under the left listbox, the number of kilobytes that the packages will 
consume once installed, are indicated.

.TP
.B 5. Quit
Well just try this one if you get fed up fiddling with your packages.

.SH USING THE FILESELECTOR

Using the fileselector is really very simple.

Use the 
.B TAB 
key to move forwards from one input/display field to 
the next. If enabled in the termcap, 
.B Shift-TAB 
will move backwards.
Pressing enter in a field will perform the changes you may have made and 
move to the next field. Pressing 
.B TAB 
will discard the changes and move to the next field.

The 
.B "Filemask:" 
controls what kind of files will be displayed in the 
.B "Files:" 
list. The expression follows the same rules as your shell does, i.e.
\'*.tgz' will only show files having names ending with '.tgz'.

.B "Directory:"
displays the current directory. You can also type in another directory 
in this field. 

The 
.B "Directories:" 
list enables you to browse the filesystem. Select 
.B '..'
and press enter to
go up the directory tree, select any other directory listed to descent 
into that directory.

Finally there three more fields: The 
.B Selection:
, the 
.B <Ok>
button and the 
.B <Cancel> 
button. The file chosen in the 
.B Files:
field, assuming you pressed enter, will be displayed in the 
.B Selection:
field. You can also change this value directly by editing the field. 

When you are satisfied with the current selection you can move the cursor
to the
.B <Ok>
button and press enter. If you want to back out, move the cursor to the 
.B <Cancel> 
button and press enter.

.SH USING THE DIRECTORYSELECTOR

This is basically the same as using the fileselector. There are just no 
files to select. Once the directory has been chosen, choose 
.B <OK> 

.SH SEE ALSO
pkg_add(1), pkg_info(1), pkg_delete(1), pkg_create(1).

.SH BUGS
