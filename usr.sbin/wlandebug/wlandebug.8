.Dt WLANDEBUG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wlandebug
.Nd "set/query 802.11 wireless debugging messages"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d | Fl i Ar ifnet
.Op Fl flag|+flag Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is a tool for enabling and disabling
debugging messages in the
.Xr wlan 4
module.
Running
.Nm
without any options will display the current messages
enabled for the specified network interface
(by default, ``wlan0').
The default debugging level for new interfaces can be set
by specifying the
.Fl d
option.
When run as the super-user
.Nm
can be used to enable and/or disable debugging messages.
.Pp
To enable debugging messages of a certain
.Ar type
use
.Ar +type ;
to disable such messages use
.Ar -type .
Multiple messages can be enabled and disabled with a single command.
.Pp
Messages are organized in the following groups:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar dumppkts"
.It Ar debug
general debugging facilities; equivalent to setting the debug
parameter with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Ar dumppkts
dump packet contents on transmit and receive.
.It Ar crypto
crypto-related work.
.It Ar input
errors encountered during input handling.
.It Ar xrate
extended rate set handling (for 802.11g).
.It Ar elemid
information element processing in 802.11 management frames.
.It Ar node
management of per-station state.
.It Ar assoc
802.11 station association processing; particularly useful to
see when stations join and leave a BSS.
.It Ar auth
802.11 station authentication processing.
.It Ar scan
scanning operation; especially useful for debugging problems
with not locating an access point.
.It Ar output
errors encountered during output handling.
.It Ar state
.Xr wlan 4
state machine operation.
.It Ar power
802.11 power save operation; in hostap mode this enables
copious information about buffered frames for stations operating
in power save mode.
.It Ar hwmp
trace operation of Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol processing.
.It Ar dot1xsm
802.1x state machine operation; not presently meaningful as 802.1x protocol
support is implemented in user mode by the
.Xr hostapd 8
program.
.It Ar radius
radius backend operation as it relates to 802.1x operation;
not presently meaningful as 802.1x protocol
support is implemented in user mode by the
.Xr hostapd 8
program.
.It Ar raddump
dump packets exchanged with the radius backend for 802.1x operation;
not presently meaningful as 802.1x protocol
support is implemented in user mode by the
.Xr hostapd 8
program.
.It Ar mesh
trace operation of 802.11s mesh protocol processing.
.It Ar wpa
trace operation of the WPA protocol;
only partly meaningful as WPA protocol
support is mostly implemented in user mode by the
.Xr hostapd 8
and
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
programs.
.It Ar acl
trace operation of the Access Control List (ACL) support; see
.Xr wlan_acl 4
for more details.
.It Ar wme
trace operation of WME/WMM protocol processing.
.It Ar superg
trace operation of Atheros SuperG protocol processing.
.It Ar doth
trace operation of IEEE 802.11h protocol processing.
.It Ar inact
trace station inactivity processing; in particular,
show when stations associated to an access point are dropped due to
inactivity.
.It Ar roam
trace station mode roaming between access points.
.It Ar rate
trace transmit rate control operation.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following might be used to debug basic station mode operation:
.Pp
.Dl "wlandebug -i wlan1 scan+auth+assoc"
.Pp
it enables debug messages while scanning, authenticating to
an access point, and associating to an access point.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Pp
The
.Pa /usr/src/tools
directory contains some utilities that might be relevant to debug wireless
issues.
.Sh NOTES
Different wireless drivers support different debugging messages.
Drivers such as
.Xr ath 4
and
.Xr ral 4
that depend on the
.Xr wlan 4
module for 802.11 protocol processing typically support
most of the debugging messages while devices that
implement parts of the 802.11 protocol in firmware do not.
.Pp
Some debugging messages are no longer meaningful
because protocol processing has moved from the operating
system to user mode programs such as
.Xr hostapd 8
and
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 .
