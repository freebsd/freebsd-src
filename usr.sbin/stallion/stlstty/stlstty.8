.Sh NAME
.Nm stlstty
.Nd "Stallion Technologies multiport serial port enhanced switches"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hV
.Op Ar SWITCHES
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to view and set the advanced driver switches available on
Stallion Technologies multiport serial ports.
.Pp
The advanced switches configurable through
.Nm
are only available on the intelligent boards of the Stallion
Technologies multiport serial board range.
This includes the EasyConnection 8/64 (ISA and EISA),
ONboard and Brumby boards.
The switches are not available on the EasyIO, EasyConnection 8/32
and EasyConnection 8/64-PCI boards.
.Pp
If no switch settings are listed on the
.Nm
command line then it will display the current setting of all switches
for the port that is
.Pa standard input.
If one or more switches is listed on the
.Nm
command line then those switches will be set accordingly.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It Fl h
Output usage information.
.It Fl V
Output version information.
.El
.Sh SWITCHES
All switches are enabled by using the switch name as a parameter
to
.Nm stlstty .
To disable a setting use a
.Pa "-"
character in front of the switch name.
.Pp
All switches configurable by
.Nm
are persistent through opens and closes of the port.
Once a switch is set it will remain set until changed using
.Nm
or by a reboot of the board or system.
.Pp
The following switches are configurable through
.Nm stlstty :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It Ar maprts (\-maprts)
Maps the functionality normally associated with the DTR pin to
action on the RTS pin instead.
So in other words the RTS pin will now act as if it where the DTR pin.
This is useful for boards that have ports that do not have full
modem signaling on their connector (eg ONboard 16).
.It Ar mapcts (\-mapcts)
Maps the functionality normally associated with the DCD pin to
be actioned on the CTS pin.
So in other words the CTS pin will now act as if it was the DCD pin.
This is useful for boards that have ports that do not have full
modem signaling on their connector (eg ONboard 16).
.It Ar rtslock (\-rtslock)
Locks RTS based flow control on this port on.
No matter what the port flow control is configured to be via
the usual
.Pa stty
program, RTS based (hardware) flow control will be active on
this port.
.It Ar ctslock (\-ctslock)
Locks CTS based flow control on this port on.
No matter what the port flow control is configured to be via
the usual
.Pa stty
program, CTS based (hardware) flow control will be active on
this port.
.It Ar loopback (\-loopback)
Enables the internal loopback mode of the port UART.
All data transmitted on this port will be received,
and none will physically be transmitted by the port.
.It Ar fakedcd (\-fakedcd)
The DCD pin will always be reported as being asserted,
regardless of the physical state of the hardware pin.
.It Ar dtrfollow (\-dtrfollow)
The DTR signal will only be asserted when data is being
transmitted from the port.
This is useful in conjunction with the EasyConnection
Dual Interface module when fitted with RS-485 line drivers.
.It Ar rximin (\-rximin)
Disables (or enables) the slave processor's received character
"bunching" algorithms.
By default the slave processor will bunch up received data,
so that it can be sent to the host in large chunks.
This increases the time it takes for any individual character
to be seen by an application.
This may be undesirable for latency sensitive applications or
protocols.
To reduce received character latency the
.Pa rximin
switch should be turned on.
.It Ar rxitime (\-rxitime)
Disables (or enables) the slave processor's received character
wait timer.
This timer is used as part of the slave processor's data "bunching"
algorithm.
By turning this switch on the timer is reduced to a minimum,
so that received data will immediately be sent to the host system.
.It Ar rxthold (\-rxthold)
Disables the UART received FIFO for this port.
By default the UART received FIFO is programmed to a reasonably
high level, to minimize CPU overhead.
Some third party serial devices do not respond quickly to flow
control signals (hardware of software) and this may cause the
UART's received FIFO to over-run - thus losing data.
Turning this switch on disables use of the received FIFO.
