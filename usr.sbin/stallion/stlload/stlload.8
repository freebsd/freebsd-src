.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl vhVR
.Op Fl i Ar image-file
.Op Fl c Ar control-device
.Op Fl r Ar rx-buf-size
.Op Fl t Ar tx-buf-size
.Op Fl B Ar boot-banner

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Stlload
is used to download the firmware code to Stallion Technologies intelligent
multiport serial boards.
A firmware download is only required for those boards that use the Stallion
.Nm stli
driver.
This includes the EasyConnection 8/64, ONboard and Brumby families of boards.
.Pp
Different board types require different firmware images.
If the wrong firmware is loaded into a board it will fail to operate.
.Pp
The Stallion EasyConnection 8/64 Host Adapter PCI cards DO NOT require
firmware to be loaded.
.Pp
The download process is achieved through the Stallion
.Nm stli
driver control device,
.Pa /dev/staliomem? .
This device implements a file type device that can read and write into the
boards shared memory region.
It also implements a number of special
.Em ioctls
that reset and restart the board.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl v
Verbose output generation.
Trace is generated at each phase of the download and startup process.
.It Fl h
Output usage information.
.It Fl V
Output version information.
.It Fl R
Reset the board only.
Does not proceed to download firmware to the board.
.It Fl i Ar image-file
Specify the firmware image file to download.
The default firmware image is
.Pa /usr/libdata/stallion/cdk.sys .
.It Fl c Ar control-device
Specify the board control device through which to download the firmware
and start up the board.
The default is
.Pa /dev/staliomem0 .
.It Fl r Ar rx-buf-size
Specify the size of the boards shared memory Receive Data buffer.
By default the buffer is dynamically sized to use the maximum
available shared memory.
.It Fl t Ar tx-buf-size
Specify the size of the boards shared memory Transmit Data buffer.
By default the buffer is dynamically sized to use the maximum
available shared memory.
.It Fl B Ar boot-banner
Enable the slave debug trace flag during download.
This enables debug trace output from the firmware code.
This trace is output on port 0 of the board,
and the port is set to 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
.It Fl b Ar unit-number
Specify the unit (board) number to be downloaded.  The default is to
download board 0.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Stlload
would typically be run from
.Pa /etc/rc.serial .
