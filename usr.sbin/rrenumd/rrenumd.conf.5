.Nm rrenumd.conf
.Nd configuration file for router renumbering daemon
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The rrenumd config file describes how the router renumbering packet
must be constructed and to which destinations it should be sent.
This file consists of a sequence of statements terminated by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens
separated by white space, which can be any combination of blanks, tabs
and newlines.
This structure simplifies identification of
the parts of the configuration associated with each other.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.\"
.Sh Meta Syntax
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using the
.Ic bold
font.
Parameters are specifying with
.Ar underline .
Parameters shown in
square brackets (`[' and `]') are used to show optional
keywords and parameters.
The vertical bar (`|') is used to indicate
between a choice of optional parameters.
Curly braces (`{' and
`}') are used to group keywords and parameters when necessary.
.\"
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar lo0
and
.Ar ep1 .

.It Cm keeplen Ar keeplen-val
Specify the medium part of
.Ar use-prefix-val
just next to the starting part specified by
.Ar use-prefix-len ,
as decimal bit number.
Contiguous bits part in the same bit position of an existent prefix
matched with
.Ar match-prefix-val
is copied to the same bit position of prefixes to be added.
.It Cm vltime Ar vmtime-val
Assign an
.Ar time
as prefix valid life time for a prefix to be added.
Valid value for
.Ar time
is decimal seconds number or special format as "d00h00m00s00",
where 00 can take any decimal number, and "d" means days, "h" means hours,
"m" means minutes, "s" means seconds.
And alternatively, special keyword
"infinity" can be also be specified.
.It Cm pltime Ar pltime-val
Assign an
.Ar time
as prefix preferred life time for a prefix to be added.
Valid value for
.Ar time
is same as for
.Ar vltime-val .
.It Cm raf_onlink Cm on|off
Let the prefix to be added to have on-link or off-link nature
for the assigned interface.
If
.Cm on
is specified, the prefix have on-link nature
(e.g.\& the prefix
belong to the link).
If
.Cm off
is specified, the prefix have off-link nature
(e.g.\& the
prefix does not belong to the link).
.It Cm raf_auto Cm on|off
Enable or disable the autonomous address auto configuration
for the prefix to be added.
If
.Cm on
is specified, autonomous address auto configuration is
enabled.
If
.Cm off
is specified, it is disabled.
.It Cm rrf_decrprefd Cm on|off
Enable or disable the decrementation of the pltime.
If
.Cm on
is specified, decrementation of the pltime is enabled.
If
.Cm off
is specified, decrementation of the pltime is disabled.
.It Cm rrf_decrvalid Cm on|off
Enable or disable the decrementation of the vltime.
If
.Cm on

If
.Cm off
is specified, decrementation of the vltime is disabled.
.El

.It seqnum Ar seqnum-val { Ar rrenum-cmd } ;

specific seqnum.
Multiple of this statement can be specified if they
have different
.Ar seqnum-val
each other.
.Ar rrenum-cmd
has just same syntax with above add|change|setglobal statement.

.Sh EXAMPLES
For each configuration file example shown below, we suppose
every IPv6 subnet has its own prefix beginning with
fec0:0:0::/48 and with its own subnet number
(in this case,
subnet number is 7th and 8th octet value of the prefix).
.Pp
If you want to assign prefixes beginning with 3ffe:501:ffff::/48
to each subnet, then following configuration will be enough,
if each of your routers supports IPv6 multicast forwarding.
The subnet number of the existing fec0:0:0::/48 prefix and the
newly assigned 3ffe:501:ffff::/48 prefix will be same.
.\"
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dest ff05::2;

add match-prefix fec0:0:0:: /48 use-prefix 3ffe:501:ffff:: /48 keeplen 16;
.Ed
.Pp
.\"
If your routers do not support IPv6 multicast forwarding,
you will need to specify each destination at
.Cm dest
command.
.\"
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dest fec0:0:0:1:260:8ff:fe24:fb3a fec0:0:0:2:200:eff:fe2e:dfe1 fec0:0:0:3:5254:ff:fedc:5217;

add match-prefix fec0:0:0:: /48 use-prefix 3ffe:501:ffff:: /48 keeplen 16;
.Ed
.Pp
.\"
If you are going to do renumbering, then following procedure will be natural.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Assign a new prefix.
.It
Set old prefix lifetimes to some appropriate transition
period.
In the following example we use 1 week for valid
lifetime, and 0 for preferred lifetime.
Also, enable old prefix lifetime expiration
(By default, it is static and does not expire).
.It
After the transition period, old prefixes should become
invalid, and may have been deleted.
To make sure that they are deleted, send new router
renumbering message, which specifies old prefixes as match
prefix, and no use prefix.
.El
.Pp
.\"
The following configuration file will do 1 and 2.
.\"
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dest ff05::2;

seqnum 0 {
	add match-prefix fec0:0:0:: /48 use-prefix 3ffe:501:fffe:: /48 keeplen 16;
	};

seqnum 1 {
	change match-prefix 3ffe:501:ffff:: /48 use-prefix 3ffe:501:ffff:: /48 keeplen 16 vltime d7 pltime 0 rrf_decrvalid on rrf_decrprefd on;
	};
.Ed
.Pp
.\"
And the following configuration file will do 3
(should be
used for the router renumbering message to be sent 1 week
afterward).
.\"
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dest ff05::2;

change match-prefix 3ffe:501:ffff:: /48;
.Ed
.Pp
.\"
In the above example, only
.Cm add
and
.Cm change
commands are used, and there is no example for
.Cm setglobal
command.
.Cm setglobal
command is almost same with
.Cm change
command except that it deletes all pre-defined IPv6 global address.
