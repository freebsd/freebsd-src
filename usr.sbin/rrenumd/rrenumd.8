.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility transmits router renumbering request packets,
to renumber the routers in the site network.
.Pp
On KAME-based systems,
router renumbering requests are received and processed by
.Xr rtadvd 8 .
For other systems, refer to relevant documents.
.Pp
The program will daemonize itself on invocation.
It reads configuration information from standard input if
.Fl s
is specified, or from
.Ar conf_file
if
.Fl c Ar conf_file
is specified.
.Pp
The contents of configuration information are described in
.Xr rrenumd.conf 5 .
.Pp
After successful configuration,
.Nm
sends router renumbering
messages periodically to configured destinations.
Messages contain prefixes configured to be renumbered.
