.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides command-line access to features and debug facilities exported by
.Xr cxgbe 4
via private ioctls.
The target nexus device,
.Va t4nex%d
, is always the first argument.
(The parent nexus for an Ethernet port
.Va cxgbe%d
is listed in
.Va dev.cxgbe.%d.%parent
in the
.Xr sysctl 8
MIB).
The rest consists of a command and any parameters required by that command.
.Ss Commands
.Bl -ohang
.It Cm clearstats Ar port_id
Clear all transmit, receive, and error statistics of all queues associated
with a port.
The total number of ports attached to a nexus is listed in
.Va dev.t4nex.%d.nports
and the 0 based
.Ar port_id
identifies a port within this range.
.Pp

.Bl -tag -width "ingress_cntxt_id" -compact
.It Ar ingress_cntxt_id
context id of an ingress queue -- the value listed in one of
.Va dev.t4nex.%d.fwq.cntxt_id ,
.Va dev.cxgbe.%d.rxq.%d.cntxt_id ,
or
.Va dev.cxgbe.%d.ofld_rxq.%d.cntxt_id .

The FLM context id is displayed in the
egress context dump of a freelist as FLMcontextID.
.El
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Cm hashfilter mode
.It
.Cm filter mode
.El
Display a list of match-criteria available for use in filter rules.
A full list of match-criteria known to the chip is in the table below but not
all can be used together and the firmware sets up the available parameters based
on "filterMode" in the configuration file.
Every filter must conform to the filter mode -- multiple match criteria per
filter are allowed but only from among those in the current setting of the
filter mode.
The filter mode for hash filters is a subset of that for normal TCAM filters and
depends on the "filterMask" setting in the firmware configuration file.
Hash filters do not support masked matches and an exact value for every
parameter in the output of "hashfilter mode" (except ipv4/ipv6) must be provided
when creating a hash filter.
.Pp
(Note that
.Ar mask
defaults to all 1s when not provided explicitly.
Hash filters do not support masked matches.
Also note that many of the items being matched are discrete numeric
values rather than bit fields and should be masked with caution.)

interface on which incoming frame was received is in promiscuous mode
and the destination MAC in the frame is not a broadcast address, and
does not match in the MPS TCAM or the MPS hash either.  (The frame would
have been discarded if the interface wasn't in promiscuous mode.)
.It 5
interface on which incoming frame was received is in promiscuous mode
and the destination MAC in the frame is not a broadcast address; it
wasn't looked up in the MPS TCAM or the MPS hash because the chip is
configured to give precedence to promiscuous mode classification.

.Cm hashfilter Ar filter-specification
.It
.Cm filter Ar idx Ar filter-specification
.El
Program a filter.
.Pp
TCAM filters: The number of available filters is in
dev.<nexus>.<instance>.nfilters.
.Ar idx
must be an unused index between 0 and nfilters - 1.
IPv6 filters consume 4 consecutive entries on T4/T5 and 2 on T6 and
.Ar idx
must be aligned to 4 or 2 in this case.
.Pp
Hash filters:  These reside in the card's memory instead of its TCAM and are
enabled with a special configuration file that is selected with
.Cm hw.cxgbe.config_file="hashfilter"
in loader.conf.
There are at least half a million filters available with the sample config
shipped with the driver.
Note that the hardware selects the index for a hashfilter and this index is
displayed when the filter is created.
Hash and TCAM filters can be used together.
.Pp
.Ar filter-specification
consists of one or more matches (see Usage in the table above) to try against an
incoming frame, an action to perform when all matches succeed, and some
additional operational parameters.
Hashfilters require an exact value for the 5-tuple (sip, dip, sport, dport,
proto) and for any other match-criteria listed in "hashfilter mode".
Possible filter actions are
.Cm drop ,
.Cm pass , or
.Cm switch .
.Pp
Operational parameters that can be used with all filters:
.Bl -tag -width "nat_dport" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm hitcnts
Count filter hits: 0 or 1 (default).
.It Cm prio
Filter has priority over active and server regions of TCAM: 0 (default) or 1.
.El
.Pp
Operational parameters that can be used with filters with
.Cm action pass :
.Bl -tag -width "nat_dport" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm queue
Context id of an ingress queue to which to deliver the packet.
The context id is available in
.Va dev.cxgbe.%d.rxq.%d.cntxt_id .
By default, packets that hit a filter with action pass are delivered based on
their RSS hash as usual.
Use this to steer them to a particular queue.
.It Cm rpttid
Report the filter tid instead of the RSS hash in the rx descriptor.
0 (default) or 1.
.It Cm tcbhash
Select TCB hash information in rx descriptor.
0 (default) or 1
.El
.Pp
Operational parameters that can be used with filters with
.Cm action switch :
.Bl -tag -width "nat_dport" -offset indent -compact

Install the Connection Offload Policy (COP) in
.Ar cop.txt .
A COP offers fine-grained control over which connections get offloaded and with
what parameters.
Set
.Cm hw.cxgbe.toe.cop_managed_offloading="1"
in loader.conf to ensure that t4_tom will not offload any connection before a
COP is installed.
Note that t4_tom must be loaded and operational (IFCAP_TOE enabled) as always
for any kind of offload based on the hardware TOE.
.Bl -column -offset indent "COP installed" "cop_managed_offloading" "Behavior"

.It NO Ta 0 Ta offload all [Default]
.It NO Ta 1 Ta no offload
.It YES Ta Don't Care Ta Rule based offload
.El
.Pp
The policy file consists of empty lines, comments (lines beginning with #) and
any number of rules.
Rules are applied in the order they appear in the file and processing stops at
the first match.
There is an implicit rule that disables offload for connections that do not
match anything in the policy.
.Pp
Each rule consists of a filter part, which determines what connections the
rule applies to, and a settings part, which determines whether matching
connections will be offloaded and, if so, with what settings.
The general form of a rule is
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Cm \&[ Ar socket-type Cm \&] Ar pcap-filter Cm => Ar settings
.Pp
.Ar socket-type
is one of the following.
.Bl -tag -width "X" -compact
.It Sy A
Active open.
Connection is being opened by this host.
.It Sy P
Passive open.
Connection was requested by a peer.
.It Sy L

Disabling offload in such a rule will prevent a hardware listener from being started.
.It Sy D
Don't care.
Matches all of the above.
.El
.Pp
.Ar pcap-filter
is an expression that follows the
.Xr pcap-filter 7
syntax, or it is the keyword
.Cm all
that matches everything.
.Pp
.Ar settings
determine whether connections matching
.Ar socket-type
and
.Ar pcap-filter
are offloaded and optionally sets some per-connection properties if they are.
A combination of the following is allowed.
.Bl -tag -width "timestamp" -compact
.It Cm offload

Use when nofldrxq is the same as nofldtxq.
.It Cm mss Ar val
Set the advertised TCP MSS in the SYN for this connection to
.Ar val
(in bytes).
The hardware MTU table must already have an entry that is suitable for the MSS.
.El
.It Example of a COP.
Note that hardware listener for port 22 will be IPv4 only because the rule
before it will prevent any IPv6 servers other than the first two.
Also note
that outgoing connections to 192.168/16 are the only outgoing connections that
