.Nd supervise USB attach/detach
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
handles the USB device attachment and detachment.
It does two things.
Through opening the
.Pa /dev/usb0 ,
.Pa /dev/usb1 ,
etc. devices, it enables the kernel to do handle change requests from
attached hubs.
This functionality will be removed when the kernel has
kernel threads.
The (multiple)
.Fl f Ar device
command line options specify which controllers it should handle.
Normally this option is not needed.
.Pp
If the
.Dq usb ,
.Dq ohci
and
.Dq uhci
modules are not loaded, it will load them automatically.
.Pp
The second part is the handling of the attachment and detachment of USB
devices.
The device
.Pa /dev/usb
is opened and events are read from it.
Whenever a device is attached or
detached the list of actions read from
.Pa /etc/usbd.conf
are searched for a matching entry.
If found, the corresponding action is
executed.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar filename
Name of configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/usbd.conf .
.It Fl d
Enable debugging to the standard output,
and do not disassociate from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl e
Do one device tree exploration, no event queue handling and then exit.
.It Fl f Ar device
Specify the pathname of a USB controller device file.
The flag may be repeated to watch more than one USB controller.
The default is
.Pa /dev/usb0
through
.Pa /dev/usb3 .
Do not specify the device
.Pa /dev/usb
here.
It is used for events only.
.It Fl n
Do not handle the event queue on /dev/usb.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Set the timeout interval (in seconds) before an exploration happens
without being triggered by a connect or disconnect.
A timeout of 0 means that there is no timeout.  The default is 30.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
Repeating the flag makes
.Nm
more verbose.
