.Sh NAME
.Nm fwcontrol
.Nd FireWire control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl u Ar bus_num
.Op Fl prt
.Op Fl c Ar node
.Op Fl d Ar node
.Op Fl o Ar node
.Op Fl s Ar node
.Op Fl l Ar file
.Op Fl f Ar node
.Op Fl g Ar gap_count
.Op Fl b Ar pri_req
.Op Fl M Ar mode
.Op Fl R Ar filename
.Op Fl S Ar filename
.Op Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is designed to provide a way for users to access and control the
.Fx
FireWire subsystem.
Without options,
.Nm
will output a list of devices that are/were connected to the bus.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl u Ar bus_num
Specify the FireWire bus number to be operated on.
The default is bus 0.
.It Fl r
Initiate bus reset.
.It Fl t
Show the topology map.
.It Fl p
Dump PHY registers.
.It Fl c Ar node
Show the configuration ROM on the node.
.It Fl d Ar node
Hex dump of the configuration ROM.
.It Fl o Ar node
Send a link-on PHY packet to the node.
.It Fl s Ar node
Write to the
.Dv RESET_START
register on the node.
.It Fl l Ar file
Load hex dump file of the configuration ROM and parse it.
.It Fl f Ar node
Force specified
.Ar node
to be the root node on the next bus reset by sending a PHY config packet.
Valid values are 0 - 63.
.It Fl g Ar gap_count
Broadcast new
.Ar gap_count
by sending a PHY_config packet.
By default this value is 63 on all nodes.
Valid values are 0 - 63.
.It Fl i Ar pri_req
Set the
.Dv PRIORITY_BUDGET
register on all supported nodes.
.It Fl M Ar mode
Explicitly specify either
.Ar dv
or
.Ar mpeg
mode for the incoming stream.
Only meaningful in case of and must precede the
.Fl R
option.
If not specified, the program will try to guess.
In case of
.Dq format 0x20
error, try to force the
.Dq mpeg
mode.
.It Fl R Ar filename
Receive DV or MPEG TS stream and dump it to a file.
Use ^C to stop the receiving.
Some DV cameras seem not to send the stream if a bus manager exists.
If it is impossible to get the stream, try the following commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl hw.firewire.try_bmr=0
fwcontrol -r
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting file contains raw DV data excluding isochronous header
and CIP header.
It can be handled by
.Nm libdv
in the
.Fx
Ports Collection.
Resulting MPEG TS stream can be played and sent over a
network using the VideoLAN
.Nm vlc
tool in the
.Fx
Ports Collection.
The stream can be piped directly to
.Nm vlc,
see
.Sx EXAMPLES .
.It Fl S Ar filename
Send a DV file as isochronous stream.
.It Fl m Ar EUI64 | hostname
Set default fwmem target.
Hostname will be converted to EUI64 using
.Xr eui64 5 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "Pa /dev/fw0.0"
.It Pa /dev/fw0.0
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Each DV frame has a fixed size and it is easy to edit the frame order.
.Pp
.Dl "fwcontrol -R original.dv"
.Pp
Receive a DV stream with DV camera attached.
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=first.dv bs=120000 count=30"
.Pp
Get first 30 frames(NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "dd if=original.dv of=second.dv bs=120000 skip=30 count=30"
.Pp
Get second 30 frames(NTSC).
.Pp
.Dl "cat second.dv first.dv | fwcontrol -S /dev/stdin"
.Pp
Swap first and second 30 frames and send them to DV recorder.
.Pp
For PAL, replace
.Dq Li bs=120000
with
.Dq Li bs=144000 .
.Pp
.Dl "fwcontrol -R file.m2t"
.Pp
Receive an MPEG TS stream from a camera producing MPEG transport stream.
This has been tested with SONY HDR-FX1E camera that produces HD MPEG-2
stream at 25 Mbps bandwidth.
.Pp
To send the stream from the camera over the network using TCP (which
surprisingly works better with vlc), you can use
.Dl "fwcontrol -R - | nc 192.168.10.11 9000"
with
.Nm netcat
from ports and to receive the stream, use
.Dl nc -l -p 9000 | vlc -
.Pp
To netcast via UDP, you need to use
.Nm buffer
program from ports, since vlc is not fast enough to read UDP packets from
buffers and thus it experiences dropouts when run directly.
The sending side can use
.Dl "fwcontrol -R - | nc 192.168.10.11 9000"
and to receive the stream, use
.Dl nc -l -u -p 9000 | buffer -s 10k -b 1000 -m 20m -p 5 | vlc -
.Pp
For more information on how to work with
.Nm vlc
see its docs.

.Sh HISTORY
The

utility first appeared in

(MPEG TS mode)
.Sh BUGS
This utility is still under development and provided for debugging purposes.
Especially MPEG TS reception support is very rudimental and supports only
high-bandwidth MPEG-2 streams (fn field in CIP header equals 3).
