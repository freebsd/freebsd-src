.Dt PNFSDSKILL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pnfsdskill
.Nd
disables a pNFS data storage server (DS)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Ar mounted-on-DS-dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command disables one DS when mirroring is enabled.
If one mirrored DS is malfunctioning, a system administrator
may use this command on the metadata server (MDS) to disable use of this mirror.
This command must be used on the MDS and the
.Ar mounted-on-DS-dir
must be the exact pathname used when mounting the DS on the MDS.
Normally this command will fail if there is no valid mirror for the DS
available.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
This option forces the DS to be disabled even if there is no valid mirror
for the DS available.
It should only be used to allow the
.Xr nfsd 8
threads to be terminated.
.El
.Pp
If this command fails with
.Dq Device not configured
(ENXIO), it probably
means that the DS has already been disabled due to an error either detected
by the MDS or reported to the MDS by a client.
.Pp
The pNFS service should continue to run normally so long as the number of
operational DSs is at least as many as the level of mirroring.
