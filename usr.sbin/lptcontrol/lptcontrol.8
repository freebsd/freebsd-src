.Sh NAME
.Nm lptcontrol
.Nd a utility for manipulating the lpt printer driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl e | i | p | s
.Op Fl d Ar control_device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to set either the interrupt-driven, extended, standard,
or polling mode of individual
.Xr lpt 4
devices.
When a printer is switched from
a mode to another, this change will only take effect
the next time the device is opened.
.Pp
Extended mode is anything the parallel port interface can support.
For an
ECP/ISA parallel port, it may be FIFO+DMA or ECP.
.Pp
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Turn on extended mode.
.It Fl i
Turn on interrupt-driven mode.
.It Fl p
Turn on polled mode.
.It Fl s
Turn on standard mode, i.e., turn off extended mode.
.It Fl d Ar control_device
Set the mode of the printer control device specified by
.Ar control_device .
The default value for
.Ar control_device
is
.Pa /dev/lpt0.ctl .
.El
.Pp
One of
.Fl e , i , p
or
.Fl s
must be specified.

The control device name should never have been an option,
but should have been an optional argument.
Because of this, a single argument is treated as a device name.
