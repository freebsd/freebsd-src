.Sh NAME
.Nm crashinfo
.Nd "analyze a core dump of the operating system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar crashdir
.Op Fl n Ar dumpnr
.Op Fl k Ar kernel
.Op Ar core
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility analyzes a core dump saved by
.Xr savecore 8 .
It generates a text file containing the analysis in the same directory as
the core dump.
For a given core dump file named
.Pa vmcore.XX
the generated text file will be named
.Pa core.txt.XX .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
analyzes the most recent core dump in the core dump directory.
A specific core dump may be specified via either the
.Ar core
or
.Ar dumpnr
arguments.
Once
.Nm
has located a core dump,
it analyzes the core dump to determine the exact version of the kernel
that generated the core.
It then looks for a matching kernel file under each of the subdirectories in
.Pa /boot .
The location of the kernel file can also be explicitly provided via the
.Ar kernel
argument.
.Pp
Once
.Nm
has located a core dump and kernel,
it uses several utilities to analyze the core including
.Xr dmesg 8 ,
.Xr fstat 1 ,
.Xr iostat 8 ,
.Xr ipcs 1 ,
.Xr kgdb 1 Pq Pa ports/devel/gdb ,
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr pstat 8 ,
and
.Xr vmstat 8 .
Note that kgdb must be installed from the devel/gdb port or gdb package.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Run in batch mode.
Write most messages to the
.Pa core.txt.XX
file instead of the terminal.
This flag is used when
.Nm
is run during boot.
.It Fl d Ar crashdir
Specify an alternate core dump directory.
The default crash dump directory is
.Pa /var/crash .
.It Fl n Ar dumpnr
Use the core dump saved in
.Pa vmcore. Ns Ar dumpnr
instead of the latest core in the core dump directory.
.It Fl k Ar kernel
Specify an explicit kernel file.
