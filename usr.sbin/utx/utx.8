.Sh NAME
.Nm utx
.Nd manage the user accounting database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm boot
.Nm
.Cm shutdown
.Nm
.Cm rm
.Ar identifier
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to perform operations on the user accounting
database, as done by
.Xr pututxline 3 .
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm shutdown"
.It Cm boot
Write a boot time record to the user accounting database.
This option should typically only be used by
.Xr rc 8 .
.It Cm shutdown
Write a shutdown time record to the user accounting database.
This option should typically only be used by
.Xr rc 8 .
.It Cm rm
Remove stale sessions from the user accounting
database, by referring to their
.Ar identifier .
Stale sessions can occur if a login service exits prematurely or fails
to remove the session from the accounting database.
.Pp
Utilities such as
.Xr w 1
will not display the identifier corresponding with a login session,
since its value is typically only of use by the process managing the
record.
The following command can be used to obtain all records from the user
accounting database's active session table, including its identifiers:
.Pp
.Dl getent utmpx active
.Pp
Identifiers can either be supplied in hexadecimal form as displayed by
.Xr getent 1 ,
or as a string if the identifier allows such a representation.
.El
.Pp
Because this utility requires write-access to the user accounting
database, its use is limited to the super-user.
