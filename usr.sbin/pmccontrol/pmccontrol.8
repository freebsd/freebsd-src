.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls the operation of the system's hardware performance
monitoring counters.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility processes options in command line order, so later options modify
the effect of earlier ones.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar cpu
Subsequent enable and disable options affect the CPU
denoted by argument
.Ar cpu .
The argument
.Ar cpu
is a number denoting a CPU in the system, or
.Dq Li * ,
denoting all unhalted CPUs in the system.
.It Fl d Ar pmc
Disable PMC number
.Ar pmc
on the CPU specified by
.Fl c ,
preventing it from being used till subsequently re-enabled.
The argument
.Ar pmc
is a number denoting a specific PMC, or
.Dq Li *
denoting all the PMCs on the specified CPU.
.Pp
Only idle PMCs may be disabled.
.\" XXX this probably needs to be fixed.
.It Fl e Ar pmc
Enable PMC number
.Ar pmc ,
on the CPU specified by
.Fl c ,
allowing it to be used in the future.
The argument
.Ar pmc
is a number denoting a specific PMC, or
.Dq Li *
denoting all the PMCs on the specified CPU.
If PMC
.Ar pmc
is already enabled, this option has no effect.
.It Fl l
List available hardware performance counters and their current
disposition.
.It Fl L
List available hardware performance counter classes and their
supported event names.
.It Fl s
Print driver statistics maintained by
.Xr hwpmc 4 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To disable all PMCs on all CPUs, use the command:
.Dl "pmccontrol -d*"
.Pp
To enable all PMCs on all CPUs, use:
.Dl "pmccontrol -e*"
.Pp
To disable PMCs 0 and 1 on CPU 2, use:
.Dl "pmccontrol -c2 -d0 -d1"
.Pp
To disable PMC 0 of CPU 0 only, and enable all other PMCS on all other
CPUs, use:
.Dl "pmccontrol -c* -e* -c0 -d0"
