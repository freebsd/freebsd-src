.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more
file systems.
The
.Nm quotaoff
utility announces to the system that the specified
file systems should have any disk quotas turned off.
The file systems specified must have entries in
.Pa /etc/fstab
and be mounted.
The
.Nm
utility expects each file system to have quota files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
By default both user and group quotas are enabled.

Available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
If supplied in place of any file system names,
.Nm Ns / Ns Nm quotaoff

.Pa /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are enabled.

.Pa /etc/fstab
should be enabled/disabled.
.It Fl u
