errors.
Specifically, it checks that every non-blank, non-comment
entry is composed of four colon-separated fields, that none of them
contains whitespace, and that the third field (the group ID) is
numeric.
It will also check for invalid characters in the group names
and group members.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
This option disables printing of text when the group format
is correct.
