.Nd get information about disk device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl t
.Ar disk ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints out information about a disk device,
and optionally runs a naive performance test on the device.
.Pp
If given no arguments, the output will be a single line per specified device
with the following fields: device name, sectorsize, media size in bytes,
media size in sectors, firmware cylinders, firmware heads, and firmware sectors.
The last three fields are only present if the information is available.
.Pp
If given the
.Fl v
option, the fields will be printed one per line with a descriptive comment.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option triggers a simple and rather naive benchmark of the disks seek
and transfer performance.
