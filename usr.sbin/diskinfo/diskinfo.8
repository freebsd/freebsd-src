.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm diskinfo
.Nd get information about disk device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl citSvw
.Ar disk ...
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Fl p
.Ar disk ...
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Fl s
.Ar disk ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints out information about a disk device,
and optionally runs a naive performance test on the device.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl v"
.It Fl v
Print fields one per line with a descriptive comment.
.It Fl c
Perform a simple measurement of the I/O read command overhead.
.It Fl i
Perform a simple IOPS benchmark.
.It Fl l
In case of
.Fl p
or
.Fl s
modes prepend each line of an output with a device name using a tab
character as a separator.
.It Fl p
Return the physical path of the disk.
This is a string that identifies the physical path to the disk in the
storage enclosure.
.It Fl s
Return the disk ident, usually the serial number.
.It Fl S
Perform synchronous random write test (ZFS SLOG test),
measuring time required to write data blocks of different size and
flush disk cache.
Blocks of more then 128KB are written with multiple parallel operations.
.It Fl t
Perform a simple and rather naive benchmark of the disks seek
and transfer performance.
.It Fl w
Allow disruptive write tests.
.El
.Pp
If given no arguments, the output will be a single line per specified device
with the following fields: device name, sectorsize, media size in bytes,
media size in sectors, stripe size, stripe offset, firmware cylinders,
firmware heads, and firmware sectors.
The last three fields are only present if the information is available.
.Sh EXAMPLES
List first ten (at most)
.Xr da 4
devices with corresponding serial numbers:
.Pp
.Dl diskinfo -ls /dev/da?
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr da 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 5.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Poul-Henning Kamp Aq Mt phk@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
There are in order of increasing severity: lies,
damn lies, statistics, and computer benchmarks.
