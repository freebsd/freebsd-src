			SENDMAIL RELEASE 8

This directory has the latest sendmail software from Berkeley.  See
doc/op/op.me for a summary of changes since 5.67.

Report any bugs to sendmail@CS.Berkeley.EDU.

The latest version of sendmail is kept on FTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU, directory
/ucb/sendmail; check there for the latest revision.


+--------------+
| MANUAL PAGES |
+--------------+

The sendmail manual pages use contemporary Berkeley troff macros.  If
your system does not process these manual pages, you can pick up the
new macros in a BSD Net/2 FTP site (e.g.  on FTP.UU.NET, the files
/systems/unix/bsd-sources/share/tmac/me/strip.sed and
/systems/unix/bsd-sources/share/tmac/*).

The strip.sed file is only used in installation.

After installation, edit tmac.doc and tmac.andoc to reflect the
installation path of the tmac files.  Those files contain pointers to
/usr/share/tmac/, and those pointers are not changed by the `make
install` process.

Rename the existing tmac.an to be tmac.an.old, and rename tmac.andoc
to be tmac.an.

tmac.an will choose between tmac.an.old, your old macros, or tmac.doc,
which are the new macros, so that both the new man pages and the
existing man pages will be translated properly.

I'm also told that the groff distribution from MIT has a tmac.doc
macro set that is compatible with these macros.

| RELATED DOCUMENTATION |

There are other files you should read.  Rooted in this directory are:

  CHANGES-R5-R8
	Describes changes between Release 5 and Release 8 of sendmail.
	There are some things that may behave somewhat differently.
	For example, the rules governing when :include: files will
	be read have been tightened up for security reasons.
  FAQ
	Answers to Frequently Asked Questions.
  KNOWNBUGS
	Known bugs in the current release.  I try to keep this up
	to date -- get the latest version from FTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU
	in /ucb/sendmail/KNOWNBUGS.
  RELEASE_NOTES
	A detailed description of the changes in each version.  This
	is quite long, but informative.
  src/READ_ME
	Details on compiling and installing sendmail.
  cf/README
	Details on configuring sendmail.
  doc/op/op.me
	The sendmail Installation & Operations Guide.  Be warned: if
	you are running this off on SunOS or some other system with an
	old version of -me, you need to add the following macro to the
	macros:

		.de sm
		\s-1\\$1\\s0\\$2
		..

	This sets a word in a smaller pointsize.

| RELATED RFCS |
+--------------+

There are several related RFCs that you may wish to read -- they are
available via anonymous FTP to several sites, including nic.ddn.mil
(directory rfc), ftp.nisc.sri.com (rfc), nis.nsf.net (RFC),
nisc.jvnc.net (rfc), venera.isi.edu (in-notes), and wuarchive.wustl.edu
(info/rfc).  They can also be retrieved via electronic mail by sending
email to one of:

	mail-server@nisc.sri.com
		Put "send rfcNNN" in message body
	nis-info@nis.nsf.net
		Put "send RFCnnn.TXT-1" in message body
	sendrfc@jvnc.net
		Put "RFCnnn" as Subject: line

Important RFCs for electronic mail are:

	RFC821	SMTP protocol
	RFC822	Mail header format
	RFC974	MX routing
	RFC976	UUCP mail format
	RFC1123	Host requirements (modifies 821, 822, and 974)
	RFC1413	Identification server
	RFC1341	MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
	RFC1344	Implications of MIME for Internet Mail Gateways

Other standards that may be of interest (but which are less directly
relevant to sendmail) are:

	RFC987	Mapping between RFC822 and X.400
	RFC1049	Content-Type header field (extension to RFC822)

Warning to AIX users: this version of sendmail does not implement
MB, MR, or MG DNS resource records, as defined as experiments in
RFC883.

| DATABASE ROUTINES |
+-------------------+

IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE NEW BERKELEY DB SOFTWARE:  ****  DO NOT  ****
use the version that was on the Net2 tape -- it has a number of
nefarious bugs that were bad enough when I got them; you shouldn't have
to go through the same thing.  Instead, get a new version via public
FTP from ftp.CS.Berkeley.EDU, file ucb/4bsd/db.tar.Z.  This software
is highly recommended; it gets rid of several stupid limits, it's much
faster, and the interface is nicer to animals and plants.  You will
also probably find that you have to add -I/where/you/put/db/include
to the sendmail makefile to get db.h to work properly.

Be sure you remove ndbm.h and ndbm.o from the db distribution.  These
will cause problems with sendmail because sendmail already understands
about NEWDB and NDBM coexisting.


+-------------+
| USE WITH MH |
+-------------+

This version of sendmail notices and reports certain kinds of SMTP
protocol violations that were ignored by older versions.  If you
are running MH you may wish to install the patch in contrib/mh.patch
that will prevent these warning reports.  This patch also works
with the old version of sendmail, so it's safe to go ahead and
install it.


+-----------+
| MAKEFILES |
+-----------+

The Makefiles in this release use the new Berkeley "make" that is
available in BSD Net/2 and 4.4BSD.  If you are using this version
of make, you may notice one or two places where the Makefile includes
"../../Makefile.inc".  This file is not included with the sendmail
distribution because it's not part of sendmail.  However, it is,
in toto:

	#	@(#)Makefile.inc	8.1 (Berkeley) 6/6/93

	BINDIR?=	/usr/sbin

The other directories should all have Makefile.dist files that work
on the old make, albeit without all the niceties included.

You can also get a new Berkeley make from the Net2 release (available
on many public FTP archives).  This version should also interpret old
Makefiles, so you could drop it in as your default make.

For more details, see src/READ_ME.

| DIRECTORY STRUCTURE |
+---------------------+

The structure of this directory tree is:

cf		Source for Berkeley configuration files.  These are
		different than what you've seen before.  They are a
		fairly dramatic rewrite, requiring the new sendmail
		(since they use new features).
contrib		Some contributed tools to help with sendmail.  THESE
		ARE NOT SUPPORTED by Berkeley -- contact the original
		authors if you have problems.  (This directory is not
		on the 4.4BSD tape.)
doc		Documentation.  If you are getting source, read
		op.me -- it's long, but worth it.
mailstats	Statistics printing program.  It has the pathname of
		sendmail.st compiled in, so if you've changed that,
		beware.  This isn't all that useful.
makemap		A program that creates the keyed maps used by the $( ... $)
		construct in sendmail.  It is primitive but effective.
		It takes a very simple input format, so you will probably
		expect to preprocess must human-convenient formats
		using sed scripts before this program will like them.
		But it should be functionally complete.
praliases	A program to print the DBM version of the aliases file.
		It hasn't been converted to understand the new Berkeley
		DB format (which we are using).
rmail		Source for rmail(8).  This is used as a delivery
		agent for for UUCP, and could presumably be used by
		other non-socket oriented mailers.  Older versions of
		rmail are probably deficient.
src		Source for the sendmail program itself.
test		Some test scripts (currently only for compilation aids).
