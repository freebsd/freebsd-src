The FAQ is no longer maintained with the sendmail release.  It is
posted regularly to comp.mail.sendmail, comp.mail.misc, comp.mail.smail,
comp.answers, and news.answers, and can be obtained via anonymous FTP
from ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/sendmail-faq.
If you do not have access to anonymous FTP, you can retrieve it by
sending email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the command "send
usenet/news.answers/mail/sendmail-faq" in the message.

An HTML version is also available at http://www.sendmail.org/faq.
