		NEW SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION FILES

		Eric Allman <eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU>

		@(#)README	8.3 (Berkeley) 7/13/93


This document describes the sendmail configuration files being used
at Berkeley.  These use features in the new (R6) sendmail, and although
there is an ``OLDSENDMAIL'' mode, they haven't really been tested on
old versions of sendmail and cannot be expected to work well.

These configuration files are probably not as general as previous
versions, and don't handle as many of the wierd cases automagically.
I was able to simplify by them for two reasons.  First, the network
has become more consistent -- for example, at this point, everyone
on the internet is supposed to be running a name server, so hacks to
handle NIC-registered hosts can go away.  Second, I assumed that a
subdomain would be running SMTP internally -- UUCP is presumed to be
a long-haul protocol.  I realize that this is not universal, but it
does describe the vast majority of sites with which I am familiar,
including those outside the US.

Of course, the downside of this is that if you do live in a wierd
world, things are going to get wierder for you.  I'm sorry about that,
but at the time we at Berkeley had a problem, and it seemed like the
right thing to do.

This package requires a post-V7 version of m4; if you are running the
4.2bsd, SysV.2, or 7th Edition version, I suggest finding a friend with
a newer version.  You can m4-expand on their system, then run locally.
SunOS's /usr/5bin/m4 or BSD-Net/2's m4 both work.  GNU m4 (which is a
language unto itself) also works, but I don't intend to work so hard
to keep this up in the future.  [Note to GNU folks:  the construct
"define(`FOO')" should work without my having to add a null value.]

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BERKELEY MAKE, don't despair!  Just run
"m4 foo.mc > foo.cf" -- that should be all you need.

To get started, you may want to look at tcpproto.mc (for TCP-only
sites) and uucpproto.m4 (for UUCP-only sites).  Others are versions
that we use at Berkeley, although not all are in current use.  For
example, ucbarpa has gone away, but I've left ucbarpa.mc in because
it demonstrates some interesting techniques.

I'm not pretending that this README describes everything that these
configuration files can do; clever people can probably tweak them
to great effect.  But it should get you started.


+--------------------------+
| INTRODUCTION AND EXAMPLE |
+--------------------------+

Configuration files are contained in the subdirectory "cf", with a
suffix ".mc".  They must be run through "m4" to produce a ".cf" file.

Let's examine a typical .mc file (cf/cs-exposed.mc):

	divert(-1)

	# WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
	#

The divert(-1) will delete the crud in the resulting output file.
The copyright notice is what your lawyers require.  Our lawyers require
the one that I've included in my files. A copyleft is a copyright by
another name.

The next line MUST be

	include(`../m4/cf.m4')

This will pull in the M4 macros you will need to make sense of
everything else.  As the saying goes, don't think about it, just
do it.  If you don't do it, don't bother reading the rest of this
file.

	VERSIONID(`<SCCS or RCS version id>')

VERSIONID is a macro that stuffs the version information into the
resulting file.  We use SCCS; you could use RCS, something else, or
omit it completely.  This is not the same as the version id included
in SMTP greeting messages -- this is defined in m4/version.m4.

	DOMAIN(cs.exposed)

This example exposes the host inside of the CS subdomain -- that is,
it doesn't try to hide the name of the workstation to the outside
world.  Changing this to DOMAIN(cs.hidden) would have made outgoing
messages refer to "<username>@CS.Berkeley.EDU" instead of using the
local hostname.  Internaly this is effected by using
"MASQUERADE_AS(CS.Berkeley.EDU)".

	MAILER(smtp)

These describe the mailers used at the default CS site site.  The
local mailer is always included automatically.


+--------+
| OSTYPE |
+--------+

Note that cf/cs-exposed.mc omits an OSTYPE macro -- this assumes
default Computer Science Division environment.  There are several
explicit environments available: bsd4.3, bsd4.4, hpux, irix, osf1,
riscos4.5, sunos3.5, sunos4.1, and ultrix4.1.  These change things
like the location of the alias file and queue directory.  Some of
these files are identical to one another.

Operating system definitions are easy to write.  They may define
the following variables (everything defaults, so an ostype file
may be empty).

ALIAS_FILE		[/etc/aliases] The location of the text version
			of the alias file(s).  It can be a comma-separated
			list of names.
HELP_FILE		[/usr/lib/sendmail.hf] The name of the file
			containing information printed in response to
			the SMTP HELP command.
QUEUE_DIR		[/var/spool/mqueue] The directory containing
			queue files.
STATUS_FILE		[/etc/sendmail.st] The file containing status
			information.
LOCAL_MAILER_PATH	[/usr/libexec/mail.local] The program used to 
			deliver local mail.
LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS	[rn] The flags used by the local mailer.  The
			flags lsDFMm are always included.
LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS	[mail -d $u] The arguments passed to deliver local
			mail.
LOCAL_SHELL_PATH	[/bin/sh] The shell used to deliver piped email.
LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS	[eu] The flags used by the shell mailer.  The
			flags lsDFM are always included.
LOCAL_SHELL_ARGS	[sh -c $u] The arguments passed to deliver "prog"
			mail.
USENET_MAILER_PATH	[/usr/lib/news/inews] The name of the program
			used to submit news.
USENET_MAILER_FLAGS	[rlsDFMmn] The mailer flags for the usenet mailer.
USENET_MAILER_ARGS	[-m -h -n] The command line arguments for the
			usenet mailer.
SMTP_MAILER_FLAGS	[undefined] Flags added to SMTP mailer.
UUCP_MAILER_FLAGS	[undefined] Flags added to UUCP mailer.
UUCP_MAILER_ARGS	[uux - -r -z -a$f -gC $h!rmail ($u)] The arguments
			passed to the UUCP mailer.
UUCP_MAX_SIZE		[100000] The maximum size message accepted for
			transmission by the UUCP mailers.
HOSTMAP_SPEC		[dbm -o /etc/hostmap] The value for the builtin
			hostmap key definition.  You can redefine this
			to change the class, flags, and filename of
			the hostmap.  The default flag (-o) makes this
			map optional.

In addition, the following boolean flags may be defined -- the value
is ignored.

NEED_DOMAIN		If set, the $j macro is defined as $w.$D.
			If not set, $j is defined as $w.  If this is
			set, the domain must be defined using the line
			DD<domainname> (probably in the domain file,
			but possibly in the .mc file).  You will only
			need this if you define your system hostname
			without a domain (type "hostname" -- if it
			has no dots in the output, you qualify) AND
			if you are not running the nameserver AND if
			the first (canonical) name in /etc/hosts for
			your machine has no domain -- OR if you are
			running Ultrix or OSF/1 sendmail.  Either of
			these is probably a mistake.

+---------+
| DOMAINS |
+---------+

You will probably want to collect domain-dependent defines into one
file, referenced by the DOMAIN macro.  For example, our Berkeley
domain file includes definitions for several internal distinguished
hosts:

UUCP_RELAY	The host that will forward UUCP-addressed email.
		If not defined, all UUCP sites must be directly
		connected.
BITNET_RELAY	The host that will forward BITNET-addressed email.
		If not defined, the .BITNET pseudo-domain won't work.
CSNET_RELAY	The host that will forward CSNET-addressed email.
		If not defined, the .CSNET pseudo-domain won't work.
LOCAL_RELAY	The site that will handle unqualified names -- that
		is, names with out an @domain extension.  If not set,
		they are assumed to belong on this machine.  This
		allows you to have a central site to store a
		company- or department-wide alias database.  This
		only works at small sites, and there are better
		methods.

The domain file can also be used to define a domain name, if needed
(using "DD<domain>") and set certain site-wide features.  If all hosts
at your site masquerade behind one email name, you could also use
MASQUERADE_AS here.

You do not have to define a domain -- in particular, if you are a
single machine sitting off somewhere, it is probably more work than
it's worth.  This is just a mechanism for combining "domain dependent
knowledge" into one place.

+---------+
| MAILERS |
+---------+

There are fewer mailers supported in this version than the previous
version, owing mostly to a simpler world.

local		The local and prog mailers.  You will almost always
		need these; the only exception is if you relay ALL
		your mail to another site.  This mailer is included
		automatically.

smtp		The Simple Mail Transport Protocol mailer.  This does
		not hide hosts behind a gateway or another other
		such hack; it assumes a world where everyone is
		running the name server.  This file actually defines
		three mailers: "smtp" for regular (old-style) SMTP to
		other servers, "esmtp" for extended SMTP to other
		servers, and "relay" for transmission to our
		RELAY_HOST or MAILER_HUB.

uucp		The Unix-to-Unix Copy Program mailer.  Actually, this
		defines two mailers, "uucp" and "suucp".  The latter
		is for when you know that the UUCP mailer at the other
		end can handle multiple recipients in one transfer.
		When you invoke this, sendmail looks for all names in
		the $=U class and sends them to the uucp mailer; all
		names in the $=Y class are sent to suucp.  Note that
		this is a function of what version of rmail runs on
		the receiving end, and hence may be out of your control.

usenet		Usenet (network news) delivery.  If this is specified,
		an extra rule is added to ruleset 0 that forwards all
		local email for users named ``group.usenet'' to the
		``inews'' program.  Note that this works for all groups,
		and may be considered a security problem.

fax		Facsimile transmission.  This is experimental and based
		on Sam Leffler's FlexFAX software.  For more information,
		see below.


+----------+
| FEATURES |
+----------+

Special features can be requested using the "FEATURE" macro.  For
example, the .mc line:

	FEATURE(use_cw_file)

tells sendmail that you want to have it read an /etc/sendmail.cw
file to get values for class $=w.  The FEATURE may contain a single
optional parameter -- for example:

	FEATURE(mailertable, dbm /usr/lib/mailertable)

Available features are:

use_cw_file	Read the file /etc/sendmail.cw file to get alternate
		names for this host.  This might be used if you were
		on a host that MXed for a dynamic set of other
		hosts.  If the set is static, just including the line
		"Cw<name1> <name2> ..." is probably superior.
		The actual filename can be overridden by redefining
		confCW_FILE.
redirect	Reject all mail addressed to "address.REDIRECT" with
		a ``551 User not local; please try <address>'' message.
		If this is set, you can alias people who have left
		to their new address with ".REDIRECT" appended.
nouucp		Don't do anything special with UUCP addresses at all.
nocanonify	Don't pass addresses to $[ ... $] for canonification.
		This would generally only be used by sites that only
		act as mail gateways or which have user agents that do
		full canonification themselves.
notsticky	By default, email sent to "user@local.host" are marked
		as "sticky" -- that is, the local addresses aren't
		matched against UDB and don't go through ruleset 5.
		This features disables this treatment.  It would
		normally be used on network gateway machines.
mailertable	Include a "mailer table" which can be used to override
		routing for particular domains.  The argument of the
		FEATURE may be the key definition.  If none is specified,
		the definition used is:
			hash /etc/mailertable -o
		Keys in this database are fully qualified domain names
		or partial domains preceded by a dot -- for example,
		"vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU" or ".CS.Berkeley.EDU".
		Values must be of the form:
			mailer:domain
		where "mailer" is the internal mailer name, and "domain"
		is where to send the message.  These maps are not
		reflected into the message header.
domaintable	Include a "domain table" which can be used to provide
		full domains on unqualified (single word) hosts.  The
		argument of the FEATURE may be the key definition.  If
		none is specified, the definition used is:
			hash /etc/domaintable -o
		The key in this table is the unqualified host name; the
		value is the fully qualified domain.  Anything in the
		domaintable is reflected into headers; that is, this
		is done in ruleset 3.
bitdomain	Look up bitnet hosts in a table to try to turn them into
		internet addresses.  The table can be built using the
		bitdomain program contributed by John Gardiner Meyers.
		The argument of the FEATURE may be the key definition; if
		none is specified, the definition used is:
			hash /etc/bitdomain.db -o
		Keys are the bitnet hostname; values are the corresponding
		internet hostname.
uucpdomain	Similar feature for UUCP hosts.  The default map definition
		is:
			hash /etc/uudomain.db -o
		At the moment there is no automagic tool to build this
		database.
always_add_domain
		Include the local host domain even on locally delivered
		mail.  Normally it is not added unless it is already
		present.
allmasquerade	If masquerading is enabled (using MASQUERADE_AS), this
		feature will cause recipient addresses to also masquerade
		as being from the masquerade host.  Normally they get
		the local hostname.  Although this may be right for
		ordinary users, it can break local aliases.  For example,
		if you send to "localalias", the originating sendmail will
		find that alias and send to all members, but send the
		message with "To: localalias@masqueradehost".  Since that
		alias likely does not exist, replies will fail.  Use this
		feature ONLY if you can guarantee that the ENTIRE
		namespace on your masquerade host supersets all the
		local entries.

Other FEATUREs should be defined, but I was trying to keep these
config files fairly lean and mean.


+-------+
| HACKS |
+-------+

Some things just can't be called features.  To make this clear,
they go in the hack subdirectory and are referenced using the HACK
macro.  These will tend to be site-dependent.  The release
includes the Berkeley-dependent "cssubdomain" hack (that makes
sendmail accept local names in either Berkeley.EDU or CS.Berkeley.EDU;
this is intended as a short-term aid while we move hosts into
subdomains.


+--------------------+
| SITE CONFIGURATION |
+--------------------+

Complex sites will need more local configuration information, such as
lists of UUCP hosts they speak with directly.  This can get a bit more
tricky.  For an example of a "complex" site, see cf/ucbvax.mc.

The SITECONFIG macro allows you to indirectly reference site-dependent
configuration information stored in the siteconfig subdirectory.  For
example, the line

	SITECONFIG(uucp.ucbvax, ucbvax, U)

reads the file uucp.ucbvax for local connection information.  The
second parameter is the local name (in this case just "ucbvax" since
it is locally connected, and hence a UUCP hostname) and the name of
the class in which to store the host information.  Another SITECONFIG
line reads

	SITECONFIG(uucp.ucbarpa, ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU, W)

This says that the file uucp.ucbarpa contains the list of UUCP sites
connected to ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU.  The $=W class will be used to
store this list.  [The machine ucbarpa is gone now, but I've left
this out-of-date configuration file around to demonstrate how you
might do this.]

The siteconfig file (e.g., siteconfig/uucp.ucbvax.m4) contains nothing
more than a sequence of SITE macros describing connectivity.  For
example:

	SITE(cnmat)
	SITE(sgi olympus)

The second example demonstrates that you can use two names on the
same line; these are usually aliases for the same host (or are at
least in the same company).


+-------------------+
| TWEAKING RULESETS |
+-------------------+

For more complex configurations, you can define special rules.
The macro LOCAL_RULE_3 introduces rules that are used in canonicalizing
the names.  Any modifications made here are reflected in the header.

A common use is to convert old UUCP addreses to SMTP addresses using
the UUCPSMTP macro.  For example:

	LOCAL_RULE_3
	UUCPSMTP(decvax,	decvax.dec.com)
	UUCPSMTP(research,	research.att.com)

will cause addresses of the form "decvax!user" and "research!user"
to be converted to "user@decvax.dec.com" and "user@research.att.com"
respectively.

This could also be used to look hosts in a database map:

	LOCAL_RULE_3
	R$* < @ $+ > $*		$: $1 < @ $(hostmap $2 $) > $3

This map would be defined in the LOCAL_CONFIG portion, as shown below.

Similarly, LOCAL_RULE_0 can be used to introduce new parsing rules.
For example, new rules are needed to parse hostnames that you accept
via MX records.  For example, you might have:

	LOCAL_RULE_0
	R$+ < @ cnmat.Berkeley.EDU >	$#uucp $@ cnmat $: $1

You would use this if you had installed an MX record for cnmat.Berkeley.EDU
pointing at this host; this rule catches the message and forwards it on
using UUCP.

You can also tweak rulesets 1 and 2 using LOCAL_RULE_1 and LOCAL_RULE_2.
These rulesets are normally empty.

A similar macro is LOCAL_CONFIG.  This introduces lines added after the
boilerplate option setting but before rulesets, and can be used to
declare local database maps or whatever.  For example:

	LOCAL_CONFIG
	Khostmap hash /etc/hostmap.db
	Kyplocal nis -m hosts.byname


+---------------------------+
| MASQUERADING AND RELAYING |
+---------------------------+

You can have your host masquerade as another using

	MASQUERADE_AS(host.domain)

This causes outgoing SMTP mail to be labelled as coming from the
indicated domain, rather than $j.  One normally masquerades as one
of your own subdomains (for example, it's unlikely that I would
choose to masquerade as an MIT site).

there are always users that need to be "exposed" -- that is, their
internal site name should be displayed instead of the masquerade name.
Root is an example.  You can add users to this list using

	EXPOSED_USER(usernames)

This adds users to class E; you could also use something like

	FE/etc/sendmail.cE

You can also arrange to relay all unqualified names (that is, names
without @host) to a relay host.  For example, if you have a central
email server, you might relay to that host so that users don't have
to have .forward files or aliases.  You can do this using

	define(`LOCAL_RELAY', mailer:hostname)

The ``mailer:'' can be omitted, in which case the mailer defaults to
"smtp".  There are some user names that you don't want relayed, perhaps
because of local aliases.  A common example is root, which may be
locally aliased.  You can add entries to this list using

	LOCAL_USER(usernames)

This adds users to class L; you could also use something like

	FL/etc/sendmail.cL

If you want all mail sent to a centralized hub, as for a shared
/var/spool/mail scheme, use

	define(`MAIL_HUB', mailer:hostname)

Again, ``mailer:'' defaults to "smtp".  If you define both LOCAL_RELAY
and MAIL_HUB, unqualified names and names in class L will be sent to
the LOCAL_RELAY and other local names will be sent to MAIL_HUB.  For
example, if are on machine mastodon.CS.Berkeley.EDU, the following
combinations of settings will have the indicated effects:

email sent to....	eric			  eric@mastodon.CS.Berkeley.EDU

LOCAL_RELAY set to	mail.CS.Berkeley.EDU	  (delivered locally)
mail.CS.Berkeley.EDU

MAIL_HUB set to		mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU	  mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU
mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU

Both LOCAL_RELAY and	mail.CS.Berkeley.EDU	  mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU
MAIL_HUB set as above


+-------------------------------+
| NON-SMTP BASED CONFIGURATIONS |
+-------------------------------+

These configuration files are designed primarily for use by SMTP-based
sites.  I don't pretend that they are well tuned for UUCP-only or
UUCP-primarily nodes (the latter is defined as a small local net
connected to the rest of the world via UUCP).  However, there is one
hook to handle some special cases.

You can define a ``smart host'' that understands a richer address syntax
using:

	define(`SMART_HOST', mailer:hostname)

In this case, the ``mailer:'' defaults to "suucp".  Any messages that
can't be handled using the usual UUCP rules are passed to this host.

If you are on a local SMTP-based net that connects to the outside
world via UUCP, you can use LOCAL_NET_CONFIG to add appropriate rules.
For example:

	define(`SMART_HOST', suucp:uunet)
	LOCAL_NET_CONFIG
	R$* < @ $* .$m. > $*	$#smtp $@ $2.$m. $: $1 < @ $2.$m. > $3

This will cause all names that end in your domain name ($m) via
SMTP; anything else will be sent via suucp (smart UUCP) to uunet.
If you have FEATURE(nocanonify), you may need to omit the dots after
the $m.  If you are running a local DNS inside your domain which is
not otherwise connected to the outside world, you probably want to
use:

	define(`SMART_HOST', smtp:fire.wall.com)
	LOCAL_NET_CONFIG
	R$* < @ $* . > $*	$#smtp $@ $2. $: $1 < @ $2. > $3

That is, send directly only to things you found in your DNS lookup;
anything else goes through SMART_HOST.


+------------------+
| FlexFAX SOFTWARE |
+------------------+

Sam Leffler's FlexFAX software is still in beta test -- but he expects a
public version out "later this week" [as of 3/1/93].  The following
blurb is direct from Sam:

	$Header: /a/cvs/386BSD/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/README,v 1.4 1993/08/09 11:22:56 rgrimes Exp $

	How To Obtain This Software (in case all you get is this file)

	The source code is available for public ftp on
	    sgi.com			sgi/fax/v2.1beta.tar.Z
		(192.48.153.1)

	You can also obtain inst'able images for Silicon Graphics machines from
	    sgi.com			sgi/fax/v2.1beta.inst.tar
		(192.48.153.1)

	For example,
	    % ftp -n sgi.com
	    ....
	    ftp> user anonymous
	    ... <type in password>
	    ftp> cd sgi/fax
	    ftp> binary
	    ftp> get v2.1beta.tar.Z

	If you cannot use FTP at all, there is a service called "ftpmail"
	available from gateekeeper.dec.com:  you can send e-mail to this
	machine and it will use FTP to retrieve files for you and send you the
	files back again via e-mail.  To find out more about the ftpmail
	service, send a message to "ftpmail@gatekeeper.dec.com" whose body
	consists of the single line "help".

	Internal to Silicon Graphics there are inst'able images on the host
	flake.asd in the directory /d/dist.  Thus you can do something like:

	    % inst -f flake.asd.sgi.com:/d/dist/flexfax

	to install the software on your machine.

	The external distributions come in a compressed or uncompressed tar
	file.  To extract the source distribution:

	    % zcat v2.1beta.tar.Z | tar xf -

	(uncompress and extract individual files in current directory).  To
	unpack and install the client portion of the inst'able distribution:

	    % mkdir dist
	    % cd dist; tar xf ../v2.1beta.inst.tar; cd ..
	    % inst -f dist/flexfax
	    ...
	    inst> go

	(Note, the dist subdirectory is because some versions of inst fail if
	the files are in the current directory.) Server binaries is also
	included in the inst'able images as flexfax.server.*.  It is not
	installed by default, so to get it also you need to extract the do:

	    % inst -f flexfax
	    ...
	    inst> install flexfax.server.*
	    inst> go

	The SGI binaries were built for Version 4.0.5 of the IRIX operating
	system.  They should work w/o problem on earlier versions of the
	system, but I have not fully tested this.  Also, note that to install a
	server on an SGI machine, you need to have installed the Display
	PostScript execution environment product (dps_eoe).  Otherwise, the fax
	server will not be able to convert PostScript to facsimile for
	transmission.

	If you are working from the source distribution, look at the file README
	in the top of the source tree.  If you are working from the inst images,
	you need to run faxaddmodem to setup and configure your fax modem.  Do
	man faxaddmodem for more information.

Also from Sam:

	A mailing list for users of this software is located on sgi.com.
	If you want to join this mailing list or have a list-related request
	such as getting your name removed from it, send a request to

	    flexfax-request@sgi.com

	Submissions (including bug reports) should be directed to:

	    flexfax@sgi.com


+--------------------------------+
| TWEAKING CONFIGURATION OPTIONS |
+--------------------------------+

There are a large number of configuration options that don't normally
need to be changed.  However, if you feel you need to tweak them, you
can define the following M4 variables.  This list is shown in four
columns:  the name you define, the default value for that definition,
the option or macro that is affected (either Ox for an option or Dx
for a macro), and a brief description.  Greater detail of the semantics
can be found in the Installation and Operations Guide.

Some options are likely to be deprecated in future versions -- that is,
the option is only included to provide back-compatibility.  These are
marked with "*".

| HIERARCHY |
+-----------+

Within this directory are several subdirectories, to wit:

m4		General support routines.  These are typically
		very important and should not be changed without
		very careful consideration.

cf		The configuration files themselves.  They have
		".mc" suffixes, and must be run through m4 to
		become complete.  The resulting output should
		have a ".cf" suffix.

ostype		Definitions describing a particular operating
		system type.  These should always be referenced
		using the OSTYPE macro in the .mc file.  Examples
		include "bsd4.3", "bsd4.4", "sunos3.5", and
		"sunos4.1".

domain		Definitions describing a particular domain, referenced
		using the DOMAIN macro in the .mc file.  These are
		site dependent; for example, we contribute "cs.exposed.m4"
		and "cs.hidden.m4" which both describe hosts in the
		CS.Berkeley.EDU subdomain; the former displays the local
		hostname (e.g., mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU), whereas the
		latter does its best to hide the identity of the local
		workstation inside the CS subdomain.

mailer		Descriptions of mailers.   These are referenced using
		the MAILER macro in the .mc file.

sh		Shell files used when building the .cf file from the
		.mc file in the cf subdirectory.

feature		These hold special orthogonal features that you might
		want to include.  They should be referenced using
		the FEATURE macro.

hack		Local hacks.  These can be referenced using the HACK
		macro.  They shouldn't be of more than voyeuristic
		interest outside the .Berkeley.EDU domain, but who knows?
		We've all got our own peccadilloes.

siteconfig	Site configuration -- e.g., tables of locally connected
		UUCP sites.

The following sections detail usage of certain internal parts of the
sendmail.cf file.  Read them carefully if you are trying to modify
the current model.  If you find the above descriptions adequate, these
