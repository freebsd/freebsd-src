.Nm iostat
.Nd report
.Tn I/O

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl CdhIKoTxz
.Op Fl c Ar count
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl n Ar devs
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Oo
.Fl t
.Sm off
.Ar type , if , pass
.Sm on
.Oc
.Op Fl w Ar wait
.Op Ar drives
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays kernel
.Tn I/O
statistics on terminal, device and cpu operations.
The first statistics that are printed are averaged over the system uptime
(unless
.Fl I
is specified).
Any references to repetitions in this man page implicitly include the first
statistics output.
To get information about the current activity, a suitable wait time should
be specified, so that the subsequent sets of printed statistics will be
averaged over that time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl C
Display CPU statistics.
This is on by default, unless
.Fl d
or
.Fl x
is specified.
.It Fl c
Repeat the display
.Ar count
times.
If
.Fl c
is not specified and a wait interval is specified,
the default repeat count is infinity.
If no wait interval is specified, the default repeat count is 1.
.It Fl d
Display only device statistics.
If this flag is turned on, only device statistics will be displayed, unless
.Fl C
or
.Fl T
is also specified to enable the display of CPU or TTY statistics.
.It Fl h
Put
.Nm
in
.Sq top
mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will show devices in order from highest to lowest bytes
per measurement cycle.
.It Fl I
Display total statistics for a given time period, rather than average
statistics for each second during that time period.
.It Fl K
In the old-style blocks transferred display
.Po Fl I
and
.Fl o Pc ,
display block count in kilobytes rather than the device native block size.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Dq Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default
.Dq Pa /boot/kernel/kernel .
.It Fl n
Display up to
.Ar devs
number of devices.
The
.Nm
utility will display fewer devices if there are less than
.Ar devs
devices present.
.It Fl o
Display old-style
.Nm
device statistics.
Sectors per second, transfers per second, and milliseconds per seek are
displayed.
If
.Fl I
is specified, total blocks/sectors, total transfers, and
milliseconds per seek are displayed.
.It Fl T
Display TTY statistics.
This is on by default, unless
.Fl d
or
.Fl x
is specified.
.It Fl t
Specify which types of devices to display.
There are three different categories of devices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It device type:
.Bl -tag -width 9n -compact
.It da
Direct Access devices
.It sa
Sequential Access devices
.It printer
Printers
.It proc
Processor devices
.It worm
Write Once Read Multiple devices
.It cd
CD devices
.It scanner
Scanner devices
.It optical
Optical Memory devices
.It changer
Medium Changer devices
.It comm
Communication devices
.It array
Storage Array devices
.It enclosure
Enclosure Services devices
.It floppy
Floppy devices
.El
.Pp
.It interface:
.Bl -tag -width 9n -compact
.It IDE
Integrated Drive Electronics devices
.It SCSI
Small Computer System Interface devices
.It NVME
NVM Express Interface devices
.It other
Any other device interface
.El
.Pp
.It passthrough:
.Bl -tag -width 9n -compact
.It pass
Passthrough devices
.El
.El
.Pp
The user must specify at least one device type, and may specify at most
one device type from each category.
Multiple device types in a single device type statement must be separated by
commas and are ANDed together.
.Pp
Any number of
.Fl t
arguments may be specified on the command line.
All
.Fl t
arguments are ORed together to form a matching expression against which
all devices in the system are compared.
Any device that fully matches any
.Fl t
argument will be included in the
.Nm
output, up to the number of devices that can be displayed in
80 columns, or the maximum number of devices
.Pq Fl n
specified by the user.
.It Fl w
Pause
.Ar wait
seconds between each display.
If
.Fl w
is not specified, the default interval is 1 second.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command will accept and honor a non-integer number of seconds.
Note that the interval only has millisecond granularity.
Finer values will be truncated.
E.g.,
.Dq Li -w1.0001
is the same as
.Dq Li -w1.000 .
The interval will also suffer from modifications to
.Va kern.hz
so your mileage may vary.
.It Fl x
Show extended disk statistics.
Each disk is displayed on a line of its own with all available statistics.
If this flag is turned on, only disk statistics will be displayed, unless
.Fl C
or
.Fl T
is also specified to enable the display of CPU or TTY statistics.
.It Fl z
If
.Fl x
is specified, omit lines for devices with no activity.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility displays its information in the following format:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It tty
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It tin
characters read from terminals
.It tout
characters written to terminals
.El
.It devices
Device operations.
The header of the field is the device name and unit number.
The
.Nm
utility
will display as many devices as will fit in a standard 80 column screen, or
the maximum number of devices in the system, whichever is smaller.
If
.Fl n
is specified on the command line,
.Nm
will display the smaller of the
requested number of devices, and the maximum number of devices in the system.
To force
.Nm
to display specific drives, their names may be supplied on the command
line.
The
.Nm
utility
will not display more devices than will fit in an 80 column screen, unless
the
.Fl n
argument is given on the command line to specify a maximum number of
devices to display.
If fewer devices are specified on the command line than will fit in an 80
column screen,
.Nm
will show only the specified devices.
.Pp
The standard
.Nm
device display shows the following statistics:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It KB/t
kilobytes per transfer
.It tps
transfers per second
.It MB/s

.Sh BUGS
The use of
.Nm
as a debugging tool for crash dumps is probably limited because there is
currently no way to get statistics that only cover the time immediately before
the crash.
.Pp
Each
.Ar drives
argument is passed to
.Fn isdigit .
If
.Fn isdigit
returns true,
.Nm
switches into an undocumented traditional syntax and subsequent arguments,
if any, will not be interpreted as drive names.
This behavior collides with the one documented in this man page and prevents
specifying drive names starting with a number.
E.g., the following
.Bd -literal -offset indent
iostat ada0 ada1 2 3 cd0
.Ed
.Pp
This document's use of
.Dq device type
is misleading.
