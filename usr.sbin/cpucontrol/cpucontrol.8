.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to read and write arbitrary machine-specific
CPU registers via the
.Xr cpuctl 4
special device.
It can also be used to apply CPU firmware updates.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar datadir
Where to look for microcode images.
The option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl m Ar msr Ns Op = Ns Ar value
Show value of the specified MSR.
MSR register number should be given as a hexadecimal number.
.It Fl m Ar msr Ns = Ns Ar value
Store the
.Ar value
in the specified MSR register.
The
.Ar value
argument can be prefixed with ~ operator.
In this case the inverted value of argument will be stored in the register.
.It Fl m Ar msr Ns &= Ns Ar mask
Store the result of bitwise AND operation between
.Ar mask
and the current MSR value in the MSR register.
The
.Ar mask
argument can be prefixed with ~ operator.
In this case the inverted value of mask will be used.
.It Fl m Ar msr Ns |= Ns Ar mask
Store the result of bitwise OR operation between
.Ar mask
and the current MSR value in the MSR register.
The
.Ar mask
argument can be prefixed with ~ operator.
In this case the inverted value of mask will be used.
.It Fl i Ar level
Retrieve CPUID info.
Level should be given as a hex number.
.It Fl i Ar level,level_type
Retrieve CPUID info.
Level and level_type should be given as hex numbers.
.It Fl u
Apply CPU firmware updates.
The
.Nm
utility will walk through the configured data directories
and apply all firmware updates available for this CPU.
.It Fl v
Increase the verbosity level.
.It Fl h
Show help message.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -m 0x10 /dev/cpuctl0"
.Pp
will read the contents of TSC MSR from CPU 0.
.Pp
To set the CPU 0 TSC MSR register value to 0x1 issue
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -m 0x10=0x1 /dev/cpuctl0" .
.Pp
The following command will clear the second bit of TSC register:
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -m 0x10&=~0x02 /dev/cpuctl0" .
.Pp
The following command will set the forth and second bit of TSC register:
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -m 0x10|=0x0a /dev/cpuctl0" .
.Pp
The command
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -i 0x1 /dev/cpuctl1"
.Pp
will retrieve the CPUID level 0x1 from CPU 1.
.Pp
To perform firmware updates on CPU 0 from images located at
.Pa /usr/local/share/cpuctl/
use the following command:
.Pp
.Dq Li "cpucontrol -d /usr/local/share/cpuctl/ -u /dev/cpuctl0"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cpuctl 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 7.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page was written by
.An Stanislav Sedov Aq Mt stas@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
Yes, probably, report if any.
