.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a hypervisor that runs guest operating systems inside a
virtual machine.
.Pp
Parameters such as the number of virtual CPUs, amount of guest memory, and
I/O connectivity can be specified with command-line parameters.
.Pp
If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must be loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 8
or a similar boot loader before running
.Nm ,
otherwise, it is enough to run
.Nm
with a boot ROM of choice.
.Pp
.Nm
runs until the guest operating system reboots or an unhandled hypervisor
exit is detected.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl A
Generate ACPI tables.
bhyve always generates ACPI tables so this option is obsolete.
.It Fl a
The guest's local APIC is configured in xAPIC mode.
The xAPIC mode is the default setting so this option is redundant.
It will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl C
Include guest memory in core file.
.It Fl c Op Ar setting ...
Number of guest virtual CPUs
and/or the CPU topology.
The default value for each of
.Ar numcpus ,
.Ar sockets ,
.Ar cores ,
and
.Ar threads
is 1.
If
.Ar numcpus
is not specified then it will be calculated from the other arguments.
The topology must be consistent in that the
.Ar numcpus
must equal the product of
.Ar sockets ,
.Ar cores ,
and
.Ar threads .
If a
.Ar setting
is specified more than once the last one has precedence.
.Pp
The maximum number of virtual CPUs defaults to the number of active
physical CPUs in the system available via the
.Va hw.vmm.maxcpu
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
The limit can be adjusted via the
.Va hw.vmm.maxcpu
loader tunable.
.It Fl D
Destroy the VM on guest initiated power-off.
.It Fl e
Force
.Nm
to exit when a guest issues an access to an I/O port that is not emulated.
This is intended for debug purposes.
.It Fl f Ar name Ns Cm \&, Ns Oo Cm string Ns No | Ns Cm file Ns Oc Ns Cm \&= Ns Ar data
Add a fw_cfg file
.Ar name
to the fw_cfg interface.
If a
.Cm string
is specified, the fw_cfg file contains the string as data.
If a
.Cm file
is specified, bhyve reads the file and adds the file content as fw_cfg data.
.It Fl G Xo
.Sm off
.Oo Ar w Oc
.Oo Ar bind_address Cm \&: Oc
.Ar port
.Sm on
.Xc
Start a debug server that uses the GDB protocol to export guest state to a
debugger.
An IPv4 TCP socket will be bound to the supplied
.Ar bind_address
and
.Ar port
to listen for debugger connections.
Only a single debugger may be attached to the debug server at a time.
If the option begins with
.Sq w ,
.Nm
will pause execution at the first instruction waiting for a debugger to attach.
.It Fl H
Yield the virtual CPU thread when a HLT instruction is detected.
If this option is not specified, virtual CPUs will use 100% of a host CPU.
.It Fl h
Print help message and exit.
.It Fl k Ar config_file
Set configuration variables from a simple, key-value config file.
Each line of the config file is expected to consist of a config variable
name, an equals sign
.It Fl K Ar layout
Specify the keyboard layout.
The value that can be specified sets the file name in
.Ar /usr/share/bhyve/kbdlayout .
This specification only works when loaded with UEFI mode for VNC.
When using a VNC client that supports QEMU Extended Key Event Message (e.g.
TigerVNC), this option isn't needed.
When using a VNC client that doesn't support QEMU Extended Key Event Message
(e.g. tightVNC), the layout defaults to the US keyboard unless specified
otherwise.
.Pq Sq = ,
and a value.
No spaces are permitted between the variable name, equals sign, or
value.
Blank lines and lines starting with
.Sq #
are ignored.
See
.Xr bhyve_config 5
for more details.
.It Fl l Cm help
Print a list of supported LPC devices.
.It Fl l Ar lpcdev Ns Op Cm \&, Ns Ar conf

This must be the same size that was given to
.Xr bhyveload 8 .
.Pp
The size argument may be suffixed with one of
.Cm K , M , G
or
.Cm T
(either upper or lower case)
to indicate a multiple of kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes.
If no suffix is given, the value is assumed to be in megabytes.
.Pp
The default is 256M.
.It Fl o Ar var Ns Cm = Ns Ar value
Set the configuration variable
.Ar var
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl P
Force the guest virtual CPU to exit when a PAUSE instruction is detected.
.It Fl p Ar vcpu Ns Cm \& : Ns Ar hostcpu
Pin guest's virtual CPU
.Em vcpu
to
.Em hostcpu .
Host CPUs and guest virtual CPUs are numbered starting from 0.
A
.Fl p
option is required for every guest vCPU to be pinned.
To map a 4 vCPU guest to host CPUs 12-15:
.Bd -literal
-p 0:12 -p 1:13 -p 2:14 -p 3:15
.Ed
.It Fl r Ar file
Resume a guest from a snapshot.
The guest memory contents are restored from
.Ar file ,
and the guest device and vCPU state are restored from the file
.Dq Ar file Ns .kern .
.Pp
Note that the current snapshot file format requires that the
configuration of devices in the new VM match the VM from which the
snapshot was taken by specifying the same
.Fl s
and
.Fl l
options.
The count of vCPUs and memory configuration are read from the snapshot.

An IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets and may contain an
optional zone identifier.
.It Cm w= Ns Ar width No and Cm h= Ns Ar height
A display resolution, width and height, respectively.
If not specified, a default resolution of 1024x768 pixels will be used.
Minimal supported resolution is 640x480 pixels,
and maximum is 1920x1200 pixels.
.It Cm vga= Ns Ar vgaconf
Possible values for this option are
.Cm io
(default),
.Cm on
, and
.Cm off .
PCI graphics cards have a dual personality in that they are
standard PCI devices with BAR addressing, but may also
implicitly decode legacy VGA I/O space
.Pq Ad 0x3c0-3df
and memory space
.Pq 64KB at Ad 0xA0000 .
The default
.Cm io
option should be used for guests that attempt to issue BIOS calls which result
in I/O port queries, and fail to boot if I/O decode is disabled.
.Pp
The
.Cm on
option should be used along with the CSM BIOS capability in UEFI
to boot traditional BIOS guests that require the legacy VGA I/O and
memory regions to be available.
.Pp
The
.Cm off
option should be used for the UEFI guests that assume that
VGA adapter is present if they detect the I/O ports.
An example of such a guest is
.Ox
in UEFI mode.
.Pp
Please refer to the
.Nm
.Fx
wiki page
.Pq Lk https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve
for configuration notes of particular guests.
.It Cm wait
Instruct
.Nm
to only boot upon the initiation of a VNC connection, simplifying the
installation of operating systems that require immediate keyboard input.
This can be removed for post-installation use.
.It Cm password= Ns Ar password
This type of authentication is known to be cryptographically weak and is not
intended for use on untrusted networks.
Many implementations will want to use stronger security, such as running
the session over an encrypted channel provided by IPsec or SSH.

.Sh CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.Nm
uses an internal tree of configuration variables to describe global and
per-device settings.
When
.Nm
starts,
it parses command line options (including config files) in the order given
on the command line.
Each command line option sets one or more configuration variables.
For example,
the
.Fl s
option creates a new tree node for a PCI device and sets one or more variables
under that node including the device model and device model-specific variables.
Variables may be set multiple times during this parsing stage with the final
value overriding previous values.
.Pp
Once all of the command line options have been processed,
the configuration values are frozen.
.Nm
then uses the value of configuration values to initialize device models
and global settings.
.Pp
More details on configuration variables can be found in
.Xr bhyve_config 5 .
.Sh DEBUG SERVER
The current debug server provides limited support for debuggers.
.Ss Registers
Each virtual CPU is exposed to the debugger as a thread.

General purpose registers can be queried for each virtual CPU, but other
registers such as floating-point and system registers cannot be queried.
.Ss Memory
Memory (including memory mapped I/O regions) can be read and written
by the debugger.
Memory operations use virtual addresses that are resolved to physical
addresses via the current virtual CPU's active address translation.
.Ss Control
The running guest can be interrupted by the debugger at any time
.Pq for example, by pressing Ctrl-C in the debugger .
.Pp
Single stepping is only supported on Intel CPUs supporting the MTRAP VM exit.
.Pp
Breakpoints are supported on Intel CPUs that support single stepping.
Note that continuing from a breakpoint while interrupts are enabled in the
guest may not work as expected due to timer interrupts firing while single
stepping over the breakpoint.
.Sh SIGNAL HANDLING
.Nm
deals with the following signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width SIGTERM -compact
.It SIGTERM
Trigger ACPI poweroff for a VM
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status indicates how the VM was terminated:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It 0
rebooted
.It 1
powered off
.It 2
halted
.It 3
triple fault
.It 4
exited due to an error
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must have been loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 8
or a similar boot loader before
.Xr bhyve 4
can be run.
Otherwise, the boot loader is not needed.
