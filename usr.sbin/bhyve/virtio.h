/*
 * A virtual device has zero or more "virtual queues" (virtqueue).
 * Each virtqueue uses at least two 4096-byte pages, laid out thus:
 *
 *      +-----------------------------------------------+
 *      |    "desc":  <N> descriptors, 16 bytes each    |
 *      |   -----------------------------------------   |
 *      |   "avail":   2 uint16; <N> uint16; 1 uint16   |
 *      |   -----------------------------------------   |
 *      |              pad to 4k boundary               |
 *      +-----------------------------------------------+
 *      |   "used": 2 x uint16; <N> elems; 1 uint16     |
 *      |   -----------------------------------------   |
 *      |              pad to 4k boundary               |
 *      +-----------------------------------------------+
 *
 * The number <N> that appears here is always a power of two and is
 * limited to no more than 32768 (as it must fit in a 16-bit field).
 * If <N> is sufficiently large, the above will occupy more than
 * two pages.  In any case, all pages must be physically contiguous
 * within the guest's physical address space.
 *
 * The <N> 16-byte "desc" descriptors consist of a 64-bit guest
 * physical address <addr>, a 32-bit length <len>, a 16-bit
 * <flags>, and a 16-bit <next> field (all in guest byte order).
 *
 * There are three flags that may be set :
 *	NEXT    descriptor is chained, so use its "next" field
 *	WRITE   descriptor is for host to write into guest RAM
 *		(else host is to read from guest RAM)
 *	INDIRECT   descriptor address field is (guest physical)
 *		address of a linear array of descriptors
 *
 * Unless INDIRECT is set, <len> is the number of bytes that may
 * be read/written from guest physical address <addr>.  If
 * INDIRECT is set, WRITE is ignored and <len> provides the length
 * of the indirect descriptors (and <len> must be a multiple of
 * 16).  Note that NEXT may still be set in the main descriptor
 * pointing to the indirect, and should be set in each indirect
 * descriptor that uses the next descriptor (these should generally
 * be numbered sequentially).  However, INDIRECT must not be set
 * in the indirect descriptors.  Upon reaching an indirect descriptor
 * without a NEXT bit, control returns to the direct descriptors.
 *
 * Except inside an indirect, each <next> value must be in the
 * range [0 .. N) (i.e., the half-open interval).  (Inside an
 * indirect, each <next> must be in the range [0 .. <len>/16).)
 *
 * The "avail" data structures reside in the same pages as the
 * "desc" structures since both together are used by the device to
 * pass information to the hypervisor's virtual driver.  These
 * begin with a 16-bit <flags> field and 16-bit index <idx>, then
 * have <N> 16-bit <ring> values, followed by one final 16-bit
 * field <used_event>.  The <N> <ring> entries are simply indices
 * into the descriptor ring (and thus must meet the same
 * constraints as each <next> value).  However, <idx> is counted
 * up from 0 (initially) and simply wraps around after 65535; it
 * is taken mod <N> to find the next available entry.
 *
 * The "used" ring occupies a separate page or pages, and contains
 * values written from the virtual driver back to the guest OS.
 * This begins with a 16-bit <flags> and 16-bit <idx>, then there
 * are <N> "vring_used" elements, followed by a 16-bit <avail_event>.
 * The <N> "vring_used" elements consist of a 32-bit <id> and a
 * 32-bit <len> (vu_tlen below).  The <id> is simply the index of
 * the head of a descriptor chain the guest made available
 * earlier, and the <len> is the number of bytes actually written,
 * e.g., in the case of a network driver that provided a large
 * receive buffer but received only a small amount of data.
 *
 * The two event fields, <used_event> and <avail_event>, in the
 * avail and used rings (respectively -- note the reversal!), are
 * always provided, but are used only if the virtual device
 * negotiates the VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX feature during feature
 * negotiation.  Similarly, both rings provide a flag --
 * VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT and VRING_USED_F_NO_NOTIFY -- in
 * their <flags> field, indicating that the guest does not need an
 * interrupt, or that the hypervisor driver does not need a
 * notify, when descriptors are added to the corresponding ring.
 * (These are provided only for interrupt optimization and need
 * not be implemented.)

/*
 * The address of any given virtual queue is determined by a single
 * Page Frame Number register.  The guest writes the PFN into the
 * PCI config space.  However, a device that has two or more
 * virtqueues can have a different PFN, and size, for each queue.
 * The number of queues is determinable via the PCI config space
 * VTCFG_R_QSEL register.  Writes to QSEL select the queue: 0 means
 * queue #0, 1 means queue#1, etc.  Once a queue is selected, the
 * remaining PFN and QNUM registers refer to that queue.
 *
 * QNUM is a read-only register containing a nonzero power of two
 * that indicates the (hypervisor's) queue size.  Or, if reading it
 * produces zero, the hypervisor does not have a corresponding
 * queue.  (The number of possible queues depends on the virtual
 * device.  The block device has just one; the network device
 * provides either two -- 0 = receive, 1 = transmit -- or three,
 * with 2 = control.)
 *
 * PFN is a read/write register giving the physical page address of
 * the virtqueue in guest memory (the guest must allocate enough space
 * based on the hypervisor's provided QNUM).
 *
 * QNOTIFY is effectively write-only: when the guest writes a queue
 * number to the register, the hypervisor should scan the specified
 * virtqueue. (Reading QNOTIFY currently always gets 0).

 *
 * Note: inside each hypervisor virtio driver, changes to these
 * data structures must be locked against other threads, if any.
 * Except for PCI config space register read/write, we assume each
 * driver does the required locking, but we need a pointer to the
 * lock (if there is one) for PCI config space read/write ops.
 *
 * When the guest reads or writes the device's config space, the

 * described above.  If the offset of the register(s) being read
 * or written is past the CFG area (CFG0 or CFG1), the request is
 * passed on to the virtual device, after subtracting off the
 * generic-layer size.  (So, drivers can just use the offset as
 * an offset into "struct config", for instance.)
 *
 * (The virtio layer also makes sure that the read or write is to/
 * from a "good" config offset, hence vc_cfgsize, and on BAR #0.
 * However, the driver must verify the read or write size and offset
 * and that no one is writing a readonly register.)
 *
