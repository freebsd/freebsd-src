# bhyve ps2kbd keyboard layout file (US - default)
#
# Created by: Koine Yuusuke(koinec) <koinec@users.osdn.me>
#

# for those who create the Keyboard Layout File. ******************************
#  To create the keyboard layout file, first copy this 'default' file into the
#  same dir. with the layout name as the file name.
#  The file name is a character string that can be specified as it is in the
#  -k option of the bhyve command, so a normal language name is desirable.
#  Then, it is necessary to define the difference between the standard US keyboard
#  and the keyboard for each language according to the setting method described
#  in the comment below.
#
#  Note that lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored.
#  In addition, the definition of the standard layout setting (US keyboard)
#  is described as a comment line below for reference.
#  So you usually only need to remove the '#' and fix it to the correct ScanCode
#  only on the lines of the key that you can't type correctly with the standard
#  US keyboard settings.


# Alphabet/Number/Sign Keys ---------------------------------------------------
#   Format:
#     'Chr',ScanCode(Hex); <Comment>
#       or
#     AsciiCode(Hex),ScanCode(Hex); <Comment>
#
#  If there are ASCII characters that cannot be entered correctly with the
#  standard settings(US Keyboard layout), delete the "#" at the beginning of the
#  relevant line below and set the correct ScanCode.
#
#  For example, when a Japanese Keyboard is used, the '@' sign cannot be input
#  correctly and the number '2' is input.
#  This is because the US keyboard can input the '@' sign with the Shift + number'2'
#  keys, and the ScanCode of the '@' sign is the number '2' key by default.
#  In this case, remove the '#' at the beginning of the line with the '@' sign
#  below and correct the ScanCode from 0x1e to 0x54 so that you can enter it
#  correctly.
#  ScanCode differs depending on the keyboard of eash language, so check it on
#  the Internet.
#  Note that keys that have no problems with input have the same settings as
#  the US keyboard, so you do not need to set anything below.
#  See the "/usr/share/bhyve/kbdlayout/jp106" file for the specific setting method.

# Functional Keys -------------------------------------------------------------
#   Format:
#     Xorg KeySym(Hex:2Byte),ScanCode(Hex); <Comment>
#       or
#     Xorg KeySym(Hex:2Byte),ScanCode(Hex),Prefix(Hex); <Comment>
#
#  Key definitions other than alphanumeric characters such as Enter and Escape
#  are set in this section.
#  If there is a key that can not be entered correctly with the standard settings
#  (US Keyboard layout),, delete the '#' at the beginning of the corresponding
#  line and set the correct scan code.
#  The Xorg KeySym Code can be checked by using the 'xev' command from X window
#  on the guest OS.
#  In addition, some keys have ScanCodes that have a Prefix Byte.
#  In this case, define '0xe0' as the third argument.(example Home Key,etc)
#  Note that keys that have no problems with input have the same settings as
#  the US keyboard, so you do not need to set anything below.
#  See the "/usr/share/bhyve/kbdlayout/jp106" file for the specific setting method.

# 0xff9f,0x71; 		Keypad del


# Language Specific Keys -------------------------------------------------------
#
#  If a key not exist in the US keyboard is added to the keyboard of each language,
#  it is necessary to add the combination of Xorg KeySym and ScanCode of the
#  corresponding key.
#  The setting format is the same as the Functional Key section above.
#   example:
#     0xff2a,0x0e;   Hankaku/Zenkaku|Kanji (Japanese 106 keyboard original Key)
