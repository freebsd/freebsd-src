The following options may be set from this screen.

NFS Secure:   NFS server talks only on a secure port

    This is most commonly used when talking to Sun workstations, which
    will not talk NFS over "non privileged" ports.


NFS Slow:     User is using a slow PC or Ethernet card

    Use this option if you have a slow PC (386) or an Ethernet card
    with poor performance being "fed" by NFS on a higher-performance
    workstation.  This will throttle the workstation back to prevent
    the PC from becoming swamped with data.


NFS TCP:      Use TCP for the NFS mount

    This option can be used if your NFS server supports TCP
    connections; not all do!  This may be useful if your NFS server
    is at a remote site in which case it may offer some additional
    stability.


NFS version 3:   Use NFS version 3

    This option forces the use of NFS version 3 and is on by default.
    If your NFS server only supports NFS version 2, disable this option.


Debugging:    Turn on the extra debugging flag

    This turns on a lot of extra noise in between dialogs (unless
    debugFile has been set, sending the data to a logfile instead).
    Optionally, if debugFile begins with a plus sign (`+'), output will
    occur both on standard output and to debugFile (minus leading plus).
    If your installation should fail for any reason, PLEASE turn this
    flag on when attempting to reproduce the problem.  It will provide a
    lot of extra debugging at the failure point and may be very helpful
    to the developers in tracking such problems down!


Yes To All:   Assume "Yes" answers to all non-critical dialogs

    This flag should be used with caution.  It will essentially
    decide NOT to ask the user about any "boundary" conditions that
    might not constitute actual errors but may be warnings indicative
    of other problems.  It's most useful to those who are doing unattended
    installs.


DHCP:         Enable DHCP configuration of interfaces

    This option specifies whether DHCP configuration of interfaces
    may be attempted.  The default setting is to interactively ask
    the user.


IPv6:         Enable IPv6 router solicitation configuration

    This option specifies whether automatic configuration of IPv6
    interfaces may be attempted.  This uses the router solicitation
    method of automatic configuration.  The default setting is to
    interactively ask the user.


FTP username:  Specify username and password instead of anonymous.

    By default, the installation attempts to log in as the
    anonymous user.  If you wish to log in as someone else,
    specify the username and password with this option.


Editor:  Specify which screen editor to use.

   At various points during the installation it may be necessary
   to customize some text file, at which point the user will be
   thrown unceremoniously into a screen editor.  A relatively
   simplistic editor which shows its command set on-screen is
   selected by default, but UNIX purists may wish to change this
   setting to `/usr/bin/vi'.


Release Name:  Which release to attempt to load from installation media.

    You should only change this option if you're really sure you know
    what you are doing!  This will change the release name used by
    bsdconfig when fetching components of any distributions.


Media Type:   Which media type is being used.

    This is mostly informational and indicates which media type (if any)
    was last selected in the Media menu.  It's also a convenient short-cut
    to the media menu itself.


Package Temp:  Where package temporary files should go

   Some packages, like emacs, can use a LOT of temporary space - up to
   20 or 30MB.  If you are going to configure a small / directory and no
   separate /var (and hence a small /var/tmp), then you may wish to set
   this to point at another location (say, /usr/tmp).


Re-scan Devices:  

   Reprobe the system for devices.


Use Defaults:  Use default values.

    Reset all options back to their default values.
