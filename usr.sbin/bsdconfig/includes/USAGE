Usage: bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ [OPTIONS] [include ...]

OPTIONS:
	-a    Always use color even when output is not to a terminal.
	-d    Print description for each function selected. Implies `-f'.
	-f    Show functions for selected includes.
	-F pattern
	      If `-f', only print functions matching pattern. Without `-f'
	      print only includes containing functions matching pattern.
	-h    Print this usage statement and exit.
	-n    Disable the use of color.

EXAMPLES:
	View a list of available includes:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@

	View functions for all available includes (function names are
	highlighted):

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ -f

	View functions with less(1) (function names are not highlighted):

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ -f | less

	View functions with less(1) and color:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ -af | less -R

	View functions from `common.subr':

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ common.subr

	NB: The `-f' flag is implied when given an include.

	Show only functions containing the word `show' in common.subr:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ -F show common

	NB: The `.subr' suffix on the end of the include is optional.

	Show descriptions of each of the `show' functions:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ -dF show
