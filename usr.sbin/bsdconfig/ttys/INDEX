# Two-part variable that defines an action to take when `keyword' is passed on
# a bsdconfig command line. Variable takes the form "keyword|command" and
# multiple occurrences of the variable (with different `keyword's, or different
# `keyword's AND `command's) are allowed.  If `command' begins with a '/' then
# the full path to the program is needed. If `command' begins with anything
# else it is a path relative to the directory this INDEX file is in. `keyword'
# can be i18n'ed but `command' is the name of a script.
