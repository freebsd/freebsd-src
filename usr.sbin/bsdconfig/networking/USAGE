Usage: bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
	-d         Provide lots of debugging info on standard-out when running.
	-D file    Send debugging info to file. If file begins with a plus-sign
	           debug info is sent to both standard-out and file (minus the
	           leading plus).
	-h         Print this usage statement and exit.
	-S         Secure X11 mode (implies `-X'). As root, always prompt-for
	           and validate sudo(8) username/password before starting.
	-X         Use Xdialog(1) in place of dialog(1).
