# f_resword_new $resword $function
#
# Create a new `reserved' word for scripting purposes. Reswords call pre-
# defined functions but differ from those functions in the following ways:
#
# 	+ Reswords do not take arguments but instead get all their data from
# 	  the environment variable namespace.
# 	+ Unless noError is set (must be non-NULL), if calling the resword
# 	  results in failure, the application will terminate prematurely.
# 	+ noError is unset after each/every resword is called.
#
# Reswords should not be used in bsdconfig itself (hence the name `reserved
# word') but instead only in scripts loaded through f_script_load()).

# NOTE: $noError is unset after every call.
