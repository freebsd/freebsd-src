Usage: bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ [-ehnrSsvX] [-C chroot_dir] [zinfo_file | zinfo_name]
OPTIONS:
	-d         Provide lots of debugging info on standard-out when running.
	-D file    Send debugging info to file. If file begins with a plus-sign
	           debug info is sent to both standard-out and file (minus the
	           leading plus).
	-e         Only return success on exit if user selects a timezone AND
	           the selected timezone was successfully installed. By default
	           (without this flag), success is always returned unless an
	           error has occurred.
	-h         Print this usage statement and exit.
	-n         Do not create or copy files.
	-r         Reinstall the zoneinfo file installed last time. The name is
	           obtained from /var/db/zoneinfo.
	-S         Secure X11 mode (implies `-X'). As root, always prompt-for
	           and validate sudo(8) username/password before starting.
	-s         Skip the initial question about adjusting the clock if
	           not set to UTC.
	-v         Verbose. Enable extra output when installing the zone file.
	-X         Enable the use of Xdialog(1) instead of dialog(1).
