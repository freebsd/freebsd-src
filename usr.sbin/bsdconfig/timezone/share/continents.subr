############################################################ FUNCTIONS

# f_continent $cont $property [$var_to_set]
#
# Returns a single property of a given continent. Available properties are:
#
# 	name        Directory name of continent/ocean as it appears in
# 	            _PATH_ZONEINFO.
# 	title       Menu text of this continent/ocean to be displayed in the
# 	            continent-selection menu.
# 	nitems      Number of submenu items associated with this
# 	            continent/ocean.
# 	tlc_N       2-character country code of the Nth submenu item associated
# 	            with this continent displayed in the country-selection menu
# 	            (which appears after continent selection).
# 	menu_list   Menu-list of regions for this continent.
#
# If $var_to_set is missing or NULL, the value of $var_to_get is printed to
# standard output for capturing in a sub-shell (which is less-recommended
# because of performance degredation; for example, when called in a loop).
