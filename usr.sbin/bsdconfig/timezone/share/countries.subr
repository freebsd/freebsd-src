# f_country $code $property [$var_to_set]
#
# Returns a single property of a given country. Available properties are:
#
# 	name         Name of the country as read from _PATH_ISO3166.
# 	nzones       Number of zones within the country (-1 if country has
# 	             only a single zone).
# 	filename     The filename portion of the TZ field (after the `/') as
# 	             read from _PATH_ZONETAB.
# 	cont         The principal continent in which the country lies (appears
# 	             before the `/' in the TZ field of _PATH_ZONETAB).
# 	filename_N   Like filename, but for the Nth zone when the country has
# 	             multiple zones (nzones > 0).
# 	cont_N       Like cont, but for the Nth zone when the country has
# 	             multiple zones (nzones > 0).
# 	descr_N      Like name, but for the Nth zone when the country has
# 	             multiple zones (nzones > 0)
#
# If $var_to_set is missing or NULL, the value of $var_to_get is printed to
# standard output for capturing in a sub-shell (which is less-recommended
# because of performance degredation; for example, when called in a loop).
