.Sh NAME
.Nm pccardd
.Nd PC-CARD (PCMCIA) management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pccardd
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl i Ar IRQ
.Op Fl f Ar configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pccardd
is normally started at boot time, and manages the insertion
and removal of PC-CARD cards.
.Pp
When started,
.Nm
will read the configuration file (default name
.Pa /etc/defaults/pccard.conf
which includes
.Pa /etc/pccard.conf
as the user configuration file)
and scans the available PC-CARD slots for cards.
.Nm Pccardd
then waits for
.Em "card events" ,
such as the insertion of a new card or the removal
of a card.
.Pp
When a card is inserted, the following
actions are taken:
.Bl -enum
.It
The kernel driver detects the card insertion and applies
power to the card.
.It
.Nm Pccardd
reads the
.Em CIS
data from the attribute memory of the card, and uses
the manufacturer name and card version to match
the card description in the configuration file.
.It
Once matched, a driver is allocated.
.It
Once a free driver and device instance is located,
.Nm
will (if required) allocate resources such as an ISA memory
block and Input/Output ports from a common pool.
.It
The PC-CARD slot is configured with the I/O and memory
contexts allocated, and the kernel driver is attached to
this card.
.It
If the attach succeeds, then specific shell commands
may be executed to configure the device, such as
.Xr ifconfig 8
to set up a network interface.
Separate commands may be specified
for each card, driver or device, and are executed in that order.
.El
.Pp
When
.Nm
detects that a card has been removed, the following sequence occurs:
.Bl -enum
.It
The shell commands associated with card removal are executed.
These
are intended to reset any device associated with the removed card.
Separate commands may exist for card, driver and device instances.
.It
The PC-CARD slot resources are freed.
.El
.Pp
Once a card/driver instance is configured, the resources
bound to that instance are remembered, and if the card is removed
and reinserted, the same driver is allocated.
The primary reason
is that once a driver is associated with a card, the
driver's
.Fn probe
routine has been called, and this usually causes driver specific
data areas to be initialized with the I/O ports or memory resources
allocated to the card.
Most drivers are not designed to be
disassociated from the hardware and then reassociated with different
parameters.
This will change significantly when loadable kernel
modules are supported.
.Pp
SIGHUP causes
.Nm
to reload the configuration files.
.Pp
The start options understood by
.Nm
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not run as a daemon, but run in the foreground and
display error messages.
.It Fl v
After reading the configuration file, print out a summary
of it.
.It Fl z
Delays running as a daemon until after the cards have been probed and attached.
.It Fl i Ar IRQ
Configures an available IRQ.  It overrides the "irq" line in
.Pa /etc/defaults/pccard.conf
and
.Pa /etc/pccard.conf .
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specifies a different configuration file to be used
in placed of the default file
.Pa /etc/defaults/pccard.conf .
The file format is detailed in
.Xr pccard.conf 5 ,
and lists the PC-CARD cards recognized by
.Nm pccardd ,
and the kernel drivers and devices that are used to
interface to the card.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm Pccardd
can set up card parameters, but cannot guarantee that
particular drivers can work with the card.
.Pp
Removing cards may cause problems if system resources
have been associated with the card, such as network
mounted filesystems.
