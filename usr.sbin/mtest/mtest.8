.Sh NAME
.Nm mtest
.Nd test multicast socket operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is a small program for testing multicast socket operations.
.Pp
It accepts the following commands, interactively, or as part of a scripted
input file (useful for automated testing):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "a ifname e.e.e.e e.e.e.e" -compact -offset indent
.\"
.It Ic a Ar ifname Ar mac-addr
Join the link-layer group address
.Ar mac-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname .
The group address should be in IEEE 802 MAC format,
delimited by colon (':') characters.
.It Ic d Ar ifname Ar mac-addr
Leave the link-layer group address
.Ar mac-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname .
.It Ic m Ar ifname Ar 1/0
Set or reset ALLMULTI mode on interface
.Ar ifname .
This option is deprecated and is now a no-op.
.It Ic p Ar ifname Ar 1/0
Set or reset promiscuous mode on interface
.Ar ifname .
.Pp
.It Ic j Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Op Ar source-addr
Join the multicast address
.Ar mcast-addr
on the interface with name
.Ar ifname .
.Pp
If an optional source
.Ar source-addr
is specified, a source-specific join will be performed;
if
.Nm
is already joined to the multicast address, the source
will be added to its filter list.
.Pp
.It Ic l Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Op Ar source-addr
Leave the multicast address
.Ar mcast-addr
on the interface with address
.Ar ifname .
If a source
.Ar source-addr
is specified, only that source will be left.
.\"
.It Ic i Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Ar n Ar source-addr ...
Set the socket with membership of
.Ar mcast-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname
to include filter mode, and add
.Ar n
sources beginning with
.Ar source-addr
to the inclusion filter list.
.\"
.It Ic e Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Ar n Ar source-addr ...
Set the socket with membership of
.Ar mcast-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname
to exclude filter mode, and add
.Ar n
sources beginning with
.Ar source-addr
to the exclusion filter list.
.\"
.It Ic t Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Ar source-addr
Set the socket with membership of
.Ar mcast-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname
to block traffic from source
.Ar source-addr .
.\"
.It Ic b Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Ar source-addr
Set the socket with membership of
.Ar mcast-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname
to allow traffic from source
.Ar source-addr .
.\"
.Pp
.It Ic g Ar mcast-addr Ar ifname Ar n
Print
.Ar n
source filter entries for
.Ar mcast-addr
on interface
.Ar ifname .
.\"
.Pp
.It Ic f Ar filename
Read commands from the file
.Ar filename .
.It Ic s Ar n
Sleep for
.Ar n
seconds.
.It Ic ?\&
List legal commands.
.It Ic q
Quit the program.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
For each command implemented by
.Nm ,
the address family of each argument must be identical; it is not possible
to mix IPv4 multicast memberships with IPv6, for example.
.Pp
To support IPv6, all commands have now changed to accept an interface
name rather than an interface address.
For IPv4, the program will perform
a lookup of the primary IP address based on the interface name.
This may fail if no primary IP address is assigned.
