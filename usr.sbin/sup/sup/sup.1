.SH "NAME"
sup \- software upgrade protocol
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsup\fR [ \fIflags\fR ] [ \fIsupfile\fR ] [ \fIcollection\fR ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I Sup
is a program used for upgrading collections of files from other machines
to your machine.  You execute
.IR sup ,
the
.I client
program, which talks over the network using IP/TCP to a
.I file server
process.
The file server process cooperates with
.I sup
to determine which files of the collection need to be upgraded on
your machine.

Sup collections can have multiple releases. One use for such releases is
to provide different versions of the same files. At CMU, for example,
system binaries have alpha, beta and default release corresponding to
different staging levels of the software. We also use release names
default and minimal to provide complete releases or subset releases.
In both of these cases, it only makes sense to sup one release of the
collections. Releases have also been used in private or external sups to
provide subsets of collections where it makes sense to pick up several
of the releases. For example the Mach 3.0 kernel sources has a default
release of machine independent sources and separate releases of 
machine dependent sources for each supported platform.

In performing an upgrade, the file server constructs a list of
files included in the specified release of the collection.  The list is sent to your machine,
which determines which files are needed.  Those files are then sent
from the file server.
It will be most useful to run
.I sup
as a daemon each night so you will continually have the latest version of the
files in the needed collections.

The only required argument to
.I sup
is the name of a supfile.  It must either be given explicitly on the command
line, or the
.B -s
flag must be specified.  If the
.B -s
flag is given, the system supfile will be used and a supfile command argument
should not be specified.  The list of collections is optional and if specified
will be the only collections upgraded.  The following flags affect all
collections specified:
.TP
.B -s
As described above.
.TP
.B -t
When this flag is given,
.I sup
will print the time
that each collection was last upgraded, rather than
performing actual upgrades.
.TP
.B -N
.I Sup
will trace network messages sent and received that implement the
.I sup
network protocol.
.TP
.B -P
Sup will use a set of non-privileged network
ports reserved for debugging purposes.
.i0
.DT
.PP

The remaining flags affect all collections unless an explicit list
of collections are given with the flags.  Multiple flags may be
specified together that affect the same collections.  For the sake
of convience, any flags that always affect all collections can be
specified with flags that affect only some collections.  For
example,
.B sup -sde=coll1,coll2
would perform a system upgrade,
and the first two collections would allow both file deletions and
command executions.  Note that this is not the same command as
.B sup -sde=coll1 coll2,
which would perform a system upgrade of
just the coll2 collection and would ignore the flags given for the
coll1 collection.
.TP
.B -a
All files in the collection will be copied from
the repository, regardless of their status on the
current machine.  Because of this, it is a very
expensive operation and should only be done for
small collections if data corruption is suspected
and been confirmed.  In most cases, the
.B -o
flag should be sufficient.
.TP
.B -b
If the
.B -b
flag if given, or the 
.B backup
supfile
option is specified, the contents of regular files
on the local system will be saved before they are
overwritten with new data.  The file collection maintainer
can designate specific files to be
worthy of backing up whenever they are upgraded.
However, such
backup will only take place if you specify this flag or the
.B backup
option to allow
backups for a file collection on your machine.
The backup mechanism
will create a copy of the current version of a file immediately
before a new copy is received from the file server; the copy is
given the same name as the original file but is put into a directory
called
.B 
BACKUP
within the directory containing the original file.
For example,
.B 
/usr/sas/src/foo.c
would have a backup copy called
.B 
/usr/sas/src/BACKUP/foo.c.
There is no provision for automatically maintaining multiple old
versions of files; you would have to do this yourself.
.TP
.B -B
The
.B -B
flag overrides and disables the
.B -b
flag and the
.B backup
supfile option.
.TP
.B -d
Files that are no longer in the collection on the
repository will be deleted if present on the local
machine and were put there by a previous sup.  
This may also be specified in a supfile with the
.B delete
option.
.TP
.B -D
The
.B -D
flag overrides and disables the
.B -d
flag and the
.B delete
supfile option.
.TP
.B -e
Sup will execute commands sent from the repository
that should be run when a file is upgraded.  If
the
.B -e
flag is omitted, Sup will print a message
that specifies the command to execute.  This may
also be specified in a supfile with the
.B execute
option.
.TP
.B -E
The
.B -E
flag overrides and disables the
.B -e
flag and the
.B execute
supfile option.
.TP
.B -f
A
.I list-only
upgrade will be performed.  Messages
will be printed that indicate what would happen if
an actual upgrade were done.
.TP
.B -i
Normally, 
.I sup 
will fail to upgrade any files that are \fBETXTBSY\fR.
The
.B -i
flag, or the
.B unlinkbusy
supfile option, will cause
.I sup
to try to upgrade a busy file by unlinking it before the 
replacement file is installed.  The option is intended for
environments where upgrades to possibly running binaries or 
libraries will take place.  Some operating systems \fB(HPUX)\fR 
do not allow the unlink system call to succeed on ETXTBSY files.
If the unlink does not succeed, an attempt is made to rename the 
file to filename.sup#sup-pid.moved.  The new name is logged in either 
the system default rename log file, \fB/usr/local/etc/sup.moved\fR, 
or in a logfile as set by the \fBrenamelog\fR supfile option.  The 
logfile allows for easy deletion of ETXTBSY files once they are no 
longer in use.  A typical time to perform the deletions is at system 
boot time with something similar to:
.TP
.ce 1
cat /usr/local/etc/sup.moved | xargs rm -rf
.TP
.B -I
The
.B -I
flag overrides and disables the
.B -i
flag and the
.B unlinkbusy
supfile option.
.TP
.B -k
.I Sup
will check the modification times of
files on the local disk before updating them.  Only files which are
newer on the repository than on the local disk will be updated;
files that are newer on the local disk will be kept as they are.
This may also be specified in a supfile with the
.B keep
option.
.TP
.B -K
The
.B -K
flag overrides and disables the
.B -k
flag and the
.B keep
supfile option.
.TP
.B -l
Normally,
.I sup
will not upgrade a collection if the
repository is on the same machine.  This allows
users to run upgrades on all machines without
having to make special checks for the repository
machine.  If the
.B -l
flag is specified, collections
will be upgraded even if the repository is local.
.TP
.B -m
Normally,
.I sup
used standard output for messages.
If the
.B -m
flag if given,
.I sup
will send mail to the user running
.IR sup ,
or a user specified with the
.B notify
supfile option, that contains messages
printed by
.IR sup .
.TP
.B -o
.I Sup
will normally only upgrade files that have
changed on the repository since the last time an
upgrade was performed. That is, if the file in the
repository is newer than the date stored in the 
.I when
file on the client.  The
.B -o
flag, or the
.B old
supfile option, will cause
.I sup
to check all files
in the collection for changes instead of just the
new ones.
.TP
.B -O
The
.B -O
flag overrides and disables the
.B -o
flag and the
.B old
supfile option.
.TP
.B -u
The
.B -u
flag, or the
.B noupdate
supfile option prevent updates from occurring for regular files where
the modification time and mode hasn't changed.
.TP
.B -U
The
.B -U
flag overrides and disables the
.B -u
flag and the
.B noupdate
supfile option.
.TP
.B -z
Normally sup transfers files directly without any
other processing, but with the 
.B -z
flag, or the
.B compress
supfile option, sup will compress the file 
before sending it across the network and
uncompress it and restore all the correct 
file attributes at the recieving end.
.TP
.B -Z
The
.B -Z
flag overrides and disables the
.B -z
flag and the
.B compress
supfile option.
.TP
.B -v
Normally,
.I sup
will only print messages if there
are problems.  This flag causes
.I sup
to also print
messages during normal progress showing what
.I sup
is doing.
.i0
.DT
.PP
.SH "SETTING UP UPGRADES"
Each file collection to be upgraded must have a
.I base directory
which contains a subdirectory called
.B sup
that will be used by the
.I sup
program; it will be created automatically if you do not create it.
.I Sup
will put subdirectories and files into this directory as needed.

.I Sup
will look for a subdirectory with the same name as the
collection within the
.B sup
subdirectory of the
.I base directory.
If it exists it may contain any of the following files:
.TP
.B when.<rel-suffix>
This file is automatically updated by
.I sup
when a collection is successfully upgraded and contains the
time that the file server, or possibly
.IR supscan ,
created the list of files in the upgrade list.
.I Sup
will send this time to the file server for generating the list
of files that have been changed on the repository machine.
.TP
.B refuse
This file contains a list of files and directories, one per line, that
the client is not interested in that should not be upgraded.
.TP
.B lock
This file is used by
.I sup
to lock a collection while it is being upgraded.
.I Sup
will get exclusive access to the lock file using
.IR flock (2),
preventing more than one
.I sup
from upgrading the same collection at the same time.
.TP
.B last.<rel-suffix>
This file contains a list of files and directories, one per line, that
have been upgraded by
.I sup
in the past.  This information is used when the
.B delete
option, or the
.B -d
flag is used to locate files previously upgraded that are no longer
in the collection that should be deleted.
.i0
.DT
.PP

Each file collection must also be described in one or more supfiles.
When
.I sup
is executed, it reads the specified supfile to determine what file
collections  and releases to upgrade.
Each collection-release set is described by a single
line of text in the supfile; this line must contain the name of the
collection, and possibly one or more options separated by spaces.
The options are:
.TP
.BI release= releasename
If a collection contains multiple releases, you need to specify which
release you want. You can only specify one release per line, so
if you want multiple releases from the same collections, you will need
to specify the collection more than once. In this case, you should use
the 
.I use-rel-suffix 
ption in the supfile
to keep the last and when files for the two releases separate.
.TP
.BI base= directory
The usual default name of the base directory for a collection is
described below (see FILES); if you want to specify another
directory name, use this option specifying the desired
directory.
.TP
.BI prefix= directory
Each collection may also have an associated
.I prefix directory
which is used instead of the base directory to specify in what
directory files within the collection will be placed. 
.TP
.BI host= hostname
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI hostbase= directory
.br
.I System
collections are supported by the system maintainers, and
.I sup
will automatically find out the name of the host machine and
base directory on that machine.
However, you can also upgrade
.I private
collections; you simply specify with these options
the
.I hostname
of the machine containing the files and the
.I directory
used as a base directory for the file server on that machine.
Details of setting up a file collection are given in the section
below.
.TP
.BI login= accountid
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI password= password
.br
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI crypt= key
.br
Files on the file server may be protected, and network transmissions
may be encrypted.
This prevents unauthorized access to files via
.IR sup .
When files are not accessible to the default account (e.g.
the
.B anon
anonymous account), you can specify an alternative
.I accountid
and
.I password
for the file server to use on the repository host.
Network
transmission of the password will be always be encrypted.
You can
also have the actual file data encrypted by specifying a
.IR key ;
the file collection on the repository must specify the same key
or else
.I sup
will not be able to upgrade files from that collection.
In this case, the default account used by the file server on the
repository machine will be the owner of the encryption key
file (see FILES) rather than the
.B anon
anonymous account.
.TP
.BI notify= address
If you use the
.B 
-m
option to receive log messages by mail, you can have the mail
sent to different user, possibly on another host, than the user
running the sup program.
Messages will be sent to the specified
.IR address ,
which can be any legal netmail address.
In particular, a
project maintainer can be designated to receive mail for that
project's file collection from all users running
.I sup
to upgrade that collection.
.TP
.BI renamelog= filename
When the 
.B
unlinkbusy
or
.B
-i
option is enabled, but the system cannot unlink a busy file, it
will rename it instead and log the new filename.  Logging will 
occur to the system default rename log file or to the specified
.IR filename
in the renamelog entry of a supfile.
.TP
.B backup
As described above under the
.B -b
flag.
.TP
.B delete
As described above under the
.B -d
flag.
.TP
.B execute
As described above under the
.B -e
flag.
.TP
.B keep
As described above under the
.B -k
flag.
.TP
.B old
As described above under the
.B -o
flag.
.TP
.B unlinkbusy
As described above under the
.B -i
flag.
.TP
.B noupdate
As described above under the
.B -u
flag.
.TP
.B compress
As described above under the
.B -z
flag.
.TP
.B use-rel-suffix
Causes the release name to be used as a suffix to the 
.I last
and
.I when
files. This is necessary whenever you are supping more than one
release in the same collection.
.i0
.DT
.PP
.SH "PREPARING A FILE COLLECTION REPOSITORY"
A set of files residing on a repository must be prepared before
.I sup
client processes can upgrade those files.
The collection must
be given a
.I name
and a
.I base directory.
If it is a private collection, client users
must be told the name of the collection, repository host, and
base directory;
these will be specified in the supfile via the
.B host
and
.B hostbase
options.
For a system-maintained file collection, entries must be
placed into the host list file and directory list file as described
in
.IR supservers (8).

Within the base directory, a subdirectory must be created called
.B sup .
Within this directory there must be a subdirectory for each
collection using that base directory, whose name is the name of the
collection; within each of these directories will be a
list file and possibly a prefix file, a host file, an encryption key
file, a log file and
a scan file.
The filenames are listed under FILES below.
.TP
.B prefix
Normally, all files in the collection are relative to the base directory.
This file contains a single line which is the name of a directory to be
used in place of the base directory for file references.
.TP
.B host
Normally,
all remote host machines are allowed access to a file collection.
If you wish to restrict access to specific remote hosts for this
collection,
put each allowed hostname on a
separate line of text in this file.
If a host has more than one name, only one of its names needs to be
listed.
The name
.B LOCAL
can be used to grant access to all hosts on the local
network. The host name may be a  numeric network adddress
or a network name. If a crypt appears on the same line as
the host name, that crypt will be used for that host. Otherwise,
the crypt appearing in the 
.I crypt
file, if any will be used. 
.TP
.B crypt
If you wish to use the
.I sup
data encryption mechanism, create an encryption file containing,
on a single line of text, the desired encryption key.
Client
processes must then specify the same key with the
.B crypt
option in the supfile or they will be denied access to the files.
In addition, actual network transmission of file contents and
filenames will be encrypted.
.TP
.B list
This file describes the actual list of files to be included in this
file collection, in a format described below.
.TP
.B releases
This file describes any releases that the collection may have. Each
line starts with the release name and then may specify any of the following
files: 
.I prefix=<dirname>
to use a different parent directory for the files in this release.
.I list=<listname>
to specify the list of files in the release.
.I scan=<scanfile>
must be used in multi-release collections that are scanned to keep
the scan files for the different releases separate.
.I host=<hostfile>
to allow different host restrictions for this release.
.I next=<release>
used to chain releases together. This has the effect of making one release
be a combination of serveral other releases. If the same file appears in
more than one chained release, the first one found will be used.
If these files are not specified for a release the default names:
prefix,list,scan and host will be used.
.TP
.B scan
This file, created by
.IR supscan ,
is the list of filenames that correspond to the instructions in the
list file.  The scan file is only used for frequently-updated file
collections; it makes the file server run much faster.  See
.IR supservers (8)
for more information.
.TP
.B lock
As previously mentioned, this file is used to indicate that the
collection should be locked while upgrades are in progress.  All
file servers will try to get shared access to the lock file with
.IR flock (2).
.TP
.B logfile
If a log file exists in the collection directory, the file server
will append the last time an upgrade was successfully completed,
the time the last upgrade started and finished, and the name of
the host requesting the upgrade.
.i0
.DT
.PP
It should be noted that
.I sup
allows several different named collections to use the same base
directory.  Separate encryption, remote host access, and file lists
are used for each collection, since these files reside in subdirectorie
.I <basedir>/sup/<coll.name>.

The list file is a text file with one command on each line.
Each command
contains a keyword and a number of operands separated by spaces.
All filenames in the list file are evaluated on the repository machine
relative to the host's base directory, or prefix directory if one is
specified, and on your machine with respect
to the base, or prefix, directory for the client.
The
.I filenames
below (except \fIexec-command\fR)
may all include wild-cards and meta-characters as used by
.IR csh (1)
including *, ?, [...], and {...}.  The commands are:
.TP
\fBupgrade\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The specified file(s) (or directories) will be included in the list
of files to be upgraded.
If a directory name is given, it recursively
includes all subdirectories and files within that directory.
.TP
\fBalways\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The always command is identical to upgrade, except that omit and
omitany commands do not affect filenames specified with the always
command.
.TP
\fBrename\fR \fIfilename\fR \fIdest-filename\fR...
The rename command allows for a file on the server to be placed on the
client under a different name.  To prevent confusion and ease its use,
the rename option implicitly omits any files on the server that have 
the same name as \fIdest-filename\fR.
.TP
\fBomit\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The specified file(s) (or directories) will be excluded from the
list of files to be upgraded.
For example, by specifying
.B upgrade /usr/vision
and
.B omit /usr/vision/exp,
the generated list
of files would include all subdirectories and files of /usr/vision
except /usr/vision/exp (and its subdirectories and files).
.TP
\fBomitany\fR \fIpattern\fR ...
The specified patterns are compared against the files in the upgrade
list.  If a pattern matches, the file is omitted.  The omitany command
currently supports all wild-card patterns except {...}.  Also, the
pattern must match the entire filename, so a leading */, or a trailing /*,
may be necessary in the pattern.
.TP
\fBbackup\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The specified file(s) are marked for backup; if they are upgraded
and the client has specified the
.B backup
option in the corresponding
line of the supfile, then backup copies will be created as described
above.
Directories may not be specified, and no recursive filename
construction is performed; you must specify the names of the specific
files to be backed up before upgrading.
.TP
\fBnoaccount\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The accounting information of the specified file(s) will not be
preserved by
.IR sup .
Accounting information consists of the owner,
group, mode and modified time of a file.
.TP
\fBsymlink\fR \fIfilename\fR ...
The specified file(s) are to be treated as symbolic links
and will be transfered as such and not followed.  By default,
.I sup
will follow symbolic links.
.TP
\fBrsymlink\fR \fIdirname\fR ...
All symbolic links in the specified directory and its
subdirectories are to be treated as symbolic links. That
is the links will be transferred and not the files to which
they point.
.TP
\fBexecute\fR \fIexec-command\fR (\fIfilename\fR ...)
The
.I exec-command
you specified will be executed on the client process
whenever any of the files listed in parentheses are upgraded.
A special token,
.B %s,
may be specified in the
.I exec-command
and will be replaced by the name of the file that was upgraded.
For example, if you say
\fBexecute ranlib %s (libc.a)\fR,
then whenever libc.a is upgraded, the client machine will execute
.B 
ranlib libc.a.
As described above, the client must invoke
.I sup
with the
.B -e
flag to allow the automatic execution of command files.  The timestamp
of the upgraded file is maintained even if the executed command might
change it so as to prevent an upgrade with every \fIsup\fR.
.TP
\fBinclude\fR \fIlistfile\fR ...
The specified
.I listfiles
will be read at this point.  This is useful
when one collection subsumes other collections; the larger collection
can simply specify the listfiles for the smaller collections contained
within it.
.i0
.DT
.PP
The order in which the command lines appear in the list file does not
matter.  Blank lines may appear freely in the list file.
