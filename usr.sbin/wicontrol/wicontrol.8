.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command controls the operation of WaveLAN/IEEE wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr wi 4
driver. Most of the parameters that can be changed relate to the
IEEE 802.11 protocol which the WaveLAN implements. This includes
the station name, whether the station is operating in ad-hoc (point
to point) or BSS (service set) mode, and the network name of a service
set to join (IBSS) if BSS mode is enabled. The
.Nm
command can also be used to view the current settings of these paremeters
and to dump out the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar iface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the WaveLAN/IEEE
device (wi0, wi1, etc...). Interface parameters should only be changed
when the interface is down. If the interface is already up, you should
use the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command to bring the interface down, then set the interface parameters
with
.Nm ,
and then bring the interface up again.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl i Ar iface Op Fl o
Display the current settings of the specified WaveLAN/IEEE interface.
This retrives the current card settings from the driver and prints them
out. Using the additional
.Fl o
flag will cause
.Nm
to print out the statistics counters instead of the card settings.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl t Ar tx rate
Set the transmit rate of the specified interface. The permitted values
for the transmit rate are 1, 2 and 3, where 1 is fixed 1Mbps, 2 is
fixed 2Mbps and 3 is 2Mbps with automatic fallback to 1Mbps. The default
driver setting is 3.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl n Ar network name
Set the name of the service set (IBSS) that this station wishes to
join. The
.Ar network name
can be any text string up to 30 characters in length. The default name
is the string "ANY" which should allow the station to connect to the first
available access point. The interface should be set for BSS mode using
the
.Fl p
flag in order for this to work.
.Pp
Note: the WaveLAN manual indicates that an empty string will allow the
host to connect to any access point, however I have also seen a reference
in another driver which indicates that the "ANY" string works as well.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl s Ar station name
Sets the
.Ar station name
for the specified interface. The
.Ar station name
is used for diagnostic purposes. The Lucent WaveMANAGER sofware can
poll the names of remove hosts.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl c Ar 0|1
Allow the station to create a service set (IBSS). Permitted values
are 0 (don't create IBSS) and 1 (enable creation of IBSS). The default
is 0.
.Pp
Note: this option is provided for experimental purposes only: enabling
the creation of an IBSS on a host system doesn't appear to actually work.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl q Ar SSID
Specify the name of an IBSS (SSID) to create on a given interface.
The
.Ar SSID
can be any text string up to 30 characters long.
.Pp
Note: this option is provided for experimental purposes only: enabling
the creation of an IBSS on a host system doesn't appear to actually work.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl p Ar port type
Set the
.Ar port type
for a specified interface. The legal values for
.Ar port type
are 1 (BSS mode) and 3 (ad-hoc) mode. In ad-hoc mode, the station can
comminicate directly with any other stations within direct radio range
(provided that they are also operating in ad-hoc mode). In BSS mode,
hosts must associate with a service set controlled by an access point,
which relays traffic between end stations. The default setting is 3
(ad-hoc mode).
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl a Ar access_point_density
Specify the
.Ar access point density
for a given interface. Legal values are 1 (low), 2 (medium) and 3 (high).
This setting influences some of the radio modem threshold settings.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl m Ar mac address
Set the station address for the specified interface. The
.Ar mac address
is specified as a series of six hexadecimal values separated by colons,
e.g.: 00:60:1d:12:34:56. This programs the new address into the card
and updates the interface as well.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl d Ar max_data_length
Set the maximum receive and transmit frame size for a specified interface.
The
.Ar max data length
can be any number from 350 to 2304. The default is 2304.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl r Ar RTS threshold
Set the RTS/CTS threshold for a given interface. This controls the
number of bytes used for the RTS/CTS handhake boundary. The
.Ar RTS threshold
can be any value between 0 and 2047. The default is 2347.
