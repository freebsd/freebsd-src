.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg
.Nd a utility for manipulating packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Ar command ...
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Cm add
.Op Fl fy
.Op Fl r Ar reponame
.Ar pkg.pkg
.Nm
.Fl N
.Nm
.Op Fl 46d
.Cm bootstrap
.Op Fl fy
.Op Fl r Ar reponame
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the package management tool.
It is used to manage local packages installed from
.Xr ports 7
and install/upgrade packages from remote repositories.
.Pp
To avoid backwards incompatibility issues, the actual
.Xr pkg 8
tool is not installed in the base system.
The first time invoked,
.Nm
will bootstrap the real
.Xr pkg 8
from a remote repository.
.Bl -tag
.It Nm Ar command ...
If
.Xr pkg 8
is not installed yet, it will be fetched, have its signature verified,
installed, and then have the original command forwarded to it.
If already installed, the command requested will be forwarded to the real
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Nm Cm add Oo Fl fy Oc Oo Fl r Ar reponame Oc Ar pkg.pkg
Install
.Xr pkg 8
from a local package instead of fetching from remote.
If signature checking is enabled, then the correct signature file
must exist and the signature valid before the package will be installed.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then
.Xr pkg 8
will be installed regardless if it is already installed.
If the
.Fl y
flag is specified, no confirmation will be asked when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
If a
.Ar reponame
has been specified, then the signature configuration for that repository will be
used.
.It Nm Fl N
Do not bootstrap, just determine if
.Xr pkg 8
is actually installed or not.
Returns 0 and the number of packages installed
if it is, otherwise 1.
.It Nm Oo Fl 46 Oc Cm bootstrap Oo Fl fy Oc \
Oo Fl r Ar reponame Oc
Attempt to bootstrap and do not forward anything to
.Xr pkg 8
after it is installed.
With
.Fl 4
and
.Fl 6 ,
.Nm
will force IPv4 or IPv6 respectively to fetch
.Xr pkg 8
and its signatures as needed.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then
.Xr pkg 8
will be fetched and installed regardless if it is already installed.
If the
.Fl y
flag is specified, no confirmation will be asked when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
If a
.Ar reponame
has been specified, then the configuration for that repository will be used.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d, Fl -debug
Show debug information.
May be specified more than once to increase the level of detail.
When specified twice,
.Xr fetch 3
debug output is enabled.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
Configuration varies in whether it is in a repository configuration file
or the global configuration file.
The default repository configuration for
.Fx
is stored in
.Pa /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf ,
and additional repository configuration files will be searched for in
.Ev REPOS_DIR ,
or
.Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
if it is unset.
.Pp
For bootstrapping,
.Nm
will process all repositories that it finds and use the last enabled repository
by default.
.Pp
Repository configuration is stored in the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
FreeBSD: {
  url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
  mirror_type: "srv",
  signature_type: "none",
  fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
  enabled: yes
}
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width signature_type -compact
.It url
Refer to
.Dv PACKAGESITE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It mirror_type
Refer to
.Dv MIRROR_TYPE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It signature_type
Refer to
.Dv SIGNATURE_TYPE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It fingerprints
Refer to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It enabled
Defines whether this repository should be used or not.
Valid values are
.Dv yes ,
.Dv true ,
.Dv 1 ,
.Dv no ,
.Dv false ,
.Dv 0 .
.El
.Pp
Global configuration can be stored in
.Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf
in the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
PACKAGESITE: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
MIRROR_TYPE: "srv",
SIGNATURE_TYPE: "none",
FINGERPRINTS: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES: "yes"
REPOS_DIR: ["/etc/pkg", "/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos"]
.Ed
.Pp
Reference
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
for each variable.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables can be set to override the settings
from the
.Pa pkg.conf
file used.
.Bl -tag -width "ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES"
.It Ev MIRROR_TYPE
This defines which mirror type should be used.
Valid values are
.Dv SRV ,
.Dv HTTP ,
.Dv NONE .
.It Ev ABI
This defines the ABI for the package to be installed.
Default ABI is determined from
.Pa /bin/sh .
.It Ev ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES
If set, no confirmation will be asked when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Ev SIGNATURE_TYPE
If set to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
then a signature will be required and validated against known
certificate fingerprints when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Ev FINGERPRINTS
If
.Sy SIGNATURE_TYPE
is set to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
this value should be set to the directory path where known fingerprints are
located.
.It Ev PACKAGESITE
The URL that
.Xr pkg 8
and other packages
will be fetched from.
.It Ev REPOS_DIR
Comma-separated list of directories that should be searched for repository
configuration files.
.El
.Sh FILES
Configuration is read from the files in the listed order.
This path can be changed by setting
.Ev REPOS_DIR .
The last enabled repository is the one used for bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Bl -tag -width "/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/*.conf"
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf
.It Pa /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/*.conf
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some examples are listed here.
The full list of available commands are available in
.Xr pkg 8
once it is bootstrapped.
.Pp
Search for a package:
.Dl $ pkg search perl
.Pp
Install a package:
.Dl % pkg install perl
.Pp
List installed packages:
.Dl $ pkg info
.Pp
Upgrade from remote repository:
.Dl % pkg upgrade
.Pp
List non-automatic packages:
.Dl $ pkg query -e '%a = 0' %o
.Pp
List automatic packages:
.Dl $ pkg query -e '%a = 1' %o
.Pp
Delete an installed package:
.Dl % pkg delete perl
.Pp
Remove unneeded dependencies:
.Dl % pkg autoremove
.Pp
Change a package from automatic to non-automatic, which will prevent
.Xr pkg-autoremove 8
from removing it:
.Dl % pkg set -A 0 perl
.Pp
Change a package from non-automatic to automatic, which will make
.Xr pkg-autoremove 8
allow it be removed once nothing depends on it:
.Dl % pkg set -A 1 perl
.Pp
Create package file from an installed package:
.Dl % pkg create -o /usr/ports/packages/All perl
.Pp
Determine which package installed a file:
.Dl $ pkg which /usr/local/bin/perl
.Pp
Audit installed packages for security advisories:
.Dl $ pkg audit
.Pp
Check installed packages for checksum mismatches:
.Dl # pkg check -s -a
.Pp
Check for missing dependencies:
.Dl # pkg check -d -a
.Pp
Fetch a package for a different
.Fx
version, along with all its dependencies:
.Dl # pkg -o ABI=FreeBSD:15:amd64 -o IGNORE_OSVERSION=yes fetch -o destdir -d perl

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 9.1 .

replacing the
pkg_install suite of tools
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_info 1 and
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
