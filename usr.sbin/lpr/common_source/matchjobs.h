 * The caller must choose the order that entries should be scanned:
 * 1) JSORDER: Matched jobs are processed (by calling the "doentry()"
 *    routine) in the order that the user specified those jobs.
 * 2) QORDER: Matched jobs are processed in the order that the jobs are
 *    listed the queue.  This guarantees that the "doentry()" routine
 *    will be called only once per job.
 *
 * There is a "job_matched" variable in struct jobqueue, which is used
 * to make sure that the "doentry()" will only be called once for any
 * given job in JSORDER processing.  The "doentry()" routine can turn
 * that off, if it does want to be called multiple times when the job
 * is matched by multiple specifiers.
 *
 * The JSORDER processing will also call the "doentry()" routine once
 * after each scan of the queue, with the jobqueue set to null.  This
 * provides a way for the caller to print out a summary message for
 * each jobspec that was given.
