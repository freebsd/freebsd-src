/*
 *	Control-files (cf*) have the following format.
 *
 *	Each control-file describes a single job.  It will list one or more
 *	"datafiles" (df*) which should be copied to some printer.  Usually
 *	there is only one datafile per job.  For the curious, RFC 1179 is an
 *	informal and out-of-date description of lpr/lpd circa 1990.
 *
 *	Each line in the file gives an attribute of the job as a whole, or one
 *	of the datafiles in the job, or a "command" indicating something to do
 *	with one of the datafiles.  Each line starts with an 'id' that indicates
 *	what that line is there for.  The 'id' is historically a single byte,
 *	but may be multiple bytes (obviously it would be best if multi-byte ids
 *	started with some letter not already used as a single-byte id!).
 *	After the 'id', the remainder of the line will be the value of the
 *	indicated attribute, or a name of the datafile to be operated on.
 *
 *	In the following lists of ids, the ids with a '!' in front of them are
 *	NOT explicitly supported by this version of lpd, or at least "not yet
 *	supported".  They are only listed for reference purposes, so people
 *	won't be tempted to reuse the same id for a different purpose.
 *
 *	The following are attributes of the job which should not appear more
 *	than once in a control file.  Only the 'H' and 'P' lines are required
 *	by the RFC, but some implementations of lpr won't even get that right.
 *
 *	! A   - [used by lprNG]
 *	  B   - As far as I know, this is never used as a single-byte id.
 *		Therefore, I intend to use it for multi-byte id codes.
 *	  C   - "class name" to display on banner page (this is sometimes
 *		used to hold options for print filters)
 *	! D   - [in lprNG, "timestamp" of when the job was submitted]
 *	! E   - "environment variables" to set [some versions of linux]
 *	  H   - "host name" of machine where the original 'lpr' was done
 *	  I   - "indent", the amount to indent output
 *	  J   - "job name" to display on banner page
 *	  L   - "literal" user's name as it should be displayed on the
 *		banner page (it is the existence of an 'L' line which
 *		indicates that a job should have a banner page).
 *	  M   - "mail", userid to mail to when done printing (with email
 *		going to 'M'@'H', so to speak).
 *	  P   - "person", the user's login name (e.g. for accounting)
 *	! Q   - [used by lprNG for queue-name]
 *	  R   - "resolution" in dpi, for some laser printer queues
 *	  T   - "title" for files sent thru 'pr'
 *	  W   - "width" to use for printing plain-text files
 *	  Z   - In BSD, "locale" to use for datafiles sent thru 'pr'.
 *		(this BSD usage should move to a different id...)
 *		[in lprNG - this line holds the "Z options"]
 *	  1   - "R font file" for files sent thru troff
 *	  2   - "I font file" for files sent thru troff
 *	  3   - "B font file" for files sent thru troff
 *	  4   - "S font file" for files sent thru troff
 *
 *	The following are attributes attached to a datafile, and thus may
 *	appear multiple times in a control file (once per datafile):
 *
 *	  N   - "name" of file (for display purposes, used by 'lpq')
 *	  S   - "stat() info" used for symbolic link ('lpr -s')
 *		security checks.
 *
 *	The following indicate actions to take on a given datafile.  The same
 *	datafile may appear on more than one "print this file" command in the
 *	control file.  Note that ALL ids with lowercase letters are expected
 *	to be actions to "print this file":
 *
 *	  c   - "file name", cifplot file to print.  This action appears
 *		when the user has requested 'lpr -c'.
 *	  d   - "file name", dvi file to print, user requested 'lpr -d'
 *	  f   - "file name", a plain-text file to print = "standard"
 *	  g   - "file name", plot(1G) file to print, ie 'lpr -g'
 *	  l   - "file name", text file with control chars which should
 *		be printed literally, ie 'lpr -l'  (note: some printers
 *		take this id as a request to print a postscript file,
 *		and because of *that* some OS's use 'l' to indicate
 *		that a datafile is a postscript file)
 *	  n   - "file name", ditroff(1) file to print, ie 'lpr -n'
 *	  o   - "file name", a postscript file to print.  This id is
 *		described in the original RFC, but not much has been
 *		done with it.  This 'lpr' does not generate control
 *		lines with 'o'-actions, but lpd's printjob processing
 *		will treat it the same as 'l'.
 *	  p   - "file name", text file to print with pr(1), ie 'lpr -p'
 *	  t   - "file name", troff(1) file to print, ie 'lpr -t'
 *	  v   - "file name", plain raster file to print
 *
 *	  U   - "file name" of datafile to unlink (ie, remove file
 *		from spool directory.  To be done in a 'Pass 2',
 *		AFTER having processed all datafiles in the job).

/*
 * This routine renames the temporary control file as received from some

 * for the control file.  Now if you read the RFC, you would think that all
 * control filenames start with `cfA*'.  However, it seems there are some
 * implementations which send control filenames which start with `cf'
 * followed by *any* letter, so this routine can not assume what the third
 * letter will (or will not) be.  Sigh.
 *
 * So this will rewrite the temporary file to `rf*' (correcting any lines
 * which need correcting), rename that `rf*' file to `cf*', and then remove
 * the original `tf*' temporary file.
 *
 * The *main* purpose of this routine is to be paranoid about the contents
 * of that control file.  It is partially meant to protect against people
 * TRYING to cause trouble (perhaps after breaking into root of some host
 * that this host will accept print jobs from).  The fact that we're willing
 * to print jobs from some remote host does not mean that we should blindly
 * do anything that host tells us to do.
 *
 * This is also meant to protect us from errors in other implementations of
 * lpr, particularly since we may want to use some values from the control
 * file as environment variables when it comes time to print, or as parameters
 * to commands which will be exec'ed, or values in statistics records.
 *
 * This may also do some "conversions" between how different versions of
 * lpr or lprNG define the contents of various lines in a control file.
 *
 * If there is an error, it returns a pointer to a descriptive error message.
 * Error messages which are RETURNED (as opposed to syslog-ed) do not include
 * the printer-queue name.  Let the caller add that if it is wanted.
