.Sh NAME
.Nm lptest
.Nd generate lineprinter ripple pattern
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar length
.Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes the traditional "ripple test" pattern on standard output.
In 96 lines,
this pattern will print all 96 printable
.Tn ASCII
characters
in each position.
While originally created to test printers, it is quite
useful for testing terminals,
driving terminal ports for debugging purposes,
or any other task where a quick supply of random data is needed.
.Pp
The
.Ar length
argument specifies the output line length if the default
length of 79 is inappropriate.
.Pp
The
.Ar count
argument specifies the number of output lines to be generated if
the default count of 200 is inappropriate.
Note that if
.Ar count
is to be specified,
.Ar length
must be also be specified.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
