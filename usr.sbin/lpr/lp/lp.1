.Sh NAME
.Nm lp
.Nd front-end to the print spooler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lp
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl d printer
.Op Fl n Ar num
.Op Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Lp
is a front-end to the print spooler as required by the
.St -p1003.2
specification.  It effectively invokes
.Xr lpr 1
with the proper set of arguments.

It generally prints the named files on the destination printer.
.Pp
Option
.Fl c
makes the
.Nm
command exit only after further access to any of the input files is no
longer required.  The application can then safely delete or modify the
files without affecting the output operation.

To specify a particular printer, option
.Fl d Ar dest
can be used.  If no
.Fl d
is provided on the command line, the contents of the environmental
variables
.Ev LPDEST
or
.Ev PRINTER
.Pq with this precedence
are taken as the destination printer.

Option
.Fl n Ar num
can be used to specify that
.Ar num
copies of each of the named files shall be printed.

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
As described above, the variables
.Ev LPDEST
and
.Ev PRINTER
are examined to select the destination printer.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpr 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm lp
command is expected to comply with the
.St -p1003.2
specification.
.Sh AUTHOR
This implementation of the
.Nm
command has been written by
.if t J\(:org Wunsch.
.if n Joerg Wunsch.
.Sh BUGS
The
.St -p1003.2
specification does not provide any means to print non-text files.  It
rather requires the files to be printed to be text files limited to
reasonable line lengths and printable characters.
