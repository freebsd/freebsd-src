.Sh NAME
.Nm rtadvd.conf
.Nd config file for router advertisement daemon
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This file describes how the router advertisement packet must be constructed
for each of the interfaces.
.Pp
It obeys the famous
.Xr termcap 5
file format.
Each line in the file describes a network interface.
Fields are separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&: ,
and each field contains one capability description.
Lines may be concatenated by
.Sq \e
character.
The comment marker is the
.Sq \#
character.
.Pp
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Capabilities describe the value to be filled into ICMPv6 router
advertisement messages and to control
.Xr rtadvd 8
behavior.
Therefore, you are encouraged to read IETF neighbor discovery documents
if you would like to modify the sample configuration file.
.Pp
Note that almost all items have default values.
If you omit an item, the default value of the item will be used.
.Pp
There are two items which control the interval of sending router advertisements.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&maxinterval
(num) The maximum time allowed between sending unsolicited
multicast router advertisements
.Pq unit: seconds .
The default value is 600.
Its value must be no less than 4 seconds
and no greater than 1800 seconds.
.It Cm \&mininterval
(num) The minimum time allowed between sending unsolicited multicast
router advertisements
.Pq unit: seconds .
The default value is the one third of value of
.Ic maxinterval.
Its value must be no less than 3 seconds and no greater than .75 *
the value of
.Ic maxinterval.
.El
.Pp
The following items are for ICMPv6 router advertisement message
header.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&chlim
(num) The value for Cur Hop Limit field.
The default value is 64.
.It Cm \&raflags
(num) Flags field in router advertisement message header.
Bit 7
.Po
.Li 0x80
.Pc
means Managed address configuration flag bit,
and Bit 6
.Po
.Li 0x40
.Pc
means Other stateful configuration flag bit.
The default value is 0.
.It Cm \&rltime
(num) Router lifetime field
.Pq unit: seconds .
Its value must be no greater than 3600000.
The default value is 1800.
.It Cm \&rtime
(num) Reachable time field
.Pq unit: milliseconds .
The default value is 0, which means unspecified by this router.
.It Cm \&retrans
(num) Retrans Timer field
.Pq unit: milliseconds .
The default value is 0, which means unspecified by this router.
.El
.Pp
The following items are for ICMPv6 prefix information option,
which will be attached to router advertisement header.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&addrs
(num) Number of prefixes.
Its default is 0, so it must explicitly be set to positve values
if you want to specify any prefix information option.
If its value is 0,
.Xr rtadvd 8
looks up the system routing table and
advertise the prefixes corresponding to interface routes
on the interface.
If its value is more than 1, you must specify the index of the prefix
for each item below.
Indices vary from 0 to N-1, where N is the
value of
.Ic addrs .
Each index shall follow the name of each item, e.g.,
.Dq prefixlen2 .
.It Cm \&prefixlen
(num) Prefix length field.
The default value is 64.
.It Cm \&pinfoflags
(num) Flags field in prefix information option.
Bit 7
.Po
.Li 0x80
.Pc
means On-link flag bit,
and Bit 6
.Po
.Li 0x40
.Pc
means Autonomous address-configuration flag bit.
The default value is 0xc0, i.e., both bits are set.
.It Cm \&addr
(str) The address filled into Prefix field.
Since
.Dq \&:
is used for
.Xr termcap 5
file format as well as IPv6 numeric address, the field MUST be quoted by
doublequote character.
This field cannot be
omitted if the value of
.Ic addrs
is more than 0.
.It Cm \&vltime
(num) Valid lifetime field
.Pq unit: seconds .
The default value is 2592000(30 days).
.It Cm \&pltime
(num) Preferred lifetime field
.Pq unit: seconds .
The default value is 604800(7 days).
.El
.Pp
The following items are for ICMPv6 MTU option,
which will be attached to router advertisement header.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&mtu
(num or str) MTU (maximum transmission unit) field.
If 0 is specified, it means that the option will not be included.
The default value is 0.
If the special string
.Dq auto
is specified for this item, MTU option will be included and its value
will be set to the interface MTU automatically.
.El
.Pp
The following item controls ICMPv6 source link-layer address option,
which will be attached to router advertisement header.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&nolladdr
(bool) By default
.Po
if
.Cm \&nolladdr
is not specified
.Pc ,
.Xr rtadvd 8
will try to get link-layer address for the interface from the kernel,
and attach that in source link-layer address option.
If this capability exists,
.Xr rtadvd 8
will not attach source link-layer address option to
router advertisement packets.
.El
.Pp
The following item controls ICMPV6 home agent information option,
which was defined with mobile IPv6 support.
It will be attached to router advertisement header just like other options do.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm \&hapref
(num) Specifies home agent preference.
If set to non-zero,
.Cm \&hatime
must be present as well.
.It Cm \&hatime
(num) Specifies home agent lifetime.
.El
.Pp
When mobile IPv6 support is turned on for
.Xr rtadvd 8 ,
advertisement interval option will be attached to router advertisement
packet, by configuring
.Cm \&maxinterval
explicitly.
.Pp
You can also refer one line from another by using
.Cm tc
capability.
See
.Xr termcap 5
for details on the capability.
