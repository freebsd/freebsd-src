.Nd determine filesystem type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl u
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to determine the filesystem type on a given device.
It can recognize BeFS (BeOS), ISO-9660, exFAT, Ext2, FAT, NTFS, and UFS filesystems.
When the
.Fl u
flag is specified,
.Nm
also recognizes certain additional metadata formats that cannot be
handled using
.Xr mount 8 ,
such as
.Xr geli 8
providers, and
ZFS pools.
.Pp
The filesystem name is printed to the standard output
as, respectively:
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
befs
.It
cd9660
.It
exfat
.It
ext2fs
.It
geli
.It
hammer
.It
hammer2
.It
msdosfs
.It
ntfs
.It
ufs
.It
zfs
.El
.Pp
Because
.Nm
is built specifically to detect filesystem types, it differs from
.Xr file 1
in several ways.
The output is machine-parsable, filesystem labels are supported,
the utility runs sandboxed using
.Xr capsicum 4 ,
and does not try to recognize any file format other than filesystems.
.Pp
These options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl l"
.It Fl l
In addition to filesystem type, print filesystem label if available.
.It Fl s
Ignore file type.
By default,
.Nm
only works on regular files and disk-like device nodes.
Trying to read other file types might have unexpected consequences or hang
indefinitely.
.It Fl u
Include filesystems and devices that cannot be mounted directly by
.Xr mount 8 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs or the filesystem
type is not recognized.
