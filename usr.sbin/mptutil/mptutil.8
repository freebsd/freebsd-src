.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to display or modify various parameters on LSI
Fusion-MPT controllers.
Each invocation of
.Nm
consists of zero or more global options followed by a command.
Commands may support additional optional or required arguments after the
command.
.Pp
Currently one global option is supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl u Ar unit
.Ar unit
specifies the unit of the controller to work with.
If no unit is specified,
then unit 0 is used.
.El
.Pp
Volumes may be specified in two forms.
First,
a volume may be identified by its location as
.Sm off
.Op Ar xx Ns \&:
.Ar yy
.Sm on
where
.Ar xx
is the bus ID and
.Ar yy
is the target ID.
If the bus ID is omitted,
the volume is assumed to be on bus 0.
Second,
on the volume may be specified by the corresponding
.Em daX
device,
such as
.Em da0 .
.Pp
The
.Xr mpt 4
controller divides drives up into two categories.
Configured drives belong to a RAID volume either as a member drive or as a hot
spare.
Each configured drive is assigned a unique device ID such as 0 or 1 that is
show in
.Cm show config ,
and in the first column of
.Cm show drives .
Any drive not associated with a RAID volume as either a member or a hot spare
is a standalone drive.
Standalone drives are visible to the operating system as SCSI disk devices.
As a result, drives may be specified in three forms.
First,
a configured drive may be identified by its device ID.
Second,
any drive may be identified by its location as
.Sm off
.Ar xx Ns \&:
.Ar yy
.Sm on
where
.Ar xx
is the bus ID and
.Ar yy
is the target ID for each drive as displayed in
.Cm show drives .
Note that unlike volumes,
a drive location always requires the bus ID to avoid confusion with device IDs.
Third,
a standalone drive that is not part of a volume may be identified by its
corresponding
.Em daX
device as displayed in
.Cm show drives .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports several different groups of commands.
The first group of commands provide information about the controller,
the volumes it manages, and the drives it controls.
The second group of commands are used to manage the physical drives
attached to the controller.
The third group of commands are used to manage the logical volumes
managed by the controller.
The fourth group of commands are used to manage the drive configuration for
the controller.
.Pp
The informational commands include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm version
Displays the version of
.Nm .
.It Cm show adapter
Displays information about the RAID controller such as the model number.
.It Cm show config
Displays the volume and drive configuration for the controller.
Each volume is listed along with the physical drives that the volume spans.
If any hot spare drives are configured, then they are listed as well.
.It Cm show drives
Lists all of the physical drives attached to the controller.
.It Cm show events
Display all the entries from the controller's event log.
Due to lack of documentation this command is not very useful currently and
just dumps each log entry in hex.
.It Cm show volumes
Lists all of the logical volumes managed by the controller.
.El
.Pp
The physical drive management commands include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm fail Ar drive
Mark
.Ar drive
as
.Dq failed requested .
Note that this state is different from the
.Dq failed
state that is used when the firmware fails a drive.
.Ar Drive
must be a configured drive.
.It Cm online Ar drive
Mark
.Ar drive
as an online drive.
.Ar Drive
must be part a configured drive in either the
.Dq offline
or
.Dq failed requested
states.
.It Cm offline Ar drive
Mark
.Ar drive
as offline.
.Ar Drive
must be a configured, online drive.
.El
.Pp
The logical volume management commands include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm name Ar volume Ar name
Sets the name of
.Ar volume
to
.Ar name .
.It Cm volume cache Ar volume Ar enable|enabled|disable|disabled
Enables or disables the drive write cache for the member drives of
.Ar volume .
.It Cm volume status Ar volume
Display more detailed status about a single volume including the current
progress of a rebuild operation if one is being performed.
.El
.Pp
The configuration commands include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm clear
Delete the entire configuration including all volumes and spares.
All drives will become standalone drives.
.It Xo Cm create Ar type
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl s Ar stripe_size
.Ar drive Ns Op \&, Ns Ar drive Ns Op ",..."
.Xc
Create a new volume.
The
.Ar type
specifies the type of volume to create.
Currently supported types include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm raid0
Creates one RAID0 volume spanning the drives listed in the single drive list.
.It Cm raid1
Creates one RAID1 volume spanning the drives listed in the single drive list.
.It Cm raid1e
Creates one RAID1E volume spanning the drives listed in the single drive list.
.El
.Pp
.Sy Note:
Not all volume types are supported by all controllers.
.Pp
If the
.Fl q
flag is specified after
.Ar type ,
then a
.Dq quick
initialization of the volume will be done.
This is useful when the drives do not contain any existing data that need
to be preserved.
.Pp
If the
.Fl v
flag is specified after
.Ar type ,
then more verbose output will be enabled.
Currently this just provides notification as drives are added to volumes
when building the configuration.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
.Ar stripe_size
parameter allows the stripe size of the array to be set.
By default a stripe size of 64K is used.
The list of valid values for a given
.Ar type
are listed in the output of
.Cm show adapter .
.It Cm delete Ar volume
Delete the volume
.Ar volume .
Member drives will become standalone drives.
.It Cm add Ar drive Op Ar volume
Mark
.Ar drive
as a hot spare.
.Ar Drive
must not be a member of a volume.
If
.Ar volume
is specified,
then the hot spare will be dedicated to that volume.
Otherwise,
.Ar drive
will be used as a global hot spare backing all volumes for this controller.
Note that
.Ar drive
must be as large as the smallest drive in all of the volumes it is going to
back.
.It Cm remove Ar drive
Remove the hot spare
.Ar drive
from service.
It will become a standalone drive.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Mark the drive at bus 0 target 4 as offline:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Cm offline 0:4
.Pp
Create a RAID1 array from the two standalone drives
.Va da1
and
.Va da2 :
.Pp
.Dl Nm Cm create raid1 da1,da2
.Pp
Mark standalone drive
.Va da3
as a global hot spare:
.Pp
.Dl Nm Cm add da3

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The handling of spare drives appears to be unreliable.
The
.Xr mpt 4
firmware manages spares via spare drive
.Dq pools .
There are eight pools numbered 0 through 7.
Each spare drive can only be assigned to a single pool.
Each volume can be backed by any combination of zero or more spare pools.
The
.Nm
utility attempts to use the following algorithm for managing spares.
Global spares are always assigned to pool 0,
and all volumes are always backed by pool 0.
For dedicated spares,
.Nm
assigns one of the remaining 7 pools to each volume and
assigns dedicated drives to that pool.
In practice however, it seems that assigning a drive as a spare does not
take effect until the box has been rebooted.
Also, the firmware renumbers the spare pool assignments after a reboot
which undoes the effects of the algorithm above.
Simple cases such as assigning global spares seem to work ok
.Pq albeit requiring a reboot to take effect
but more
.Dq exotic
configurations may not work reliably.
.Pp
Drive configuration commands result in an excessive flood of messages on the
console.
.Pp
The mpt version 1 API that is used by
.Nm
and
.Xr mpt 4
does not support volumes above two terabytes.
This is a limitation of the API.
If you are using this adapter with volumes larger than two terabytes, use the adapter in JBOD mode.
Utilize
.Xr geom 8 ,
.Xr zfs 8 ,
or another software volume manager to work around this limitation.
