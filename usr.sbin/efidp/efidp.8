.Sh NAME
.Nm efidp
.Nd UEFI Device Path manipulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fp
.Op Fl -parse
.Op Fl -format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program converts
.Dq Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
.Pq UEFI
Device Paths, as defined in the UEFI standard, to and from binary form.
Binary and textual forms are defined in Chapter 9 of the UEFI
Specification.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20m
.It Fl f Fl -format
Formats a binary UEFI Device Path into its canonical UTF-8 textual form.
A binary Device Path can be no longer than 65536 bytes.
The textual form must fit into 65536 bytes.
Multiple binary device paths may be specified.
.It Fl p Fl -parse
Parses a UEFI Device Path UTF-8 specification and outputs the binary
Device Path form.
Only one device path is parsed, even if there are multiple present in
the input.
Leading white space is ignored.
The resulting binary Device Path can be no longer than 65536 bytes.
Multiple lines may be specified.
Each one will be translated.
.It Fl e Fl --to-efi
Translate a Unix file path to an EFI Device Path.
The output is the textual representation of the EFI Device Path.
.It Fl u Fl --to-unix
Translate an EFI device path to a Unix file path.
The input is the textual representation of the EFI Device Path.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
Appendix A of the UEFI specification has the format for GUIDs.
All GUIDs
.Dq Globally Unique Identifiers
have the format described in RFC 4122.
.Pp
The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification is available
from
.Pa www.uefi.org .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 11.1 .
