.Sh NAME
.Nm jexec
.Nd "execute a command inside an existing jail"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl u Ar username | Fl U Ar username
.Ar jail Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes
.Ar command
inside the
.Ar jail
identified by its jid or name.
If
.Ar command
is not specified then the user's shell is used.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
Execute in a clean environment.
The environment is discarded except for
.Ev HOME , SHELL , TERM , USER ,
and anything from the login class capability database for the user.
.Ev PATH
is set to "/bin:/usr/bin".
.It Fl u Ar username
The user name from host environment as whom the
.Ar command
should run.
This is the default.
.It Fl U Ar username
The user name from jailed environment as whom the
.Ar command
should run.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Example 1 : Open a shell in a jail
The following command specifies a jail by its name and utilizes the current
user's shell:
.Pp
.Dl # jexec name
.Pp
It is also possible to specify a jail by its jid:
.Pp
.Dl # jexec JID
.Ss Example 2 : Run a single command without opening a shell
The following command runs
.Ql uname -a
in a jail called
.Dq name .
Since a command is specified explicitly,
.Nm
does not spawn an interactive shell.
Instead,
.Nm
executes the specified command directly.
.Pp
.Dl # jexec name uname -a
.Ss Example 3 : Open a shell in a jail with a clean environment
The following command opens a
.Xr sh 1
shell in a jail with a clean environment:
.Pp
.Dl # jexec -l name sh
.Ss Example 4 : Open a shell in a jail with the login command
The following command utilizes
.Xr login 1
to access the jail, submitting an audit record, and displaying the
user's last login, system copyright, and
.Xr motd 5
message:
.Pp
.Dl # jexec -l name login -f root
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr jail_attach 2 ,
.Xr jail 8 ,
.Xr jls 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was added in
.Fx 5.1 .
.Sh BUGS
If the jail is not identified by
.Ar jid
there is a possible race in between the lookup of the jail
and executing the command inside the jail.
Giving a
.Ar jid
has a similar race as another process can stop the jail and
start another one after the user looked up the
.Ar jid .
