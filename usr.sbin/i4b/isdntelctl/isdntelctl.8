.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to configure the sound format
conversion facilities of the /dev/i4btel interfaces.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Clear the telephone input queue.
.It Fl g
Get the sound format currently in use.
.It Fl u
Set the /dev/i4btel unit number.
The default value is zero to access
device /dev/i4btel0.
.It Fl A
Do A-law (ISDN line) -> u-law (userland) conversion.
.It Fl U
Do u-law (ISDN line) -> A-law (userland) conversion.
.It Fl N
Set sound conversion to do no format conversion.
.El
.Pp
The telephony data stream comes out of the line in a bit-reversed format,
so the
.Xr i4btel 4
driver does the bit-reversion process in any case.
.Pp
Additionally, the user can specify to do A-law to u-law, u-law to A-law
or no conversion at all in the i4btel driver by using the
.Nm
utility.
.Sh FILES
/dev/i4btel<n>
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdntelctl -g
.Ed
.Pp
displays the currently used sound format for device /dev/i4btel0.
