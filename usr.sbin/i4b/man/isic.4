.Sh NAME
.Nm isic
.Nd isdn4bsd Siemens ISDN Chipset device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device isic"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides D-channel layer 1 supports as specified in ITU Recommendation
I.430 and layer 1 support for the B-channel.
.Pp
The driver supports several 8 and 16bit passive ISA, ISA PnP and PCI 
ISDN cards from various manufacturers which are all based upon the 
popular Siemens ISDN chipset consisting of the ISDN Subscriber Access 
Controller ISAC (such as the PEB2085 or PSB 2186) and the High-Level 
Serial Communications Controller Extended HSCX (such as the SAB82525 
or PSB21525). 
The newer IPAC chip (which integrates an ISAC and a HSCX in one chip,
with the added benefit of larger FIFO buffers) is also supported.
.Sh SUPPORTED CARDS: ISA bus, NON-PnP

.Pp
Valid values for hint.isic.N.irq are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
.Pp
The i/o ports are memory mapped and the memory start address (hint.isic.N.maddr)
may be in the range 0xA0000 to 0xDF000 and use a region of 4kB of memory.

.Ed
.Pp
These boards have a jumper which specifies an i/o base address
(hint.isic.N.port) of either 0xd80, 0xe80 or 0xf80. 
The remaining necessary configuration values are then
programmed at run time by accessing this i/o port.
.Pp
Valid interrupts (hint.isic.N.irq) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 or 15.
.Pp
Valid memory start addresses (hint.isic.N.maddr) are

0xDE000.
.Pp
Notice: Although the jumpers are labeled 0xd80, 0xe80 or 0xf80, they
also require i/o space at addresses 0x180, 0x280 or 0x380.

.Pp
Older Versions of the AVM A1 also require setting of an IRQ jumper, newer
versions of this and the Fritz!Card only have an i/o base jumper and the
interrupt is setup at runtime by reprogramming a register.

.Sh CAVEATS
Note that all of ISA boards with i/o ports actually use several ranges
of port addresses; Teles happen to refer to the 0xd80 range in their
documentation (the board also uses 0x180 etc.), while AVM happen to refer
to the 0x200 range in their documentation (the board also uses 0x600 etc.)
The driver matches the manufacturers' description for the purposes of
configuration, but of course makes use of all the ports in order to
operate the card.
.Sh BUGS
Since there is no hardware documentation available from the manufacturers
of several boards, it is likely that there are many bugs left.
