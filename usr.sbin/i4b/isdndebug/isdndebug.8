.Sh NAME
.Nm isdndebug
.Nd control debugging handling inside isdn4bsd kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl l Ar layer
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl s Ar value
.Op Fl u Ar unit
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl H
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm isdndebug
is part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to control debugging output
of the isdn4bsd kernel part. Every layer of the isdn4bsd kernel uses a
debugging mask which can be manipulated using this utility.
.Pp
A second usage of
.Nm
is to display and reset the HSCX error counters.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to display errors only.
.It Fl g
Get the debugging mask for the selected layer(s).
.It Fl h
Display the HSCX error counters.
.It Fl l
Specify the layer for which a command applies. Default is all layers.
.It Fl m
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to display all possible
debugging messages (maximum output).
.It Fl r
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to the compiled in default
(reset).
.It Fl s
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to value. Value can be
specified in any number base supported by
.Xr sscanf 3 .
.It Fl u
Set the unit numbers for the -h and -H flags.
.It Fl z
Set debugging mask for the selected layer(s) to no output at all (zero).
.It Fl H
Reset the HSCX error counters to zero.
.El
.Pp
.Sh FILES
/dev/i4bctl

.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isdndebug -g
.Ed
.Pp
displays the current debugging level for all ISDN layers
