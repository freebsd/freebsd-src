.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc
contains (if not otherwise specified on the command line) the runtime
configuration for the
.Xr isdnd 8
ISDN connection management daemon which is part of the isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The configuration file consists of keywords which start in column 1 followed by
one or more spaces or tabs, an equal sign, one or more spaces or tabs
and a keyword dependent parameter value.
.Pp
A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment line.
.Pp
For keywords requiring the specification of a boolean value, the truth
value can be either
.Em yes

In the
.Em system
section parameters regarding the daemon operation or parameters
not associated with a single remote connection can be set.
In the
.Em controller
section parameters regarding a particular controller can be set.
In the
.Em entry
section(s) parameters directly associated with a single remote
connection can be set.

.Em Note :
this feature is considered experimental!
The parameter to this keyword is a string specifying a time range within
which this entry is valid.
The time specification consists of a list of weekdays and/or a holiday
indicator ( see also the
.Em holidayfile
keyword in the system section ) separated by commas followed by an optional
daytime range specification in the form hh:mm-hh:mm.
The weekdays are specified as numbers from 0 to 6 and the number 7 for
holidays:

.Sh IDLETIME CALCULATION AND SHORT-HOLD MODE
.Bl -tag -width "incoming calls
.It Li incoming calls
It is assumed that the calling side knows most about charging structures and
such and as a consequence only the keyword
.Em idletime-incoming
has a function for incoming calls.
.Pp
For incoming calls the line is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-incoming
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typically,
.Em idletime-incoming
is used as a last resort and is therefore set much higher than a charging
unit time: typical values are one to five minutes.
.It Li outgoing calls
Outgoing call disconnect time can be setup in one of three ways:
.Bl -tag -width "shorthold mode
.It Li simple mode
For simple mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em fix-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
must be 0 (zero) and
.Em idletime-outgoing
greater zero.
.Pp
The outgoing traffic is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-outgoing
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typical values in simple mode are 10 to 30 seconds.
.It Li shorthold mode for fixed unit charging
For shorthold mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em fix-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Em earlyhangup
must be >= 0 (zero).

.Ed
.Pp
During the unchecked window which is (unitlength - (idle-time+earlyhangup))
in length, no idle check is done.
After the unchecked window has ended,
the line is checked for idle-time length if no traffic takes place.
In case
there was traffic detected in the check-window, the same procedure is restarted
at the beginning of the next unit.
In case no traffic was detected during
the check-window, the line is closed at the end of the check window.
.Pp
Notice:
.Em unitlength
must (!) be greater than the sum of
.Em idletime-outgoing
and
.Em earlyhangup !
.It Li shorthold mode for variable unit charging
For shorthold mode, the
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em var-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Pp
This shorthold mode is suitable when your calls are billed on
the elapse time of the call plus a fixed connection charge.
For example British Telecom bill this way.
.Pp
Each call is divided into two periods, the first is the
.Em unchecked
period and the second is the
.Em checked .
The
.Em checked
period starts 1 second before the first units time expires.
.Pp
During the
.Em checked
period if there is no traffic for
.Em idle-time
seconds the call is disconnected.

.Ed
.Pp
Experience shows that useful values for idle-time are from 15 to 30 seconds.
.Pp
If idle-time is too short an application that is not yet finished with the
network will cause a new call to be placed.
