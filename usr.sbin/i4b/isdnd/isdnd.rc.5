.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnd.rc
.Nd isdn4bsd ISDN connection management daemon config file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc
contains (if not otherwise specified on the command line) the runtime
configuration for the 
.Xr isdnd 8
ISDN connection management daemon which is part of the isdn4bsd package.
.Pp
The configuration file consists of keywords which start in column 1 followed by
one or more spaces or tabs, an equal sign, one or more spaces or tabs
and a keyword dependent parameter value.
.Pp
A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment line.
.Pp
For keywords requiring the specification of a boolean value, the truth
value can be either
.Em yes
or
.Em on
while the false value can be either
.Em no
or
.Em off .
.Pp
The configuration file consists of one
.Em system
section, one or more optional
.Em controller
sections and one or more
.Em entry
sections.
In the
.Em system
section parameters regarding the daemon operation or parameters 
not associated with a single remote connection can be set.
In the
.Em controller
section parameters regarding a particular controller can be set.
In the
.Em entry
section(s) parameters directly associated with a single remote
connection can be set.
.Pp
The following keywords are recognized by
.Nm isdnd :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width system -compact

.It Li system

or no charging information is available or is not subscribed.
(optional)

.It Li acctfile
Specifies the name of the accounting file which is used when the keyword
.Em useacctfile
(see below) is set to 
.Em on .
See also system keyword
.Em rotatesuffix .
If this keyword is omitted the system default is used.
(optional)

.It Li aliasing

.Em on ,
date/time information from the exchange (if provided) is written to the
logfile.
The default is off.
(optional)

.It Li mailer
This keyword is used to specify the path/name of a mail program which
which is able to use the "-s" flag to specify a subject on its 
command line.
In case of a fatal error exit of
.Nm
this program is used to send mail to an administrator specified by
the keyword
.Em mailto .
(optional)

.It Li mailto
This keyword is used to specify the email address of someone to notify
in case of a fatal error exit of
.Nm .
(See also keyword

.It Li monitor-port
sets the TCP port number for remote monitoring.
This integer parameter is optional and is set to port 451 by default.

.It Li monitor
This keyword specifies a local socket name or a host or network for remote
monitoring.
The 
.Em monitor 
specification may either be:
.Pp

.It Ar the name of a local (UNIX-domain) socket
this MUST start with a "/", example: /var/run/isdn-monitor
.It Ar a dotted-quad host specification

.It Li regexpr
This keyword is used to specify regular expressions.
It can be specified
more than once up to a compile time dependent value (currently set to 5 by
the MAX_RE definition in the source).
.Pp
All specified regular expressions are compared to the log strings at runtime
and if a match is found, a program is run with the log text as a parameter
(see also the keyword
.Em regprog
below).
.Pp
For an explanation how regular expressions are specified, please have a
look at
.Xr re_format 7
and
.Xr regex 3 .
The
.Em extended
regular expression syntax is supported here.
.Pp
Hint: it might be necessary to properly quote the expression to avoid
improper interpretation by the configuration file parser.
(optional)

.It Li regprog
This keyword is used to specify the name of a program which is run in
case a corresponding regular expression is matched by a logging string.

(optional)

.It Li rotatesuffix
Specifies a suffix for renaming the log- and the accountingfilename.
In case
rotatesuffix is used and a USR1 signal is sent to isdnd, the logfile and the
accounting file is not only closed and reopened but the old logfile is also
renamed to the former filename with the rotatesuffix string appended.
If this keyword is omitted, the logfiles are just closed and reopened; this
is also the default behaviour.

got from the telephone exchange.
.Pp
This keyword is mandatory for the ipr interfaces.

When dialing
out to a remote site, the number specified here is put into the
.Em "Called Party Number Information Element" .

This keyword is mandatory for the
.Em ipr
interfaces.
It may be specified more than once to try to dial to several
numbers until one succeeds.

got from the telephone exchange.
.Pp
This keyword is mandatory for the ipr interfaces.
.Pp

.It Li usedown
is used to enable the use of the keywords
.Em downtries
and
.Em downtime
in the entries section(s). It is used in the
.Nm isdnd
daemon to dynamically enable and disable the IP interfaces to avoid excessive
dialing activities in case of transient failures (such as busy lines).
This parameter is optional and is set to
.Em off
by default.

.It Li connectprog

address negotiation is complete (i.e.: the connection is useable).
.Nm Isdnd
expects to find the program below the path
.Pa /etc/isdn
which is prepended to the string specified as a parameter to this keyword.
The programs specified by connect and disconnect will get the following
command line arguments: -d (device) -f (flag) [ -a (addr) ] where

.Em flag
will be "up" if connection just got up, or "down" if interface changed to down 
state and

(optional, only if it can be figured out by isdnd). (optional)

.It Li disconnectprog
specifies a program run everytime after a connection was shut down.
.Nm Isdnd
expects to find the program below the path
.Pa /etc/isdn
which is prepended to the string specified as a parameter to this keyword.
(optional)

.El
.El

.Sh IDLETIME CALCULATION AND SHORTHOLD MODE
.Bl -tag -width incoming calls -compact
.It Li incoming calls
It is assumed that the calling side knows most about charging structures and
such and as a consequence only the keyword
.Em idletime-incoming
has a function for incoming calls.
.Pp
For incoming calls the line is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-incoming
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typically,
.Em idletime-incoming
is used as a last resort and is therefore set much higher than a charging
unit time: typical values are one to five minutes.

.It Li outgoing calls
Outgoing call disconnect time can be setup in one of three ways:

.Bl -tag -width shorthold mode -compact
.It Li simple mode
For simple mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em fix-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength
must be 0 (zero) and
.Em idletime-outgoing
greater zero. 
.Pp
The outgoing traffic is constantly monitored, and in case there was
not traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
.Em idletime-outgoing
the call is closed.
.Pp
Typical values in simple mode are 10 to 30 seconds.

.It Li shorthold mode for fixed unit charging
For shorthold mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
 must be
.Em fix-unit-size
 and the selected
.Em unitlength 
and 
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Em earlyhangup must be >= 0 (zero).

.Bd -literal

|<unchecked-window>|<checkwindow>|<safetywindow>|
|                  |             |              |
+------------------+-------------+--------------+
|                  |             |              |
|                  |<-idle-time->|<earlyhangup->|
|<--------------unitlength--------------------->|

.Ed

During the unchecked window which is (unitlength - (idle-time+earlyhangup))
in length, no idle check is done.
After the unchecked window has ended,
the line is checked for idle-time length if no traffic takes place.
In case
there was traffic detected in the check-window, the same procedure is restarted
at the beginning of the next unit.
In case no traffic was detected during
the check-window, the line is closed at the end of the check window.
.Pp
Notice: 
.Em unitlength
must (!) be greater than the sum of
.Em idletime-outgoing
and
.Em earlyhangup !

.It Li shorthold mode for variable unit charging
For shorthold mode, the 
.Em idle-algorithm-outgoing
must be
.Em var-unit-size
and the selected
.Em unitlength 
and
.Em idletime-outgoing
must be greater than 0 (zero);
.Pp

This shorthold mode is suitable when your calls are billed on
the elapse time of the call plus a fixed connection charge.
For example British Telecom bill this way.
.Pp

Each call is divided into two periods, the first is the
.Em unchecked
period and the second is the
.Em checked
. The
.Em checked
period starts 1 second before the first units time expires.
.Pp
During the
.Em checked
period if there is no traffic for
.Em idle-time
seconds the call is disconnected.
.Pp

.Bd -literal

|<---unchecked------------------>|<------checked------>
+------------------+-------------+
|                  |<-idle-time->|
|<--------------unitlength------->|

.Ed

Experience shows that useful values for idle-time are from 15 to 30 seconds.
.Pp
If idle-time is too short an application that is not yet finished with the
network will cause a new call to be placed.
