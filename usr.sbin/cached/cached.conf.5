.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cached.conf
.Nd "caching daemon configuration file manual page"
.Sh "DESCRIPTION"
.Nm
is used by the
.Xr cached 8
daemon and is read on its startup. Its syntax is mostly similar to the
nscd.conf syntax in Linux and Solaris. It has some differences, though -
see them below.
.Pp
Each line specifies either an attribute and a value, or an attribute,
a cachename and a value. Usual cachenames are passwd, groups, hosts,
services, protocols and rpc. You can also use any other cachename
(for example, if some third-party application uses nsswitch).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Pair
.It Sy threads [value]
Number of threads, which would listen for connections and process requests. The
minimum is 1. The default value is 8.
.It Sy enable-cache [cachename] [yes|no]
Enables or disables the cache for specified cachename.
.It Sy positive-time-to-live [cachename] [value]
Sets the TTL (time-to-live) for the specified cache in seconds. Larger values
can increase system's performance, but they also can affect the cache
coherence. The default value is 3600.
.It Sy positive-policy [cachename] [fifo|lru|lfu]
The policy that is applied to erase some of the cache elements, when the
size limit of the given cachename is exceeded. Possible policies are:
fifo (first-in-first-out), lru (least-recently-used),
lfu (least-frequently-used). The default policy is lru.
.It Sy negative-time-to-live [cachename] [value]
The TTL of the negative cached elements in seconds. The larger values can
significantly increase system performance in some environments
(when dealing with files with UIDs, which are not in system databases,
for example). This number should be kept low to avoid the cache
coherence problems. The default value is 60.
.It Sy negative-policy [cachename] [fifo|lru|lfu]
The same as the positive-policy, but this one is applied to the negative
elements of the given cachename. The default policy is fifo.
.It Sy suggested-size [cachename] [value]
This is the internal hash table size. The value should be a prime number
for optimum performance. You should only change this value when the number
of cached elements is significantly (in 5-10 times) greater then the default
hash table size (255).
.It Sy keep-hot-count [cachename] [value]
The size limit of the cache with the given cachename. When it is exceeded,
the policy will be applied. The default value is 2048.
.It Sy perform-actual-lookups [cachename] [yes|no]
If enabled, the
.Xr cached 8
doesn't simply receive and cache the NSS-requests results, but performs
all the lookups by itself and only returns the responses. If this feature is
enabled, then for the given cachename
.Xr cached 8
will act similarly to the NSCD.
.Pp
.Pa NOTE:
this feature is currently experimental - it supports only passwd, groups and
services cachenames.
.Sh "NOTES"
