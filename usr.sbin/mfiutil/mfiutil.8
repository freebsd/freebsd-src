.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to display or modify various parameters on LSI
MegaRAID SAS RAID controllers.
Each invocation of
.Nm
consists of zero or more global options followed by a command.
Commands may support additional optional or required arguments after the
command.
.Pp
Currently three global options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D Ar device
.Ar device
specifies the device node of the controller to use.
.Pa /dev/
will be added to the device node if needed.
If no device node is specified,
then device will be made of the type and device.
.It Fl t Ar type
.Ar type
specifies the type of the controller to work with either
.Xr mfi 4
or
.Xr mrsas 4 .
If no type is specified,
then the name of the invoked tool used to derive the type.
.It Fl u Ar unit
.Ar unit
specifies the unit of the controller to work with.
If no unit is specified,
then unit 0 is used.
.El
.Pp
Various commands accept either or both of the two options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Print numeric device IDs as drive identifier.
This is the default.
Useful in combination with
.Fl e
to print both, numeric device IDs and enclosure:slot information.
.It Fl e
Print drive identifiers in enclosure:slot form.
See next paragraph on format details in context of input rather than
output.
.El
.Pp
Drives may be specified in two forms.
First,
a drive may be identified by its device ID.
The device ID for configured drives can be found in
.Cm show config .
Second,
a drive may be identified by its location as
.Sm off
.Op E Ar xx Ns \&:
.Li S Ns Ar yy
.Sm on
where
.Ar xx
is the enclosure
and
.Ar yy
is the slot for each drive as displayed in
.Cm show drives .
.Pp
Volumes may be specified in two forms.
First,
a volume may be identified by its target ID.
Second,
on the volume may be specified by the corresponding
.Em mfidX
device,
such as
.Em mfid0 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports several different groups of commands.
The first group of commands provide information about the controller,
the volumes it manages, and the drives it controls.
The second group of commands are used to manage the physical drives
attached to the controller.
The third group of commands are used to manage the logical volumes
managed by the controller.
The fourth group of commands are used to manage the drive configuration for
the controller.
The fifth group of commands are used to manage controller-wide operations.
.Pp
The informational commands include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm version
Displays the version of
.Nm .
.It Cm show adapter
Displays information about the RAID controller such as the model number.
.It Cm show battery
Displays information about the battery from the battery backup unit.
.It Cm show config
Displays the volume and drive configuration for the controller.
Each array is listed along with the physical drives the array is built from.
Each volume is listed along with the arrays that the volume spans.
If any hot spare drives are configured, then they are listed as well.
.It Cm show drives
Lists all of the physical drives attached to the controller.
.It Xo Cm show events
.Op Fl c Ar class
.Op Fl l Ar locale
.Op Fl n Ar count
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar start Op Ar stop
.Xc
Display entries from the controller's event log.
The controller maintains a circular buffer of events.
Each event is tagged with a class and locale.
.Pp
The
.Ar class
parameter limits the output to entries at the specified class or higher.
The default class is
.Dq warn .
The available classes from lowest priority to highest are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm debug
Debug messages.
.It Cm progress
Periodic progress updates for long-running operations such as background
initializations, array rebuilds, or patrol reads.
.It Cm info
Informational messages such as drive insertions and volume creations.
.It Cm warn
Indicates that some component may be close to failing.
.It Cm crit
A component has failed, but no data is lost.
For example, a volume becoming degraded due to a drive failure.
.It Cm fatal
A component has failed resulting in data loss.
.It Cm dead
The controller itself has died.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar locale
parameter limits the output to entries for the specified part of the controller.
The default locale is
.Dq all .
The available locales are
.Dq volume ,
.Dq drive ,
.Dq enclosure ,
.Dq battery ,
.Dq sas ,
.Dq controller ,
.Dq config ,
.Dq cluster ,
and
.Dq all .
.Pp
The
.Ar count
parameter is a debugging aid that specifies the number of events to fetch from
the controller for each low-level request.
The default is 15 events.
.Pp
By default, matching event log entries from the previous shutdown up to the
present are displayed.
This range can be adjusted via the
.Ar start
and
.Ar stop
parameters.
Each of these parameters can either be specified as a log entry number or as
one of the following aliases:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm newest
The newest entry in the event log.
.It Cm oldest
The oldest entry in the event log.
.It Cm clear
The first entry since the event log was cleared.
.It Cm shutdown
The entry in the event log corresponding to the last time the controller was
cleanly shut down.
.It Cm boot
The entry in the event log corresponding to the most recent boot.
.El
.It Cm show firmware
Lists all of the firmware images present on the controller.
.It Cm show foreign
