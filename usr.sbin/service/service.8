.Dt SERVICE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm service
.Nd "control (start/stop/etc.) or list system services"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl e
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Fl l | r
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar <rc.d script> start|stop|etc.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is an easy interface to the rc.d system.
Its primary purpose is to start and stop services provided
by the rc.d scripts.
When used for this purpose it will set the same restricted
environment that is in use at boot time (see below).
It can also be used to list
the scripts using various criteria.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl e
List services that are enabled.
The list of scripts to check is compiled using
.Xr rcorder 8
the same way that it is done in
.Xr rc 8 ,
then that list of scripts is checked for an
.Qq rcvar
assignment.
If present the script is checked to see if it is enabled.
.It Fl l
List all files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
and the local startup directories.
As described in
.Xr rc.conf 5
this is usually
.Pa /usr/local/etc/rc.d .
All files will be listed whether they are an actual
rc.d script or not.
.It Fl r
Generate the
.Xr rcorder 8
as in
.Fl e
above, but list all of the files, not just what is enabled.
.It Fl v
Be slightly more verbose
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
When used to run rc.d scripts the
.Nm
command sets
.Ev HOME
to
.Pa /
and
.Ev PATH
to
.Pa /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
which is how they are set in
.Pa /etc/rc
at boot time.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are examples of typical usage of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl "service named status"
.Dl "service -rv"
.Pp
The following programmable completion entry can be use in
.Xr bash 1
for the names of the rc.d scripts:
.Dl "_service () {"
.Dl "	local cur"
.Dl "	cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
.Dl "	COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W '$( service -l )' -- $cur ) )"
.Dl "	return 0"
.Dl "}"
.Dl "complete -F _service service"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bash 1 Pq Pa ports/shells/bash ,
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rcorder 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 7.3 .
