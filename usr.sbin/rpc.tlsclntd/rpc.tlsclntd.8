.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 2
.Op Fl C Ar available_ciphers
.Op Fl D Ar certdir
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl l Ar CAfile
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl p Ar CApath
.Op Fl r Ar CRLfile

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides support for the client side of the kernel Sun RPC over TLS
implementation.
This daemon must be running for the kernel RPC to be able to do a TLS
connection to a server for an NFS over TLS mount.
This daemon requires that the kernel be built with
.Dq options KERNEL_TLS
and be running on an architecture such as
.Dq amd64
that supports a direct map (not i386) with
.Xr ktls 4
enabled.
.Pp
If either of the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
options have been specified, the daemon will require the server's
certificate to verify
and have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in it.
This FQDN must match
the reverse DNS name for the IP address that
the server is using for the TCP connection.
The FQDN may be
in either the DNS field of the subjectAltName or the CN field of the
subjectName in the certificate and
cannot have a wildcard
.Dq *
in it.
.Pp
If a SIGHUP signal is sent to the daemon it will reload the
.Dq CRLfile
and will shut down any extant connections that presented certificates
during TLS handshake that have been revoked.
If the
.Fl r
option was not specified, the SIGHUP signal will be ignored.
.Pp
The daemon will log failed certificate verifications via
.Xr syslogd 8
using LOG_INFO | LOG_DAEMON when the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
option has been specified.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 2 , Fl Fl usetls1_2
Specify the use of TLS version 1.2.
By default, the client will
use TLS version 1.3, as required by the RFC.
However, early
.Fx
.Pq 13.0 and 13.1
servers require
this option, since they only support TLS version 1.2.
.It Fl C Ar available_ciphers , Fl Fl ciphers= Ns Ar available_ciphers
Specify which ciphers are available during TLS handshake.
If this option is specified,
.Dq SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites()
will be called with
.Dq available_ciphers
as the argument.
If this option is not specified, the cipher will be chosen by
.Xr ssl 7 ,
which should be adequate for most cases.
The format for the available ciphers is a simple
.So
:
.Sc
separated list, in order of preference.
The command
.Dq openssl ciphers -s -tls1_3
lists available ciphers.
.It Fl D Ar certdir , Fl Fl certdir= Ns Ar certdir
Use
.Dq certdir
instead of /etc/rpc.tlsclntd for the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl d , Fl Fl debuglevel
Run in debug mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will not fork when it starts.
.It Fl l Ar CAfile , Fl Fl verifylocs= Ns Ar CAfile
This specifies the path name of a CAfile which holds the information
for server certificate verification.
This path name is used in
.Dq SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx,CAfile,NULL)
and
.Dq SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file(CAfile))
openssl library calls.
Note that this is a path name for the file and is not assumed to be
in
.Dq certdir .
.It Fl m , Fl Fl mutualverf
Enable support for mutual authentication.
A certificate and associated key must be found in /etc/rpc.tlsclntd
(or the directory specified by the
.Fl D
option)
in case a server requests a peer certificate.
The first certificate needs to be in a file named
.Dq cert.pem
and the associated key in a file named
.Dq certkey.pem .
The
.Xr mount_nfs 8
option
.Fl tlscertname
can be used to override the default certificate for a given
NFS mount, where the files use the alternate naming specified by the option.
If there is a passphrase on the
.Dq certkey.pem
file, this daemon will prompt for the passphrase during startup.
The keys for alternate certificates cannot have passphrases.
.It Fl p Ar CApath , Fl Fl verifydir= Ns Ar CApath
This option is similar to the
.Fl l
option, but specifies the path of a directory with CA
certificates in it.
When this option is used,
.Dq SSL_CTX_set0_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file())
is not called, so a list of CA names is not be passed
to the server during the TLS handshake.
The openssl documentation indicates this call is rarely needed.
.It Fl r Ar CRLfile , Fl Fl crl= Ns Ar CRLfile
This option specifies a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) file
that is to be loaded into the verify certificate store and
checked during verification of the server's certificate.
This option is meaningless unless either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
have been specified.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Run in verbose mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will log activity messages to syslog using LOG_INFO | LOG_DAEMON or to
stderr, if the
.Fl d
option has also been specified.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in
.Fx 13.0 .
.Sh BUGS
This daemon cannot be safely shut down and restarted if there are
any active RPC-over-TLS connections.
Doing so will orphan the KERNEL_TLS connections, so that they
can no longer do upcalls successfully, since the
.Dq SSL *
structures in userspace have been lost.
