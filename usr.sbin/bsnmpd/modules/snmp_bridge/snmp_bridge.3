.Sh NAME
.Nm snmp_bridge
.Nd "bridge module for snmpd"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pq begemotSnmpdModulePath."bridge" = "/usr/lib/snmp_bridge.so"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm snmp_bridge
module implements the BRIDGE-MIB as standardized in RFC 4188, the RSTP-MIB
standardized in RFC4318 and a private BEGEMOT-BRIDGE-MIB, which allows
management of multiple bridge interfaces.
Most of the objects defined in the private BEGEMOT-BRIDGE-MIB are duplicates
of the original objects defined by the standard BRIDGE-MIB, but the private
MIB also defines additional objects which make the functionality of
.Nm
similar to
.Xr ifconfig 8
for configuring bridge interfaces.
Therefore one should consider adding write communities or loading the
.Nm
module on systems where security is crucial.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The additional objects to configure a bridge are:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXX"
.It Va begemotBridgeBaseStatus
Bridge interfaces can be created and destroyed via this object.
SNMP SET operations with the following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va createAndWait"
.It Va createAndWait
will attempt to create a bridge interface with the name given by the table
index.
.It Va createAndGo
will attempt to create a bridge interface with the name given by the table
index and set the status of the interface to "active/up".
.It Va destroy
will attempt to destroy the bridge interface.
.El
.It Va begemotBridgeBaseSpanEnabled
A SNMP SET operation on this object is only successful if the corresponding
port has not been added as member of the bridge interface on the system.
.It Va begemotBridgeBasePortStatus
SNMP SET operations with the following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va createAndWait"
.It Va createAndWait
will create a new row for the bridge member in the SNMP
.Va begemotBridgeBasePortTable
but will not try to commit the information to the system.
.It Va active
will attempt to commit the information to the system and will be successful
only if a value for
.Va begemotBridgeBaseSpanEnabled
has been SET already.
.It Va destroy
will attempt to remove the interface from the system bridge interface.
.El
.It Va begemotBridgeBasePortPrivate
This object controls a bridge interface flag called PRIVATE where any private
port can not communicate with another private port.
.El
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
Not all information in the MIBs is currently available in FreeBSD.
The following variables carry no information:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXX"
.It Va dot1dBasePortCircuit
.It Va dot1dBasePortDelayExceededDiscards
.It Va dot1dBasePortMtuExceededDiscards
.It Va begemotBridgeBasePortDelayExceededDiscards
.It Va begemotBridgeBasePortMtuExceededDiscards
