.Sh NAME
.Nm snmp_wlan
.Nd "wireless networking module for"
.Xr bsnmpd 1
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pq begemotSnmpdModulePath."wlan" = "/usr/lib/snmp_wlan.so"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm snmp_wlan
module implements a private BEGEMOT-WIRELESS-MIB, which allows
management of virtual wireless interfaces.
The MIB defines objects similar to the state data and configuration capabilities of
.Xr ifconfig 8
for configuring virtual wireless interfaces.
Therefore one should consider adding write communities or loading the
.Nm
module on systems where security is crucial.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
A short description of the Tables and interesting objects in the MIB follows.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXX"
.It Va wlanInterfaceTable
The table is used for creation and deletion of virtual wireless interfaces.
To add a new interface, a SET should be executed on the
.Va wlanIfaceName
column with
value the desired name of the interface.
Next the parent interface must be set via
.Va wlanParentIfName
column.
Any optional parameters may be set via the
.Va wlanIfaceOperatingMode ,
.Va wlanIfaceFlags ,
.Va wlanIfaceBssid
and
.Va wlanIfaceLocalAddress
columns.
To finally create the interface in the system, a SET with value of active(1) to
.Va wlanIfaceStatus
column should be executed.
To destroy a wireless interface a SET with value of destroy(6) to the relevant
.Va wlanIfaceStatus
column should be executed.
.It Va wlanIfParentTable
The table contains information about the hardware capabilities of the parent of
a wireless interface.
.It Va wlanIfaceConfigTable
The table is used to get or set various configuration parameters for a virtual
wireless interface.
Depending on the operating mode of the interface and the hardware capabilities
of the underlying hardware interface, not all parameters and values may be supported.
.It Va wlanIfacePeerTable
The table contains information about the associated stations for interfaces
operating as access points, or the stations identified as neighbors in the IBSS
for interfaces operating in adhoc mode.
.It Va wlanIfaceChannelTable
Information about the active channels for the wireless interfaces in the system.
.It Va wlanIfRoamParamsTable
The parameters that govern the roaming operation on the wireless interfaces.
.It Va wlanIfTxParamsTable
The parameters that govern the transmit operation on the wireless interfaces.
.It Va wlanScanConfigTable
The table that contains a configuration for channel scanning initiated via SNMP.
.It Va wlanScanResultsTable
The table contains the scan results from the last scan for each wireless
interface on the system.
.It Va wlanIfaceStatisticsTable
Summary statistics for each wireless interface on the system.
.It Va wlanWepInterfaceTable
WEP configuration for the wireless interfaces on the system.
.It Va wlanMACAccessControlTable
Access Control configuration for wireless interfaces operating as access points.
.It Va wlanMACAccessControlMACTable
The table with Access Control MAC entries for which the configured Access
Control Policy on wireless interfaces operating in Host AP mode is applied.
.Va wlanMACAccessControlMACStatus
column is used to add or delete MAC ACL entries.
A set with value createAndGo(4) will add new entry, while with value destroy(6)
will delete an existing one.
.It Va wlanMeshRoutingConfig
The subtree contains system configuration related to Wireless Mesh Routing.
.It Va wlanMeshInterfaceTable
The table contains information for wireless interfaces operating as wireless
mesh points.
.It Va wlanMeshNeighborTable
The table contains information for the neighbors of wireless interfaces
operating in mesh mode.
.It Va wlanMeshRouteTable
The mesh routing table for interfaces operating as mesh points, used for
forwarding packets on a mesh network.
.Va wlanMeshRouteStatus
column is used to add or delete entries in the mesh routing table for an
interface.
A set with value createAndGo(4) will add new entry, while with value destroy(6)
will delete an existing one.
.It Va wlanMeshStatsTable
Summary statistics for each virtual wireless interface operating as mesh point.
.It Va wlanMeshHWMPConfig
The subtree contains system configuration related to Hybrid Wireless Mesh
Protocol.
.It Va wlanHWMPInterfaceTable
The table contains HWMP information for wireless interfaces operating in mesh
mode.
.It Va wlanMeshHWMPStatsTable
Summary statistics for HWMP operation on interfaces operating as mesh points.
