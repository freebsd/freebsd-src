.Sh DESCRIPTION
The mouse daemon 
.Nm
and the console driver work together to support 
mouse operation in the text console and user programs.
They virtualize the mouse and provide user programs with mouse data 
in the standard format 
.Pq see Xr sysmouse 4 .
.Pp
The mouse daemon listens to the specified port for mouse data,
interprets and then passes it via ioctls to the console driver.
The mouse daemon
reports translation movement, button press/release
events and movement of the roller or the wheel if available.
The roller/wheel movement is reported as ``Z'' axis movement.
.Pp
The console driver will display the mouse pointer on the screen
and provide cut and paste functions if the mouse pointer is enabled
in the virtual console via 
.Xr vidcontrol 1 .
If
.Xr sysmouse 4
is opened by the user program, the console driver also passes the mouse 
data to the device so that the user program will see it.
.Pp
If the mouse daemon receives the signal 
.Dv SIGHUP ,
it will reopen the mouse port and reinitializes itself.
Useful if
the mouse is attached/detached while the system is suspended.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 3
Emulate the third (middle) button for 2-button mice.
It is emulated
by pressing the left and right physical buttons simultaneously.
.It Fl C Ar threshold
Set double click speed as the maximum interval in msec between button clicks.
Without this option, the default value of 500 msec will be assumed.
This option will have effect only on the cut and paste operations 
in the text mode console.
The user program which is reading mouse data
via 
.Xr sysmouse 4
will not be affected.
.It Fl D
Lower DTR on the serial port. 
This option is valid only if 
.Ar mousesystems
is selected as the protocol type.
The DTR line may need to be dropped for a 3-button mouse 
to operate in the
.Ar mousesystems
mode.
.It Fl E Ar timeout
When the third button emulation is enabled
.Pq see above ,
the
.Nm
daemon waits
.Ar timeout
msec at most before deciding whether two buttons are being pressed
simultaneously.
The default timeout is 100 msec.
.It Fl F Ar rate
Set the report rate (reports/sec) of the device if supported.
.It Fl I Ar file
Write the process id of the
.Nm
daemon in the specified file.
Without this option, the process id will be stored in 
.Pa /var/run/moused.pid .
.It Fl P
Do not start the Plug and Play COM device enumeration procedure
when identifying the serial mouse.
If this option is given together with the
.Fl i
option, the
.Nm
command will not be able to print useful information for the serial mouse.
.It Fl R
Lower RTS on the serial port.
This option is valid only if 
.Ar mousesystems
is selected as the protocol type by the
.Fl t
option below.
It is often used with the 
.Fl D
option above.
Both RTS and DTR lines may need to be dropped for 
a 3-button mouse to operate in the
.Ar mousesystems
mode.
.It Fl S Ar baudrate
Select the baudrate for the serial port (1200 to 9600).
Not all serial mice support this option.
.It Fl a Ar X Ns Op , Ns Ar Y
Accelerate or decelerate the mouse input.
This is a linear acceleration only.
Values less than 1.0 slow down movement, values greater than 1.0 speed it
up.
Specifying only one value sets the acceleration for both axes.
.It Fl c
Some mice report middle button down events
as if the left and right buttons are being pressed.
This option handles this.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
.It Fl f
Do not become a daemon and instead run as a foreground process.
Useful for testing and debugging.
.It Fl i Ar info
Print specified information and quit.  Available pieces of 
information are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width modelxxx
.It Ar port
Port (device file) name, i.e. 
.Pa /dev/cuaa0 , 
.Pa /dev/mse0
and 
.Pa /dev/psm0 .
.It Ar if
Interface type: serial, bus, inport or ps/2.
.It Ar type
Protocol type.
It is one of the types listed under the 
.Fl t
option below or 
.Ar sysmouse
if the driver supports the
.Ar sysmouse
data format standard.
.It Ar model
Mouse model.  The
.Nm
command may not always be able to identify the model.
.It Ar all
All of the above items.  Print port, interface, type and model in this order
in one line.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Nm
command cannot determine the requested information, it prints ``unknown''
or ``generic''.
.It Fl m Ar N=M
Assign the physical button 
.Ar M 
to the logical button 
.Ar N .
You may specify as many instances of this option as you like.
More than one physical button may be assigned to a logical button at the
same time.
In this case the logical button will be down, 
if either of the assigned physical buttons is held down.
Do not put space around `='.
.It Fl p Ar port
Use
.Ar port
to communicate with the mouse.
.It Fl r Ar resolution
Set the resolution of the device; in Dots Per Inch, or
.Ar low ,
.Ar medium-low ,
.Ar medium-high
or
.Ar high .
This option may not be supported by all the device.
.It Fl s
Select a baudrate of 9600 for the serial line.
Not all serial mice support this option.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify the protocol type of the mouse attached to the port.
You may explicitly specify a type listed below, or use
.Ar auto 
to let the
.Nm
command to automatically select an appropriate protocol for the given
mouse.
If you entirely ommit this options in the command line, 
.Fl t Ar auto
is assumed.
Under normal circumstances,
you need to use this option only if the 
.Nm
command is not able to detect the protocol automatically
.Pq see the Sx Configuring Mouse Daemon .
.Pp
Note that if a protocol type is specified with this option, the
.Fl P
option above is implied and Plug and Play COM device enumeration 
procedure will be disabled.
.Pp
Also note that if your mouse is attached to the PS/2 mouse port, you should
always choose
.Ar auto
or
.Ar ps/2 ,
regardless of the brand and model of the mouse.  Likewise, if your
mouse is attached to the bus mouse port, choose
.Ar auto
or
.Ar busmouse .
Serial mouse protocols will not work with these mice.
.Pp
For the USB mouse, the protocol must be
.Ar auto .
No other protocol will work with the USB mouse.
.Pp
Valid types for this option are
listed below.
.Pp
For the serial mouse:
.Bl -tag -compact -width mousesystemsxxx
.It Ar microsoft
Microsoft serial mouse protocol.  Most 2-button serial mice use this protocol.
.It Ar intellimouse
Microsoft IntelliMouse protocol.  Genius NetMouse, ASCII Mie Mouse,
Logitech MouseMan+ and FirstMouse+ use this protocol too.
Other mice with a roller/wheel may be compatible with this protocol.
.It Ar mousesystems
MouseSystems 5-byte protocol.  3-button mice may use this protocol.
.It Ar mmseries
MM Series mouse protocol.
.It Ar logitech
Logitech mouse protocol.  Note that this is for old Logitech models.  
.Ar mouseman
or
.Ar intellimouse
should be specified for newer models.
.It Ar mouseman
Logitech MouseMan and TrackMan protocol.  Some 3-button mice may be compatible
with this protocol.  Note that MouseMan+ and FirstMouse+ use
.Ar intellimouse
protocol rather than this one.
.It Ar glidepoint
ALPS GlidePoint protocol.
.It Ar thinkingmouse
Kensington ThinkingMouse protocol.
.It Ar mmhitab
Hitachi tablet protocol.
.It Ar x10mouseremote
X10 MouseRemote.
.It Ar kidspad
Genius Kidspad and Easypad protocol.
.It Ar versapad
Interlink VersaPad protocol.
.El
.Pp
For the bus and InPort mouse:
.Bl -tag -compact -width mousesystemsxxx
.It Ar busmouse
This is the only protocol type available for 
the bus and InPort mouse and should be specified for any bus mice 
and InPort mice, regardless of the brand.
.El
.Pp
For the PS/2 mouse:
.Bl -tag -compact -width mousesystemsxxx
.It Ar ps/2
This is the only protocol type available for the PS/2 mouse
and should be specified for any PS/2 mice, regardless of the brand.
.El
.Pp
For the USB mouse,
.Ar auto
is the only protocol type available for the USB mouse
and should be specified for any USB mice, regardless of the brand.
.It Fl w Ar N
Make the physical button
.Ar N
act as the wheel mode button.
While this button is pressed, X and Y axis movement is reported to be zero
and the Y axis movement is mapped to Z axis.
You may further map the Z axis movement to virtual buttons by the 
.Fl z
option below.
.It Fl z Ar target
Map Z axis (roller/wheel) movement to another axis or to virtual buttons.
Valid
.Ar target
maybe:
.Bl -tag -compact -width x__
.It Ar x
.It Ar y
X or Y axis movement will be reported when the Z axis movement is detected.
.It Ar N
Report down events for the virtual buttons
.Ar N 
and 
.Ar N+1 
respectively when negative and positive Z axis movement 
is detected.
There do not need to be physical buttons 
.Ar N
and 
.Ar N+1 .
Note that mapping to logical buttons is carried out after mapping
from the Z axis movement to the virtual buttons is done.
.It Ar N1 N2
Report down events for the virtual buttons
.Ar N1
and 
.Ar N2
respectively when negative and positive Z axis movement 
is detected.
.It Ar N1 N2 N3 N4
This is useful for the mouse with two wheels of which
the second wheel is used to generate horizontal scroll action,
and for the mouse which has a knob or a stick which can detect
the horizontal force applied by the user.
.Pp
The motion of the second wheel will be mapped to the buttons
.Ar N3 ,
for the negative direction, and
.Ar N4 ,
for the positive direction.
If the buttons
.Ar N3
and
.Ar N4
actually exist in this mouse, their actions will not be detected.
.Pp
Note that horizontal movement or second roller/wheel movement may not
always be detected,
because there appears to be no accepted standard as to how it is encoded.
.Pp
Note also that some mice think left is the negative horizontal direction, 
others may think otherwise.  
Moreover, there are some mice whose two wheels are both mounted vertically,
and the direction of the second vertical wheel does not match the
first one's.
.El
.El
.Ss Configuring Mouse Daemon
The first thing you need to know is the interface type 
of the mouse you are going to use.
It can be determined by looking at the connector of the mouse.
The serial mouse has a D-Sub female 9- or 25-pin connector.
The bus and InPort mice have either a D-Sub male 9-pin connector 
or a round DIN 9-pin connector.
The PS/2 mouse is equipped with a small, round DIN 6-pin connector.
Some mice come with adapters with which the connector can 
be converted to another.  If you are to use such an adapter,
remember the connector at the very end of the mouse/adapter pair is 
what matters.
The USB mouse has a flat rectangular connector.
.Pp
The next thing to decide is a port to use for the given interface.
For the bus, InPort and PS/2 mice, there is little choice: 
the bus and InPort mice always use
.Pa /dev/mse0 ,
and the PS/2 mouse is always at
.Pa /dev/psm0 .
There may be more than one serial port to which the serial
mouse can be attached.  Many people often assign the first, built-in 
serial port
.Pa /dev/cuaa0
to the mouse.
You can attach multiple USB mice to your system or to your USB hub.
They are accessible as 
.Pa /dev/ums0 , /dev/ums1 ,
and so on.
.Pa
You may want to create a symbolic link
.Pa /dev/mouse
pointing to the real port to which the mouse is connected, so that you
can easily distinguish which is your ``mouse'' port later.
.Pp
The next step is to guess the appropriate protocol type for the mouse.
The
.Nm
command may be able to automatically determine the protocol type.
Run the
.Nm
command with the
.Fl i
option and see what it says.  If the command can identify
the protocol type, no further investigation is necessary on your part.  
You may start the daemon without explicitly specifying a protocol type
.Pq see Sx EXAMPLES .
.Pp
The command may print 
.Ar sysmouse
if the mouse driver supports this protocol type.
.Pp
Note that the
.Dv type
and 
.Dv model
printed by the 
.Fl i
option do not necessarily match the product name of the pointing device
in question, but they may give the name of the device with which it is 
compatible.
.Pp
If the
.Fl i
option yields nothing, you need to specify a protocol type to the
.Nm
command by the
.Fl t
option.
You have to make a guess and try.
There is rule of thumb:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact -width 1.X
.It
The bus and InPort mice always use
.Ar busmouse
protocol regardless of the brand of the mouse.
.It
The
.Ar ps/2
protocol should always be specified for the PS/2 mouse
regardless of the brand of the mouse.
.It
You must specify the
.Ar auto
protocol for the USB mouse.
.It
Most 2-button serial mice support the
.Ar microsoft
protocol.
.It
3-button serial mice may work with the
.Ar mousesystems
protocol.
If it does not, it may work with the 
.Ar microsoft
protocol although 
the third (middle) button will not function.
3-button serial mice may also work with the
.Ar mouseman
protocol under which the third button may function as expected.
.It
3-button serial mice may have a small switch to choose between ``MS''
and ``PC'', or ``2'' and ``3''.
``MS'' or ``2'' usually mean the 
.Ar microsoft
protocol.
``PC'' or ``3'' will choose the 
.Ar mousesystems
protocol.
.It
If the mouse has a roller or a wheel, it may be compatible with the
.Ar intellimouse
protocol.
.El
.Pp
To test if the selected protocol type is correct for the given mouse,
enable the mouse pointer in the current virtual console,
.Pp
.Dl vidcontrol -m on
.Pp
start the mouse daemon in the foreground mode,
.Pp
.Dl moused -f -p Ar _selected_port_ -t Ar _selected_protocol_
.Pp
and see if the mouse pointer travels correctly
according to the mouse movement.
Then try cut & paste features by
clicking the left, right and middle buttons.
Type ^C to stop
the command.
.Ss Multiple Mice
As many instances of the mouse daemon as the number of mice attached to
the system may be run simultaneously; one
instance for each mouse. 
This is useful if the user wants to use the built-in PS/2 pointing device
of a laptop computer while on the road, but wants to use a serial
mouse when s/he attaches the system to the docking station in the office.
Run two mouse daemons and tell the application program
.Pq such as the X Window System
to use
.Xr sysmouse ,
then the application program will always see mouse data from either mice. 
When the serial mouse is not attached, the corresponding mouse daemon
will not detect any movement or button state change and the application
program will only see mouse data coming from the daemon for the
PS/2 mouse.
In contrast when both mice are attached and both of them
are moved at the same time in this configuration,
the mouse pointer will travel across the screen just as if movement of 
the mice is combined all together.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/cuaa0 -i type
.Pp
Let the
.Nm
command determine the protocol type of the mouse at the serial port
.Pa /dev/cuaa0 .
If successful, the command will print the type, otherwise it will say
``unknown''.
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/cuaa0 
.Dl vidcontrol -m on
.Pp
If the
.Nm
command is able to identify the protocol type of the mouse at the specified
port automatically, you can start the daemon without the
.Fl t
option and enable the mouse pointer in the text console as above.
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/mouse -t microsoft 
.Dl vidcontrol -m on
.Pp
Start the mouse daemon on the serial port 
.Pa /dev/mouse .
The protocol type
.Ar microsoft
is explicitly specified by the
.Fl t
option.
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/mouse -m 1=3 -m 3=1
.Pp
Assign the physical button 3 (right button) to the logical button 1 
(logical left) and the physical button 1 (left) to the logical 
button 3 (logical right).
This will effectively swap the left and right buttons.
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/mouse -t intellimouse -z 4
.Pp
Report negative Z axis (roller) movement as the button 4 pressed
and positive Z axis movement as the button 5 pressed.
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
command does not currently work with the alternative console driver
.Xr pcvt 4 .
.Pp
Many pad devices behave as if the first (left) button were pressed if
the user `taps' the surface of the pad.
In contrast, some ALPS GlidePoint and Interlink VersaPad models 
treat the tapping action 
as fourth button events.
Use the option ``-m 1=4'' for these models
to obtain the same effect as the other pad devices.
.Pp
Cut and paste functions in the virtual console assume that there
are three buttons on the mouse.
The logical button 1 (logical left) selects a region of text in the
console and copies it to the cut buffer.
The logical button 3 (logical right) extends the selected region.
The logical button 2 (logical middle) pastes the selected text 
at the text cursor position.
If the mouse has only two buttons, the middle, `paste' button 
is not available.
To obtain the paste function, use the
.Fl 3
option to emulate the middle button, or use the
.Fl m
option to assign the physical right button to the logical middle button: 
``-m 2=3''.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command partially supports
.Dq Plug and Play External COM Device Specification
in order to support PnP serial mice.
However, due to various degrees of conformance to the specification by 
existing serial mice, it does not strictly follow the version 1.0 of the
standard.
Even with this less strict approach, 
it may not always determine an appropriate protocol type 
for the given serial mouse.
