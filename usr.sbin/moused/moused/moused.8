.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility and the console driver work together to support
mouse operation in the text console and user programs.
They virtualize the mouse and provide user programs with mouse data
in the standard format
(see
.Xr sysmouse 4 ) .
.Pp
The mouse daemon listens to the specified port for mouse data,
interprets and then passes it via ioctls to the console driver.
Supported data interfaces are
.Qq input event device
AKA evdev and
.Xr sysmouse 4
level 1.
The mouse daemon
reports translation movement, button press/release
events and movement of the roller or the wheel if available.
The roller/wheel movement is reported as
.Dq Z
axis movement.
.Pp
The console driver will display the mouse pointer on the screen
and provide cut and paste functions if the mouse pointer is enabled
in the virtual console via
.Xr vidcontrol 1 .
If
.Xr sysmouse 4
is opened by the user program, the console driver also passes the mouse
data to the device so that the user program will see it.
.Pp
If the mouse daemon receives the signal
.Dv SIGHUP ,
it will reopen the mouse port and reinitialize itself.
Useful if
the mouse is attached/detached while the system is suspended.
.Pp
If the mouse daemon receives the signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
it will stop passing mouse events.
Sending the signal
.Dv SIGUSR1
again will resume passing mouse events.
Useful if your typing on a laptop is
interrupted by accidentally touching the mouse pad.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 3
Emulate the third (middle) button for 2-button mice.
It is emulated
by pressing the left and right physical buttons simultaneously.
.It Fl C Ar threshold
Set double click speed as the maximum interval in msec between button clicks.
Without this option, the default value of 500 msec will be assumed.
This option will have effect only on the cut and paste operations
in the text mode console.
The user program which is reading mouse data
via
.Xr sysmouse 4
will not be affected.
.It Fl E Ar timeout
When the third button emulation is enabled
(see above),
the
.Nm
utility waits
.Ar timeout
msec at most before deciding whether two buttons are being pressed
simultaneously.
The default timeout is 100 msec.
.It Fl F Ar rate
Only for
.Xr sysmouse 4
interface.
Set the report rate (reports/sec) of the device if supported.
.It Fl L Ar distance
When
.Dq Virtual Scrolling
is enabled, the
.Fl L
option can be used to set the
.Ar distance
(in pixels) that the mouse must move before a scroll event
is generated.  This effectively controls the scrolling speed.
The default
.Ar distance
is 2 pixels.
.It Fl H
Enable
.Dq Horizontal Virtual Scrolling .
With this option set, holding the middle mouse
button down will cause motion to be interpreted as
horizontal scrolling.
Use the
.Fl U
option to set the distance the mouse must move before the scrolling mode is
activated and the
.Fl L
option to set the scrolling speed.
This option may be used with or without the
.Fl V
option.
.It Fl I Ar file
Write the process id of the
.Nm
utility in the specified file.
Without this option, the process id will be stored in
.Pa /var/run/moused.pid .
.It Fl T Ar distance Ns Op , Ns Ar time Ns Op , Ns Ar after
Terminate drift.
Use this option if mouse pointer slowly wanders when mouse is not moved.
Movements up to
.Ar distance
(for example 4) pixels (X+Y) in
.Ar time
msec (default 500) are ignored, except during
.Ar after
msec (default 4000) since last real mouse movement.
.It Fl V
Enable
.Dq Virtual Scrolling .
With this option set, holding the middle mouse
button down will cause motion to be interpreted as scrolling.
Use the
.Fl U
option to set the distance the mouse must move before the scrolling mode is
activated and the
.Fl L
option to set the scrolling speed.
.It Fl U Ar distance
When
.Dq Virtual Scrolling
is enabled, the
.Fl U
option can be used to set the
.Ar distance
(in pixels) that the mouse must move before the scrolling
mode is activated.
The default
.Ar distance
is 3 pixels.
.It Fl A Ar exp Ns Op , Ns Ar offset
Apply exponential (dynamic) acceleration to mouse movements:
the faster you move the mouse, the more it will be accelerated.
That means that small mouse movements are not accelerated,
so they are still very accurate, while a faster movement will
drive the pointer quickly across the screen.
.Pp
The
.Ar exp
value specifies the exponent, which is basically
the amount of acceleration.  Useful values are in the
range 1.1 to 2.0, but it depends on your mouse hardware
and your personal preference.  A value of 1.0 means no
exponential acceleration.  A value of 2.0 means squared
acceleration (i.e. if you move the mouse twice as fast,
the pointer will move four times as fast on the screen).
Values beyond 2.0 are possible but not recommended.
A good value to start is probably 1.5.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar offset
value specifies the distance at which the acceleration
begins.  The default is 1.0, which means that the
acceleration is applied to movements larger than one unit.
If you specify a larger value, it takes more speed for
the acceleration to kick in, i.e. the speed range for
small and accurate movements is wider.
Usually the default should be sufficient, but if you're
not satisfied with the behaviour, try a value of 2.0.
.Pp
Note that the
.Fl A
option interacts badly with the X server's own acceleration,
which doesn't work very well anyway.  Therefore it is
recommended to switch it off if necessary:
.Dq xset m 1 .
.It Fl a Ar X Ns Op , Ns Ar Y
Accelerate or decelerate the mouse input.
This is a linear acceleration only.
Values less than 1.0 slow down movement, values greater than 1.0 speed it
up.
Specifying only one value sets the acceleration for both axes.
.Pp
You can use the
.Fl a
and
.Fl A
options at the same time to have the combined effect
of linear and exponential acceleration.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
.It Fl f
Do not become a daemon and instead run as a foreground process.
Useful for testing and debugging.
.It Fl g
Only for evdev interface.
Become the sole recipient of all incoming input events.
This prevents other processes from getting input events on the device.
.It Fl i Ar info
Print specified information and quit.
Available pieces of
information are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width modelxxx
.It Ar port
Port (device file) name, i.e.\&
.Pa /dev/input/event0 ,
.Pa /dev/ums0
and
.Pa /dev/psm0 .
.It Ar if
Interface type:
.Dq evdev
or
.Dq sysmouse .
.It Ar type
Device type:
.Dq mouse
or
.Dq touchpad .
.It Ar model
Mouse model.
.It Ar all
All of the above items.
Print port, type and model in this order
in one line.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Nm
utility cannot determine the requested information, it prints
.Dq Li unknown
or
.Dq Li generic .
.It Fl l Ar level
Ignored.
Used for compatibiliy with legacy
.Nm .
.It Fl m Ar N=M
Assign the physical button
.Ar M
to the logical button
.Ar N .
You may specify as many instances of this option as you like.
More than one physical button may be assigned to a logical button at the
same time.
In this case the logical button will be down,
if either of the assigned physical buttons is held down.
Do not put space around
.Ql = .
.It Fl p Ar port
Use
.Ar port
to communicate with the mouse.
.It Fl r Ar resolution
Only for
.Xr sysmouse 4
interface.
Set the resolution of the device; in Dots Per Inch, or
.Ar low ,
.Ar medium-low ,
.Ar medium-high
or
.Ar high .
This option may not be supported by all the device.
.It Fl t Ar type
Force the interface type of the mouse attached to the port.
You may explicitly specify a type listed below, or use
.Ar auto
to let the
.Nm
utility automatically select an appropriate protocol for the given
character device.
If you entirely omit this option in the command line,
.Fl t Ar auto
is assumed.
.Pp
Valid types for this option are listed below.
.Bl -tag -compact -width systemmouse
.It Ar evdev
Input event device usualy residing in
.Pa /dev/input .
.It Ar sysmouse
Traditional protocol used by e.g.
.Xr ums 4
and
.Xr psm 4
drivers.
.El
.Pp
Note that this option restricts usage of the given port rather then gives
a hint.
.It Fl q Ar config
Path to configuration file.
.It Fl Q Ar quirks
Path to quirks directory.
.It Fl w Ar N
Make the physical button
.Ar N
act as the wheel mode button.
While this button is pressed, X and Y axis movement is reported to be zero
and the Y axis movement is mapped to Z axis.
You may further map the Z axis movement to virtual buttons by the
.Fl z
option below.
.It Fl z Ar target
Map Z axis (roller/wheel) movement to another axis or to virtual buttons.
Valid
.Ar target
maybe:
.Bl -tag -compact -width x__
.It Ar x
.It Ar y
X or Y axis movement will be reported when the Z axis movement is detected.
.It Ar N
Report down events for the virtual buttons
.Ar N
and
.Ar N+1
respectively when negative and positive Z axis movement
is detected.
There do not need to be physical buttons
.Ar N
and
.Ar N+1 .
Note that mapping to logical buttons is carried out after mapping
from the Z axis movement to the virtual buttons is done.
.It Ar N1 N2
Report down events for the virtual buttons
.Ar N1
and
.Ar N2
respectively when negative and positive Z axis movement
is detected.
.It Ar N1 N2 N3 N4
This is useful for the mouse with two wheels of which
the second wheel is used to generate horizontal scroll action,
and for the mouse which has a knob or a stick which can detect
the horizontal force applied by the user.
.Pp
The motion of the second wheel will be mapped to the buttons
.Ar N3 ,
for the negative direction, and
.Ar N4 ,
for the positive direction.
If the buttons
.Ar N3
and
.Ar N4
actually exist in this mouse, their actions will not be detected.
.Pp
Note that horizontal movement or second roller/wheel movement may not
always be detected,
because there appears to be no accepted standard as to how it is encoded.
.Pp
Note also that some mice think left is the negative horizontal direction;
others may think otherwise.
Moreover, there are some mice whose two wheels are both mounted vertically,
and the direction of the second vertical wheel does not match the
first one.
.El
.Ss Multiple Mice
The
.Nm
utility may operate in 2 different modes depending on the value of
.Fl p
option.
When started with
.Fl p Ar auto
option specified the
.Nm
handles all recognized pointing devices in a single instance.
Device hotplug is supported through
.Xr devd 8 .
Only evdev interface is available in this mode.
When started with
.Fl p Ar <selected_port>
option specified the
.Nm
handles single device located at
.Ar <selected_port> .
Both evdev and
.Xr sysmouse 4
level 1 interfaces are available in this mode.
Multiple
.Nm
instances may be run simultaneously.

.Sh CAVEATS
Cut and paste functions in the virtual console assume that there
are three buttons on the mouse.
The logical button 1 (logical left) selects a region of text in the
console and copies it to the cut buffer.
The logical button 3 (logical right) extends the selected region.
The logical button 2 (logical middle) pastes the selected text
at the text cursor position.
If the mouse has only two buttons, the middle, `paste' button
is not available.
To obtain the paste function, use the
.Fl 3
option to emulate the middle button, or use the
.Fl m
option to assign the physical right button to the logical middle button:
.Dq Fl m Li 2=3 .
