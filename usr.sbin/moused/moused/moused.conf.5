.Sh NAME
.Nm moused.conf
.Nd mouse daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies how the
.Xr moused 8
(mouse daemon) should operate. It provides ability to adjust certain
mice parameters on per-device basis.
.Pp
Configuration file format is derrived from
.Xr libinput 1
device quirk files.
A file may contain multiple section headers ([some identifier])
followed by one or more MatchFoo=Bar directives, followed by at least
one of MousedFoo=bar or AttrFoo=bar directive.
A configuration file must contain at least one section, each section
must have at least one
.Sq Match
tag and at least one of either
.Sq Attr
or
.Sq Moused .
Section names are free-form and may contain spaces.
.Ss List of currently available matches.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It MatchName, MatchUniq
Match on the NAME or UNIQ udev property on this device. These
properties are typically derived from the deviceâ€™s kernel name or uniq.
These matches use
.Fn fnmatch
globs.
.It MatchBus
A lower-case bus name. Currently supported are usb, bluetooth, ps2,
rmi, i2c, and spi.
.It MatchVendor, MatchProduct, MatchVersion
The hexadecmial 4-digit vendor ID, product ID or driver version as
exported, without a 0x prefix.
.It MatchDMIModalias, MatchDeviceTree
An
.Fn fnmatch
glob for the DMI modalias or the DeviceTree compatible string.
.It MatchDevType
One of touchpad, mouse, pointingstick, keyboard, joystick, tablet,
tablet-pad.
Only touchpad and mouse types are suppported.
.El
.Ss List of currently available Moused tags.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It MousedGrabDevice
Only for evdev interface.
Become the sole recipient of all incoming input events.
This prevents other processes from getting input events on the device.
.Pp
Use
.Fl g
option alternatively.
.It MousedIgnoreDevice
Ignore given device.
.It MousedClickThreshold
Set double click speed as the maximum interval in msec between button clicks.
Without this option, the default value of 500 msec will be assumed.
This option will have effect only on the cut and paste operations
in the text mode console.
The user program which is reading mouse data
via
.Xr sysmouse 4
will not be affected.
.Pp
Use
.Fl C
option alternatively.
.It MousedEmulateThirdButton
Emulate the third (middle) button for 2-button mice.
It is emulated
by pressing the left and right physical buttons simultaneously.
.Pp
Use
.Fl 3
option alternatively.
.It MousedEmulateThirdButtonTimeout
When the third button emulation is enabled
(see above),
the
.Xr moused 8
utility waits
.Ar MousedEmulateThirdButtonTimeout
msec at most before deciding whether two buttons are being pressed
simultaneously.
The default timeout is 100 msec.
.Pp
Use
.Fl E
option alternatively.
.It MousedLinearAccelX
.It MousedLinearAccelY
.It MousedLinearAccelZ
Accelerate or decelerate the mouse input.
This is a linear acceleration only.
Values less than 1.0 slow down movement, values greater than 1.0 speed it
up.
.Pp
You can use the
.Ar MousedLinearAccel
and
.Ar MousedExponentialAccel
options at the same time to have the combined effect
of linear and exponential acceleration.
.Pp
Use
.Fl a
option alternatively.
.It MousedExponentialAccel
.It MousedExponentialOffset
Apply exponential (dynamic) acceleration to mouse movements:
the faster you move the mouse, the more it will be accelerated.
That means that small mouse movements are not accelerated,
so they are still very accurate, while a faster movement will
drive the pointer quickly across the screen.
.Pp
The
.Ar MousedExponentialAccel
value specifies the exponent, which is basically
the amount of acceleration.  Useful values are in the
range 1.1 to 2.0, but it depends on your mouse hardware
and your personal preference.  A value of 1.0 means no
exponential acceleration.  A value of 2.0 means squared
acceleration (i.e. if you move the mouse twice as fast,
the pointer will move four times as fast on the screen).
Values beyond 2.0 are possible but not recommended.
A good value to start is probably 1.5.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar MousedExponentialOffset
value specifies the distance at which the acceleration
begins.  The default is 1.0, which means that the
acceleration is applied to movements larger than one unit.
If you specify a larger value, it takes more speed for
the acceleration to kick in, i.e. the speed range for
small and accurate movements is wider.
Usually the default should be sufficient, but if you're
not satisfied with the behaviour, try a value of 2.0.
.Pp
Note that the
.Fl A
option interacts badly with the X server's own acceleration,
which doesn't work very well anyway.  Therefore it is
recommended to switch it off if necessary:
.Dq xset m 1 .
.Pp
Use
.Fl A
option alternatively.
.It MousedMapZAxis
Map Z axis (roller/wheel) movement to another axis or to virtual buttons.
Does not supported yet.
Use
.Fl z
option instead.
.It MousedVirtualScrollEnable
Enable
.Dq Virtual Scrolling .
With this option set, holding the middle mouse
button down will cause motion to be interpreted as scrolling.
Use the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollThreshold
option to set the distance the mouse must move before the scrolling mode is
activated and the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollSpeed
option to set the scrolling speed.
.Pp
Use
.Fl V
option alternatively.
.It MousedHorVirtualScrollEnable
Enable
.Dq Horizontal Virtual Scrolling .
With this option set, holding the middle mouse
button down will cause motion to be interpreted as
horizontal scrolling.
Use the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollThreshold
option to set the distance the mouse must move before the scrolling mode is
activated and the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollSpeed
option to set the scrolling speed.
This option may be used with or without the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollEnable
option.
.Pp
Use
.Fl H
option alternatively.
.It MousedVirtualScrollSpeed= Ar distance
When
.Dq Virtual Scrolling
is enabled, the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollSpeed
option can be used to set the
.Ar distance
(in pixels) that the mouse must move before a scroll event
is generated.
This effectively controls the scrolling speed.
The default
.Ar distance
is 2 pixels.
.Pp
Use
.Fl L
option alternatively.
.It MousedVirtualScrollThreshold= Ar distance
When
.Dq Virtual Scrolling
is enabled, the
.Ar MousedVirtualScrollThreshold
option can be used to set the
.Ar distance
(in pixels) that the mouse must move before the scrolling
mode is activated.
The default
.Ar distance
is 3 pixels.
.Pp
Use
.Fl U
option alternatively.
.It MousedWMode= Ar N
Make the physical button
.Ar N
act as the wheel mode button.
While this button is pressed, X and Y axis movement is reported to be zero
and the Y axis movement is mapped to Z axis.
You may further map the Z axis movement to virtual buttons by the
.Ar MousedMapZAxis
tag.
.Pp
Use
.Fl w
option alternatively.

.It MousedDriftTerminate
.It MousedDriftDistance
.It MousedDriftTime
.It MousedDriftAfter

Use this option if mouse pointer slowly wanders when mouse is not moved.
Movements up to
.Ar MousedDriftDistance
(for example 4) pixels (X+Y) in
.Ar MousedDriftTime
msec (default 500) are ignored, except during
.Ar MousedDriftAfter
msec (default 4000) since last real mouse movement.
