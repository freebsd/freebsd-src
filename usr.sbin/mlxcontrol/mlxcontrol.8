.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides status monitoring and management functions
for devices attached
to the
.Xr mlx 4
driver.
.Pp
Controller names are of the form "mlxN"
where N is the unit number of the controller.
Drive names are of the form "mlxdN"
where N is the unit number of the drive.
Do not specify the path to a device node.
.Bl -tag -width rebuild
.It status
Print the status of controllers and system drives.
If one or more drives are specified,
only print information about these drives,
otherwise print information
about all controllers and drives in the system.
With the
.Fl v
flag, display much more verbose information.
With the
.Fl q
flag, do not print any output.
This command returns
0 if all drives tested are online,
1 if one or more drives are critical and
2 if one or more are offline.
.It rescan
Rescan one or more controllers for non-attached system drives
(e.g.\& drives that have been
detached or created subsequent to driver initialisation).
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied, rescan all controllers in the system.
.It detach
Detach one or more system drives.
Drives must be unmounted
and not opened by any other utility for this command to succeed.
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied, detach all system drives from the nominated controller.
.It check
Initiate a consistency check and repair pass on a redundant system drive
(e.g.\& RAID1 or RAID5).
The controller will scan the system drive and repair any inconsistencies.
This command returns immediately;
use the
.Ar status
command to monitor the progress of the check.
.It rebuild
Requires two arguments,
.Ar controller
and
.Ar physdrive
as specified in the
output of the
.Ar status
command.
All system drives using space on the physical drive
.Ar physdrive
are rebuilt, reconstructing all data on the drive.
Note that each controller can only perform one rebuild at a time.
This command returns immediately; use the
.Ar status
command to monitor the progress of the rebuild.
.It config
Print the current configuration from the nominated controller.
This command will be updated
to allow addition/deletion of system drives from a configuration
in a future release.
.It help
Print usage information for
.Ar command .
