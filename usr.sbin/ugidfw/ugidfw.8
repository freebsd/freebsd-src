.Sh NAME
.Nm ugidfw
.Nd "firewall-like access controls for file system objects"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm list
.Nm
.Cm set
.Ar rulenum
.Cm subject
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Cm object
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Cm mode
.Ar arswxn
.Nm
.Cm remove
.Ar rulenum
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides an
.Xr ipfw 8 Ns -like
interface to manage accesses to file system objects by UID and GID,
supported by the
.Xr mac_bsdextended 4
.Xr mac 9
policy.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent
.It Cm list
Produces a list of all the current
.Nm
rules in the system.
.It Xo
.Cm set Ar rulenum
.Cm subject
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Cm object
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Cm mode
.Ar arswxn
.Xc
Add a new rule or modify an existing rule.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar rulenum"
.It Ar rulenum
Rule number.
Entries with a lower rule number
are applied first;
placing the most frequently-matched rules at the beginning of the list
(i.e. lower-numbered)
will yield a slight performance increase.
.It Xo
.Cm subject
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Xc
Subjects performing an operation must match
(or, if
.Cm not
is specified, must
.Em not
match)
the user and group specified by
.Ar uid
and/or
.Ar gid
for the rule to be applied.
.It Xo
.Cm object
.Op Cm not
.Op Cm uid Ar uid
.Op Cm gid Ar gid
.Xc
Objects must be owned by
(or, if
.Cm not
is specified, must
.Em not
be owned by)
the user and/or group specified by
.Ar uid
and/or
.Ar gid
for the rule to be applied.
.It Cm mode Ar arswxn
Similar to
.Xr chmod 1 ,
each character represents an access mode.
If the rule applies,
the specified access permissions are enforced
for the object.
When a character is specified in the rule,
the rule will allow for the operation.
Conversely, not including it will cause the operation
to be denied.
The definitions of each character are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm w" -compact -offset indent
.It Cm a
administrative operations
.It Cm r
read access
.It Cm s
access to file attributes
.It Cm w
write access
.It Cm x
execute access
.It Cm n
none
.El
.El
.It Cm remove Ar rulenum
Disable and remove the rule with the specified rule number.
