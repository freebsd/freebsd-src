.Sh NAME
.Nm jls
.Nd "list jails"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -libxo
.Op Fl dhNnqsv
.Op Fl j Ar jail
.Op Ar parameter ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility lists all active jails, or the specified jail.
Each jail is represented by space-separated values of the listed
.Ar parameters ,
one jail per line (unless the parameters themselves contain newlines).
The pseudo-parameter
.Va all
will show all available jail parameters.
A list of available parameters can be retrieved via
.Dq Nm sysctl Fl d Va security.jail.param .
See
.Xr jail 8
for a description of some core parameters.
.Pp
If no
.Ar parameters
or any of the options
.Fl hns
are given, the following four columns will be printed:
jail identifier (jid), IP address (ip4.addr), hostname (host.hostname),
and path (path).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -libxo
Generate output via
.Xr libxo 3
in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.
See
.Xr xo_options 7
for details on command line arguments.
.It Fl d
List
.Va dying
as well as active jails.
.It Fl h
Print a header line containing the parameters listed.
If no parameters are given on the command line,
.Va all
is assumed.
.It Fl N
In the standard display mode, print each jail's name instead of its
numeric ID.
If the jail does not have a name, the numeric ID is printed instead.
.It Fl n
Print parameters in
.Dq name=value
format, where each parameter is preceded by its name.
If no parameters are given on the command line,
.Va all
is assumed.
.It Fl q
Put quotes around parameters if they contain spaces or quotes, or are
the empty string.
.It Fl s
Print parameters suitable for passing to
.Xr jail 8 ,
skipping read-only and unused parameters.
Implies
.Fl nq .
.It Fl v
Extend the standard display with a multiple-line summary per jail,
containing the following parameters:
jail identifier (jid), hostname (host.hostname), path (path),
jail name (name), jail state (dying), cpuset ID (cpuset),
IP address(es) (ip4.addr and ip6.addr).
.It Fl j Ar jail
The jid or name of the
.Ar jail
to list.
Without this option, all active jails will be listed.
