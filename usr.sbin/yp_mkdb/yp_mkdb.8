.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates
.Xr db 3
style databases for use with
.Fx Ns 's
NIS server.
The
.Nm
utility reads data from
.Ar inputfile ,
and writes it to
.Ar dbname
in
.Xr db 3
format (using the hash table method).
The input should be in 'key data' format, which is to say
two fields of
.Tn ASCII
data separated by white space.
The first field
is assumed to be the key, and everything else is assumed to be
the data.
These databases are typically stored in
.Pa /var/yp/[domainname]
where
.Ar domainname
is the name of the NIS domain being served.
The
.Nm
utility is usually invoked by
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile .
The
.Nm
utility can also be used to dump an NIS database file so that its
contents can be examined.
For security reasons, all databases that
.Nm
creates are readable and writable by owner only (and usually the
owner is root).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Cause
.Nm
to send a YPPROC_CLEAR request to
.Xr ypserv 8
on the local host.
This signal tells the server to close any open
database descriptors and flush out its database cache.
If used alone,
this flag signals the server and does nothing else.
If used as part
of a database creation command,
.Nm
will send the signal only after the new database has been successfully
created.
.It Fl b
Cause
.Nm
to add a special entry to the database with a key of
.Em YP_INTERDOMAIN
and an empty data field.
If this key is present in a map, it alters the
behavior of the 'match' procedure in
.Xr ypserv 8
slightly.
If a match query fails (because the server could not find
a record that matched the supplied key), and the
.Em YP_INTERDOMAIN
key exists within the queried map,
.Xr ypserv 8
will try to match the entry again using a DNS lookup.
Note that this
special behavior only applies to the
.Em hosts
maps.
Using the
.Fl b
flag for other maps has no effect.
.It Fl s
This flag is used to add a special entry to the database with a key of
.Em YP_SECURE
and an empty data field.
If this key is present in a map,
.Xr ypserv 8
will deny access to the map to any client that is not using a
reserved port for its query.
This is used mainly for the
.Em master.passwd
maps, which should be restricted to privileged access only.
.It Fl f
This flag is used to turn on filtering of lines in the source file
input that start with ``+'' or ``-'' characters.
These characters
have special meaning for the
.Pa group ,
.Pa passwd
and
.Pa master.passwd
maps and hence should not be allowed to appear in them as the first
character of a key or datum.
If the
.Fl f
flag is used,
.Nm
will reject any source line that starts with a ``+'' or ``-''
character and issue a warning message displaying the line that
was dropped.
.It Fl u Ar dbname
Dump (or 'unwind') an NIS database.
This option can be used to
inspect the contents of an existing NIS database.
.It Fl i Ar inputfile
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Ar inputfile
as a special entry in the database with a key of
.Em YP_INPUT_FILE .
.It Fl o Ar outputfile
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Ar outputfile
as a special entry in the database with a key of
.Em YP_OUTPUT_FILE .
.It Fl d Ar domainname
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Ar domainname
as a special entry in the database with a key of
.Em YP_DOMAIN_NAME .
.It Fl m Ar mastername
When generating an NIS map, encode
.Ar mastername
as a special entry in the database with a key of
.Em YP_MASTER_NAME .
This entry in the database is frequently used by various NIS utilities
to determine the name of an NIS master server for a domain.
By default,
.Nm
assumes that the local host is the NIS master; the
.Fl m
option is used to override this default.
