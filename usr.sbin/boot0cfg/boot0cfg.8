.Sh NAME
.Nm boot0cfg
.Nd boot manager installation/configuration utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm boot0cfg
.Op Fl Bv
.Op Fl b Ar boot0
.Op Fl d Ar drive
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl s Ar slice
.Op Fl t Ar ticks
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The FreeBSD
.Sq boot0
boot manager permits the operator to select from which disk and which
slice an i386 machine (PC) is booted.
.Pp
Note that what are referred to here as
.Dq slices
are typically called
.Dq partitions
in non-BSD documentation relating to the PC.  Typically, only
non-removable disks are sliced.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility optionally installs the
.Sq boot0
boot manager on the specified
.Ar disk ;
and allows various operational parameters to be configured.
.Pp
On PCs, a boot manager typically occupies sector 0 of a disk, which is
known as the Master Boot Record (MBR).  The MBR contains both code (to
which control is passed by the PC BIOS) and data (an embedded table of
defined slices).
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Install the
.Sq boot0
boot manager.  This option causes MBR code to be replaced, but without
affecting the embedded slice table.
.It Fl v
Verbose: display information about the slices defined, etc.
.It Fl b Ar boot0
Specify which
.Sq boot0
image to use.  The default is /boot/boot0.
.It Fl d Ar drive
Specify the drive number used by the PC BIOS in referencing the drive
which contains the specified
.Ar disk .
Typically this will be 0x80 for the first hard drive, 0x81 for the
second hard drive, and so on; however any integer between 0 and 0xff
is acceptable here.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify that a backup copy of the preexisting MBR should be written to
.Ar file .
This file is created if it does not exist, and truncated if it does.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify slices to be enabled/disabled, where
.Ar mask
is an integer between 0 (no slices enabled) and 0xf (all four slices
enabled).
.It Fl o Ar options
A comma-separated string of any of the following options may be
specified (with
.Dq no
prepended as necessary):
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It packet
Use the disk packet (BIOS Int 0x13 extensions) interface rather than
the conventional (CHS) interface, when accessing disk-related BIOS
services.  The default is
.Sq nopacket .
.It setdrv
Forces the drive containing the disk to be referenced using drive
number definable by means of the -d option.  The default is
.Sq nosetdrv .
.It update
Allow the MBR to be updated by the boot manager.  (The MBR may be
updated to flag slices as
.Sq active ,
and to save slice selection information.)  This is the default; a
.Sq noupdate
option causes the MBR to be treated as read-only.
.El
.It Fl s Ar slice
Set the default boot selection to
.Ar slice .
Values between 1 and 4 refer to slices; a value of 5 refers to the
option of booting from a second disk. This would normally be used in
conjunction with the
.Sq noupdate
option.
.It Fl t Ar ticks
Set the timeout value to
.Ar ticks .
(There are approximately 18.2 ticks per second.)
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success and >0 on error.

.Sh BUGS
Use of the
.Sq packet
option may cause
.Sq boot0
to fail, depending on the nature of BIOS support.
.Pp
Use of the
.Sq setdrv
option with an incorrect -d operand may cause the MBR to be written
to the wrong disk.  Be careful!
