.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Xten
is a command-line interface to the X-10 daemon.
When invoked with a one-letter house code (A-P) and a series of key/unit
codes as arguments, it requests the X-10 daemon to transmit a corresponding
series of X-10 packets.  The X-10 daemon makes its best effort to ensure
that the packets are all transmitted correctly, though in general it is
not possible to tell whether the commands were actually received and
executed by the remote X-10 devices.
.Pp
When invoked with the single argument
.Fl "" ,
.Nm
enters an interactive mode in which a line is repeatedly read from the
standard input, sent to the X-10 daemon, and the one-line response from
the daemon printed on the standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Ar house
argument is a one-letter house code in the range A-P.
All the X-10 requests generated will refer to this house code.
Each
.Ar key
is either a numeric unit code in the range 1-16, or else
is a string that specifies an X-10 function.  The possible
function code strings are:
.Bl -diag
.It AllUnitsOff
.It AllLightsOn
.It On
.It Off
.It Dim
.It Bright
.It AllLightsOff
.It ExtendedCode
.It HailRequest
.It HailAcknowledge
.It PreSetDim0
.It PreSetDim1
.It ExtendedData
.It StatusOn
.It StatusOff
.It StatusRequest
.El
.Pp
Each
.Ar key
may be followed by an optional numeric
.Ar cnt ,
which specifies the number of packets that are to be sent with that
key code without gaps.  If this argument is omitted, two packets
are transmitted.  The ability to specify numbers of packets other than
two is used by the X-10
.Em Dim
and
.Em Bright
commands.
