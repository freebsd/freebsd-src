.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Aq Fl d Ar dev
.Aq Fl c Ar cmd
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl l Ar LBA
.Op Fl o Ar rep_opts
.Op Fl P Ar print_opts
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Manage
.Tn SCSI
and
.Tn ATA
Zoned Block devices.
This allows managing devices that conform to the
.Tn SCSI
Zoned Block Commands (ZBC) and
.Tn ATA
Zoned ATA Command Set (ZAC)
specifications.
Devices using these command sets are usually hard drives using Shingled
Magnetic Recording (SMR).
There are three types of SMR drives:
.Bl -tag -width 13n
.It Drive Managed
Drive Managed drives look and act just like a standard random access block
device, but underneath, the drive reads and writes the bulk of its capacity
using SMR zones.
Sequential writes will yield better performance, but writing sequentially
is not required.
.It Host Aware
Host Aware drives expose the underlying zone layout via
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn ATA
commands and allow the host to manage the zone conditions.
The host is not required to manage the zones on the drive, though.
Sequential writes will yield better performance in Sequential Write
Preferred zones, but the host can write randomly in those zones.
.It Host Managed
Host Managed drives expose the underlying zone layout via
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn ATA
commands.
The host is required to access the zones according to the rules described
by the zone layout.
Any commands that violate the rules will be returned with an error.
.El
.Pp
SMR drives are divided into zones (typically in the range of 256MB each)
that fall into three general categories:
.Bl -tag -width 20n
.It Conventional
These are also known as Non Write Pointer zones.
These zones can be randomly written without an unexpected performance penalty.
.It Sequential Preferred
These zones should be written sequentially starting at the write pointer
for the zone.
They may be written randomly.
Writes that do not conform to the zone layout may be significantly slower
than expected.
.It Sequential Required
These zones must be written sequentially.
If they are not written sequentially, starting at the write pointer, the
command will fail.
.El
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Fl c Ar cmd
Specify the zone subcommand:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It params
Display device parameters, including the type of device (Drive Managed,
Host Aware, Host Managed, Not Zoned), the zone commands supported, and
how many open zones it supports.
.It rz
Issue the Report Zones command.
All zones are returned by default.
Specify report options with
.Fl o
and printing options with
.Fl P .
Specify the starting LBA with
.Fl l .
Note that
.Dq reportzones
is also accepted as a command argument.
.It open
Explicitly open the zone specified by the starting LBA.
.It close
Close the zone specified by starting LBA.
.It finish
Finish the zone specified by the starting LBA.
.It rwp
Reset the write pointer for the zone specified by the starting LBA.
.El
.It Fl a
For the Open, Close, Finish, and Reset Write Pointer operations, apply the
operation to all zones on the drive.
.It Fl l Ar lba
Specify the starting LBA.
For the Report Zones command, this tells the drive to report starting with
the zone that starts at the given LBA.
For the other commands, this allows the user to identify the zone requested
by its starting LBA.
The LBA may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal or octal notation.
.It Fl o Ar rep_opt
For the Report Zones command, specify a subset of zones to report.
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It all
Report all zones.
This is the default.
.It empty
Report only empty zones.
.It imp_open
Report zones that are implicitly open.
This means that the host has sent a write to the zone without explicitly
opening the zone.
.It exp_open
Report zones that are explicitly open.
.It closed
Report zones that have been closed by the host.
.It full
Report zones that are full.
.It ro
Report zones that are in the read only state.
Note that
.Dq readonly
is also accepted as an argument.
.It offline
Report zones that are in the offline state.
.It reset
Report zones that the device recommends should have their write pointers reset.
.It nonseq
Report zones that have the Non Sequential Resources Active flag set.
These are zones that are Sequential Write Preferred, but have been written
non-sequentially.
.It nonwp
Report Non Write Pointer zones, also known as Conventional zones.
.El
.It Fl P Ar print_opt
Specify a printing option for Report Zones:
.Bl -tag -width 7n
.It normal
Normal Report Zones output.
This is the default.
The summary and column headings are printed, fields are separated by spaces
and the fields themselves may contain spaces.
.It summary
Just print the summary:  the number of zones, the maximum LBA (LBA of the
last logical block on the drive), and the value of the
.Dq same
field.
The
.Dq same
field describes whether the zones on the drive are all identical, all
different, or whether they are the same except for the last zone, etc.
.It script
Print the zones in a script friendly format.
The summary and column headings are omitted, the fields are separated by
commas, and the fields do not contain spaces.
The fields contain underscores where spaces would normally be used.
