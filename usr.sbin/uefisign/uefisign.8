.It Fl V
Determine whether the file is signed.
Note that this does not verify the correctness of the signature;
only that the file contains a signature.
.It Fl k
Name of file containing the private key used to sign the binary.
.It Fl c
Name of file containing the certificate used to sign the binary.
