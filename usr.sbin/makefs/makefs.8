.Ar image-file
.Ar directory | manifest
.Op Ar extra-directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The utility
.Nm
creates a file system image into
.Ar image-file
from the directory tree
.Ar directory
or from the mtree manifest
.Ar manifest .
If any optional directory trees are passed in the
.Ar extra-directory
arguments, then the directory tree of each argument will be merged
into the
.Ar directory
or
.Ar manifest
first before creating
.Ar image-file .
No special devices or privileges are required to perform this task.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl B Ar endian
Set the byte order of the image to
.Ar endian .
Valid byte orders are
.Ql 4321 ,
.Ql big ,
or
.Ql be
for big endian, and
.Ql 1234 ,
.Ql little ,
or
.Ql le
for little endian.
Some file systems may have a fixed byte order; in those cases this
argument will be ignored.
.It Fl b Ar free-blocks
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-blocks
free blocks exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-blocks
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl D
Treat duplicate paths in an mtree manifest as warnings not error.
If this flag is specified more than once, warnings about duplicate paths
are not printed at all.
.It Fl d Ar debug-mask
Enable various levels of debugging, depending upon which bits are
set in
.Ar debug-mask .
This option is intended for source debugging.
.Ar debug-mask
is a bit map defined in the header file
.Ar makefs.h .
See the source for usage, and look for defines starting with
.Ar DEBUG_ .
.It Fl F Ar mtree-specfile
.Em This is almost certainly not the option you are looking for.
To create an image from a list of files in an mtree format manifest,
specify it as the last argument on the command line, not as a the
argument to
.Fl F .
.Pp
Use
.Ar mtree-specfile
as an
.Xr mtree 8
.Sq specfile
specification.
This option has no effect when the image is created from a mtree manifest
rather than a directory.
.Pp
If a specfile entry exists in the underlying file system, its
permissions and modification time will be used unless specifically
overridden by the specfile.
An error will be raised if the type of entry in the specfile
conflicts with that of an existing entry.
.Pp
In the opposite case (where a specfile entry does not have an entry
in the underlying file system) the following occurs:
If the specfile entry is marked
.Sy optional ,
the specfile entry is ignored.
Otherwise, the entry will be created in the image, and it is
necessary to specify at least the following parameters in the
specfile:
.Sy type ,
.Sy mode ,
.Sy gname ,
or
.Sy gid ,
and
.Sy uname
or
.Sy uid ,
and
.Sy link
(in the case of symbolic links).
If
.Sy time
is not provided, the current time will be used.
If
.Sy flags
is not provided, the current file flags will be used.
Missing regular file entries will be created as zero-length files.
.It Fl f Ar free-files
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-files
free files (inodes) exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-files
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl M Ar minimum-size
Set the minimum size of the file system image to
.Ar minimum-size .
.It Fl m Ar maximum-size
Set the maximum size of the file system image to
.Ar maximum-size .
An error will be raised if the target file system needs to be larger
than this to accommodate the provided directory tree.
.It Fl N Ar userdb-dir
Use the user database text file
.Pa master.passwd
and group database text file
.Pa group
from
.Ar userdb-dir ,
rather than using the results from the system's
.Xr getpwnam 3
and
.Xr getgrnam 3
(and related) library calls.
.It Fl O Ar offset
Instead of creating the filesystem at the beginning of the file, start
at offset.
Valid only for
.Sy ffs
and
.Sy msdos .
.It Fl o Ar fs-options
Set file system specific options.
.Ar fs-options
is a comma separated list of options.
Valid file system specific options are detailed below.
.It Fl p
Deprecated.
Create a sparse file for
.Sy ffs .
This is the same as the preferred
.Fl Z
flag.
.It Fl R Ar roundup-size
Round the image up to
.Ar roundup-size .
.Ar roundup-size
should be a multiple of the file system block size.
This option only applies to the
.Sy ffs
file system type.
.It Fl S Ar sector-size
Set the file system sector size to
.Ar sector-size .
.\" XXX: next line also true for cd9660?
Defaults to 512.
.It Fl s Ar image-size
Set the size of the file system image to
.Ar image-size .
This is equivalent to setting both the minimum
.Fl ( M )
and the maximum
.Fl ( m )
sizes to the same value.
For
.Sy ffs
and
.Sy msdos
the
.Ar image-size
does not include the
.Ar offset .
.Ar offset
is not included in that size.
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
Specify a timestamp to be set for all filesystem files and directories
created so that repeatable builds are possible.
The
.Ar timestamp
can be a
.Pa pathname ,
where the timestamps are derived from that file, or an integer
value interpreted as the number of seconds from the Epoch.
Timestamps in a
.Xr mtree 5
specfile (specified with
.Fl F )
are used even if a default timestamp is specified.
However, the timestamps in an mtree manifest are ignored
if a default timestamp is specified.
.It Fl t Ar fs-type
Create an
.Ar fs-type
file system image.
The following file system types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width cd9660 -offset indent
.It Sy ffs
BSD fast file system (default).
.It Sy cd9660
ISO 9660 file system.
.It Sy msdos
FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32 file system.
.It Sy zfs
ZFS pool containing one or more file systems.
.El
.It Fl x
Exclude file system nodes not explicitly listed in the specfile.
.It Fl Z
Create a sparse file for
.Sy ffs .
This is useful for virtual machine images.
.El
.Pp
Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.
Two or more numbers may be separated by an
.Dq x
to indicate a product.
Each number may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 3n -offset indent -compact
.It b
Block; multiply by 512
.It k
Kibi; multiply by 1024 (1 KiB)
.It m
Mebi; multiply by 1048576 (1 MiB)
.It g
Gibi; multiply by 1073741824 (1 GiB)
.It t
Tebi; multiply by 1099511627776 (1 TiB)
.It w
Word; multiply by the number of bytes in an integer
.El
.\"
.\"

.El
.Ss zfs-specific options
The image created by
.Nm
contains a ZFS pool with a single vdev of type
.Ql disk .
The root dataset is always created implicitly and contains the entire input
directory tree unless additional datasets are specified using the options
described below.
.Pp
To keep images reproducible, the pool GUID and other random identifiers will
always be the same across runs of
.Nm .
This means that when a pool is first imported, its GUID should be reset
using
.Xr zpool-reguid 8
to avoid conflicting with other pools also generated by
.Nm ;
otherwise, it will not be possible to import other pools.
This can be configured from
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
using the
.Va zpool_reguid
variable.
.Pp
The arguments consist of a keyword, an equal sign
.Pq Ql = ,
and a value.
The following keywords are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width omit-trailing-period -offset indent -compact
.It ashift
The base-2 logarithm of the minimum block size.
Typical values are 9 (512B blocks) and 12 (4KB blocks).
The default value is 12.
.It bootfs
The name of the bootable dataset for the pool.
Specifying this option causes the
.Ql bootfs
property to be set in the created pool.
.It mssize
The size of metaslabs in the created pool.
By default,
.Nm
allocates large (up to 512MB) metaslabs with the expectation that
the image will be auto-expanded upon first use.
This option allows the default heuristic to be overridden.
.It verify-txgs
Prompt OpenZFS to verify pool metadata during import.
This is disabled by default as it may significantly increase import times.
.It poolname
The name of the ZFS pool.
This option must be specified.
.It rootpath
An implicit path prefix added to dataset mountpoints.
By default it is
.Pa /<poolname> .
For creating bootable pools, the
.Va rootpath
should be set to
.Pa / .
At least one dataset must have a mountpoint equal to
.Va rootpath .
.It fs
Create an additional dataset.
This option may be specified multiple times.
The argument value must be of the form
.Ar <dataset>[;<prop1=v1>[;<prop2=v2>[;...]]] ,
where
.Ar dataset
is the name of the dataset and must belong to the pool's namespace.
For example, with a pool name of
.Ql test
all dataset names must be prefixed by
.Ql test/ .
A dataset must exist at each level of the pool's namespace.
For example, to create
.Ql test/foo/bar ,
.Ql test/foo
must be created as well.
.Pp
The dataset mountpoints determine how the datasets are populated with
files from the staged directory tree.
Conceptually, all datasets are mounted before any are populated with files.
The root of the staged directory tree is mapped to
.Va rootpath .
.Pp
Dataset properties, as described in
.Xr zfsprops 7 ,
may be specified following the dataset name.
The following properties may be set for a dataset:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent
.It atime
.It canmount
.It exec
.It mountpoint
.It setuid
