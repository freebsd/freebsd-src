.Dt ADDUSER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm adduser.conf
.Nd
.Xr adduser 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/adduser.conf
file is automatically generated by the
.Xr adduser 8
utility when invoked with the
.Fl C
command-line option.
It is not meant to be edited by hand.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/adduser.conf
file is used to pre-set certain configuration options for
the
.Xr adduser 8
utility.
When
.Xr adduser 8
is invoked, it will check to see if this file exists, and
if so, the configuration will be used or offered as the
default settings.
The
.Nm
file offers three types of configuration:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Default settings offered by
.Xr adduser 8 .
These options are specified in the configuration file and offered
as the default during every invocation of the
.Xr adduser 8
utility.
.It
Configuration options which can be set in
.Nm ,
but overridden by passing a flag to
.Xr adduser 8 .
.It
Configuration supported by
.Xr adduser 8
but not offered by a flag or during initial invocation.
.El
.Pp
In the first case, these options can be set in
.Nm
but will still be offered when
.Xr adduser 8
is invoked.
In the second case,
.Xr adduser 8
will read the configuration data unless a flag
has been passed to override it.
For example, the
.Va defaultshell
option.
In the third case, the configuration will be utilized, but the
user will never be prompted to modify the default setting by
either a flag or an
.Xr adduser 8
prompt.
For example, the
.Va upwexpire
setting.
.Pp
The following configuration options can be set in
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Va defaultgroups" -offset indent
.It Va defaultLgroup
The default group new users will be added to.
.It Va defaultclass
The default class to place users in as described in
.Xr login.conf 5 .
.It Va defaultgroups
This option is used to specify what other groups the new account
should be added to.
.It Va passwdtype
May be one of
.Cm no , none , random ,
or
.Cm yes ,
as described in
.Xr adduser 8 .
As such, the text is not duplicated here and may be
read in
.Xr adduser 8 .
.It Va homeprefix
The default home directory prefix, usually
.Pa /home .
.It Va defaultshell
The user's default shell which may be any of the shells listed in
.Xr shells 5 .
.It Va udotdir
Defines the location of the default shell and environment
configuration files.
.It Va msgfile
Location of the default new user message file.
This message will be sent to all new users if specified
here or at the
.Xr adduser 8
prompt.
.It Va disableflag
The default message enclosed in brackets for the
lock account prompt.
.It Va upwexpire
The default password expiration time.
Format of the date is either a
.Ux
time in decimal, or a date in
.Sm off
.Ar dd No - Ar mmm No - Ar yy Op Ar yy
.Sm on
format, where
.Ar dd
is the day,
.Ar mmm
is the month in either numeric or
alphabetic format, and
.Ar yy Ns Op Ar yy
is either a two or four digit year.
This option also accepts a relative date in the form of
.Sm off
.Ar n Op Ar m h d w o y
.Sm on
where
.Ar n
is a decimal, octal (leading 0) or hexadecimal (leading 0x) digit
followed by the number of Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months or
Years from the current date at
which the expiration time is to be set.
.It Va uexpire
The default account expire time.
The format is similar to the
.Va upwexpire
option.
.It Va ugecos
The default information to be held in the GECOS field of
.Pa /etc/master.passwd .
.It Va uidstart
The default user ID setting.
This must be a number above 1000 and fewer than 65534.
.It Va Zcreate
Set to
.Dq no
to prevent the creation of a ZFS home dataset if
.Va homeprefix
is a ZFS mountpoint.
