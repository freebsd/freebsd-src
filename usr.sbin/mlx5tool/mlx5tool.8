.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is provided for management of the Connect-X4, 5 and 6 network adapters
in the aspects not covered by the generic
.Xr ifconfig 8
command, mostly related to the PCIe attachment and internal card working.
The utility executes commands on specific adapter, which is addressed using
.Em device:bus:slot:function
conventions of the PCIe buses.
You can match adapters ethernet name and addresses using the
.Xr pciconf 8
utility.
The address is passed as an argument of the
.Fl d
option, which must be specified for each invocation.
.Pp
When the driver detects the malfunctioning of the hardware, or by user
request, it is possible to create
.Em firmware dump ,
which contains debugging information about internal device state, for
analysis of the failure by the Mellanox support team.
.Pp
The following commands are currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E
Print EEPROM information
.It Fl e
Take the snapshot of the firmware registers state and store it in the
kernel buffer.
The buffer must be empty, in other words, no dumps should be written so
far, or existing dump cleared with the
.It Fl f
Flashes the firmware image
.Fa file.mfa2
to the specified adapter.
Image must be in MFA2 pack format and contain a component suitable
for the adapter hardware.
.Pp
Typically, PCIe link-level reset is required to activate the
newly flashed image, which can be performed by the system reboot
or using the
.Fl z
option.
.Fl r
command for the specified device.
.It Fl r
Clear the stored firmware dump, preparing the kernel buffer for
the next dump.
.It Fl w
Fetches the stored firmware dump and writes it into the file specified
by the
.Fl o
option argument.
.It Fl z
Performs PCIe link-level reset on the specified device.
.El
.Sh FILES
The
.Pa /dev/mlx5ctl
.Xr devfs 4
node is used to pass commands to the driver.
