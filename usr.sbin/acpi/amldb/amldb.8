.Sh NAME
.Nm amldb
.Nd executing and debugging AML interpreter
(with DSDT files)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhst
.Ar dsdt_file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility parses the DSDT
(Differentiated System Description Table)
files, which usually are acquired from ACPI BIOS, and executes
the sequence of ACPI Control Methods described in AML
(ACPI Machine Language)
with its AML interpreter.
The
.Nm
utility also has a simple ACPI virtual machine.  During execution of the
Control Methods each access to the region, such as
SystemMemory, SystemIO, PCI_Config, does not affect the real
hardware but only the virtual machine.
Because the sequence of virtual accesses is maintained in user space,
AML interpreter developers need not worry about any effect on hardware
when they analyze DSDT data files.  They can develop and debug the
interpreter, even if the machine has no ACPI BIOS.
.Pp
The developer will need to acquire a DSDT data file from any machine
with ACPI BIOS through
.Xr acpidump 8 .
The DSDT is a table, a part of the whole ACPI memory table
located in somewhere in the BIOS area
.Pq Li 0xa0000 \- 0x100000 .
It includes such information as the detailed hardware information
for PnP, and the set of procedures which perform power management from
the OS.  The information is stored in AML format.
.Pp
The AML interpreter can execute any of the Control Methods specified
by users.  When executed, it interprets the byte sequence in the
Control Method of DSDT, and disassembles the opcodes that it
recognizes into ASL
(ACPI Source Language)
format to be displayed.
.Pp
If it encounters one of more accesses to the region such as
SystemMemory in executing the Control Methods, its ACPI Virtual
Machine simulates the input/output operations to the resources in the
region.  In writing to a certain region, the ACPI Virtual Machine
prepares a piece of memory corresponding to its address,
if necessary, and holds the specified value in the memory as the
.Em region contents .
In reading from a certain region, it fetches the value in the memory
.Pq Em region contents ,
prompts with it as the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
DEBUG[read(0, 0x100b6813)&mask:0x1](default: 0x1 / 1) >>
.Ed
.Pp
for users to have the opportunity to modify it, and hands it to
the AML interpreter.  In case that there is no corresponding region
in the AML Virtual Machine, the value zero is handed.
.Pp
The interpreter continues to maintain all of the
.Em region contents
until
.Nm
terminates.  You can specify their initial values with the file
.Pa region.ini
in the current directory.  If it is executed with
.Fl d
option, it dumps the final status of all of its
.Em region contents
to the file
.Pa region.dmp
when it terminates.  Each line of there files consists of the following
fields, separated by tabs; region type, address, and value.
Region types are specified as follows;
.TS H
box;
c | l.
value	region type
=
0	SystemMemory
1	SystemIO
2	PCI_Concig
3	EmbeddedControl
4	SMBus
.TE
.Pp
Interactive commands are described below:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm s
.Em Single step :
Performs single-step execution of the current Control Method.  If
the next instruction is an invocation of another Control Method,
the step execution will continue in the following Control Method.
.It Cm n
.Em Step program :
Performs single-step execution of the current Control Method.
Even if the next instruction is an invocation of another Control
Method, the step execution will not continue.
.It Cm c
.Em Continue program being debugged :
Resumes execution of the AML interpreter.  Because the current
.Nm
has no way of breakpoint, this command might not so much useful.
.It Cm q
.Em Quit method execution :
Terminates execution of the current Control Method.  If
.Nm
is not in execution, this command causes to input the next
DSDT data file.  If there are no next DSDT data files, it
terminates
.Nm
itself.
.It Cm t
.Em Show local name space tree and variables :
Displays the structure of the ACPI namespace tree.  If
.Nm
is in execution, this command displays the structure that relates
to the objects, arguments, and local variables below the scope of the
current Control Method.
.It Cm i
.Em Toggle region input prompt :
Switches whether the prompt for modifying the value read from the
.Em region contents
be showed or not.  Default is On.
.It Cm o
.Em Toggle region output prompt :
Switches whether the prompt for modifying the value to be written
to the region contents will be shown or not.  The default is Off.
.It Cm m
.Em Show memory management statistics :
Displays the current statistics of the memory management system
on the AML interpreter.
.It Cm r Ar method
.Em Run specified method :
Executes the specified Control Method.  If it requires one or
more arguments, a prompt such as the following appears;
.Bd -literal
Method: Arg 1 From 0x280626ce To 0x28062775
  Enter argument values (ex. number 1 / string foo). 'q' to quit.
  Arg0 ?
.Ed
.Pp
For each argument, a pair of type string and value delimited by
one or more spaces can be entered.  Now only
.Ic number
and
.Ic string
can be specified as the type string.
In the current implementation, only the first character of the type
string, such as
.Ic n
or
.Ic s ,
is identified.  For example, we can enter as follows:
.Bd -literal
  Arg0 ? n 1
.Ed
.Pp
.It Cm f Ar string
.Em Find named objects from namespace :
Lists the named objects that includes the specified string as the
terminate elements searching from the ACPI namespace.  For the
namespace is expressed as the sequence of four-character elements,
appropriate number of additional underscore
.Pq Ql _
characters are necessary for specifying objects which have less than four
character string.  Unless additional underscores specified, matching
occurs as the beginning of word with the specified number of characters.
.It Cm h
.Em Show help message :
Displays the command summary of
.Nm .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
Exactly one of the following options must be specified.  Otherwise,
.Nm
shows its usage and terminates.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Dump the final status of all of the
.Em region contents
in the ACPI Virtual Machine to the file
.Pa region.dmp .
.It Fl h
Terminate with the usage of this command.
.It Fl s
Display the statistics of the memory management system on the
AML interpreter when
.Nm
terminates.
.It Fl t
Display the tree structure of ACPI namespace after the
DSDT data file is read.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example including, invoking the
.Nm ,
searching
.Li _PRS
(Possible Resource Settings)
objects, and executing the
.Li _PTS
(Prepare To Sleep)
Control Method by the AML interpreter.

.Sh BUGS
The ACPI virtual machine does not completely simulate the behavior
of a machine with an ACPI BIOS.  In the current implementation, the
ACPI virtual machine only reads or writes the stored values by
emulating access to regions such as SystemMemory.
.Pp
Because the AML interpreter interprets and disassembles
simultaneously, it is impossible to implement such features as setting
breakpoints with the specified line number in ASL.  Setting breakpoints
at certain Control Methods, which is not very difficult, has not
yet implemented because nobody has ever needed it.
