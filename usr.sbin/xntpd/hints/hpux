This file hopefully describes the whatever and however of how to get xntp
running on hpux 8.0 and later s300, s700, and s800.  

First off,  all the standard disclaimers hold here ... HP doesn't have anthing
to do with this stuff.  I fool with it in my spare time because we use it and
because I like to.  We just happen to have a lot of HP machines around here :-)
Xntp has been in use here for several months and has a fair amount of mileage
on various HP platforms within the company.  I can't really guarantee bug fixes
but I'd certainly like to hear about bugs and I won't hestitate to look at
any fixes sent to me.  

Now lets talk OS.  If you don't have 8.0 or later, pretty much hang it up now.
This stuff has run here on 8.0 s300, s700, and s800.  Its possible that it 
runs on 7.0 but I have not tried v3 code on 7.0 at all.

[Note that recent reports state that this release does in fact run on HP
300 and 400 boxes, which run 7.0 - Ed.]

Next, let me explain a bit about how this stuff works on HP-UX since we don't
have adjtime(2).  The directory adjtime contains libadjtime.a and the adjtimed
daemon.  Instead of the adjtime(2) system call, we use a library routine to
talk to adjtimed thru message queues.  Adjtimed munges into /dev/kmem and
causes the clock to skew properly as needed.  PLEASE NOTE that the adjtime
code provided here is NOT a general replacement for adjtime(2) ... use of
this adjtime(3)/adjtimed(8) other than here may yield very odd results.

What to do to get this stuff running ?

    * cd ..
	* Say "make makeconfig"

    * cd ..
	* Say "make", sit back for a few minutes.

    * cd authstuff
	* Say "./authcert < certdata" and check the output.  Every line should
	  end with "OK" ... if not, we got trouble.
	* Now try "./authspeed auth.samplekeys".  What we want to 
	  remember here is the "authentication delay in CPU time" 

    * cd ..
	* Now we need to install this stuff ... make install will not work
	  unless you have replaced the SYSV install command with a BSD
	  compatible version.  So ... the simplest thing to do is run
	  make -n install and do manually what it would have done.

    * I'd suggest reading the xntp docs about now :-) ... seriously !!

    * Check out the docs and the stuff in xntp/conf and build a config
      file ... put it in /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf (or where ever you
      defined the config file to be in Config).  One thing we have 
      added to this version of xntpd is a way to select config files
      if you are sharing /usr/local thru NFS or whatever.  If the 
      file /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf happens to be a directory, the files
      in that directory are searched until a match is found.  The rules
      for a match are:

	1. Our hostname
	2. default.<machine id> (as in default.375 or default.850)
	3. default

    * Ok, make sure adjtimed is running (just start it up for now with
      "/usr/local/etc/adjtimed").  Using -z as an option will get you 
      a usage message.

    * Now start up xntpd and watch it work.

    * Make sure that adjtimed gets started at boot right before xntpd.
      We do this in /etc/netbsdsrc.  They must both run as root !!

Possible problems ?

    * On some 320's and 835's we have had to run adjtimed with "-p 45" or
      so to get rid of syslog messages about "last adjust did not finish".

Anything else ... just drop me a line at ken@sdd.hp.com
