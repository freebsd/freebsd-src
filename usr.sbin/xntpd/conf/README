README file for directory ./conf of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP Version 3 daemon xntpd. These files illustrate some of the more
obtuse configurations you may run into. They are not likely to do
anything good if run on machines other than their native spot, so don't
just blindly copy something and put it up. Additional information can
be found in the ./doc directory of the base directory.
