 * "We have the machine that goes 'ping!'" -- Monty Python
 *
 * This function blasts packets at the YPPROC_DOMAIN_NONACK procedures
 * of the NIS servers listed in restricted_addrs structure.
 * Whoever replies the fastest becomes our chosen server.
 *
 * Note: THIS IS NOT A BROADCAST OPERATION! We could use clnt_broadcast()
 * for this, but that has the following problems:
 * - We only get the address of the machine that replied in the
 *   'eachresult' callback, and on multi-homed machines this can
 *   lead to confusion.
 * - clnt_broadcast() only transmits to local networks, whereas with
 *   NIS+ you can have a perfectly good server located anywhere on or
 *   off the local network.
 * - clnt_broadcast() blocks for an arbitrary amount of time which the
 *   caller can't control -- we want to avoid that.
 *
 * Also note that this has nothing to do with the NIS_PING procedure used
 * for replica updates.
