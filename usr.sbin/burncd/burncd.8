.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to burn CD-R/RW media using the ATAPI cd driver.
.Pp
Available options and operands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl f Ar device
set the device to use for the burning process.
.It Fl s Ar speed
set the speed of the burner device.
Defaults to 1.
.It Fl e
eject the media when done.
.It Fl l
read a list of image files from filename.
.It Fl m
close disk in multisession mode (otherwise disk is closed as singlesession).
.It Fl p
use preemphasis on audio tracks.
.It Fl q
quiet, do not print progress messages.
.It Fl t
test write, do not actually write on the media.
.El
.Pp
.Ar command
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm msinfo
Show the first LBA of the last track on the media
and the next writeable address on the media for use with the
.Xr mkisofs 8 Ns 's
.Fl C
switch when adding additional data to ISO filesystems with extra sessions.
.It Cm blank
Blank a CD-RW medium.
This uses the fast blanking method, so data are not physically overwritten,
only those areas that make the media appear blank for further usage are erased.
.It Cm erase
Erase a CD-RW medium.
This erases the entire media.
Can take up to 1 hour to finish.
.It Cm fixate
Fixate the medium so that the TOC is generated and the media can be used
in an ordinary CD drive.
The driver defaults to creating singlesession media (see
.Fl m
option).
Should be the last command to
.Nm
as the program exits when this has been done.
.It Cm raw | audio
Set the write mode to produce audio (raw mode) tracks for the following
images on the command line.
.It Cm data | mode1
Set the write mode to produce data (mode1) tracks for the following
image files
on the command line.
.It Cm mode2
Set the write mode to produce data (mode2) tracks for the following
image files
on the command line.
.It Cm XAmode1
Set the write mode to produce data (XAmode1) tracks for the following image
files on the command line.
.It Ar file
All other arguments are treated as filenames of images to write to the media,
or in case the
.Fl l
option is used as files containing lists of images.
.El
.Pp
Files whose length are not a multiple of the current media blocksize are
quietly zero padded to fit the blocksize requirement.
The conventional filename
.Fl
refers to stdin, and can only be used once.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical usage for burning a data CD-R:
.Bd -literal
# burncd -f /dev/acd0c data file1 fixate
.Ed
.Pp
The typical usage for burning an audio CD-R:
.Bd -literal
# burncd -f /dev/acd0c audio file1 file2 file3 fixate
.Ed
.Pp
The typical usage for burning a mixed mode CD-R:
.Bd -literal
# burncd -f /dev/acd0c data file1 audio file2 file3 fixate
.Ed
.Pp
The typical usage for burning from a compressed image file on stdin:
.Bd -literal
# gunzip -c file.iso.gz | burncd -f /dev/acd0c data - fixate
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
Probably, please report when found.
