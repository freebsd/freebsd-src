.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to set various keyboard related options for the
.Xr syscons 4
or
.Xr vt 4
console driver and the keyboard drivers,
such as key map, keyboard repeat and delay rates, bell
characteristics etc.
.Pp
Keyboard options may be automatically configured at system boot time by
setting variables in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
See
.Sx Boot Time Configuration
below.
.Pp
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar name
Detach the keyboard, specified by the keyboard device name, from the keyboard
multiplexer.
When using this option, the standard input of the
.Nm
process should be redirected from the keyboard multiplexer keyboard device
(if the keyboard multiplexer is not the active keyboard) or
.Pa /dev/console
(if the keyboard multiplexer is the active keyboard and
you are not working on the system console).
.It Fl a Ar name
Attach the keyboard, specified by the keyboard device name, to the keyboard
multiplexer.
When using this option, the standard input of the
.Nm
process should be redirected from the keyboard multiplexer keyboard device
(if the keyboard multiplexer is not the active keyboard) or
.Pa /dev/console
(if the keyboard multiplexer is the active keyboard and
you are not working on the system console).
.It Fl b Xo
.Ar duration . Ns Ar pitch | Ar belltype
.Xc
Set the bell duration in milliseconds and pitch in hertz.
If a
.Ar belltype
argument is specified, it may be one of
.Cm normal
which sets sound parameters back to normal values,
.Cm off
which disables the bell entirely, or
.Cm visual
which sets the bell to visual mode, i.e., flashes the screen instead.
If
.Ar belltype
is preceded by the word
.Cm quiet. ,
the bell will not be rung when the ringing process is in the background vty.
The
.Cm visual
bell, when chosen, applies to all vtys; other bell types
can be set individually for each vty.
.It Fl r Xo
.Ar delay . Ns Ar repeat | Ar speed
.Xc
Set keyboard
.Ar delay
(250, 500, 750, 1000)
and
.Ar repeat
(34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 55, 59, 63, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, 110, 118, 126,
136, 152, 168, 184, 200, 220, 236, 252, 272, 304, 336, 368, 400, 440,
472, 504)
rates, or if a
.Ar speed
argument is specified, it may be one of
.Cm slow
(1000.504),
.Cm fast
(250.34)
or
.Cm normal
(500.126).
.It Fl l Ar keymap_file
Install keyboard map file from
.Ar keymap_file .
You may load the keyboard map file from a menu-driven command,
.Xr kbdmap 1 .
The format of keyboard map files is documented in the
.Xr kbdmap 5
manual page.
.It Fl d
Dump the current keyboard map onto stdout.
The output may be redirected to a file and can be loaded
back to the kernel later by the
.Fl l
option above.
.It Fl f Ar # Ar string
Set function key number
.Ar #
to send
.Ar string .
Refer to the man page for the keyboard driver
(e.g.\&
.Xr atkbd 4 )
for available function keys and their numbers.
.It Fl F
Set function keys back to the standard definitions.
.It Fl x
Use hexadecimal numbers in keyboard map dump.
.It Fl i
Print brief information about the keyboard.
.It Fl K
Disconnect the keyboard from the console.
You need to use the
.Fl k
option below to associate a keyboard with the console again.
.It Fl k Ar keyboard_device
Use the specified device as the console keyboard.
When using this option, the standard input of the
.Nm
process should be redirected from
.Pa /dev/console
if you are not working on the system console
(see the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section).
.It Fl L Ar keymap_file
Load keyboard map file from
.Ar keymap_file
and write the
.Ft "struct keymap"
compiled from it to stdout.
This option is primarily intended for programmers and is probably
of little use under normal circumstances.
.It Fl P Ar path
Search for the keymap file in
.Ar path .
The
.Fl P
option may be specified multiple times.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable
.Ev KEYMAP_PATH
can hold an alternative path to the keyboard map files.
.Sh KEYBOARD CONFIGURATION
.Ss Boot Time Configuration
You may set variables in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
or
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
in order to configure the keyboard at boot time.
The following is the list of relevant variables.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width foo_bar_var -compact
.It Ar keymap
Specifies a keyboard map file for the
.Fl l
option.
.It Ar keyrate
Sets the keyboard repeat rate for the
.Fl r
option.
.It Ar keychange
Lists function key strings for the
.Fl f
option.
.El
.Pp
See
.Xr rc.conf 5
for details.
.Ss Driver Configuration
The keyboard device driver may let you change default configuration
options, such as the default keyboard map, so that you do not need to set up
the options at boot time.
See keyboard driver manuals
(e.g.\&
.Xr atkbd 4 ,
.Xr ukbd 4 )
for details.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/foo_bar -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/*
keyboard map files for syscons
.It Pa /usr/share/vt/keymaps/*
keyboard map files for vt
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will load the keyboard map file
.Pa /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ru.koi8-r.kbd .
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -l /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ru.koi8-r.kbd
.Pp
So long as the keyboard map file resides in
.Pa /usr/share/syscons/keymaps
(if using
.Xr syscons 4 ) or
.Pa /usr/share/vt/keymaps
(if using
.Xr vt 4 ) ,
you may abbreviate the file name as
.Pa ru.koi8-r .
Since
.Xr vt 4
uses Unicode, the corresponding keyboard file names omit the encoding
and typically are just a country code, e.g.\&
.Pa ru .
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -l ru.koi8-r
.Pp
The following command will make the function key 10 emit "telnet myhost".
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -f 10 \&"telnet myhost\&"
.Pp
In order to get the visual effect for bell, but prevent the screen
from flashing if the bell is to ring in the background screen,
run the following command.
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -b quiet.visual
.Pp
To change the default console keyboard to another keyboard,
for example the first USB keyboard (see
.Xr ukbd 4 ) ,
use the following command.
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -k /dev/ukbd0 < /dev/console
.Pp
To switch back to the default keyboard, use this command.
.Pp
.Dl kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbd0
.Pp
To allow using both the second USB keyboard and the first AT keyboard
at the same time on console via the
.Xr kbdmux 4
driver, use the following sequence of commands.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kbdcontrol -K < /dev/console
kbdcontrol -a atkbd0 < /dev/kbdmux0
kbdcontrol -a ukbd1 < /dev/kbdmux0
kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbdmux0 < /dev/console
