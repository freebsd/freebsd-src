.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd configure and enable vnode disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vnconfig
.Op Fl cdeguv
.Op Fl s Ar option
.Op Fl r Ar option
.Ar special_file Ar regular_file
.Op Ar feature
.Nm vnconfig
.Fl a 
.Op Fl cdeguv
.Op Fl s Ar option
.Op Fl r Ar option
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures and enables vnode pseudo disk devices.
The first form of the command will associate the special file 
.Ar special_file
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
.Pp
Options indicate an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Read a command file and performs the
specified actions for each device/file pair.
.It Fl c
Configure the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar special_file
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
.It Fl d
Disable (if possible) the specified feature.
.It Fl e
Configure the device and enables any
.Ar feature
that was specified.
If no feature was specified,
.Fl e
is the same as
.Fl c .
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Use
.Ar config_file
as an alternate config file.
.It Fl g
Fiddle global options. 
.It Fl r Ar option
Reset
.Ar option .
.Ar Option
is one of labels, follow, debug, io, all, none.
.It Fl s Ar option
Set
.Ar option .
.It Fl u
Disable and ``unconfigure'' the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Pp
The
.Ar feature
argument specifies a feature that can be enabled via the
.Fl e
option:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv swap
Swapping is enabled on the special file.
See
.Xr swapon 2 .
.It Dv Pf mountro= Pa mount_point
The special file is mounted read-only on
.Ar mount_point .
See
.Xr mount 2 .
.It Dv Pf mountrw= Pa mount_point
The special file is mounted read-write on
.Ar mount_point .
See
.Xr mount 2 .
.It Dv Pf mount= Pa mount_point
Same as ``mountrw=''.
.El
.Pp
A configuration file contains one line per device/file pair in the form:
.Bd -literal
	special_file	regular_file	[ feature ]
.Ed
.Pp
where fields are seperated by white space.
The previously described action options serve to configure, enable,
disable or unconfigure all devices in the configuration file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/vntab -compact
.It Pa /etc/vntab
default configuration file for
.Fl a
option.
