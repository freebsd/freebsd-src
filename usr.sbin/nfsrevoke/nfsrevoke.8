.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsrevoke
.Nd revoke
.Tn NFS
V4 client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsrevoke
.Ar ClientId
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
This command is used by a system administrator to revoke a client's access
to the NFS Version 4 server. All Open/Lock state held by the client will
be released.
After revocation, the client will no longer be able to use state on the server
until it does a fresh SetClientID/SetClientIDConfirm operations sequence.
THIS SHOULD BE DONE AS A LAST RESORT ONLY, when clients are holding state
that must be released on the server.
.Pp
The
.Ar ClientId
argument is a hexadecimal string, which is the last field
of the
.Xr nfsdumpstate 8
command's
.Fl o
and
.Fl l
options output.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsv4 4 ,
.Xr nfsdumpstate 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was introduced as a part of the experimental nfs server subsystem.
