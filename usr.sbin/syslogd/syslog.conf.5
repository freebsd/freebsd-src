.Sh NAME
.Nm syslog.conf
.Nd
.Xr syslogd 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr syslogd 8
program.
It consists of
blocks of lines separated by
.Em program
specifications,
with each line containing two fields: the
.Em selector
field which specifies the types of messages and priorities to which the
line applies, and an
.Em action
field which specifies the action to be taken if a message
.Xr syslogd 8
receives matches the selection criteria.
The
.Em selector
field is separated from the
.Em action
field by one or more tab characters or spaces. 
.Pp
Note that if you use spaces as separators, your 
.Pa syslog.conf
might be incompatible with other Unices or Unix-like systems.
This functionality was added for the ease of configuration
(e.g. it is possible to cut-and-paste into 
.Pa syslog.conf
), 
and to avoid possible mistakes.
This change however preserves 
backwards compatibility with the old style of the
.Pa syslog.conf
(i.e. tab characters only).
.Pp
The
.Em Selectors
function
are encoded as a
.Em facility ,
a period
.Pq Dq \&. ,
an optional set of comparison flags
.Pq Bq <=> ,
and a
.Em level ,
with no intervening white-space.
Both the
.Em facility
and the
.Em level
are case insensitive.
.Pp
The
.Em facility
describes the part of the system generating the message, and is one of
the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail,
mark, news, ntp, syslog, user, uucp, security and local0 through local7.
These keywords (with the exception of mark) correspond to the
similar
.Dq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr openlog 3
and
.Xr syslog 3
library routines.
.Pp
The
.Em comparison flags
may be used to specify exactly what is logged.
The default set of comparison flags are
.Dq =>
(or, if you prefer,
.Do >=
.Dc ),
which means that messages from the specified
.Em facility
list of a priority
level equal or greater than
.Em level
will be logged.
.Pp
The
.Em level
describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from the
following ordered list (higher to lower): emerg, alert, crit, err,
warning, notice, info and debug.
These keywords correspond to the
similar
.Dq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr syslog 3
library routine.
.Pp
Each block of lines is separated from the previous block by a tag.
The tag
is a line beginning with
.Em #!prog
or
.Em !prog
(the former is for compatibility with the previous syslogd, if one is sharing
.Pa syslog.conf
files, for example)
and each block will be associated with calls to syslog from that specific
program.
A tag for ``foo'' will also match any message logged by the kernel
with the prefix ``foo: ''.
.Pp
See
.Xr syslog 3
for a further descriptions of both the
.Em facility
and
.Em level
keywords and their significance.
It's preferred that selections be made on
.Em facility
rather than
.Em program ,
since the latter can easily vary in a networked environment.
In some cases,
though, an appropriate
.Em facility
simply doesn't exist.
.Pp
If a received message matches the specified
.Em facility
and is of the specified
.Em level
.Em (or a higher level) ,
and the first word in the message after the date matches the
.Em program ,
the action specified in the
.Em action
field will be taken.
.Pp
Multiple
.Em selectors
may be specified for a single
.Em action
by separating them with semicolon
.Pq Dq \&;
characters.
It is important to note, however, that each
.Em selector
can modify the ones preceding it.
.Pp
Multiple
.Em facilities
may be specified for a single
.Em level
by separating them with comma
.Pq Dq \&,
characters.
.Pp
An asterisk
.Pq Dq *
can be used to specify all
.Em facilities
all
.Em levels
or all
.Em programs .
.Pp
The special
.Em facility
.Dq mark
receives a message at priority
.Dq info
every 20 minutes
(see
.Xr syslogd 8 ) .
This is not enabled by a
.Em facility
field containing an asterisk.
.Pp
The special
.Em level
.Dq none
disables a particular
.Em facility .
.Pp
The
.Em action
field of each line specifies the action to be taken when the
.Em selector
field selects a message.
There are five forms:
.Bl -bullet
.It
A pathname (beginning with a leading slash).
Selected messages are appended to the file.
.It
A hostname (preceded by an at
.Pq Dq @
sign).
Selected messages are forwarded to the
.Xr syslogd 8
program on the named host.
.It
A comma separated list of users.
Selected messages are written to those users
if they are logged in.
.It
An asterisk.
Selected messages are written to all logged-in users.
.It
A vertical bar
.Pq Dq \&| ,
followed by a command to pipe the selected
messages to.  The command is passed to a
.Pa /bin/sh
for evaluation, so usual shell metacharacters or input/output
redirection can occur.  (Note however that redirecting
.Xr stdio 3
buffered output from the invoked command can cause additional delays,
or even lost output data in case a logging subprocess exited with a
signal.)  The command itself runs with
.Em stdout
and
.Em stderr
redirected to
.Pa /dev/null .
Upon receipt of a
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Nm
will close the pipe to the process.  If the process didn't exit
voluntarily, it will be sent a
.Dv SIGTERM
signal after a grace period of up to 60 seconds.
.Pp
The command will only be started once data arrives that should be piped
to it.  If it exited later, it will be restarted as necessary.  So if it
is desired that the subprocess should get exactly one line of input only
(which can be very resource-consuming if there are a lot of messages
flowing quickly), this can be achieved by exiting after just one line of
input.  If necessary, a script wrapper can be written to this effect.
.Pp
Unless the command is a full pipeline, it's probably useful to
start the command with
.Em exec
so that the invoking shell process does not wait for the command to
complete.  Warning: the process is started under the UID invoking
.Xr syslogd 8 ,
normally the superuser.
.El
.Pp
Blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash
.Pq Dq #
character are ignored.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
A configuration file might appear as follows:
.Bd -literal
# Log all kernel messages, authentication messages of
# level notice or higher and anything of level err or
# higher to the console.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv.none	/dev/console

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none		/var/log/messages

# Log daemon messages at debug level only
daemon.=debug						/var/log/daemon.debug

# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*						/var/log/secure

# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*							/var/log/maillog

# Everybody gets emergency messages, plus log them on another
# machine.
*.emerg							*
*.emerg							@arpa.berkeley.edu

# Root and Eric get alert and higher messages.
*.alert							root,eric

# Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
# special file.
uucp,news.crit						/var/log/spoolerr

# Pipe all authentication messages to a filter.
auth.*					|exec /usr/local/sbin/authfilter

# Save ftpd transactions along with mail and news
!ftpd
*.*							/var/log/spoolerr

# Log all security messages to a separate file.
security.*						/var/log/security

.Sh BUGS
The effects of multiple
.Em selectors
are sometimes not intuitive.
For example
.Dq mail.crit,*.err
will select
.Dq mail
facility messages at the level of
.Dq err
or higher, not at the level of
.Dq crit
or higher.
.Pp
In networked environments, note that not all operating systems
implement the same set of facilities.  The facilities
authpriv, cron, ftp, and ntp that are known to this implementation
might be absent on the target system.  Even worse, DEC UNIX uses
facility number 10 (which is authpriv in this implementation) to
log events for their AdvFS file system.
