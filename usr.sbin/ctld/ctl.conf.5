.Sh NAME
.Nm ctl.conf
.Nd CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file is used by the
.Xr ctld 8
daemon.
Lines starting with
.Ql #
are interpreted as comments.
The general syntax of the
.Nm
file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pidfile <path>

auth-group <name> {
	chap <user> <secret>
	...
}

portal-group <name> {
	listen <address>
	listen-iser <address>
	discovery-auth-group <name>
	...
}

target <name> {
	auth-group <name>
	portal-group <name>
	lun <number> {
		path <path>
	}
	...
}
.Ed
.Ss global level
The following statements are available at the global level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Opens an auth-group section, defining an authentication group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic debug Aq Ar level
Specifies debug level.
The default is 0.
.It Ic maxproc Aq Ar number
Specifies limit for concurrently running child processes handling
incoming connections.
The default is 30.
Setting it to 0 disables the limit.
.It Ic pidfile Aq Ar path
Specifies path to pidfile.
The default is
.Pa /var/run/ctld.pid .
.It Ic portal-group Aq Ar name
Opens a portal-group section, defining a portal group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic target Aq Ar name
Opens a target configuration section.
.It Ic timeout Aq Ar seconds
Specifies timeout for login session, after which the connection
will be forcibly terminated.
The default is 60.
Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.
.El
.Ss auth-group level
The following statements are available at the auth-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-type Ao Ar type Ac
Specifies authentication type.
Type can be either "none", "deny", "chap", or "chap-mutual".
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given auth-group.
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any auth-group, configuration may contain either chap,
or chap-mutual entries; it is an error to mix them.
.It Ic initiator-name Ao Ar initiator-name Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator name.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
Otherwise, only initiators with names matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ao Ar address Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator portal - IPv4 or IPv6 address.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
Otherwise, only initiators with addresses matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
.El
.Ss portal-group level
The following statements are available at the portal-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic discovery-auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to the portal group,
to be used for target discovery.
By default, portal groups that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as "chap" or "initiator-name", are assigned
predefined auth-group "default", which denies discovery.
Another predefined auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used
to permit discovery without authentication.
.It Ic listen Aq Ar address
Specifies IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections.
.It Ic listen-iser Aq Ar address
Specifies IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections
using iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) protocol.
.El
.Ss target level:
The following statements are available at the target level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic alias Aq Ar text
Assigns human-readable description to the target.
There is no default.
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to the target.
By default, targets that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as "chap" or "initiator-name", are assigned
predefined auth-group "default", which denies all access.
Another predefined auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used to permit access
without authentication.
.It Ic auth-type Ao Ar type Ac
Specifies authentication type.
Type can be either "none", "deny", "chap", or "chap-mutual".
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given target.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, or chap,
or chap-mutual clauses; it is a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, chap, or
chap-mutual clauses; it is a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic initiator-name Ao Ar initiator-name Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator name.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
Otherwise, only initiators with names matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ao Ar address Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator portal - IPv4 or IPv6 address.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
Otherwise, only initiators with addresses matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic portal-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined portal group to the target.
Default portal group is "default", which makes the target available
on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.It Ic lun Aq Ar number
Opens a lun configuration section, defining LUN exported by a target.
.El
.Ss lun level
The following statements are available at the lun level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic backend Ao Ar block | Ar ramdisk Ac
Specifies the CTL backend to use for a given LUN.
Valid choices are
.Dq block
and
.Dq ramdisk ;
block is used for LUNs backed
by files or disk device nodes; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
testing.
The default backend is block.
.It Ic blocksize Aq Ar size
Specifies blocksize visible to the initiator.
The default blocksize is 512.
.It Ic device-id Aq Ar string
Specifies SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.
.It Ic option Ao Ar name Ac Aq Ar value
Specifies CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.
.It Ic path Aq Ar path
Specifies path to file or device node used to back the LUN.
.It Ic serial Aq Ar string
Specifies SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.
.It Ic size Aq Ar size
Specifies LUN size, in bytes.
.El
