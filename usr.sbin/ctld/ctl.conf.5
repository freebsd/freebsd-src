.Sh NAME
.Nm ctl.conf
.Nd CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file is used by the
.Xr ctld 8
daemon.
Lines starting with
.Ql #
are interpreted as comments.
The general syntax of the
.Nm
file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.No pidfile Ar path

.No auth-group Ar name No {
.Dl chap Ar user Ar secret
.Dl ...
}

.No portal-group Ar name No {
.Dl listen Ar address
.Dl listen-iser Ar address
.Dl discovery-auth-group Ar name
.Dl ...
}

.No target Ar name {
.Dl auth-group Ar name
.Dl portal-group Ar name
.Dl lun Ar number No {
.Dl 	path Ar path
.Dl }
.Dl ...
}
.Ed
.Ss Global Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-group Ar name
Create an
.Sy auth-group
configuration context,
defining a new auth-group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic debug Ar level
The debug verbosity level.
The default is 0.
.It Ic maxproc Ar number
The limit for concurrently running child processes handling
incoming connections.
The default is 30.
A setting of 0 disables the limit.
.It Ic pidfile Ar path
The path to the pidfile.
The default is
.Pa /var/run/ctld.pid .
.It Ic portal-group Ar name
Create a
.Sy portal-group
configuration context,
defining a new portal-group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic target Ar name
Create a
.Sy target
configuration context, which can contain one or more
.Sy lun
contexts.
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
The timeout for login sessions, after which the connection
will be forcibly terminated.
The default is 60.
A setting of 0 disables the timeout.
.El
.Ss auth-group Context
.Bl -tag -width indent

.It Ic auth-type Ar type
Sets the authentication type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar deny ,
.Qq Ar chap ,
or
.Qq Ar chap-mutual .
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given
.Sy auth-group .
.It Ic chap Ar user Ar secret
A set of CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any
.Sy auth-group ,
the configuration may only contain either
.Sy chap
or
.Sy chap-mutual
entries; it is an error to mix them.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ar user Ar secret Ar mutualuser Ar mutualsecret
A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any
.Sy auth-group ,
the configuration may only contain either
.Sy chap
or
.Sy chap-mutual
entries; it is an error to mix them.
.It Ic initiator-name Ar initiator-name
An iSCSI initiator name.
Only initiators with a name matching one of the defined
names will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ar address Ns Op / Ns Ar prefixlen
An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.
Only initiators with an address matching one of the defined
addresses will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
.El
.Ss portal-group Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic discovery-auth-group Ar name
Assign a previously defined authentication group to the portal group,
to be used for target discovery.
By default, portal groups that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as
.Sy chap
or
.Sy initiator-name ,
are assigned
predefined
.Sy auth-group
.Qq Ar default ,
which denies discovery.
Another predefined
.Sy auth-group ,
.Qq Ar no-authentication ,
may be used
to permit discovery without authentication.
.It Ic listen Ar address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections.
.It Ic listen-iser Ar address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections
using iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) protocol.
.El
.Ss target Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic alias Ar text
Assign a human-readable description to the target.
There is no default.
.It Ic auth-group Ar name
Assign a previously defined authentication group to the target.
By default, targets that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as
.Sy chap
or
.Sy initiator-name ,
are assigned
predefined
.Sy auth-group
.Qq Ar default ,
which denies all access.
Another predefined
.Sy auth-group ,
.Qq Ar no-authentication ,
may be used to permit access
without authentication.
Note that targets must only use one of
.Sy auth-group , chap , No or Sy chap-mutual ;
it is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.
.It Ic auth-type Ar type
Sets the authentication type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar deny ,
.Qq Ar chap ,
or
.Qq Ar chap-mutual .
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given
.Sy target .
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic chap Ar user Ar secret
A set of CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must only use one of
.Sy auth-group , chap , No or Sy chap-mutual ;
it is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ar user Ar secret Ar mutualuser Ar mutualsecret
A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must only use one of
.Sy auth-group , chap , No or Sy chap-mutual ;
it is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.
.It Ic initiator-name Ar initiator-name
An iSCSI initiator name.
Only initiators with a name matching one of the defined
names will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ar address Ns Op / Ns Ar prefixlen
An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.
Only initiators with an address matching one of the defined
addresses will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic portal-group Ar name
Assign a previously defined portal group to the target.
The default portal group is
.Qq Ar default ,
which makes the target available
on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.It Ic lun Ar number
Create a
.Sy lun
configuration context, defining a LUN exported by the parent target.
.El
.Ss lun Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic backend Ar block No | Ar ramdisk
The CTL backend to use for a given LUN.
Valid choices are
.Qq Ar block
and
.Qq Ar ramdisk ;
block is used for LUNs backed
by files or disk device nodes; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
testing.
The default backend is block.
.It Ic blocksize Ar size
The blocksize visible to the initiator.
The default blocksize is 512.
.It Ic device-id Ar string
The SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.
.It Ic option Ar name Ar value
The CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.
All CTL-specific options are documented in the
.Sx OPTIONS
section of
.Xr ctladm 8 .
.It Ic path Ar path
The path to the file or device node used to back the LUN.
.It Ic serial Ar string
The SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.
.It Ic size Ar size
The LUN size, in bytes.
.El
