.El
.Ss auth-group Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-type Ar type
Sets the authentication type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar deny ,
.Qq Ar chap ,
or
.Qq Ar chap-mutual .
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given
.Sy auth-group .
.It Ic chap Ar user Ar secret
A set of CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any
.Sy auth-group ,
the configuration may only contain either
.Sy chap
or
.Sy chap-mutual
entries; it is an error to mix them.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ar user Ar secret Ar mutualuser Ar mutualsecret
A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any
.Sy auth-group ,
the configuration may only contain either
.Sy chap
or
.Sy chap-mutual
entries; it is an error to mix them.
.It Ic initiator-name Ar initiator-name
An iSCSI initiator name.
Only initiators with a name matching one of the defined
names will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ar address Ns Op / Ns Ar prefixlen
An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.
Only initiators with an address matching one of the defined
addresses will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
.El
.Ss portal-group Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic discovery-auth-group Ar name
Assign a previously defined authentication group to the portal group,
to be used for target discovery.
By default, portal groups are assigned predefined
.Sy auth-group
.Qq Ar default ,
which denies discovery.
Another predefined
.Sy auth-group ,
.Qq Ar no-authentication ,
may be used
to permit discovery without authentication.
.It Ic discovery-filter Ar filter
Determines which targets are returned during discovery.
Filter can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar portal ,
.Qq Ar portal-name ,
or
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth .
When set to
.Qq Ar none ,
discovery will return all targets assigned to that portal group.
When set to
.Qq Ar portal ,
discovery will not return targets that cannot be accessed by the
initiator because of their
.Sy initiator-portal .
When set to
.Qq Ar portal-name ,
the check will include both
.Sy initiator-portal
and
.Sy initiator-name .
When set to
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth ,
the check will include
.Sy initiator-portal ,
.Sy initiator-name ,
and authentication credentials.
The target is returned if it does not require CHAP authentication,
or if the CHAP user and secret used during discovery match those
used by the target.
Note that when using
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth ,
targets that require CHAP authentication will only be returned if
.Sy discovery-auth-group
requires CHAP.
The default is
.Qq Ar none .
.It Ic listen Ar address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections.
.\".It Ic listen-iser Ar address
.\"An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections
.\"using iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) protocol.
.It Ic offload Ar driver
Define iSCSI hardware offload driver to use for this
.Sy portal-group .
The default is
.Qq Ar none .
.It Ic option Ar name Ar value
The CTL-specific port options passed to the kernel.
.It Ic redirect Ar address
IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.
When configured, all initiators attempting to connect to portal
belonging to this
.Sy portal-group
will get redirected using "Target moved temporarily" login response.
Redirection happens before authentication and any
.Sy initiator-name
or
.Sy initiator-portal
checks are skipped.
.It Ic tag Ar value
Unique 16-bit tag value of this
.Sy portal-group .
If not specified, the value is generated automatically.
.It Ic foreign
Specifies that this
.Sy portal-group
is listened by some other host.
This host will announce it on discovery stage, but won't listen.
.It Ic dscp Ar value
The DiffServ Codepoint used for sending data. The DSCP can be
set to numeric, or hexadecimal values directly, as well as the
well-defined
.Qq Ar CSx
and
.Qq Ar AFxx
codepoints.
.It Ic pcp Ar value
The 802.1Q Priority CodePoint used for sending packets.
The PCP can be set to a value in the range between
.Qq Ar 0
to
.Qq Ar 7 .
When omitted, the default for the outgoing interface is used.
.El
.Ss target Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic alias Ar text
Assign a human-readable description to the target.
There is no default.
.It Ic auth-group Ar name
Assign a previously defined authentication group to the target.
By default, targets that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as
.Sy chap
or
.Sy initiator-name ,
are assigned
predefined
.Sy auth-group
.Qq Ar default ,
which denies all access.
Another predefined
.Sy auth-group ,
.Qq Ar no-authentication ,
may be used to permit access
without authentication.
Note that this clause can be overridden using the second argument
to a
.Sy portal-group
clause.
.It Ic auth-type Ar type
Sets the authentication type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar deny ,
.Qq Ar chap ,
or
.Qq Ar chap-mutual .
In most cases it is not necessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given
.Sy target .
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic chap Ar user Ar secret
A set of CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must only use one of
.Sy auth-group , chap , No or Sy chap-mutual ;
it is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ar user Ar secret Ar mutualuser Ar mutualsecret
A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must only use one of
.Sy auth-group , chap , No or Sy chap-mutual ;
it is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.
.It Ic initiator-name Ar initiator-name
An iSCSI initiator name.
Only initiators with a name matching one of the defined
names will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ar address Ns Op / Ns Ar prefixlen
An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.
Only initiators with an address matching one of the defined
addresses will be allowed to connect.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
This clause is mutually exclusive with
.Sy auth-group ;
one cannot use
both in a single target.
.Pp
The
.Sy auth-type ,
.Sy chap ,
.Sy chap-mutual ,
.Sy initiator-name ,
and
.Sy initiator-portal
clauses in the target context provide an alternative to assigning an
.Sy auth-group
defined separately, useful in the common case of authentication settings
specific to a single target.
.It Ic portal-group Ar name Op Ar ag-name
Assign a previously defined portal group to the target.
The default portal group is
.Qq Ar default ,
which makes the target available
on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Optional second argument specifies
.Sy auth-group
for connections to this specific portal group.
If second argument is not specified, target
.Sy auth-group
is used.
.It Ic port Ar name
.It Ic port Ar name/pp
.It Ic port Ar name/pp/vp
Assign specified CTL port (such as "isp0" or "isp2/1") to the target.
This is used to export the target through a specific physical - eg Fibre
Channel - port, in addition to portal-groups configured for the target.
Use
.Cm "ctladm portlist"
command to retrieve the list of available ports.
On startup
.Xr ctld 8
configures LUN mapping and enables all assigned ports.
Each port can be assigned to only one target.
.It Ic redirect Ar address
IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.
When configured, all initiators attempting to connect to this target
will get redirected using "Target moved temporarily" login response.
Redirection happens after successful authentication.
.It Ic lun Ar number Ar name
Export previously defined
.Sy lun
by the parent target.
.It Ic lun Ar number
Create a
.Sy lun
configuration context, defining a LUN exported by the parent target.
.Pp
This is an alternative to defining the LUN separately, useful in the common
case of a LUN being exported by a single target.
.El
.Ss lun Context
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic backend Ar block No | Ar ramdisk
The CTL backend to use for a given LUN.
Valid choices are
.Qq Ar block
and
.Qq Ar ramdisk ;
block is used for LUNs backed
by files or disk device nodes; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
testing.
The default backend is block.
.It Ic blocksize Ar size
The blocksize visible to the initiator.
The default blocksize is 512 for disks, and 2048 for CD/DVDs.
.It Ic ctl-lun Ar lun_id
Global numeric identifier to use for a given LUN inside CTL.
By default CTL allocates those IDs dynamically, but explicit specification
may be needed for consistency in HA configurations.
.It Ic device-id Ar string
The SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.
.It Ic device-type Ar type
Specify the SCSI device type to use when creating the LUN.
Currently CTL supports Direct Access (type 0), Processor (type 3)
and CD/DVD (type 5) LUNs.
.It Ic option Ar name Ar value
The CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.
All CTL-specific options are documented in the
.Sx OPTIONS
section of
.Xr ctladm 8 .
.It Ic path Ar path
The path to the file, device node, or
.Xr zfs 8
volume used to back the LUN.
For optimal performance, create the volume with the
.Qq Ar volmode=dev
property set.
.It Ic serial Ar string
The SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.
.It Ic size Ar size
The LUN size, in bytes or by number with a suffix of
.Sy K , M , G , T
(for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes).
When the configuration is in UCL format, use the suffix format
.Sy kKmMgG Ns | Ns Sy bB ,
(i.e., 4GB, 4gb, and 4Gb are all equivalent).
