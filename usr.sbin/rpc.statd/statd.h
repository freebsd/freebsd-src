  Data structures for recording monitored hosts

  The information held by the status monitor comprises a list of hosts
  that we have been asked to monitor, and, associated with each monitored
  host, one or more clients to be called back if the monitored host crashes.

  The list of monitored hosts must be retained over a crash, so that upon
  re-boot we can call the SM_NOTIFY procedure in all those hosts so as to
  cause them to start recovery processing.  On the other hand, the client
  call-backs are not required to be preserved: they are assumed (in the
  protocol design) to be local processes which will have crashed when
  we did, and so are discarded on restart.

  We handle this by keeping the list of monitored hosts in a file
  (/var/statd.state) which is mmap()ed and whose format is described
  by the typedef FileLayout.  The lists of client callbacks are chained
  off this structure, but are held in normal memory and so will be
  lost after a re-boot.  Hence the actual values of MonList * pointers
  in the copy on disc have no significance, but their NULL/non-NULL
  status indicates whether this host is actually being monitored or if it
  is an empty slot in the file.
