.Dt FDCONTROL 8
.Sh NAME
.Nm fdcontrol
.Nd modify floppy disk parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar 0|1
.Ar device
.Nm
.Op Fl s
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Fdcontrol
allows the modification of the run-time behavior of the floppy
disk device specified by
.Ar device .
.Ar Device
should be a character device.
.Pp
.Nm Fdcontrol
currently supports the specification of device parameters for the
floppy disk drive
.Po
.Fl s ,
also default mode
.Pc ,
or it allows the modification of the driver debug level, in case the
floppy driver has been compiled into the kernel with the
.Em DEBUG
option set
.Pq Fl d .
.Pp
Since the implications of such actions are considered harmful, the
underlying
.Xr ioctl 2
command is restricted to the super-user.
.Pp
When requesting a new parameter specification, the command asks the
user for each individual tunable parameter, defaulting to the
currently used value.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error codes for the underlying
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are printed by the
.Xr warn 3
facility.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command is currently under development.
It's user interface is rather
silly and likely to change in future, options should be provided to
allow anything being modified from the command line.
.Pp
The driver does actually support only two debug levels
.Pq 0 and 1 ,
where debug level 1 will generate huge amounts of output.
It is likely
to overflow the syslog if not used with extreme care.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr warn 3 ,
.Xr fdc 4
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Fdcontrol
is currently under development.
It's user interface and overall
functionality are subjects to future improvements and changes.
