.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
.B
pkg_delete
does pretty much what it says.  It looks for a package in /var/db/pkg
and sets about deleting the files that make up the package and, finally,
the record of the package itself.
.PP
If the package contains a
.B require
file (see 
.B pkg_create
), then this is executed first with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name DEINSTALL
.PP
to see whether or not de-installation should continue (a non-zero exit
status means no).
.PP
If a
.B de-install
script exists for the package, it is executed before any files are removed.
It is this script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details
around the package's installation, since all
.B pkg_delete
knows how to do is delete the files created in the original distribution.
The
.B de-install
script is called with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name DEINSTALL
.PP
Where
.I pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.I DEINSTALL
is a keyword denoting that this is a deinstallation.  Passing the keyword
lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
aspects of installation and deletion.
.PP
.SH BUGS
Sure to be some.
