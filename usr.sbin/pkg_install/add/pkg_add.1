.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_add
.Nd a utility for installing software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl vInfrRMS
.Op Fl t Ar template
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Op Fl C Ar chrootdir
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to extract packages that have been previously created
with the
.Xr pkg_create 1
command.
.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs contained within a package file,
your system may be susceptible to
.Dq Em trojan horses
or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, use the
.Fl M
flag to extract the package file, and inspect its contents and scripts to
ensure it poses no danger to your system's integrity.
Pay particular
attention to any +INSTALL, +POST-INSTALL, +DEINSTALL, +POST-DEINSTALL,
+REQUIRE or +MTREE_DIRS files, and inspect the +CONTENTS file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the package file.
.Ef
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar pkg-name Op Ar pkg-name ...
The named packages are installed.
A package name of
.Fl
will cause
.Nm
to read from stdin.
If the packages are not found in the current
working directory,
.Nm
will search them in each directory named by
.Ev PKG_PATH .
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl I
If any installation scripts (pre-install or post-install) exist for a given
package, do not execute them.
.It Fl n
Don't actually install a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it was.
.It Fl R
Do not record the installation of a package.
This means
that you cannot deinstall it later, so only use this option if
you know what you are doing!
.It Fl r
Use the remote fetching feature.
This will determine the appropriate
objformat and release and then fetch and install the package.
.It Fl f
Force installation to proceed even if prerequisite packages are not
installed or the requirements script fails.
Although
.Nm
will still try to find and auto-install missing prerequisite packages,
a failure to find one will not be fatal.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the directory in which to extract files from a package.
If a package has set its default directory, it will be overridden
by this flag.
Note that only the first
.Cm @cwd
directive will be replaced, since
.Nm
has no way of knowing which directory settings are relative and
which are absolute.
It is rare in any case to see more than one
directory transition made, but when such does happen and you wish
to have control over *all* directory transitions, then you
may then wish to look into the use of
.Cm MASTER
and
.Cm SLAVE
modes (see the
.Fl M
and
.Fl S
options).
.It Fl t Ar template
Use
.Ar template
as the input to
.Xr mktemp 3
when creating a
.Dq staging area .
By default, this is the string
.Pa /var/tmp/instmp.XXXXXX ,
but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
space in your
.Pa /var/tmp
directory is limited.
Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters
for
.Xr mktemp 3
to fill in with a unique ID.
.Pp
You can get a performance boost by setting the staging area
.Ar template
to reside on the same disk partition as target directories for package
file installation; often this is
.Pa /usr .
.It Fl M
Run in
.Cm MASTER
mode.
This is a very specialized mode for running
.Nm
and is meant to be run in conjunction with
.Cm SLAVE
mode.
When run in this mode,
.Nm
does no work beyond extracting the package into a temporary staging
area (see the
.Fl t
option), reading in the packing list, and then dumping it (prefaced by
the current staging area) to stdout where it may be filtered by a
program such as
.Xr sed 1 .
When used in conjunction with
.Cm SLAVE
mode, it allows you to make radical changes to the package structure
before acting on its contents.
.It Fl S
Run in
.Cm SLAVE
mode.
This is a very specialized mode for running
.Nm
and is meant to be run in conjunction with
.Cm MASTER
mode.
When run in this mode,
.Nm
expects the release contents to be already extracted and waiting
in the staging area, the location of which is read as a string
from stdin.
The complete packing list is also read from stdin,
and the contents then acted on as normal.
.It Fl C Ar chrootdir
Before doing any operations,
.Xr chroot 2
to the
.Ar chrootdir
directory so that all package files, and the package database, are
installed to
.Ar chrootdir .
Note that
.Ar chrootdir
needs to be a fairly complete file system, including everything normally
needed by
.Nm
to run.
This flag was added to help support operations done by
.Xr sysinstall 8
and is not expected to be useful for much else.
Be careful that
.Ar chrootdir
is properly configured and cannot be modified by normal users,
versions of commands like
.Xr fetch 1
may be run inside
.Ar chrootdir
as a side effect.
.El
.Pp
One or more
.Ar pkg-name
arguments may be specified, each being either a file containing the
package (these usually end with a
.Dq .tbz
suffix) or a
URL pointing at a file available on an ftp site.
Thus you may
extract files directly from their anonymous ftp locations (e.g.\&
.Nm
.Li ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/packages/shells/bash-1.14.7.tbz ) .
Note: If you wish to use
.Bf -emphasis
passive mode
.Ef
ftp in such transfers, set
the variable
.Bf -emphasis
FTP_PASSIVE_MODE
.Ef
to some value in your environment.
Otherwise, the more standard
ACTIVE mode may be used.
If
.Nm
consistently fails to fetch a package from a site known to work,
it may be because you have a firewall that demands the usage of
.Bf -emphasis
passive mode
.Ef
ftp.
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
The
.Nm
utility extracts each package's "packing list" into a special staging
directory in /tmp (or $PKG_TMPDIR if set), parses it, and then runs
through the following sequence to fully extract the contents of the package:
.Bl -enum
.It
A check is made to determine if the package is already recorded as installed.
If it is, installation is terminated.
.It
A check is made to determine if the package conflicts (from
.Cm @conflicts
directives, see
.Xr pkg_create 1 )
with an already-installed package.
If it is, installation is terminated.
.It
Scan all the package dependencies (from
.Cm @pkgdep
directives, see
.Xr pkg_create 1 )
are read from the packing list.
If any of these required packages is not currently installed,
an attempt is made to find and install it;
if the missing package cannot be found or installed,
the installation is terminated.
.It
Search for any
.Cm @option
directives which control how the package is added to the system.
At the time of this writing, the only currently implemented option is
.Cm @option extract-in-place
which will cause the package to be extracted directly into its
prefix directory without moving through a staging area in
.Pa /tmp .
.It
If
.Cm @option extract-in-place
is enabled, the package is now extracted directly into its
final location, otherwise it is extracted into the staging area.
.It
If the package contains a
.Ar require
file (see
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) ,
then execute it with the following arguments:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ar pkg-name
.Ar INSTALL
.Ed
where
.Ar pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and the
.Ar INSTALL
keyword denotes this as an installation requirements check (useful if
you want to have one script serving multiple functions).
.It
If a
.Ar pre-install
script exists for the package, it is then executed with the following
arguments:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Cm script
.Ar pkg-name
.Ar PRE-INSTALL
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.Ar PRE-INSTALL
is a keyword denoting this as the preinstallation phase.
.Pp
.Sy Note :
The
.Ar PRE-INSTALL
keyword will not appear if separate scripts for pre-install and post-install
are given during package creation time (using the
.Fl i
and
.Fl I
flags to
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) .
.It
If
.Cm @option extract-in-place
is not used, then the packing list (this is the
.Pa +CONTENTS
file) is now used as a guide for moving (or copying, as necessary) files from
the staging area into their final locations.
.It
If the package contains an
.Ar mtreefile
file (see
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) ,
then mtree is invoked as:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Cm mtree
.Fl u
.Fl f
.Ar mtreefile
.Fl d
.Fl e
.Fl p
.Pa prefix
.Ed
where
.Pa prefix
is either the prefix specified with the
.Fl p
flag or, if no
.Fl p
flag was specified, the name of the first directory named by a
.Cm @cwd
directive within this package.
.It
If a
.Ar post-install
script exists for the package, it is then executed as
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Cm script
.Ar pkg-name
.Ar POST-INSTALL
.Ed
where
.Ar pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.Ar POST-INSTALL
is a keyword denoting this as the post-installation phase.
.Pp
.Sy Note :
The
.Ar POST-INSTALL
keyword will not appear if separate scripts for pre-install and post-install
are given during package creation time (using the
.Fl i
and
.Fl I
flags to
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) .
.Pp
Reasoning behind passing keywords such as
.Ar POST-INSTALL
and
.Ar PRE-INSTALL
is that this allows you to write a single
.Ar install
script that does both
.Dq before and after
actions.
But, separating the
functionality is more advantageous and easier from a maintenance viewpoint.
.It
After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list,
.Ar deinstall
script, description, and display files are copied into
.Pa /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name>
for subsequent possible use by
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Any package dependencies are recorded in the other packages'
.Pa /var/db/pkg/<other-pkg>/+REQUIRED_BY
file
(if the environment variable PKG_DBDIR is set, this overrides the
.Pa /var/db/pkg/
path shown above).
.It
Finally, the staging area is deleted and the program terminates.
.El
.Pp
All the scripts are called with the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PREFIX
set to the installation prefix (see the
.Fl p
option above).
This allows a package author to write a script
that reliably performs some action on the directory where the package
is installed, even if the user might change it with the
.Fl p
flag to
.Cm pkg_add .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The value of the
.Ev PKG_PATH
is used if a given package can't be found.
The environment variable
should be a series of entries separated by colons.
Each entry
consists of a directory name.
The current directory may be indicated
implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single
period.
.Pp
The environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
specifies an alternative location for the installed package database,
default location is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.Pp
The environment variables
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
and
.Ev TMPDIR ,
in that order, are taken to name temporary directories where
.Nm
will attempt to create its staging area in.
If these variables are not present or if the directories named lack
sufficient space, then
.Nm
will use the first of
.Pa /var/tmp ,
.Pa /tmp
or
.Pa /usr/tmp
with sufficient space.
.Pp
The environment variable
.Ev PACKAGEROOT
specifies an alternate location for
.Nm
to fetch from.
The fetch URL is built using this environment variable and the automatic
directory logic that
.Nm
uses when the
.Fl r
option is invoked.
An example setting would be
.Qq Li ftp://ftp3.FreeBSD.org .
.Pp
The environment variable
.Ev PACKAGESITE
specifies an alternate location for
.Nm
to fetch from.
This variable subverts the automatic directory logic
that
.Nm
uses when the
.Fl r
option is invoked.
Thus it should be a complete URL to the remote package file(s).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/pkg -compact
.It Pa /var/tmp
Temporary directory for creating the staging area, if environmental variables
.Ev PKG_TMPDIR
or
.Ev TMPDIR
do not point to a suitable directory.
.It Pa /tmp
Next choice if
.Pa /var/tmp
does not exist or has insufficient space.
.It Pa /usr/tmp
Last choice if
.Pa /var/tmp
and
.Pa /tmp
are not suitable for creating the staging area.
.It Pa /var/db/pkg
Default location of the installed package database.

.Sh BUGS
Hard links between files in a distribution are only preserved if either
(1) the staging area is on the same file system as the target directory of
all the links to the file, or (2) all the links to the file are bracketed by
.Cm @cwd
directives in the contents file,
.Em and
the link names are extracted with a single
.Cm tar
command (not split between
invocations due to exec argument-space limitations--this depends on the
value returned by
.Fn sysconf _SC_ARG_MAX ) .
.Pp
