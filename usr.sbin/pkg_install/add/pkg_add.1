.SH NAME
pkg_add - a utility for installing software package distributions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B pkg_add
.RB [options]
.RB "pkg-name\ [.. pkg-name]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pkg_add
command is used to extract packages that have been previously created
with the
.B pkg_create
command.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
The following command line options are supported.
.TP
.B \-v
Turns on verbose output.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.B \-I
If an installation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.B \-n
Don't actually install a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it was.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.B \-R
Do not record the installation of a package.  This means
that you cannot deinstall it later, so only use this option if
you know what you are doing!
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-p\ " prefix
Sets
.I prefix
as the directory in which to extract files from a package.
If a package has set its default directory, it will be overridden
by this flag.  Note that only the first directory default will
be replaced, since
.B pkg_add
has no way of knowing which directory settings are relative and
which are absolute.  It is rare, in any case, that more than one
directory transition is made, but when such is the case then you
may wish to look into the use of
.B MASTER
and
.B SLAVE
mode (see
.B \-M
and
.B \-S
options).
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-t\ " template
Use
.I template
as the input to mktemp(3).  By default, this is the string
.B /tmp/instmp.XXXXXX
, but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
space in your
.B /tmp
directory is limited.  Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters
for mktemp(3) to fill in with a unique ID.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.B \-M
Run in
.B MASTER
mode.  This is a very specialized mode for running
.B pkg_add
and is meant to be run in conjunction with
.B SLAVE
mode.  When run in this mode,
.B pkg_add
does no work beyond extracting the package into a temporary staging
area (see
.B \-t
option), reading in the packing list, and then dumping it (prefaced by
the current staging area) to stdout where it may be filtered by a
program such as
.B sed(1).
When used in conjunction with
.B SLAVE
mode, it allows you to make radical changes to the package structure
before acting on its contents.
.TP
.B \-S
Run in
.B SLAVE
mode.  This is a very specialized mode for running
.B pkg_add
and is meant to be run in conjunction with
.B MASTER
mode.  When run in this mode,
.B pkg_add
expects the release contents to be already extracted and waiting
in the staging area, the location of which is read as a string
from stdin.  The complete packing list is also read from stdin,
and the contents then acted on as normal.
.PP
.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
.B
pkg_add
is fairly simple.  It simply extracts the requested packages into
a "staging area" directory and then performs the following steps:
.PP
If the package contains a
.B require
file (see 
.B pkg_create
), then this is executed first with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name INSTALL
.PP
to see whether or not installation should
continue (a non-zero exit status means no).  
.PP
If an
.B install
script exists for the package, it is then executed as follows:
.PP
First, before installing files in the data set, the
.B install
script is called with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name PRE-INSTALL
.PP
Where
.I pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.I PRE-INSTALL
is a keyword denoting that this is the "pre installation" pass.
Using the packing list as a guide, files are then moved (or copied,
as necessary) from the staging area into their new homes and the
.B install
script is then executed a second time with the flags
.PP
.B <script>
.I pkg-name POST-INSTALL
.PP
This all allows you to write an
.B install
script that does "before and after" actions.
.PP
After installation is complete, a copy of the packing list, in addition
to any
.B deinstall
script the package might have, is copied into /var/pkg/<pkg-name>
for subsequent possible use by
.B pkg-delete.
Finally, the staging area is deleted and the program terminates.
.PP
