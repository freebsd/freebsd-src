.SH NAME
pkg_create - a utility for creating software package distributions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B pkg_create
.RB [options]
.RB pkg-name

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pkg_create
command is used to create packages that will subsequently be fed to
one of the package extraction/info utilities.  The input description
and command line arguments for the creation of a package are not
really meant to be human-generated, though it is easy enough to
do so.  It is more expected that you will use a front-end tool for
the job rather than muddling through it yourself. Nonetheless, a short
description of the input syntax is included in this document.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
The following command line options are supported.
.TP
.B \-v
Turns on verbose output.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-c\ " [-]desc
Fetch package "one line description" from file
.I desc
or, if preceeded by
.B -
, the argument itself.  This string should also
give some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
represents.
.B "Mandatory."
.TP
.BI "\-d\ " [-]desc
Fetch long description for package from file
.I desc
or, if preceeded by
.B -
, the argument itself.
.B "Mandatory."
.TP
.BI "\-f\ " file
Fetch "packing list" for package from
.I file
or
.B stdin
if
.I file
is a
.B -
(dash).
.B "Mandatory."
.TP
.BI "\-i\ " script
Sets
.I script
to be the install procedure for the package.  This can be any
executable program (or shell script).  It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later installed.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-p\ " prefix
Sets
.I prefix
As the initial directory "base" to start from in selecting files for
the package.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-k\ " script
Sets
.I script
to be the de-install procedure for the package.  This can be any
executable program (or shell script).  It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later (if ever) de-installed.
.B "Optional."
.TP
.BI "\-r\ " script
Sets
.I script
to be the "requirements" procedure for the package.  This can be any
executable program (or shell script).  It will be invoked automatically
at installation/deinstallation time to determine whether or not
installation/deinstallation should proceed.
.B "Optional."
.PP
.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
The "packing list" format (see \fB-f\fR) is fairly simple, being
nothing more than a single column of filenames to include in the
package.  However, since absolute pathnames are generally a bad idea
for a package that could be installed potentially anywhere, there is
another method of specifying where things are supposed to go
and, optionally, what ownership and mode information they should be
installed with.  This is done by imbeding specialized command sequences
in the packing list. Briefly described, these sequences are:
.TP
.BI "@cwd\ " directory
Sets the internal directory pointer to point to
.I directory.
All subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to this directory.
.TP
.BI "@exec\ " command
Execute
.I command
as part of the unpacking process.  If
.I command
contains a `%s' sequence somewhere in it, it will be expanded to
the name of the last filename extracted.  In practice, such
weird things should be unnecessary in all but the most extenuating
circumstances, but it's there should you need it nonetheless.
.TP
.BI "@mode\ " mode
Sets default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
.I mode.
Format is the same as that used by the
.B chmod
command (well, considering that it's later handed off to it, that's
no surprise).  Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
permissions.
.TP
.BI "@owner\ " user
Sets default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.I user.
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
ownership.
.TP
.BI "@group\ " group
Sets default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.I group.
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
group ownership.
.TP
.BI "@comment\ " string
Imbed a comment in the packing list.  Useful in
trying to document some particularly hairy sequence that
may trip someone up later.
.TP
.BI "@ignore\ " file
Used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file (don't
copy it anywhere), as it's used for some special purpose.  Also useful
if you want to pack some specialized datafiles in with a distribution
for your install script (or something) and want to have the installer
ignore it.
.TP
.BI "@name\ " name
Sets the name of the package.  This is mandatory and is usually
put at the top.  This name is potentially different than the name of
the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the package
for later deinstallation.  Note that
.B pkg_create
currently derives this field from the package name and adds it
automatically.
