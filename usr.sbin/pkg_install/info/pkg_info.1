.SH NAME
pkg_info - a utility for getting information on software package distributions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B pkg_info
.RB [options]
.RB "pkg-file|pkg-name\ [.. pkg-file|pkg-name]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pkg_info
command is used to dump out information for packages, either packed up in
files or already installed on the system
with the
.B pkg_create
command.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
The following command line options are supported.
.TP
.B \-a
Show all currently installed packages.
.TP
.B \-v
Turns on verbose output.
.TP
.B \-p
Show the installation prefix for each package.
.TP
.B \-c
Show the comment (one liner) field for each package.
.TP
.B \-d
Show the long description field for each package.
.TP
.B \-i
Show the install script (if any) for each package.
.TP
.B \-k
Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.
.TP
.B \-r
Show the requirements script (if any) for each package.
.TP
.BI "\-e\ " pkg-name
If the package identified by
.I pkg-name
is currently installed, return 0, otherwise return 1.  This option
allows you to easily test for the presence of another (perhaps
prerequisite) package from a script.
.TP
.BI "\-l\ " str
Prefix each catagory of information shown with
.I str.
This is primarily of use to front-end programs who want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessary want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.  This lets you add a special token to the start of
each field.
.BI "\-t\ " template
Use
.I template
as the input to mktemp(3).  By default, this is the string
.B /tmp/instmp.XXXXXX
, but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
space in your
.B /tmp
directory is limited. Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters
for mktemp(3) to fill in with a unique ID.
Note:  This should really not be necessary with pkg_info,
since very little information is extracted from each package
and one would have to have a very small /tmp indeed to overflow
it.
.PP
.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
Package info is either extracted from files supplied on the
command line, or from already installed package information
in /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name>.
.SH BUGS
Sure to be some.
