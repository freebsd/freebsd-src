.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_sign ,
.Nm pkg_check
.Nd handle package signatures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl sc
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Op Fl u Ar id
.Op Fl k Ar key
.Op Ar
.Nm pkg_check
.Op Fl sc
.Op Fl u Ar id
.Op Fl k Ar cert
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
embeds a cryptographic signature within a gzip file
.Ar file .
.Ar type
can be
.Cm pgp
(default),
.Cm sha1 ,
or
.Cm x509 .
If
.Ar type
is
.Cm pgp ,
it will always prompt you for a passphrase to unlock your private
pgp key, even if you don't use a passphrase (which is a bad idea, anyway).
If
.Ar type
is
.Cm sha1 ,
you must supply an
.Ar id ,
which will be recorded as the name of the package, and printed as the
SHA1 checksum.
.Pp
.Nm pkg_check
checks that cryptographic signature.
It currently disregards
.Ar type
and checks only the topmost signature.
For
.Cm sha1 ,
it checksums the file
and verifies that the result matches the list of checksums recorded in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/SHA1 .
.Pp
Options
.Fl s
and
.Fl c
can be used to force package signing or signature checking mode.
.Pp
For
.Cm pgp ,
the
.Ar id
to use to sign the package or verify the signature can be forced with
.Fl u .
.Pp
For
.Cm x509 ,
the signing key or verification certificate may be
specified with the
.Fl k
option.  If not specified, packages are signed or verified with the
default keys and certificates documented below.
.Pp
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq Fl
or absent,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
Package signing uses a feature of the gzip format, namely that one can
set a flag
.Dv EXTRA_FIELD
in the gzip header and store extra data between the gzip header and the
compressed file proper.
The
.Ox
signing scheme uses eight bytes markers such
.Sq Li SIGPGP
+ length or
.Sq CKSHA1
+ length for its signatures (those markers are conveniently
eight bytes long).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm
and
.Nm pkg_check
return with an exit code >0 if anything went wrong for any
.Ar file .
For
.Nm pkg_check ,
this usually indicates that the package is not signed, or that the
signature is forged.
.Bl -diag
.It "File %s is already signed"
There is a signature embedded within the gzip file already.
.Nm
currently does not handle multiple signatures.
.It "File %s is not a signed gzip file"
This is an unsigned package.
.It "File %s is not a gzip file"
The program couldn't find a proper gzip header.
.It "File %s contains an unknown extension"
The extended area of the gzip file has been used for an unknown purpose.
.It "File %s uses old signatures, no longer supported"
The gzip file uses a very early version of package signing that was
substantially slower.
.El
.Sh BUGS
.Xr pgp 1
is an ill-designed program, which is hard to interface with.
For instance, the `separate signing scheme' it pretends to offer is
useless, as it can't be used with pipes, so that
.Nm pgp_sign
needs to kludge it by knowing the length of a pgp signature, and invoking
pgp in `seamless' signature mode, without compression of the main file,
and just retrieving the signature.
.Pp
The checking scheme is little less convoluted, namely we rebuild the file
that pgp expects on the fly.
.Pp
Paths to
.Nm pgp
and
the checksum file are hard-coded to avoid tampering and hinder flexibility.
