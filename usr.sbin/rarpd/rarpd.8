.SH NAME
rarpd \- Reverse ARP Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B rarpd 
[
.B \-afsv
]
[
.I interface
]
.br
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Rarpd
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.I interface.
Upon receiving a request, 
.I rarpd
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which 
must be present in both the
.I ethers(5)
and 
.I hosts(5)
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.

By default, a request is honored only if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, a file or directory matching the glob
/tftpboot/\fIipaddr\fP*
exists, where \fIipaddr\fP is the target IP address in hex.
For example, the IP address 204.216.27.18 will be replied to if any of
/tftpboot/CCD81B12, /tftpboot/CCD81B12.SUN3, or /tftpboot/CCD81B12-boot
exist.
This requirement can be overridden with the
.B \-s
flag (see below).

In normal operation, 
.I rarpd
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via 
.I syslog(3).

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If `-a' is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.TP
.B \-f
Run in the foreground.
.TP
.B \-s
Supply a response to any RARP request for which an ethernet to IP address
mapping exists; do not depend on the existence of
/tftpboot/\fIipaddr\fP*.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose sysloging.

.SH BUGS
.I rarpd
can depend on the DNS to resolve the name discovered from /etc/ethers.
If this name is not in the DNS but is in /etc/hosts, the DNS lookup
can cause a delayed RARP response, so in this situation it is reccommended to
configure /etc/host.conf to read /etc/hosts first.
