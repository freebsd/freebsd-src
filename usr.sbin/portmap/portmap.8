.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd
.Tn RPC
program,version
to
.Tn DARPA
port mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl h Ar bindip
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Portmap
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm
what port number it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm
on the server machine to determine
the port number where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm Portmap
must be started before any
.Tn RPC
servers are invoked.
.Pp
.Nm Portmap
uses
.Xr hosts_access 5
access control by default.
Access control patterns may only reference IP addresses.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm Portmap
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Prevent
.Nm
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose logging of access control checks.
.It Fl h
Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP requests.
This option
may be specified multiple times and is typically necessary when running
on a multi-homed host.
If no
.Fl h
option is specified,
.Nm
will bind to
.Dv INADDR_ANY ,
which could lead to problems on a multi-homed host due to
.Nm
returning a UDP packet from a different IP address than it was
sent to.
Note that when specifying IP addresses with
.Fl h ,
.Nm
will automatically add
.Li 127.0.0.1
to the list.

.Xr hosts_access 5 ,
.Xr inetd.conf 5 ,
.Xr inetd 8 ,
.Xr rpcinfo 8
.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm
crashes, all servers must be restarted.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
