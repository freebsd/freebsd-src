.Nm watch

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Watch
allows the superuser to examine all data coming through a specified tty.
.Nm Watch
writes to standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-l nul  "
.It Fl c
Reconnect on close.  If the tty observed by
.Nm watch
is closed,  automatically reattach to the same tty.
If this option is not specified,
.Nm watch
will request a new tty if running in interactive mode or exit if running
without a controlling tty.
.It Fl i
Force interactive mode.
Interactive mode is a default if
.Nm watch
is started from a tty.
If output is redirected to a file, interactive mode can still be requested
by specifying this option.
.It Fl o
Reconnect on overflow.
The behavior of
.Nm watch
if the observed tty overflows is similar to the behavior if the observed tty
is closed.
