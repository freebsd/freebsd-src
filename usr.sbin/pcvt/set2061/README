Read the file "CAUTION" before proceeding !!!

The files:

	ICD2061Aalt.c		and
	compiler.h

come from the Xfree86 2.1 distribution and have been slightly modified to
fit in a non-XFree environment.

I use it to program the clock generator ICD2061a on my S3 928 based ELSA
Winner VGA board to 40MHz for clock generator #2: set2061 -n2 -f40000000.

This enables me to use 132 columns mode on this VGA board.
