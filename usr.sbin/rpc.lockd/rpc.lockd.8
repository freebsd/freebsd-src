.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Op Ar debug_level
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rpc.lockd
is a daemon which provides file- and record-locking services in an NFS
environment.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Cause debugging information to be written to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.  These messages are logged with level
LOG_DEBUG and facility LOG_DAEMON.  If debug_level is not specified,
level 1 is assumed, giving one log line per protocol operation.  Higher
debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level LOG_ERR and facility LOG_DAEMON.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon must NOT be invoked by
.Xr inetd 8
because the protocol assumes that the daemon will run from system start time.
Instead, it should be run from
.Xr rc 8
after the network has been started.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rpc.statd 8
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation provides only the server side of the protocol
(ie. clients running other OS types can establish locks on a
.Fx
fileserver,
but there is currently no means for a
.Fx
client to establish locks).
.Pp
Versions 1, 2 and 3 of the protocol are supported.  However, only versions
2 (Unix systems) and 3 (PC-NFS clients) seem to be in common use - the version
1 support has not been tested due to the lack of version 1 clients against
which to test.
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in X/Open CAE Specification
