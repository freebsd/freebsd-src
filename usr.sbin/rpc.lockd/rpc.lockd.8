.Dt RPC.LOCKD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar debug_level
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl g Ar grace period
.Op Fl h Ar bindip
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides monitored and unmonitored file and record locking services
in an NFSv3 environment.
To monitor the status of hosts requesting locks,
the locking daemon typically operates in conjunction
with
.Xr rpc.statd 8 .
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option causes debugging information to be written to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.
These messages are logged with level
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
Specifying a
.Ar debug_level
of 1 results
in the generation of one log line per protocol operation.
Higher
debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.It Fl F
Run
.Nm
in the foreground, rather than going into daemon mode.
This is useful if some other process uses
.Xr fork 2
and
.Xr exec 3
to run
.Nm ,
and wants to monitor when and how it exits.
.It Fl g
The
.Fl g
option allow to specify the
.Ar grace period ,
in seconds.
During the grace period
.Nm
only accepts requests from hosts which are reinitialising locks which
existed before the server restart.
Default is 30 seconds.
.It Fl h Ar bindip
Specify specific IP addresses to bind to.
This option may be specified multiple times.
If no
.Fl h
option is specified,
.Nm
will bind to
.Dv INADDR_ANY .
Note that when specifying IP addresses with
.Fl h ,
.Nm
will automatically add
.Li 127.0.0.1
and if IPv6 is enabled,
.Li ::1
to the list.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option allow to force the daemon to bind to the specified
.Ar port ,
for both AF_INET and AF_INET6 address families.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level
.Dv LOG_ERR
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility must NOT be invoked by
.Xr inetd 8
because the protocol assumes that the daemon will run from system start time.
Instead, it should be configured in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to run at system startup.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr nfslockd 4 ,
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
.Xr rpc.statd 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in
.Rs
.%B "X/Open CAE Specification C218"
.%T "Protocols for X/Open PC Interworking: XNFS, Issue 4"
.%O ISBN 1 872630 66 9

.Sh HISTORY
A version of
.Nm
appeared in
.Tn SunOS
4.
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation serialises locks requests that could be shared.
