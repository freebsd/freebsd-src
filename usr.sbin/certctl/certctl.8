.Sh NAME
.Nm certctl
.Nd "tool for managing trusted and untrusted TLS certificates"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ic list
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ic untrusted
.Nm
.Op Fl cnUv
.Op Fl D Ar destdir
.Op Fl M Ar metalog
.Ic rehash
.Nm
.Op Fl cnv
.Ic untrust Ar file
.Nm
.Op Fl cnv
.Ic trust Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility manages the list of TLS Certificate Authorities that are trusted by
applications that use OpenSSL.
.Pp
Flags:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl c
Copy certificates instead of linking to them.
.It Fl D Ar destdir
Specify the DESTDIR (overriding values from the environment).
.It Fl d Ar distbase
Specify the DISTBASE (overriding values from the environment).
.It Fl M Ar metalog
Specify the path of the METALOG file (default: $DESTDIR/METALOG).
.It Fl n
No-Op mode, do not actually perform any actions.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, print details about actions before performing them.
.It Fl U
Unprivileged mode, do not change the ownership of created links.
Do record the ownership in the METALOG file.
.El
.Pp
Primary command functions:
.Bl -tag -width untrusted
.It Ic list
List all currently trusted certificate authorities.
.It Ic untrusted
List all currently untrusted certificates.
.It Ic rehash
Rebuild the list of trusted certificate authorities by scanning all directories
in
.Ev TRUSTPATH
and all untrusted certificates in
.Ev UNTRUSTPATH .
A symbolic link to each trusted certificate is placed in
.Ev CERTDESTDIR
and each untrusted certificate in
.Ev UNTRUSTDESTDIR .
.It Ic untrust
Add the specified file to the untrusted list.
.It Ic trust
Remove the specified file from the untrusted list.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width UNTRUSTDESTDIR
.It Ev DESTDIR
Alternate destination directory to operate on.
.It Ev DISTBASE
Additional path component to include when operating on certificate directories.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
Location for local programs.
Defaults to the value of the user.localbase sysctl which is usually
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Ev TRUSTPATH
List of paths to search for trusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE>/usr/share/certs/trusted
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE>/usr/local/share/certs
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE><LOCALBASE>/etc/ssl/certs
.It Ev UNTRUSTPATH
List of paths to search for untrusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE>/usr/share/certs/untrusted
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE><LOCALBASE>/etc/ssl/untrusted
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE><LOCALBASE>/etc/ssl/blacklisted
.It Ev CERTDESTDIR
Destination directory for symbolic links to trusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE>/etc/ssl/certs
.It Ev UNTRUSTDESTDIR
Destination directory for symbolic links to untrusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa <DESTDIR><DISTBASE>/etc/ssl/untrusted
.It Ev EXTENSIONS
List of file extensions to read as certificate files.
Default: *.pem *.crt *.cer *.crl *.0
