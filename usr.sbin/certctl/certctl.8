.Ic untrusted
.Nm
.Op Fl BnUv
.Op Fl D Ar destdir
.Op Fl M Ar metalog

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility manages the list of TLS Certificate Authorities that are trusted by
applications that use OpenSSL.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl B
Do not generate a bundle.
This option is only valid in conjunction with the
.Ic rehash
command.
.It Fl D Ar destdir
Specify the DESTDIR (overriding values from the environment).
.It Fl d Ar distbase
Specify the DISTBASE (overriding values from the environment).
.It Fl l
When listing installed (trusted or untrusted) certificates, show the
full path and distinguished name for each certificate.
.It Fl M Ar metalog
Specify the path of the METALOG file
.Po
default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}/METALOG
.Pc .
This option is only valid in conjunction with the
.Ic rehash
command.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
Do not actually perform any actions except write the metalog.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Print detailed information about each action taken.
.It Fl U
Unprivileged mode.
Do not attempt to set the ownership of created files.
This option is only valid in conjunction with the
.Fl M
option and the
.Ic rehash
command.
.El
.Pp
Primary command functions:
.Bl -tag -width untrusted
.It Ic list
List all currently trusted certificates.
.It Ic untrusted
List all currently untrusted certificates.
.It Ic rehash
Rebuild the list of trusted certificates by scanning all directories
in
.Ev TRUSTPATH
and all untrusted certificates in
.Ev UNTRUSTPATH .
A copy of each trusted certificate is placed in
.Ev CERTDESTDIR
and each untrusted certificate in
.Ev UNTRUSTDESTDIR .
In addition, a bundle containing the trusted certificates is placed in
.Ev BUNDLE .
.It Ic untrust
Add the specified file to the untrusted list.
.It Ic trust
Remove the specified file from the untrusted list.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width UNTRUSTDESTDIR
.It Ev DESTDIR
Absolute path to an alternate destination directory to operate on
instead of the file system root, e.g.
.Dq Li /tmp/install .
.It Ev DISTBASE
Additional path component to include when operating on certificate directories.
This must start with a slash, e.g.
.Dq Li /base .
.It Ev LOCALBASE
Location for local programs.
Defaults to the value of the user.localbase sysctl which is usually
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Ev TRUSTPATH
List of paths to search for trusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${DISTBASE}/usr/share/certs/trusted
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${LOCALBASE}/share/certs/trusted
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${LOCALBASE}/share/certs
.It Ev UNTRUSTPATH
List of paths to search for untrusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${DISTBASE}/usr/share/certs/untrusted
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${LOCALBASE}/share/certs/untrusted
.It Ev TRUSTDESTDIR
Destination directory for symbolic links to trusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${DISTBASE}/etc/ssl/certs
.It Ev UNTRUSTDESTDIR
Destination directory for symbolic links to untrusted certificates.
Default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${DISTBASE}/etc/ssl/untrusted
.It Ev BUNDLE
File name of bundle to produce.
Default:
.Pa ${DESTDIR}${DISTBASE}/etc/ssl/cert.pem
