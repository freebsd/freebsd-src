.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is designed to run various tests against your systems
performance.
There are roughly 20-22 canned tests that setup specific
PMCs and then run various formulas on the output information.
These formulas can be found in Intel documentation "Using Intel Vtune
amplifier xe on NNN Generation Intel Core Processors".
The NNN is either
2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th generation i.e., Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Broadwell.
Currently the program only works on these four Intel processor types.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar filename
If this option is supplied, instead of running a
.Xr pmcstat 8
command to collect the current running information the filename will be read
in as input instead.
.It Fl H
This option will display the complete list of canned formulas that can be run including
their names which can be input to the
.Fl e
option.
.It Fl e Ar name
Execute the canned test
.Ar name
on the running kernel.
.It Fl h
If you add this option to the
.Fl e
option the test will not execute but instead give you a small description
of the test that would run.
.It Fl T
This option will execute a test of every PMC to validate that they are working
on your system.
If a PMC does not show up in this test chances
are the kernel
.Xr hwpmc 4
driver needs updating with new PMC information.
.It Fl m Ar num
This option can restrict the number of one second samples that will
be collected by your system when running a test (it bounds the
time the test will run).
Without this option the test will run
for 1024 seconds or until the user types ctrl-c.
.It Fl v
The verbose option adds debugging output to the command.
.It Fl E Ar expression
This option can be used by those that have their own ideas
on what formulas they want to run.
The expression given to the
.Fl E
option is a "formula".
The formula can declare directly the PMCs by name
or you can use an abbreviation %NNN.
To find out the abbreviations
on your system you may run the
.Fl L
option.
An example of a formula of your own might be
.Fl E
"FP_ASSIST.ANY / INST_RETIRED.ANY_P" or using the abbreviations on a
Haswell machine you would type
.Fl E
" %176 / %150".
You must have spaces between each entry and
you may use parentheses to prioritize the operators.
Add (+), Subtract (-),
Divide (/) and Multiplication (*) are supported.
You may also introduce
constant numbers.
For example you can do a standard efficiency
test like
.Fl E
"UOPS_RETIRED.RETIRE_SLOTS / (4 * CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.THREAD_P)".
.It Fl L
This option will list all known PMCs and their abbreviation (%NNN).
.It Fl A
Run all canned tests.
