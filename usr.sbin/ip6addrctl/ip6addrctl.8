.\"
.Sh NAME
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Nd configure address selection policy for IPv6 and IPv4
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Op Cm show
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Cm add
.Ar prefix precedence label
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Cm delete
.Ar prefix
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Cm flush
.Nm ip6addrctl
.Cm install
.Ar configfile
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manages the policy table of source and destination address
selection for outgoing IPv4 and IPv6 packets.
When
.Nm
is invoked without an argument or with a single argument
.Cm show ,
it prints the content of the policy table currently installed in the
kernel.
.Pp
To modify the table, the following operations are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm add Ar prefix precedence label
add a policy entry.
.Ar Prefix
is an IPv6 prefix, which is a key for the entry.
An IPv4 prefix should be specified with an IPv6 prefix using an
IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
.Ar Precedence
and
.Ar label
are decimal numbers, which specify the precedence and label values
for the entry, respectively.
This operation should be performed without an existing entry for the
prefix.
.It Cm delete Ar prefix
delete a policy entry specified by
.Ar prefix ,
which should be an IPv6 prefix.
A corresponding entry for the prefix should have already been
installed.
.It Cm flush
delete all existing policy entries in the kernel.
.It Cm install Ar configfile
install policy entries from a configuration file named
.Ar configfile .
The configuration file should contain a set of policy entries.
Each entry is specified in a single line which contains an IPv6 prefix,
a decimal precedence value, and a decimal label value, separated with
white space or tab characters.
In the configuration file, lines beginning with the pound-sign (#) are
comments and are ignored.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The program exits with 0 on success, non-zero on failures.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in the KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
The original command name was
.Nm addrselect ,
but it was then renamed to the current one so that the name would
describe its function well.
