from the user.

.Sh HISTORY
The

and
.Nm vidfont
commands appeared in
.Fx 2.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.An Wolfram Schneider Aq Mt wosch@FreeBSD.org
wrote the original Perl version.

.An Jonathan Belson Aq Mt jon@witchspace.com
for
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.\" .Nm kbdmap/vidfont
.\" does not know which font is in use. E.g. if the current font
.\" is iso-8859-1 and you chose lang 'ru' (for Russian)
.\" you get funny latin1 characters and not russkij shrift.
.\"
The
.Nm
and
.Nm vidfont
utilities work only on a (virtual) console and not with
.Tn X11 .
