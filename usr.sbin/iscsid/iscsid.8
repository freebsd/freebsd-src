.Sh NAME
.Nm iscsid
.Nd iSCSI initiator daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl l Ar loglevel
.Op Fl m Ar maxproc
.Op Fl t Ar seconds
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is the userspace component of the iSCSI initiator,
responsible for performing the Login Phase
of iSCSI connections and the SendTargets discovery.
.Pp
Upon startup, the
.Nm
daemon opens the iSCSI initiator device file and waits for requests
from the kernel component,
.Xr iscsi 4 .
.Nm
does not use any configuration files.
All needed information is supplied by the kernel.
.Pp
When the
.Nm
daemon is not running, already established iSCSI connections continue
to work.
However, establishing new connections, or recovering existing ones in case
of connection error, is not possible.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl P Ar pidfile"
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
Specify alternative location of a file where main process PID will be stored.
The default location is
.Pa /var/run/iscsid.pid .
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
The daemon sends verbose debug output to standard error, and does not
put itself in the background.
The daemon will also not fork and will exit after processing one connection.
This option is only intended for debugging the initiator.
.It Fl l Ar loglevel
Specifies debug level.
The default is 0.
.It Fl m Ar maxproc
Specifies limit for concurrently running child processes handling
connections.
The default is 30.
Setting it to 0 disables the limit.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
Specifies timeout for login session, after which the connection
will be forcibly terminated.
The default is 60.
Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.
.El
