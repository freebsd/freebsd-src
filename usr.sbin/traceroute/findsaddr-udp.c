 * Return the source address for the given destination address.

 * This makes use of proper source address selection in the FreeBSD kernel
 * even taking jails into account (sys/netinet/in_pcb.c:in_pcbladdr()).
 * We open a UDP socket, and connect to the destination, letting the kernel
 * do the bind and then read the source IPv4 address using getsockname(2).
 * This has multiple advantages: no need to do PF_ROUTE operations possibly
 * needing special privileges, jails properly taken into account and most
 * important - getting the result the kernel would give us rather than
 * best-guessing ourselves.
