.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected
together by gateways.
Tracking the route one's packets follow (or finding the miscreant gateway
that's discarding your packets) can be difficult.
The
.Nm traceroute
utility utilizes the IP protocol
.Sq time to live
field (or
.Sq hop limit
for IPv6) and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from
each gateway along the path to some host.
.Pp
The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.
The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes, but this may be increased by
specifying a packet length (in bytes) after the destination host name.
.Pp
Other options are described below.
For compatibility with the historical
.Nm traceroute6
command (which should no longer be used), some flags are accepted only
when the utility is invoked as
.Nm traceroute6 ,
and not when invoked as
.Nm traceroute .
Conversely, some flags accepted by
.Nm
are only supported for IPv4 targets.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Force
.Ar host
to be resolved to an IPv4 address.
.It Fl 6
Force
.Ar host
to be resolved to an IPv6 address.
.It Fl a
Turn on AS# lookups for each hop encountered.
.It Fl A Ar as_server
Turn on AS# lookups and use the given server instead of the default.
.It Fl d
Enable socket level debugging.
.It Fl D
(IPv4-only)
When an ICMP response to our probe datagram is received, print the differences
between the transmitted packet and the packet quoted by the ICMP response.
A key showing the location of fields within the transmitted packet is printed,
followed by the original packet in hex, followed by the quoted packet in hex.
Bytes that are unchanged in the quoted packet are shown as underscores.
Note, the IP checksum and the TTL of the quoted packet are not expected to
match.
By default, only one probe per hop is sent with this option.
.It Fl e
(IPv4-only)
Firewall evasion mode.
Use fixed destination ports for UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP and SCTP probes.
The destination port does NOT increment with each packet sent.
.It Fl E
Detect ECN bleaching.
Set the
.Em IPTOS_ECN_ECT1
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits
.Pq Dv 01 ,
and report if the hop has bleached
.Pq Dv 00
or mangled
.Pq Dv 10
them, or if it is experiencing congestion
.Pq Dv 11 .
Otherwise, report that it passed the bits appropriately.
If
.Fl t
is also specified, the corresponding ECN bits will be replaced.
.It Fl f Ar first_hop
Set the initial time-to-live (or hop limit for IPv6) in the first
outgoing probe packet.
.It Fl F
(IPv4-only)
Set the
.Dq don't fragment
bit.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specify source routing for the probe packets.
For IPv4 targets, this uses loose source routing, and up to 8 gateways
may be specified.
For IPv6 targets, this uses routing header type 0, and up to 127
gateways may be specified.
Note that the vast majority of IP routers on the Internet (including
.Fx )
ignore both IPv4 and IPv6 source routing.
.It Fl i Ar iface
(IPv4-only)
Specify a network interface to obtain the source IP address for outgoing
probe packets.
This is normally only useful on a multi-homed host.
(See the
.Fl s
flag for another way to do this).
.It Fl I
Use ICMP ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.
(A synonym for "-P icmp").
.It Fl l
This flag is ignored for compatibility with historical versions of
.Nm traceroute6 .
.It Fl m Ar hoplimit
Set the max time-to-live (or hop limit, for IPv6) used in outgoing probe
packets.
The default is the value of the
.Va net.inet.ip.ttl
.Xr sysctl 8
(the same default used for TCP connections).
.It Fl M Ar first_hop
Set the initial time-to-live value (or hop limit, for IPv6) used in
outgoing probe packets.
The default is 1, i.e., start with the first hop.
.It Fl N
.Nm ( traceroute6
only)
Set the outgoing protocol to
.Dq none ,
i.e. do not provide any payload other than the IP header.
.It Fl n
Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically
(saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each gateway found on the path).
.It Fl p Ar port
Protocol specific.
For UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP and SCTP, sets the base
.Ar port
number used in probes (default is 33434).
Traceroute hopes that nothing is listening on UDP ports (or UDP-Lite ports
if used by
.Nm
and supported by the peer)
.Em port + 1
to
.Em port + (max_ttl - first_ttl + 1) * nprobes
at the destination host (so an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message will be returned
to terminate the route tracing).
If something is listening on a port in the default range, this option can be
used to pick an unused port range.
.It Fl P Ar proto
(IPv4-only)
Send packets of specified IP protocol.
The currently supported protocols
are: UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP, SCTP, GRE and ICMP.
Other protocols may also be specified (either by name or by number), though
.Nm
does not implement any special knowledge of their packet formats.
This option is useful for determining which router along a path may be blocking
packets based on IP protocol number.
But see BUGS below.
.It Fl q Ar nprobes
Set the number of probes per hop (default is 3, unless
.Fl D
is specified,
when it is 1).
.It Fl r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no
route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped by
.Xr routed 8 .
.It Fl s Ar src_addr
Use the following IP address (which usually is given as an IP number, not a
hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets.
On multi-homed hosts (those with more than one IP address), this option can be
used to force the source address to be something other than the IP address of
the interface the probe packet is sent on.
If the IP address is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is
returned and nothing is sent.
(See the
.Fl i
flag for another way to do this).
.It Fl S
When used with
.Nm traceroute ,
print a summary of how many probes were not answered for each hop.
This is only supported for IPv4 targets.
When used with
.Nm traceroute6 ,
set the outgoing protocol to SCTP.
.It Fl T
.Nm ( traceroute6
only)
Set the outgoing protocol to TCP.
.It Fl t Ar tos
Set the
.Em type-of-service
(or
.Em traffic class ,
for IPv6)
in probe packets to the following value (default zero).
The value must be a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.
This option can be used to see if different types-of-service result in
different paths.
The upper six bits are the Differentiated Services Codepoint (RFC4594).
The lower two bits are the Explicit Congestion Notification field (RFC3168).
.It Fl U
.Nm ( traceroute6
only)
Set the outgoing protocol to UDP.
This is the default.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
Received ICMP packets other than
.Dv TIME_EXCEEDED
and
.Dv UNREACHABLE Ns s
are listed.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default 5 sec.).
.It Fl x
Toggle ip checksums.
Normally, this prevents traceroute from calculating ip checksums.
In some cases, the operating system can overwrite parts of the outgoing packet
but not recalculate the checksum (so in some cases the default is to not
calculate checksums and using
.Fl x
causes them to be calculated).
Note that checksums are usually required for the last hop when using ICMP ECHO
probes
.Pq Fl I .
So they are always calculated when using ICMP.
.It Fl z Ar pausemsecs
(IPv4-only)
Set the time (in milliseconds) to pause between probes (default 0).
Some systems such as Solaris and routers such as Ciscos rate limit ICMP
messages.
A good value to use with this is 500 (e.g., 1/2 second).
.El
.Pp
This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to some
internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small TTL (time to live)
then listening for an ICMP
.Dq time exceeded
reply from a gateway.
We start our probes with a TTL of one and increase by one until we get an ICMP
"port unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which defaults
to the amount of hops specified by the
.Va net.inet.ip.ttl
.Xr sysctl 8
and can be changed with the
.Fl m
flag).
Three probes (change with
.Fl q
flag) are sent at each TTL setting and a line is printed showing the TTL,
address of the gateway and round trip time of each probe.
If the probe answers come from different gateways, the address of each
responding system will be printed.
If there is no response within a 5 sec. timeout interval (changed with the
.Fl w
flag), a "*" is printed for that probe.
.Pp
We don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe packets so the
destination port is set to an unlikely value (if some clod on the destination
is using that value, it can be changed with the
.Fl p
flag).
.Pp
A sample use and output might be:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n

.Pp
Note that lines 2 & 3 are the same.
This is due to a buggy kernel on the 2nd hop system \- lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU \-
that forwards packets with a zero TTL (a bug in the distributed version of
4.3BSD).
Note that you have to guess what path the packets are taking cross-country
since the NSFNet (129.140) doesn't supply address-to-name translations for its
NSSes.

.Pp
Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away either don't send ICMP
"time exceeded" messages or send them with a TTL too small to reach us.
14 \- 17 are running the MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.
God only knows what's going on with 12.
.Pp
The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in the 4.[23]BSD
network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3) sends an unreachable message
using whatever TTL remains in the original datagram.
Since, for gateways, the remaining TTL is zero, the ICMP "time exceeded" is
guaranteed to not make it back to us.
The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting when it appears on the
destination system:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n

.Ed
.Pp
Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final destination) and exactly
the last half of them are "missing".
What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5) is using the
TTL from our arriving datagram as the TTL in its ICMP reply.
So, the reply will time out on the return path (with no notice sent to anyone
since ICMP's aren't sent for ICMP's) until we probe with a TTL that's at least
twice the path length.
I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.
A reply that returns with a TTL of 1 is a clue this problem exists.
.Nm
prints a "!" after the time if the TTL is <= 1.
Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete
.Pf ( DEC Ns \'s
Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or
non-standard
.Pq HP-UX
software, expect to see this problem frequently and/or take care picking the
target host of your probes.
.Pp
Other possible annotations after the time are:
.Bl -hang -offset indent -width 12n
.It Sy !H
Host unreachable.
.It Sy !N
Network unreachable.
.It Sy !P
Protocol unreachable.
.It Sy !S
Source route failed.
.It Sy !F\-<pmtu>
Fragmentation needed.
The RFC1191 Path MTU Discovery value is displayed.
.It Sy !U
Destination network unknown.
.It Sy !W
Destination host unknown.
.It Sy !I
Source host is isolated.
.It Sy !A
Communication with destination network administratively prohibited.
.It Sy !Z

For this ToS the destination network is unreachable.
.It Sy !T
For this ToS the destination host is unreachable.
.It Sy !X
Communication administratively prohibited.
.It Sy !V
Host precedence violation.
.It Sy !C
Precedence cutoff in effect.
.It Sy !<num>
ICMP unreachable code <num>.
.El
.Pp
These are defined by RFC1812 (which supersedes RFC1716).
If almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable,
.Nm
will give up and exit.
.Pp
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.
It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use
.Nm
during normal operations or from automated scripts.

.Pp
IPv6 support first appeared in
.Nm traceroute6 ,
which was part of the WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack.
.Sh BUGS
When using protocols other than UDP, functionality is reduced.
In particular, the last packet will often appear to be lost, because even
though it reaches the destination host, there's no way to know that because no
ICMP message is sent back.
In the TCP case,
.Nm
should listen for a RST from the destination host (or an intermediate router
that's filtering packets), but this is not implemented yet.
.Pp
The AS number capability reports information that may sometimes be inaccurate
due to discrepancies between the contents of the routing database server and
the current state of the Internet.
