.Sh NAME
.Nm services_mkdb
.Nd generate the services database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b | l
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl o Ar database
.Op Ar file
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
creates a
.Xr db 3
database for the specified
.Ar file .
If no file is specified, then
.Pa /etc/services
is used.
The database is installed into
.Pa /var/db/services.db .
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr services 5 ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Use big-endian byte order for database metadata.
.It Fl l
Use little-endian byte order for database metadata.
.It Fl o Ar database
Put the output databases in the named file.
.It Fl q
Do not warn about duplicate services.
.It Fl u
Print the services file to stdout, omitting duplicate entries and comments.
.El
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library services routines (see
.Xr getservent 3 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fl b
and
.Fl l
flags are mutually exclusive.
The default byte ordering is the current host order.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/db/services.db.tmp" -compact
.It Pa /var/db/services.db
The current services database.
.It Pa /var/db/services.db.tmp
A temporary file.
.It Pa /etc/services
The current services file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr db 3 ,
.Xr getservent 3 ,
.Xr services 5
.Sh BUGS
Because
.Nm
guarantees not to install a partial destination file it must
build a temporary file in the same file system and if successful use
.Xr rename 2
to install over the destination file.
.Pp
If
.Nm
fails it will leave the previous version of the destination file intact.
