.Dt LASTLOGIN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm lastlogin
.Nd indicate last login time of users
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -libxo
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl rt
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will list the last login session of each specified
.Ar user ,
or for all users by default.
Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, and the start time for the session.
.Pp
If more than one
.Ar user
is given, the session information for each user is printed in
the order given on the command line.
Otherwise, information for all users is printed.
By default, the entries are sorted by user name.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility differs from
.Xr last 1
in that it only prints information regarding the very last login session.
The last login database is never turned over or deleted in standard usage.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -libxo
Generate output via
.Xr libxo 3
in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.
See
.Xr xo_options 7
for details on command line arguments.
.It Fl f Ar file
Open last login database
.Ar file
instead of the system-wide database.
.It Fl r
Print the entries in reverse sorted order.
.It Fl t
Sort the elements by last login time, instead of user name.
