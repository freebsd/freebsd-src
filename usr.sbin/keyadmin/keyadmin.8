.Dt KEY 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm keyadmin
.Nd manually manipulate the kernel key management database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar command Op Ar args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to manually enter security associations into the kernel
key/security association database.  (See
.Xr key 4 ) .
.Pp
Almost any operation offered in the
.Xr key 4
API is available to privileged users running
.Nm .
Until there is an implementation of an automated key management protocol,
which will manipulate the key database in a manner similar to how
.Xr routed 8
or
.Xr gated 8
manipulates the routing tables,
.Nm
is the only way of establishing security associations.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked without any arguments, it will enter an interactive mode, where
the user can type in
.Dq Ar command Op Ar args
interactively, or use
.Nm
to enter a single
.Dq Ar command Op Ar args .
.Ar Command
can be one of the following:
.Bl -inset
.It Ic del Ar type spi source destination
.Pp
Delete a security association between
.Ar source
and
.Ar destination
of the given
.Ar type
and
.Ar spi .
Example:
.Bd -literal
	delete esp 90125 anderson.yes.org rabin.yes.org
.Ed
.It Ic get Ar type spi source destination
.Pp
Retrieve (and print) a security association between
.Ar source
and
.Ar destination
of the given
.Ar type
and
.Ar spi .
Example:
.Bd -literal
	get ah 5150 eddie.vanhalen.com alex.vanhalen.com
.Ed
.It Ic dump
.Pp
Display the entire security association table.  WARNING:  This prints a lot
of data.
.It Ic load Ar filename
.Pp
Load security association information from a file formatted as documented in
.Xr keys 5 .
If
.Dq -
is specified for the
.Ar filename ,
load keys from the standard input.
.It Ic save Ar filename
.Pp
Save security association information to a file formatted as documented in
.Xr keys 5 .
If
.Dq -
is specified for the
.Ar filename ,
place the key file out on the standard output.  (This can be used as a sort
of lightweight
.Ic dump
command.)
NOTE:  The
.Ic save
command must create a new file; it will not write into an
existing file.  This is to prevent writing into a world-readable file, or a
named pipe or UNIX socket (see
.Xr socket 2
and
.Xr mkfifo 1 ) .
.It Ic help Op command
.Pp
Offer brief help without an argument, or slightly more specific help on a
particular command.
.It Ic flush
.Pp
Erase all entries in the kernel security association table.
.El
.Pp
The following values for
.Ar command
are only available by using
.Nm
in its interactive mode of operation:
.Bl -inset
.It Ic add Ar type spi source destination transform key
.Op Ar iv
.Pp
Add a security association of a particular
.Ar type
and
.Ar spi
from a
.Ar source
to a
.Ar destination ,
using a particular
.Ar transform
and
.Ar key .
If a transform requires an initialization vector, the
.Ar iv
argument contains it.  This command is available only in interactive mode
because
.Nm
makes no attempt to destroy its argument vector after use.  A malicious user
of the
.Xr ps 1
command could determine security keys if
.Ic add
were allowed to be used straight from the command line.  Example:
.Bd -literal
	add esp 2112 temples.syrinx.org priests.syrinx.org des-cbc \\
		a652a476a652a476 87ac9876deac9876
.Ed
.It Ic exit
.It Ic quit
.Pp
Exit interaction with
.Nm .
An EOF will also end interaction with
.Nm .

.Xr routed 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in NRL's
.Bx 4.4
IPv6 networking distribution.
.Nm Keyadmin
started its life as a pipe dream thought up by Dan McDonald, and came to
life through the excruciating efforts of Ran Atkinson, Dan McDonald,
Craig Metz, and Bao Phan.
The NRL version of the program was originally called
.Nm key ,
but was renamed to
.Nm
because of the conflict with
.Xr key 1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Keyadmin
needs a -n flag like
.Xr route 8
to avoid name lookups.
.Pp
The
.Ic dump
and
.Ic save
commands currently display the first 30 or so entries.
