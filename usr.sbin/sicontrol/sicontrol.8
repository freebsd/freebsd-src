.Sh NAME
.Nm sicontrol
.Nd Specialix SI/XIO driver configuration and debugging
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
device
.Ar command Op Ar param ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure and monitor the SI/XIO device driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility operates on the specified
.Ar device
to indicate which port is to be used.
.Pp
The special
.Ar device
string `-' is used to indicate the global driver settings instead.
.Pp
A
.Pa /dev/
is included if necessary.
.Pp
The following commands are used for the global settings and should be
specified with the '-' device name:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Cm int_throttle Op Cm value
Configure the `aggregate interrupt throttle value'.
The maximum number of host adapter interrupts per second is determined by:
.Pp
.Ar "controller CPU clock / (8 * int_throttle)"
.Pp
The default value at boot time is 25000.  The host adapter cpu clock is
25MHz.  This gives a maximum interrupt rate of about 125 interrupts per
second.
.Pp
Lowering this value will increase the rate in which the host adapter can
interrupt the operating system for attention.
.\"
.It Cm rxint_throttle Op Cm value
Configure the receiver interrupt throttle value.
The default value of 4 at boot time allows an interrupt rate of
approximately 25.
.Pp
Lowering this value will increase the rate in which the host adapter can
interrupt the operating system to empty the receiver fifos.
.\"
.It Cm nport
Return the number of ports under the control of the device driver.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are used for the individual ports and should be
specified with a device name from
.Pa /dev :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Cm mstate
Show the current incoming modem control signals.
.It Cm ccbstat
Show the current "ccb" structure for the specified port.
This is not of
much use outside of debugging the driver and determining why a port is
wedged.
.It Cm ttystat
Show the current "tty" structure that the kernel has for the specified port.
This is not much use outside of debugging the driver.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility is loosely based on a utility called
.Nm siconfig
which was written by

.Pp
Specialix International do not support this device driver in any way.
