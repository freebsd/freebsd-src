.Sh NAME
.Nm bootparams
.Nd boot parameter database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/bootparams
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies the boot parameters that
.Xr diskless 8
clients may request when booting over the network.
Each client supported by this server must have an entry in the
.Nm
file containing the pathnames for its
.Dq root
and (optionally)
.Dq swap
areas.
.Pp
Each line in the file
(other than comment lines that begin with a
.Ql # )
specifies the client name followed by the pathnames that
the client may request by their logical names.
The components of the line are delimited with blank or tab,
and may be continued onto multiple lines with a backslash.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dummy	root=host:/export/dummy/root \\
	swap=host:/export/dummy/swap \\
	dump=host:/export/dummy/swap
.Ed
.Pp
When the client named
.Dq dummy
requests the pathname for its logical
.Dq root
it will be given the pathname
.Dq Pa host:/export/dummy/root
as the response to its
.Tn RPC
request.
The
.Dq host:
component must be supplied.
