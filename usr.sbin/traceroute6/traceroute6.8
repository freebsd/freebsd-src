.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the IPv6 protocol hop limit field to elicit an ICMP6
TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to some host.
.Pp
The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IPv6 address.
The default probe datagram carries 20 bytes of payload, in addition to the IPv6
header.
The size of the payload can be specified by giving a length (in bytes) after
the destination host name.
.Pp
Other options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Turn on AS# lookups for each hop encountered.
.It Fl A Ar as_server
Turn on AS# lookups and use the given server instead of the default.
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
.It Fl E
Detect ECN bleaching.
Set the
.Em IPTOS_ECN_ECT1
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits
.Pq Dv 01 ,
and report if the hop has bleached
.Pq Dv 00
or mangled
.Pq Dv 10
them, or if it is experiencing congestion
.Pq Dv 11 .
Otherwise, report that it passed the bits appropriately.
If
.Fl t
is also specified, the corresponding ECN bits will be replaced.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
Specify how many hops to skip in trace.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specify intermediate gateway.
Please note that
.Nm
tries to use routing headers.
.It Fl I
Use ICMP6 ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.
.It Fl l
Ignored for backward compatibility.
.It Fl m Ar hoplimit
Specify maximum hoplimit, up to 255.
The default is the value of the
.Va net.inet6.ip6.hlim
.Xr sysctl 8
(the same default used for TCP connections).
.It Fl n
Do not resolve numeric address to hostname.
.It Fl N
Use a packet with no upper layer header for the probes, instead of UDP
datagrams.
.It Fl p Ar port
Set SCTP/TCP/UDP port number to
.Ar port .
.It Fl q Ar probes
Set the number of probe per hop count to
.Ar probes .
.It Fl r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-connected network,
an error is returned.
This option corresponds to the
.Dv SO_DONTROUTE
socket option; it can be used to ping a local host through an interface that
has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped by a routing
daemon).
.It Fl s Ar src
.Ar Src
specifies the source IPv6 address to be used.
.It Fl S
Use SCTP packets for the probes.
The size of probe packets must be a multiple of 4.
If
.Ar datalen
is up to 28, probe packets consist of a SHUTDOWN-ACK chunk possibly bundled
with a PAD chunk.
For larger probe packets, an INIT chunk is used.
.It Fl t Ar tclass
.Ar tclass
specifies the
.Em traffic class
used when sending probe packets.
The value must be a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.
The default is 0.
.It Fl T
Use TCP segments for the probes.
.It Fl U
Use UDP datagrams for the probes.
This is the default.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Specify the delay time between probes.
.El
.Pp
This program prints the route to the given destination and the round-trip time
to each gateway, in the same manner as traceroute.
.Pp
Here is a list of possible annotations after the round-trip time for each
gateway:
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It !N
Destination Unreachable - No Route to Host.
.It !P
Destination Unreachable - Administratively Prohibited.
.It !S
Destination Unreachable - Not a Neighbour.
.It !A
Destination Unreachable - Address Unreachable.
.It !H
Parameter Problem - Unrecognized Next Header Type.
.It !<num>
ICMP6 unreachable code <num>.
.It !\&
This is printed if the hop limit is <= 1 on a port unreachable message.
This means that the packet got to the destination, but that the reply had a hop
limit that was just large enough to allow it to get back to the source of the
traceroute6.
This was more interesting in the IPv4 case, where some IP stack bugs could be
identified by this behaviour.

.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
