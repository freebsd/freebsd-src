.Sh NAME
.Nm gstat
.Nd print statistics about GEOM disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cd
.Op Fl I Ar interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to monitor I/O transactions of
.Xr geom 4
devices.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Enable display of
.Xr geom 4
consumers too.
The default is to show statistics only for
.Xr geom 4
producers.
.It Fl d
Enable display of statistics for delete
.Pq Dv BIO_DELETE
operations.
.It Fl I Ar interval
Refresh the
.Nm
display every
.Ar interval
microseconds.
Adding a suffix of
.Cm s , ms ,
or
.Cm us
(the default) indicates that the update interval is specified in
seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds, respectively.

.Xr geom 4
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility only works interactively.
It should probably detect when it is run non-interactively and produce
simple
.Tn ASCII
text output.
Otherwise, this utility should probably be folded into
.Xr systat 1
which only works interactively and is the obvious utility to run for
various other forms of system statistics.
