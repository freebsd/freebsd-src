.Sh NAME
.Nm gstat
.Nd print statistics about GEOM disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abBcCdops
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl I Ar interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to monitor I/O transactions of
.Xr geom 4
devices.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Only display providers that are at least 0.1% busy.
.It Fl b
Batch mode.
Collect numbers, print and exit.
Default if stdout is not a tty.
.It Fl B
Endless batch mode.
Same as batch mode, but does not exit after collecting
the first set of data.
.It Fl c
Enable display of
.Xr geom 4
consumers too.
The default is to show statistics only for
.Xr geom 4
producers.
.It Fl C
CSV output mode.
Implies endless batch mode, but output is in the form of comma-separated
values, with ISO 8601-like timestamps.
.It Fl d
Enable display of statistics for delete
.Pq Dv BIO_DELETE
operations.
.It Fl f Ar filter
A regular expression that can be used to only show statistics for some
devices.
Only devices with the names matching
.Ar filter
will be displayed.
The format of the regular expression is described in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl I Ar interval
Refresh the
.Nm
display every
.Ar interval
microseconds.
Adding a suffix of
.Cm s , ms ,
or
.Cm us
(the default) indicates that the update interval is specified in
seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds, respectively.
.It Fl o
Enable display of statistics for other operations
.Pq Dv BIO_FLUSH .
.It Fl p
Only display physical providers (those with rank of 1).
.It Fl s
Enable blocks' size statistics.
.El
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
These commands are currently recognized if
.Nm
is not running in batch mode:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic <
Halve the update interval.
.It Ic >
Double the update interval.
.It Ic c
Toggle display of
.Xr geom 4
consumers.
.It Ic f
Display only devices with the names matching regular expression filter
(prompt for filter).
.It Ic F
Remove device filter.
.It Ic q
Quit
.Nm .
