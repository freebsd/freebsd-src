.Dt BLUETOOTH-CONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bluetooth-config
.Nd a script to manage config files for the bluetooth sub system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar scan
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl n Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is an interactive script to provide a frontend to the complex bluetooth sub system daemons.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent+
.It Fl d
Scan for a specific bluetooth device address.
.It Fl n
Limit scan to a specific host controller.
Hint: List all netgraph nodes with
.Ql /usr/sbin/ngctl list .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
will help finding and setting up bluetooth controllers, scan for nearby bluetooth devices in
pairing mode, lookup their names, allow mapping to friendly names in
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/hosts ,
ask for the paring PIN, instrument
.Xr hcsecd 8
to securely pair with new devices and, if the device offers HID endpoints such as mice or
keyboards, configure and restart
.Xr bthidd 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
can bring up any interface and daemon necessary for operation and, if a node is provided on
command line, will do so automatically for that interface.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/bluetooth/hosts" -compact
.It Pa /etc/bluetooth/hosts
.It Pa sysrc -n bthidd_config
.It Pa sysrc -n hcsecd_config
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
scan -n ubt0 -a 00:26:bb:7a:58:95
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
This will scan the bluetooth controller ubt0hci for a bluetooth device with the address
00:26:bb:7a:58:95, set up ubt0 if necessary and enter an interactive dialog to pair the
new device.
Since in this example a mouse is paired,
.Nm
will interact with
.Xr bthidd 8 ,
enabling it if necessary and then write an HID descriptor to its config.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
scan
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
This will scan all bluetooth controllers on the systems for bluetooth devices, prompting
to bring up controllers or daemons along the way.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in

.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
can not parse entries in
.Xr hcsecd 8
config file and thus will ask the user to manually modify existing pairing PIN entries.
.Sh THANKS TO
Lars Engels and Warren Block for suggestions, help, and testing.
