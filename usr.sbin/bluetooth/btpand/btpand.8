.Brq Fl s Ar service | Fl S Ar service
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon handles Bluetooth Personal Area Networking services
in the system.
It can operate in client mode as a Personal Area Networking User
.Pq PANU
or in server mode as Network Access Point
.Pq NAP ,
Group ad-hoc Network
.Pq GN
or PANU host.
.Nm
connects to the system via a
.Xr tap 4
virtual Ethernet device and forwards Ethernet packets to
remote Bluetooth devices using the Bluetooth Network Encapsulation
Protocol
.Pq BNEP .
.Pp
The PANU client is the device that uses either the NAP or GN
service, or can talk directly to a PANU host in a crossover
cable fashion.
.Pp
A GN host forwards Ethernet packets to each of the connected PAN
users as needed but does not provide access to any additional networks.
.Pp
The NAP service provides some of the features of an Ethernet bridge,
with the NAP host forwarding Ethernet packets between each of the
connected PAN users, and a different network
media.
.Pp
Note, the only differences between NAP and GN services as implemented by
.Nm
are in the SDP service record.
The bridging of packets by the NAP must be configured separately.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl a Ar address"
.It Fl a Ar address
In client mode, address of remote server.
May be given as BDADDR or name, in which case
.Nm
will attempt to resolve the address via the
.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3
call.
.It Fl c Ar path
In server mode, specify
.Ar path
to the
.Xr sdpd 8
control socket.
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/sdp .
.It Fl d Ar device
Restrict connections to the local
.Ar device .
May be given as BDADDR or name, in which case
.Nm
will attempt to resolve the address via the
.Xr bt_devaddr 3
call.
.Nm
will set the
.Xr tap 4
interface physical address to the BDADDR
of the Bluetooth radio.
.It Fl i Ar ifname
.Nm
uses the
.Xr tap 4
driver to create a new network interface for use.
Use this option to select a specific
.Xr tap 4
device interface which must already be created.
.It Fl l Ar limit
In server mode, limit the number of simultaneous connections.
The default limit is 7 for NAP and GN servers,
and 1 for a PANU server.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set L2CAP connection link mode.
Supported modes are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 8n -compact
.It auth
require devices to be paired.
.It encrypt
auth, plus enable encryption.
.It secure
encryption, plus change of link key.
.El
.Pp
NOT YET SUPPORTED.
Use global device settings to set authentication and encryption.
.It Fl p Ar psm
Use an alternative L2CAP Protocol/Service Multiplexer
.Pq PSM
for server mode or client mode
.Pq when not using Service Discovery .
The default PSM for BNEP is 15
.Pq 0x000f .
.It Fl s Ar service
Name of
.Ar service
to provide or connect to, the following services are recognised:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 8n -compact
.It GN
Group ad-hoc Network.
.It NAP
Network Access Point.
.It PANU
Personal Area Networking User.
.El
.It Fl S Ar service
As per
.Fl s
except that
.Nm
will not use SDP services for connection setup.
.El
.Pp
When providing networking services, the Bluetooth PAN profile says that the
.Sq Class of Device
property of the bluetooth controller SHALL include Networking capability
.Pq set bit 0x020000 .
See
.Xr hccontrol 8
for details.
.Pp
After
.Nm
has set up the client or server connection and opened the
.Xr tap 4
interface, it will create a pid file and detach.

.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl ifconfig tap1 create
.Dl btpand -a host -d mydevice -s NAP -i tap1
.Dl dhclient tap1
.Pp
Will create a connection to the NAP on
.Ar host ,
and link that to the
.Ar tap1
interface.
.Pp
.Dl btpand -d mydevice -s GN
.Pp
Will create a Group Network and register the GN service with the local
SDP server.

.Sh BUGS
There is no way to supply alternative values for the SDP record.
.Pp
There is no way to set net type or multicast address filters.
.Pp
.Nm
does not do any address routing except to directly connected
unicast addresses.
All other packets are multicast.
.Pp
As
.Nm
uses the BDADDR of the Bluetooth radio as the physical address
of the tap, only one instance can be run per radio.
.Pp
.Nm
can only provide a single service.
