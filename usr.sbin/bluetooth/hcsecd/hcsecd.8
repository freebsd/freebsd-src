.Nm hcsecd
.Nd control link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dh
.Fl f Ar configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon controls link keys and PIN code for Bluetooth devices.
It opens raw HCI socket and listens for the
.Dv Link_Key_Request
and
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
HCI events.
Once appropriate HCI event has been received, the daemon will
scan configuration file for matching entry.
The remove device BD_ADDR is used as a key.
If no matching entry was found, the default entry will be used.
If no default entry was found then it is assumed that no link key and no PIN code
exist.
For any given entry, link key takes precedence over PIN code.
If link key was not specified, it means device must generate link key from
PIN code.
If entry was found and has the link key (or PIN code) then the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
Otherwise, the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Negative_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon currently does not handle HCI
.Dv Link_Key_Notification
event and does not cache link keys created from the PIN codes.
It means that the link key only exists while connection is opened.
After the connection has been terminated, the user will have to enter PIN code
again.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify name of the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /usr/local/etc/hcsecd.conf .
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Currently there is no way to select link key or PIN code based on which local
device received the request.
Everything is based on remote device BD_ADDR.
Also might implement interface for external helpers to obtain link keys and
PIN codes.
