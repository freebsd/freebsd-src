.Nm hcsecd
.Nd control link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dh
.Fl f Ar configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon controls link keys and PIN codes for Bluetooth devices.
It opens a raw HCI socket and listens for
.Dv Link_Key_Request ,
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
and
.Dv Link_Key_Notification
HCI events.
.Pp
Once a
.Dv Link_Key_Request
or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request
HCI event is received, the daemon scans the configuration file for a
matching entry.
The remote device BD_ADDR is used as a key.
If no matching entry was found, the default entry will be used.
If no default entry was found then it is assumed that no link key and no
PIN code exists.
For any given entry, the link key takes precedence over the PIN code.
If a link key was not specified, the device must generate the link key from
the PIN code.
If an entry was found and the link key (or PIN code) exists, the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
Otherwise, the
.Dv Link_Key_Request_Negative_Reply
(or
.Dv PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply )
command will be sent back to the device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon also handles HCI
.Dv Link_Key_Notification
events and caches link keys created from the PIN codes in memory.
To preserve link keys between restarts the
.Nm
daemon dumps link keys for all entries in the
.Pa /var/db/hcsecd.keys
link keys file.
If it exists, the link keys file gets processed by the
.Nm
daemon after it processes its main configuration file.
The link keys file gets written every time the
.Nm
daemon shuts down gracefully.
It is possible to force the
.Nm
daemon to re-read its main configuration file and dump the link keys file by
sending the
.Dv HUP
signal to the
.Nm
process.
The user is expected to not modify the link keys file by hand.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify the name of the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf .
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.

.Sh BUGS
Currently there is no way to select the link key or the PIN code based on
which local device received the request.
Everything is based on the remote device BD_ADDR.
An interface for external helpers to obtain link keys and PIN codes is missing.
