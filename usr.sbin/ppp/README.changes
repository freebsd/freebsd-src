This file summarises changes made to ppp that effect
its configuration.

It does not describe new features, rather it attempts
to answer any `this used to work, why doesn't it now?'
questions.

o The `set debug' command was replaced with `set log'.
o The `set log LCP' command was split into LCP, IPCP and CCP logs.
o Syslogd is used for logging.  /etc/syslog.conf must be updated.
o LQR is disabled by default.
o Openmode is active by default.
o Users must be a member of group `network' for ppp access.  Furthermore,
  they must be `allow'ed to run ppp via the `allow' command in the
  configuration file.
  For a brief period, ppp could only be run as root.
o No diagnostic socket is created by default.  The `set server' command
  must be used.
o The diagnostic socket password must be specified *only* on the `set
  server' command line.
o When `set server' is used to re-select a diagnostic port, all existing
  diagnostic connections are dropped.
o pppd-deflate is now called deflate24.
o Filter IPs of 0.0.0.0 have a default width of 0, not 32.
o Errors in `add' and `delete' are logged as warnings rather than being
  written to the TCP/IP log.
o Any number of diagnostic prompts are allowed, and they are allowed in
  interactive mode.
o The default `device' is cuau1, then cuau0
o A password of "*" in ppp.secret causes a passwd database lookup in
  pap mode.
o The value of the CONNECT environment variable is logged in the
  utmp host field in -direct mode.
o Out-of-sequence FSM packets (IPCP/LCP/CCP) are dropped by default.
o Reconnect values are used after an LQR timeout.
o ^C works on the parent in -background mode.
o The dial/call/open command works asynchronously.  As a result, prompts
  do not lose control while dialing.
o The `display' command has been removed.  All information is available
  with the appropriate `show' command.
o Msext does not need to be enabled/disabled.  Setting the NBNS (set nbns)
  will auto enable it.  The DNS side may be enabled/disabled, and if
  enabled without a `set dns' (was `set ns') will use values from
  /etc/resolv.conf.
o Filters are now called `allow', `dial', `in' and `out'.  `set
  ifilter ...' becomes `set filter in ...' etc.
o Authname and Authkey may only be `set' in phase DEAD.
o Set encrypt is no longer necessary.  Ppp will respond to M$CHAP
  servers correctly if it's built with DES.
o Throughput statistics are enabled by default.
o `Set stopped' only has two parameters.  It's no longer possible to
  have an IPCP stopped timer.
o `Set timeout' only has one or two parameters.  Use `set lqrperiod' and
  `set {lcp,ccp,ipcp,chap,pap}retry' for the other timers.  These timeout
  values can be seen using the relevant show commands.
o `set loopback' is now `enable/disable loopback'.
o `show auto', `show loopback' and `show mtu' are all part of `show bundle'.
o `show mru' is part of `show lcp'
o `show msext' and `show vj' are part of `show ipcp'
o `show reconnect' and `show redial' are part of `show link'
o A signal 15 (TERM) will now shut down the link gracefully.
o A signal 2 (HUP) will drop all links immediately.
o Signal 30 (USR1) is now ignored.
o Add & delete commands are not necessary in ppp.linkup if they are
  `sticky routes' (ie, contain MYADDR or HISADDR).
o LINK and CARRIER logging are no longer available.
o Timer based DEBUG messages are now logged in the new TIMER log.
o Ppp can use tun devices > tun255.
o Protocol-compressed packets are accepted even if they were denied
  at LCP negotiation time.
o Passwords aren't logged when logging the ``set server'' line.
o Command line options only need enough characters to uniquely identify
  them.  -a == -auto, -dd == -ddial etc.  -interactive is also allowed.
o If you don't like seeing additional interface aliases when running in
  -auto -alias mode, add ``iface clear'' to your ppp.linkdown file -
  check the sample file.
o Ppp waits for 1 second before checking whether the device supports
  carrier.  This is controllable with ``set cd''.
o Random dial timeouts are now between 1 and 30 seconds inclusive rather
  than between 0 and 29.
o Ppp now accepts M$CHAP (as well as normal CHAP) by default.  If this
  is not required, you must ``deny chap05 chap80''.
o The ``set device'' command now expects each device to be specified as an
  argument rather than concatentating all arguments and splitting based
  on commas and spaces.
o The ``show modem'' command is deprecated and has been changed to
  ``show physical''.
o The words ``host'' and ``port'' are no longer accepted by the ``set filter''
  command.  Removing them should yield the same results as before.
o The ``set weight'' command has been deprecated.  The ``set bandwidth''
  command should now be used instead.
o The ``set autoload'' command syntax and implementation have changed as the
  old implementation was mis-designed and dysfunctional.
o Ppp now waits either the full ``set cd'' time or until carrier is detected
  before running the login script (whichever comes first).
o The -alias flag has been deprecated.  The -nat flag should be used instead.
o Unbalanced quotes in commands are now warned about and the entire command
  is ignored.
o It is now only necessary to escape the `-' character in chat scripts twice.
  See the example files for details.
o Environment variables and ~ are expanded on in commands
o ``nat pptp'' is no longer necessary as this is now done transparently
o The ``!'' at the start of chat scripts and authkey can be made literal
  (rather than meaning execute) by doubling it to ``!!''.
o MP autoload throughput measurements are now based on the maximum of input
  and output averages rather than on the total.
o When only one link is open in MP mode, MP link level compression is not
  open and the peer MRU >= the peer MRRU, ppp sends outbound traffic as
  PROTO_IP traffic rather than PROTO_MP.
o MSCHAPv2 is now accepted by default.  If you don't wish to negotiate
  this, you must explicitly deny it.
o MPPE is enabled and accepted by default (although deflate and predictor1
  are preferred.
