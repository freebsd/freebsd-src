pw is a command-line driven passwd/group editor utility that provides
an easy and safe means of modifying of any/all fields in the system
password files, and has an add, modify and delete mode for user and
group records. Command line options have been fashioned to be similar
to those used by the Sun/shadow commands: useradd, usermod, userdel,
groupadd, groupmod, groupdel, but combines all operations within the
single command `pw'.

User add mode also provides a means of easily setting system useradd
defaults (see pw.conf.5), so that adding a user is as easy as issuing
the command "pw useradd <loginid>". Creation of a unique primary
group for each user and automatic membership in secondary groups
is fully supported.

This program may be FreeBSD specific, but should be trivial to port to
other bsd4.4 variants.
