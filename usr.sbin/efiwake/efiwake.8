.Nd manipulate the EFI wake timer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Nm
.Fl d
.Nm
.Fl e Ar yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reports the current value of, disables or enables the EFI wake timer that can
wake your machine from S3 sleep at a given time.
.Pp
If invoked without arguments, the current EFI time and the current value of the
wake timer will be printed, followed by an
.Em enabled
status and a
.Em pending
status.
EFI time is supposed to be in UTC.
Note that it can be out of sync with kernel time.
The pending status tells whether the wake timer fired recently; it is cleared
upon reading.
.Pp
If invoked with the
.Sy -d
option, the wake timer is reset and disabled.
.Pp
If invoked with the
.Sy -e
option, the wake timer is set to the given time and date.
If the date or time is invalid, an error is returned.
.Pp
The current EFI time is always printed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Without arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# efiwake
Current EFI time: 2023-05-04T15:30:45
EFI wake time: 2023-05-04T10:00:00; enabled=0, pending=1
.Ed
.Pp
Disabling and resetting the wake timer:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# efiwake -d
Current EFI time: 2023-05-04T15:32:16
EFI wake time: 2023-05-04T15:32:16; enabled=0, pending=0
.Ed
.Pp
Enabling the wake timer with a valid date:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# efiwake -e 2023-05-04T15:35:00
Current EFI time: 2023-05-04T15:34:05
EFI wake time: 2023-05-04T15:35:00; enabled=1, pending=0
.Ed
.Pp
Trying to enable with an invalid date (there is no 31st of April):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# efiwake -e 2023-04-31T15:35:00
Current EFI time: 2023-05-04T15:35:25
efiwake: cannot enable EFI wake time: Invalid argument

The quality of EFI implementations differs widely.
Corruption of the wake-up date has been observed on real hardware.
