.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm apm
.Nd control the APM BIOS and display its information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ablstzZ
.Op Fl d Ar enable
.Op Fl e Ar enable
.Op Fl h Ar enable
.Op Fl r Ar delta
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
controls the Intel / Microsoft APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS and
displays the current status of APM on laptop PCs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display the current AC-line status as an integer value.
The values
0, 1 and 2 correspond to the
.Dq off-line
state,
.Dq on-line
state or
.Dq backup power
state, respectively.
.It Fl b
Display an integer value reflecting the current battery status.
The values 0, 1, 2, 3, correspond to the
.Dq high
status,
.Dq low
status,
.Dq critical
status,
.Dq charging
status respectively.
.It Fl d Ar enable
Disable/enable suspending of the display separately from a normal suspend
using the boolean value for
.Ar enable .
This feature seems to not work on many different laptops,
including the Libretto 30CT and 50CT.
.It Fl e Ar enable
Enable or disable APM functions of the computer,
depending on the boolean
.Ar enable
argument.
.It Fl h Ar enable
Depending on the boolean value of
.Ar enable ,
enable or disable the HLT instruction in the kernel context switch routine.
These options are not necessary for almost all APM implementations,
but for some implementations whose
.Dq Pa Idle CPU
call executes both CPU clock slowdown and HLT instruction,
.Fl h Cm false
is necessary to prevent the system from reducing its peak performance.
See
.Xr apm 4
for details.
.It Fl l
Display the remaining battery percentage.
If your laptop does not
support this function, 255 is displayed.
.It Fl r Ar delta
Enable the resume wakeup timer, if the laptop supports it.
This
does not actually suspend the laptop, but if the laptop is suspended,
and it supports resume from suspend, then it will be resumed after
.Ar delta
seconds (from when you run this command, not from when you suspend).
.It Fl s
Display the status of the APM support as an integer value.
The values
0 and 1 correspond to the
.Dq disabled
state or
.Dq enabled
state respectively.
.It Fl t
Display the estimated remaining battery lifetime in seconds.
If
it is unknown, -1 is displayed.
.It Fl Z
Transition the system into standby mode.
This mode uses less power than
full power mode, but more than suspend mode.
Some laptops support
resuming from this state on timer or Ring Indicator events.
The
output of
.Nm
tells what your laptop claims to support.
.It Fl z
Suspend the system.
It is used by
.Xr zzz 8 .
.El
.Pp
If no options are specified,
.Nm
displays information and current status of APM in verbose mode.
If multiple display options are given, the values are displayed one
per line in the order given here.
.Sh NOTES
.Xr apmconf 8
has been merged in
.Nm
and thus
.Nm
replaces all of its functionality.

.Sh BUGS
Some APM implementations do not support parameters needed by
.Nm .
On such systems,
.Nm
displays them as unknown.
.Pp
Some APM implementations cannot handle events such as pushing the
power button or closing the cover.
On such implementations, the system
.Ar must
be suspended
.Ar only
by using
.Nm
or
.Nm zzz .
