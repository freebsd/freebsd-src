.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides support for the server side of the kernel Sun RPC over TLS
implementation.
This daemon must be running to allow the kernel RPC to perform the TLS
handshake after a TCP client has sent the STARTTLS Null RPC request to
the server.
This daemon requires that the kernel be built with
.Dq options KERNEL_TLS
and be running on an architecture such as
.Dq amd64
that supports a direct map (not i386) with
.Xr ktls 4
enabled.
Note that the
.Fl tls
option in the
.Xr exports 5
file specifies that the client must use RPC over TLS.
The
.Fl tlscert
option in the
.Xr exports 5
file specifies that the client must provide a certificate
that verifies.
The
.Fl tlscertuser
option in the
.Xr exports 5
file specifies that the client must provide a certificate
that verifies and has a otherName:1.3.6.1.4.1.2238.1.1.1;UTF8: field of
subjectAltName of the form
.Dq user@domain
where
.Dq domain
matches the one for this server and
.Dq user
is a valid user name that maps to a <uid, gid_list>.
For the latter two cases, the
.Fl m
and either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
options must be specified.
The
.Fl tlscertuser
option also requires that the
.Fl u
option on this daemon be specified.
.Pp
Also, if the IP address used by the client cannot be trusted,
the rules in
.Xr exports 5
cannot be applied safely.
As such, the
.Fl h
option can be used along with
.Fl m
and either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
options to require that the client certificate have the correct
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in it.
.Pp
A certificate and associated key must exist in /etc/rpc.tlsservd
(or the
.Dq certdir
specified by the
.Fl D
option)
in files named
.Dq cert.pem
and
.Dq certkey.pem .
.Pp
If a SIGHUP signal is sent to the daemon it will reload the
.Dq CRLfile
and will shut down any extant connections that presented certificates
during TLS handshake that have been revoked.
If the
.Fl r
option was not specified, the SIGHUP signal will be ignored.
.Pp
The daemon will log failed certificate verifications via
.Xr syslogd 8
using LOG_INFO | LOG_DAEMON when the
.Fl m
option has been specified.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 2 , Fl Fl allowtls1_2
Permit clients to mount using TLS version 1.2.
By default, the daemon will only allow mounts
using TLS version 1.3, as required by the RFC.
However, early
.Fx
.Pq 13.0 and 13.1
clients require
this option, since they use TLS version 1.2.
.It Fl C Ar available_ciphers , Fl Fl ciphers= Ns Ar available_ciphers
Specify which ciphers are available during TLS handshake.
If this option is specified,
.Dq SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites()
will be called with
.Dq available_ciphers
as the argument.
If this option is not specified, the cipher will be chosen by
.Xr ssl 7 ,
which should be adequate for most cases.
The format for the available ciphers is a simple
.So
:
.Sc
separated list, in order of preference.
The command
.Dq openssl ciphers -s -tls1_3
lists available ciphers.
.It Fl D Ar certdir , Fl Fl certdir= Ns Ar certdir
Use
.Dq certdir
instead of /etc/rpc.tlsservd as the location for the
certificate in a file called
.Dq cert.pem
and associated key in
.Dq certkey.pem .
.It Fl d , Fl Fl debuglevel
Run in debug mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will not fork when it starts.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl checkhost
This option specifies that the client must provide a certificate
that both verifies and has a FQDN that matches the reverse
DNS name for the IP address that
the client uses to connect to the server.
The FQDN should be
in the DNS field of the subjectAltName, but is also allowed
to be in the CN field of the
subjectName in the certificate.
By default, a wildcard "*" in the FQDN is not allowed.
With this option, a failure to verify the client certificate
or match the FQDN will result in the
server sending AUTH_REJECTEDCRED replies to all client RPCs.
This option requires the
.Fl m
and either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
options.
.It Fl l Ar CAfile , Fl Fl verifylocs= Ns Ar CAfile
This option specifies the path name of a CA certificate(s) file
in pem format, which is used to verify client certificates and to
set the list of CA(s) sent to the client so that it knows which
certificate to send to the server during the TLS handshake.
This path name is used in
.Dq SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx,CAfile,NULL)
and
.Dq SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file(CAfile))
openssl library calls.
Note that this is a path name for the file and is not assumed to be
in
.Dq certdir .
Either this option or the
.Fl p
option must be specified when the
.Fl m
option is specified so that the daemon can verify the client's
certificate.
.It Fl m , Fl Fl mutualverf
This option specifies that the server is to request a certificate
from the client during the TLS handshake.
It does not require that the client provide a certificate.
It should be specified unless no client doing RPC over TLS is
required to have a certificate.
For NFS, either the
.Xr exports 5
option
.Fl tlscert
or
.Fl tlscertuser
may be used to require a client to provide a certificate
that verifies.
See
.Xr exports 5 .
.It Fl N Ar max_threads , Fl Fl maxthreads= Ns Ar max_threads
For a server with a large number of NFS-over-TLS client mounts,
this daemon might get overloaded after a reboot, when many
clients attempt to do a TLS handshake at the same time.
To speed up recovery after reboot, the daemon always processes a TLS handshake
in a separate spawned thread.
By default the maximum number of concurrent threads (and thus
parallel handshakes) is limited to
.Va 1/2
of available CPUs on a system.
This option may be used to override this default.
.It Fl n Ar domain , Fl Fl domain= Ns Ar domain
This option specifies what the
.Dq domain
is for use with the
.Fl u
option, overriding the domain taken from the
.Xr gethostname 2
of the server this daemon is running on.
If you have specified the
.Fl domain
command line option for
.Xr nfsuserd 8
then you should specify this option with the same
.Dq domain
that was specified for
.Xr nfsuserd 8 .
This option is only meaningful when used with the
.Fl u
option.
.It Fl p Ar CApath , Fl Fl verifydir= Ns Ar CApath
This option is similar to the
.Fl l
option, but specifies the path of a directory with CA
certificates in it.
When this option is used,
.Dq SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file())
is not called, so a list of CA names might not be passed
to the client during the TLS handshake.
.It Fl r Ar CRLfile , Fl Fl crl= Ns Ar CRLfile
This option specifies a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) file
that is to be loaded into the verify certificate store and
checked during verification.
This option is only meaningful when either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
have been specified.
.It Fl u , Fl Fl certuser
This option specifies that if the client provides a certificate
that both verifies and has a subjectAltName with an otherName
component of the form
.Dq otherName:1.3.6.1.4.1.2238.1.1.1;UTF8:user@domain
where
.Dq domain
matches the one for this server,
then the daemon will attempt to map
.Dq user
in the above
to a user credential <uid, gid_list>.
There should only be one of these otherName components for each
.Dq domain .
If
.Dq user
is a valid username in the password database,
then the <uid, gid_list> for
.Dq user
will be used for all
RPCs on the mount instead of the credentials in the RPC request
header.
This option requires the
.Fl m
and either the
.Fl l
or
.Fl p
options.
Use of this option might not conform to RFC-9289, which does
not allow certificates to be used for user authentication.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Run in verbose mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will log activity messages to
.Xr syslogd 8
using LOG_INFO | LOG_DAEMON or to
stderr, if the
.Fl d
option has also been specified.
.It Fl W , Fl Fl multiwild
This option is used with the
.Fl h
option to allow use of a wildcard
.Dq *
that matches multiple
components of the reverse DNS name for the client's IP
address.
For example, the FQDN
.Dq *.uoguelph.ca
would match both
.Dq laptop21.uoguelph.ca
and
.Dq laptop3.cis.uoguelph.ca .
.It Fl w , Fl Fl singlewild
Similar to
.Fl W
but allows the wildcard
.Dq *
to match a single component of the reverse DNS name.
For example, the FQDN
.Dq *.uoguelph.ca
would match
.Dq laptop21.uoguelph.ca
but not
.Dq laptop3.cis.uoguelph.ca .
Only one of the
.Fl W
and
.Fl w
options is allowed.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in
.Fx 13.0 .
.Sh BUGS
This daemon cannot be safely shut down and restarted if there are
any active RPC-over-TLS connections.
Doing so will orphan the KERNEL_TLS connections, so that they
can no longer do upcalls successfully, since the
.Dq SSL *
structures in userspace have been lost.
