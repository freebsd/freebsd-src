.Dt CHGRP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chgrp
.Nd change group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fhvx
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar group
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sets the group ID of the file named by each
.Ar file
operand to the
.Ar group
ID specified by the group operand.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed
and hence unaffected by the command.
(Symbolic links encountered during traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl R
Change the group ID of the file hierarchies rooted in the files,
instead of just the files themselves.
Beware of unintentionally matching the
.Dq Pa ".."
hard link to the parent directory when using wildcards like
.Dq Li ".*" .
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and does not
query about strange modes (unless the user does not have proper permissions).
.It Fl h
If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself is changed
rather than the file that is pointed to.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm
to be verbose, showing files as the group is modified.
If the
.Fl v
flag is specified more than once,
.Nm
will print the filename, followed by the old and new numeric group ID.
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the super-user.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
signal (see the
.Cm status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 ) ,
then the current filename as well as the old and new group names are
displayed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/group -compact
.It Pa /etc/group
group ID file
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
In previous versions of this system, symbolic links did not have groups.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
and
.Fl x
options are non-standard and their use in scripts is not recommended.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr symlink 7 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
