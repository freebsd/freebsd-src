.Sh NAME
.Nm chgrp
.Nd change group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chgrp
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl h
.Ar group
.Ar files ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sets the group ID of the file named by each
.Ar file
operand to the
.Ar group
ID specified by the group operand.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed).
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and doesn't
query about strange modes (unless the user does not have proper permissions).
.It Fl h
If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself is changed
rather than the file that is pointed to.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the super-user.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
In previous versions of this system, symbolic links did not have groups.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/group -compact
.It Pa /etc/group
Group ID file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr symlink 7 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
