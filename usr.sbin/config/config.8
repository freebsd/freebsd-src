.Sh NAME
.Nm config
.Nd build system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm config
.Op Fl gp
.Ar SYSTEM_NAME
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm Config
builds a set of system configuration files from the file
.Ar SYSTEM_NAME
which describes
the system to configure.
A second file
tells
.Nm config
what files are needed to generate a system and
can be augmented by configuration specific set of files
that give alternate files for a specific machine.
(see the
.Sx FILES
section below)
.Pp
Available option and operand:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width SYSTEM_NAME
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is supplied, 
.Nm config
will configure a system for debugging.
.It Fl p
If the
.Fl p
option is supplied, 
.Nm config
will configure a system for profiling; for example,
.Xr kgmon 8
and
.Xr gprof 1 .

.It Ar SYSTEM_NAME
specifies the name of the system configuration file
containing device specifications, configuration options
and other system parameters for one system configuration.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Config
should be run from the
.Pa conf
subdirectory of the system source (usually
.Pa /sys/ARCH/conf ) .
.Nm Config
assumes the directory
.Pa ../../compile/SYSTEM_NAME
exists and places all output files there.  
The output of
.Nm config
consists of a number of files; for the
.Tn i386 ,
they are:
.Pa ioconf.c ,
a description
of what I/O devices are attached to the system;
.Pa vector.s ,
a set of interrupt service routines for devices
attached to the bus plus
offsets into a structure used for counting per-device interrupts;
.Pa Makefile ,
used by
.Xr make 1
in building the system;
header files,
definitions of
the number of various devices that will be compiled into the system;
swap configuration files,
definitions for
the disk areas to be used for swapping, the root file system,
argument processing, and system dumps.
.Pp
After running
.Nm config ,
it is necessary to run
.Dq Li make depend
in the directory where the new makefile
was created.
.Nm Config
prints a reminder of this when it completes.
.Pp
If any other error messages are produced by
.Nm config ,
the problems in the configuration file should be corrected and
.Nm config
should be run again.
Attempts to compile a system that had configuration errors
are likely to fail.
