.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command controls the operation of Aironet wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr an 4
driver.
Most of the parameters that can be changed relate to the
IEEE 802.11 protocol which the Aironet cards implement.
This includes
the station name, whether the station is operating in ad-hoc (point
to point) or infrastructure mode, and the network name of a service
set to join.
The
.Nm
command can also be used to view the current NIC status, configuration
and to dump out the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar iface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the Aironet
device (an0, an1, etc...). If one isn't specified the device an0 will
be assumed.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl A
Display the prefered access point list.
The AP list can be used by
stations to specify the MAC address of access points with which it
wishes to associate.
If no AP list is specified (the default) then
the station will associate with the first access point that it finds
which serves the SSID(s) specified in the SSID list.
The AP list can
be modified with the
.Fl a
option.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl N
Display the SSID list.
This is a list of service set IDs (i.e. network names)
with which the station wishes to associate.
There may be up to three SSIDs
in the list: the station will go through the list in ascending order and
associate with the first matching SSID that it finds.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl S
Display NIC status information.
This includes the current operating
status, current BSSID, SSID, channel, beacon period and currently
associated access point.
The operating mode indicates the state of
the NIC, MAC status and receiver status.
When the "synced" keyword
appears, it means the NIC has successfully associated with an access
point, associated with an ad-hoc "master" station, or become a "master"
itself.
The beacon period can be anything between 20 and 976 milliseconds.
The default is 100.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl I
Display NIC capability information.
This shows the device type,
frequency, speed and power level capablities and firmware revision levels.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl T
Display the NIC's internal statistics counters.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl C
Display current NIC configuration.
This shows the current operation mode,
receive mode, MAC address, power save settings, various timing settings,
channel selection, diversity, transmit power and transmit speed.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl t Ar 0|1|2|3|4
Select transmit speed.
The available settings are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "TX rate " "NIC speed "
.Em "TX rate	NIC speed"
0	Auto -- NIC selects optimal speed
1	1Mbps fixed
2	2Mbps fixed
3	5.5Mbps fixed
4	11Mbps fixed
.El
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the 5.5 and 11Mbps settings are only supported on the 4800
series adapters: the 4500 series adapters have a maximum speed of 2Mbps.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl s Ar 0|1|2|3
Set power save mode.
Valid selections are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "Selection " "Power save mode "
.Em "Selection	Power save mode"
0	None - power save disabled
1	Constantly awake mode (CAM)
2	Power Save Polling (PSP)
3	Fast Power Save Polling (PSP-CAM)
.El
.Ed
.Pp
Note that for IBSS (ad-hoc) mode, only PSP mode is supported, and only
if the ATIM window is non-zero.
.It Fl i Ar iface "[-v 1|2|3|4]" Fl a Ar AP 
Set prefered access point.
The
.Ar AP
is specified as a MAC address consisting of 6 hexadecimal values
separated by colons.
By default, the
.Fl a
option only sets the first entry in the AP list.
The
.Fl v
modifier can be used to specify exactly which AP list entry is to be
modified.
If the
.Fl v
flag is not used, the first AP list entry will be changed.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl b Ar beacon period
Set the ad-hoc mode beacon period.
The becon period is specified in
milliseconds.
The default is 100ms.
.It Fl i Ar iface "-v 0|1" Fl d Ar 0|1|2|3 
Select the antenna diversity.
Aironet devices can be configured with up
to two antennas, and transmit and receive diversity can be configured
accordingly.
Valid selections are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "Selection " "Diversity "
.Em "Selection	Diversity"
0	Select factory default diversity
1	Antenna 1 only
2	Antenna 2 only
3	Antenna 1 and 2
.El
.Ed
.Pp
The receive and transmit diversity can be set independently.
The user
must specify which diversity setting is to be modified by using the
.Fl v
option: selection
.Ar 0
sets the receive diversity and
.Ar 1
sets the transmit diversity.
.It Fl i Ar iface "[ -v 0|1 ]" Fl k Ar key
Set the WEP key.  For 40 bit prefix 10 hex character with 0x.
For 128 bit prefix 26 hex character with 0x.
Supports 4 keys, use even numbers are permanet and odd number 
are temporary keys for example "-v 1" sets the first temporary key.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl K Ar 0|1|2|4
Set authorization type. Use 0 for none, 1 for "Open", 
2 for "Shared Key", 4 for "Exclude unencrypted".
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl W Ar 0|1
Enable WEP. Use 1 to enable, 0 for disable.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl j Ar netjoin timeout
Set the ad-hoc network join timeout.
When a station is first activated
in ad-hoc mode, it will search out a 'master' station with the desired
SSID and associate with it.
If the station is unable to locate another
station with the same SSID after a suitable timeout, it sets itself up
as the 'master' so that other stations may associate with it.
This
timeout defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) but may be changed
with this option.
The timeout should be specified in milliseconds.
.It i Ar iface Fl l Ar station name
Set the station name used internally by the NIC.
The
.Ar station name
can be any text string up to 16 characters in length.
The default name
is set by the driver to "FreeBSD."
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl m Ar mac address
Set the station address for the specified interface.
The
.Ar mac address
is specified as a series of six hexadecimal values separated by colons,
e.g.: 00:60:1d:12:34:56.
This programs the new address into the card
and updates the interface as well.
.It Fl i Ar iface "[-v 1|2|3]" Fl n Ar SSID 
Set the desired SSID (network name). There are three SSIDs which allows
the NIC to work with access points at several locations without needing
to be reconfigured.
The NIC checks each SSID in sequence when searching
for a match.
The SSID to be changed can be specified with the
.Fl v
modifier option.
If the
.Fl v
flag isn't used, the first SSID in the list is set.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl o Ar 0|1
Set the operating mode of the Aironet interface.
Valid selections are
.Ar 0
for ad-hoc mode and
.Ar 1
for infrastructure mode.
The default driver setting is for ad-hoc
mode.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl p Ar tx power
Set the transmit power level in milliwatts.
Valid power settings
vary depending on the actual NIC and can be viewed by dumping the
device capabilities with the
.Fl I
flag.
Typical values are 1, 5, 20, 50 and 100mW.
Selecting 0 sets
the factory default.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl c Ar channel
Set the radio frequency of a given interface.
The
.Ar frequency
should be specfied as a channel ID as shown in the table below.
The
list of available frequencies is dependent on radio regulations specified
by regional authorities.
Recognized regulatory authorities include
the FCC (United States), ETSI (Europe), France and Japan.
Frequencies
in the table are specified in Mhz.

If an illegal channel is specified, the
NIC will revert to its default channel.
For NICs sold in the United States
and Europe, the default channel is 3. For NICs sold in France, the default
channel is 11.
For NICs sold in Japan, the only available channel is 14.
Note that two stations must be set to the same channel in order to
communicate.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl f Ar fragmentation threshold
Set the fragmentation threshold in bytes.
This threshold controls the
point at which outgoing packets will be split into multiple fragments.
If a single fragment is not sent successfully, only that fragment will
need to be retransmitted instead of the whole packet.
The fragmentation
threshold can be anything from 64 to 2312 bytes.
The default is 2312.
.It Fl i Ar iface Fl r Ar RTS threshold
Set the RTS/CTS threshold for a given interface.
This controls the
number of bytes used for the RTS/CTS handhake boundary.
The
.Ar RTS threshold
can be any value between 0 and 2312.
The default is 2312.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The statistics counters do not seem to show the amount of transmit
and received frames as increasing.
This is likely due to the fact that
the
.Xr an 4
driver uses unmodified packet mode instead of letting the NIC perform
802.11/ethernet encapsulation itself.
.Pp
Setting the channel does not seem to have any effect.
