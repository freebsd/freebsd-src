.Sh NAME
.Nm crunchide
.Nd hides symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar keep-list-file
.Op Fl k Ar keep-symbol
.Op Ar object-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility hides the global symbols of
.Ar object-file
such that they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker,
.Xr ld 1 .
Some symbols may be left visible via the
.Fl k Ar keep-symbol
and
.Fl f Ar keep-list-file
options.
The
.Ar keep-list-file
must contain a list of symbols to keep visible, one symbol per line.
The names given by
.Ar keep-symbol
or in
.Ar keep-list-file
should be C names.
For example,
to keep the C function
.Dq foo
visible, the option
.Dq -k foo
should be used.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is designed as a companion program for
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
which automates the process of creating crunched binaries from
multiple component programs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
.Xr ld 1
