.Op Fl h Ar height
.Op Fl r Ar resolution

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides shell level access to the ioctl
requests served by the handy scanner device driver gsc.
Please see
.Xr gsc 4
for the exact meaning of the requests.  Generally they modify
the output and behaviour of the gsc scanner device.
When
.Nm
is called with no option only the current settings are reported.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Ar [GSC_SRESSW]
Set the scanner with the values of the resolution selector switch.
.It Fl q
Operate in quiet mode, i.e. do not report any of the current settings.
Normally the parameters are shown after the modifications have been
performed.
.It Fl f Ar file
Operate on a different scanner device node given by filename.
Note
that even though there may exist more than one node of scanner device
several of them will refer the same device unit.
The modifications are
performed od the unit regardless of the device node by which it is
accessed.
.It Fl r Ar resolution [GSC_SRES]
Set the resolution in dpi.
.It Fl w Ar width [GSC_SWIDHT]
Set the width of the bitmap in pixels.
.It Fl h Ar height [GSC_SHEIGHT]
