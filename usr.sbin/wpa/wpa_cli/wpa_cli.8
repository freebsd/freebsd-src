.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is a text-based frontend program for interacting with
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 .
It is used to query current status,
change configuration,
trigger events,
and
request interactive user input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
can show the
current authentication status,
selected security
mode, dot11 and dot1x MIBs, etc.
In addition,
.Nm
can configure EAPOL state machine
parameters and trigger events such as reassociation
and IEEE 802.1X logoff/logon.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
provides an interface to supply authentication information
such as username and password when it is not provided in the
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
configuration file.
This can be used, for example, to implement
one-time passwords or generic token card
authentication where the authentication is based on a
challenge-response that uses an external device for generating the
response.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
supports two modes: interactive and command line.
Both modes share the same command set and the main difference
is in interactive mode providing access to unsolicited messages
(event messages, username/password requests).
.Pp
Interactive mode is started when
.Nm
is executed without any parameters on the command line.
Commands are then entered from the controlling terminal in
response to the
.Nm
prompt.
In command line mode, the same commands are
entered as command line arguments.
.Pp
The control interface of
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
can be configured to allow
non-root user access by using the
.Va ctrl_interface_group
parameter
in the
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
configuration file.
This makes it possible to run
.Nm
with a normal user account.
.Sh AUTHENTICATION PARAMETERS
When
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
needs authentication parameters, such as username and password,
that are not present in the configuration file, it sends a
request message to all attached frontend programs, e.g.,
.Nm
in interactive mode.
The
.Nm
utility
shows these requests with a
.Dq Li CTRL-REQ- Ns Ao Ar type Ac Ns Li - Ns Ao Ar id Ac : Ns Aq Ar text
prefix, where
.Aq Ar type
is
.Li IDENTITY , PASSWORD ,
or
.Li OTP
(One-Time Password),
.Aq Ar id
is a unique identifier for the current network,
.Aq Ar text
is a description of the request.
In the case of an
.Li OTP
(One-Time Password) request,
it includes the challenge from the authentication server.
.Pp
A user must supply
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
the needed parameters in response to these requests.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CTRL-REQ-PASSWORD-1:Password needed for SSID foobar
> password 1 mysecretpassword

Example request for generic token card challenge-response:

CTRL-REQ-OTP-2:Challenge 1235663 needed for SSID foobar
> otp 2 9876
.Ed
.Sh OPTIONS
These options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p Ar path
Control sockets path.
This should match the
.Ic ctrl_interface
in
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5 .
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/wpa_supplicant .
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Interface to be configured.
By default, the first interface found in the socket path is used.
.It Fl h
Show help.
.It Fl v
Show version information.
.It Fl B
Run the daemon in the background.
.It Fl a Ar action_file
Run in daemon mode, executing the action file based on events from
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 .
.It Fl P Ar pid_file
PID file location.
.It Fl g Ar global_ctrl
Use a global control interface to
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
rather than the default Unix domain sockets.
.It Fl G Ar ping_interval
Wait
.Dq ping_interval
seconds before sending each ping to
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 .
See the
.Ic ping
command.
.It command
See available commands in the next section.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
These commands can be supplied on the command line
or at a prompt when operating interactively.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic status
Report the current WPA/EAPOL/EAP status for the current interface.
.It Ic ifname
Show the current interface name.
The default interface is the first interface found in the socket path.
.It Ic ping
Ping the
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
utility.
This command can be used to test the status of the
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
daemon.
.It Ic mib
Report MIB variables (dot1x, dot11) for the current interface.
.It Ic help
Show usage help.
.It Ic interface Op Ar ifname
Show available interfaces and/or set the current interface
when multiple interfaces are available.
.It Ic level Ar debug_level
Change the debugging level in
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8 .
Larger numbers generate more messages.
