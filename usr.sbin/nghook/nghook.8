node
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl n
.Ar path
.Op Ar hookname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a
.Xr ng_socket 4
socket type node and connects it to hook
.Ar hookname
of the node found at
.Ar path .
If
.Ar hookname
is omitted,
.Dq debug
is assumed.
.Pp
At this point all data written to standard input is sent
to the node and all data received from the node is relayed
to standard output.
.Nm
exits when
.Dv EOF
is detected on standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Output each packet read in human-readable decoded
.Tn ASCII
form instead of raw binary.
.It Fl d
Increase the debugging verbosity level.
.It Fl l
Loops all received data back to the hook in addition to writing it
to standard output.
.It Fl n
Don't attempt to read any data from standard input.
.Nm
will continue reading from the node until stopped by a signal.

.Sh BUGS
Although all input is read in unbuffered mode, 
there's no way to control the packetization of the input.
