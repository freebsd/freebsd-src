</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>erase</STRONG> and <STRONG>werase</STRONG> routines copy blanks to  every  posi-
       tion in the window, clearing the screen.

       The  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>  and <STRONG>wclear</STRONG> routines are like <STRONG>erase</STRONG> and <STRONG>werase</STRONG>,
       but they also call <STRONG>clearok</STRONG>, so that the screen is  cleared
       completely  on  the  next call to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> for that window
       and repainted from scratch.

       The <STRONG>clrtobot</STRONG> and <STRONG>wclrtobot</STRONG> routines erase from the  cursor
       to the end of screen.  That is, they erase all lines below
       the cursor in the window.  Also, the current line  to  the
       right of the cursor, inclusive, is erased.

       The <STRONG>clrtoeol</STRONG> and <STRONG>wclrtoeol</STRONG> routines erase the current line
       to the right of the cursor, inclusive, to the end  of  the
       current line.

       Blanks created by erasure have the current background ren-
       dition (as set by <STRONG>wbkgdset</STRONG>) merged into them.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All routines return the integer <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success and  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  on
       failure.   The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-negative inte-
       ger if <STRONG>immedok</STRONG> is set", but this appears to be an error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In  this  implementa-
       tion, functions using a window pointer parameter return an
       error if it is null.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>erase</STRONG>, <STRONG>werase</STRONG>, <STRONG>clear</STRONG>, <STRONG>wclear</STRONG>, <STRONG>clrtobot</STRONG>, and <STRONG>clr-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>toeol</STRONG> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
       Issue 4.  The standard specifies that they return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  on
       failure, but specifies no error conditions.

       Some  historic  curses  implementations had, as an undocu-
       mented feature,  the  ability  to  do  the  equivalent  of
       <STRONG>clearok(...,</STRONG>  <STRONG>1)</STRONG>  by saying <STRONG>touchwin(stdscr)</STRONG> or <STRONG>clear(std-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>scr)</STRONG>.  This will not work under ncurses.

       This implementation, and others such as Solaris, sets  the
       current  position  to  0,0  after erasing via <STRONG>werase()</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>wclear()</STRONG>.  That fact is not documented in other  implemen-
       tations, and may not be true of implementations which were
       not derived from SVr4 source.

       Not obvious from  the  description,  most  implementations
       clear  the screen after <STRONG>wclear</STRONG> even for a subwindow or de-
       rived window.  If you do not want to clear the screen dur-
       ing the next <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>, use <STRONG>werase</STRONG> instead.
