</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>form_win</STRONG>  - make and break form window and subwindow asso-
       ciations


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG>
       int set_form_win(FORM *form, WINDOW *win);
       WINDOW *form_win(const FORM *form);
       int set_form_sub(FORM *form, WINDOW *sub);
       WINDOW *form_sub(const FORM *form);
       int scale_form(const FORM *form, int *rows, int *columns);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Every form has an associated pair of <STRONG>curses</STRONG> windows.   The
       form  window displays any title and border associated with
       the window; the form subwindow displays the items  of  the
       form that are currently available for selection.

       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is
       not necessary to set either window; by default, the driver
       code uses <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> for both.

       In  the <STRONG>set_</STRONG> functions, window argument of <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> is treated
       as though it were <STRONG>stsdcr</STRONG>.  A  form  argument  of  <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>  is
       treated  as  a  request  to change the system default form
       window or subwindow.

       The function <STRONG>scale_form</STRONG> returns the minimum size  required
       for the subwindow of <EM>form</EM>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines  that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.  Rou-
       tines that return an integer return one of  the  following
       error codes:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine  detected  an incorrect or out-of-range argu-
            ment.

       <STRONG>E_POSTED</STRONG>
            The form has already been posted.

       <STRONG>E_NOT_CONNECTED</STRONG>
            No items are connected to the form.

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>

       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
