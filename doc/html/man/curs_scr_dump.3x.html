<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG>, <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>, <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>, <STRONG>scr_set</STRONG> - read (write) a
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG> screen from (to) a file


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_dump(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_restore(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_init(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scr_set(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*filename);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG> routine dumps the  current  contents  of  the
       virtual screen to the file <EM>filename</EM>.

       The  <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>  routine  sets  the virtual screen to the
       contents of <EM>filename</EM>, which must have been  written  using
       <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG>.   The  next call to <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> restores the screen
       to the way it looked in the dump file.

       The <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG> routine reads in the contents of <EM>filename</EM> and
       uses  them  to initialize the <STRONG>curses</STRONG> data structures about
       what the terminal currently has on its screen.  If the da-
       ta is determined to be valid, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> bases its next update
       of the screen on this information rather than clearing the
       screen  and starting from scratch.  <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG> is used after
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or a <STRONG>system</STRONG> call to share the screen with  another
       process  which  has done a <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG> after its <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> call.
       The data is declared invalid if the terminfo  capabilities
       <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG> and <STRONG>nrrmc</STRONG> exist; also if the terminal has been writ-
       ten to since the preceding <STRONG>scr_dump</STRONG> call.

       The <STRONG>scr_set</STRONG> routine is a combination  of  <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>.   It  tells  the program that the information in
       <EM>filename</EM> is what is currently on the screen, and also what
       the  program  wants on the screen.  This can be thought of
       as a screen inheritance function.

       To read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the  <STRONG>getwin</STRONG>
       and <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routines [see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">curs_util(3x)</A></STRONG>].


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All  routines  return  the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG>
       upon success.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In  this  implementa-
       tion,  each  will  return  an  error if the file cannot be
       opened.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>,  <STRONG>scr_set</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>scr_restore</STRONG>  may  be
       macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  XSI  Curses  standard, Issue 4, describes these func-
       tions (adding the const qualifiers).

       The SVr4 docs merely say under <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG> that the dump data
       is  also  considered invalid "if the time-stamp of the tty
       is old" but do not define "old".
