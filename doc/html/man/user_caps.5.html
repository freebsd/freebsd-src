</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Background">Background</a></H3><PRE>
       Prior to <EM>ncurses</EM> 5.0 (1999), <EM>terminfo</EM> databases used a <EM>fixed</EM> <EM>repertoire</EM>
       of  terminal  capabilities  designed  for the SVr2 terminal database in
       1984, added to in stages  through  SVr4  (1989),  and  standardized  in
       X/Open Curses starting in 1995.

       Most such additions to this fixed repertoire suppelmented the tables of
       Boolean,  numeric,  and  string capabilities.  Rather than changing the
       meaning of an existing capability, a new name was added.  The  <EM>terminfo</EM>
       database  uses  a  binary  format;  binary compatibility was ensured by
       using a header that counted the number of items in the tables for  each
       type  of  capability.  Because each <EM>curses</EM> vendor extended the standard
       capability lists in distinct ways, a library  could  be  programmed  to
       recognize  only  compiled  <EM>terminfo</EM>  entries  that  it  was prepared to
       interpret.  Standardization was incomplete.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses describes only the  <EM>source</EM>  format,  not  its  <EM>binary</EM>
           representation on disk.

           Library   developers  rely  upon  SVr4  documentation  and  reverse
           engineering of compiled <EM>terminfo</EM> files to match the binary format.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Lacking a standard for the binary format, most implementations copy
           the SVr2 binary format, which uses 16-bit signed integers,  and  is
           limited to 4096-byte entries.

           The  SVr2  format  cannot  represent  very large numeric capability
           values, nor can it represent large numbers of key  definitions,  as
           are   required  to  distinguish  multiple  modifier  keys  used  in
           combination with a function key.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The tables of capability names differ between implementations.

           Although they <EM>may</EM> provide all of  the  standard  capability  names,
           each  arranges  its table entries differently because some features
           were added as needed, while others were added -- out  of  order  --
           for X/Open Curses conformance.

           While  <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  capability  repertoire  is  closest  to  that  of
           Solaris, the set of capabilities supported by each  vendor's  <EM>term-</EM>
           <EM>info</EM>  database  differs  from  the list published by X/Open Curses.
           <EM>ncurses</EM> can be configured  with  tables  that  match  the  terminal
           databases  for  AIX,  HP-UX,  or  OSF/1,  rather  than  the default
           Solaris-like configuration.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> and <EM>ncurses</EM>, the terminal  database  is  defined  at
           compile  time by interpolating a text file that lists the different
           terminal capabilities.

           In principle, the text file can be extended, but doing so  requires
           recompiling  and  reinstalling  the library.  The text file used by
           <EM>ncurses</EM> for terminal capabilities includes details of extensions to
           X/Open Curses  made  by  various  systems.   For  example,  <EM>ncurses</EM>
           supports   the   following   nonstandard   capabilities   in   each
           configuration.

               <STRONG>memory_lock</STRONG>
                    (<STRONG>meml</STRONG>) lock memory above cursor

               <STRONG>memory_unlock</STRONG>
                    (<STRONG>memu</STRONG>) unlock memory

               <STRONG>box_chars_1</STRONG>
                    (<STRONG>box1</STRONG>) box characters primary set

           The memory lock/unlock capabilities were included because they were
           used in the X11R6 terminal description for <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>.  <STRONG>tic</STRONG> uses  the
           <STRONG>box1</STRONG> capability to cope with terminal descriptions written for AIX.

       During  the  1990s,  some  application developers were reluctant to use
       <EM>terminfo</EM> in spite  of  its  performance  (and  other)  advantages  over
       <EM>termcap</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  fixed  repertoire  prevented  users  from  adding  support for
           terminal features unanticipated by X/Open Curses (or required  them
           to reuse existing capabilities as a workaround).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  limitation  to  16-bit  signed  integers  was  also mentioned.
           Because <EM>termcap</EM> stores everything as a string, it  could  represent
           larger numbers.

       Although  <EM>termcap</EM>'s  extensibility  was rarely used -- the claimant was
       never an implementor who had actually exercised it -- the criticism had
       a  point.   <EM>ncurses</EM>  5.0  provided  a   way   to   detect   nonstandard
       capabilities,  to  determine  their  type,  and to optionally store and
       retrieve them in a way that did not interfere with other  applications.
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  terms these <EM>user-defined</EM> <EM>capabilities</EM> because no modifications
       to the standard capability list are needed.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> utilities <STRONG>tic</STRONG> and <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> have a command-line  option  "-x"
       to   control   whether  the  nonstandard  capabilities  are  stored  or
       retrieved.  <EM>ncurses</EM> provides <STRONG><A HREF="curs_extend.3x.html">use_extended_names(3x)</A></STRONG> to programs for the
       same purpose.

       When compiling a terminal database, if "-x" is used, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> stores a user-
       defined capability if the capability name is not standard.

       Because <EM>ncurses</EM> provides  a  <EM>termcap</EM>  library  interface,  these  user-
       defined capabilities may be visible to <EM>termcap</EM> applications.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The   <EM>termcap</EM>  interface  (like  all  implementations  of  <EM>termcap</EM>)
           restricts capability names to two characters.

           When  the  capability  is  simple  enough  for  use  in  a  <EM>termcap</EM>
           application, it is provided as a two-character name.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Other  user-defined  capabilities  employ  features  not  usable in
           <EM>termcap</EM>, such as parameterized  strings  that  use  more  than  two
           parameters  or  require  more  powerful  expressions  than  <EM>termcap</EM>
           supports.  Such capabilities should, in the <EM>terminfo</EM> database, have
           names at least three characters in length.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Some terminals can send distinct strings for special keys (cursor-,
           keypad-  or  function-keys)  depending  on  modifier  keys  (shift,
           control,  etc.).   While <EM>terminfo</EM> and <EM>termcap</EM> define a set of sixty
           function key names, to which a series of keys can be assigned, that
           is insufficient for more than a dozen keys multiplied by more  than
           a  couple  of  modifier  combinations.  The <EM>ncurses</EM> database uses a
           convention based on <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG> to provide extended special-key names.

           Fitting that into <EM>termcap</EM>'s limitation of 2-character  names  would
           be  pointless.   These  extended keys are available only with <EM>term-</EM>
           <EM>info</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Recognized-Capabilities">Recognized Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The <EM>ncurses</EM> library employs  user-definable  capabilities.   While  the
       <EM>terminfo</EM>  database  may  have  other extensions, <EM>ncurses</EM> makes explicit
       checks for the following.

          <STRONG>AX</STRONG> (Boolean) asserts that the terminal interprets SGR 39 and SGR  49
             by  resetting the foreground and background colors, respectively,
             to the default.

             <STRONG>screen(1)</STRONG> recognizes this capability as well.

          <STRONG>E3</STRONG> (string)  tells  an  application  how  to  clear  the  terminal's
             scrollback buffer.  When present, the <STRONG><A HREF="clear.1.html">clear(1)</A></STRONG> program sends this
             before clearing the terminal.

             The command "<STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>clear</STRONG>" does the same thing.

          <STRONG>NQ</STRONG> (Boolean)  suppresses  a consistency check in <STRONG>tic</STRONG> for the <EM>ncurses</EM>
             string capabilities <STRONG>user6</STRONG> (<STRONG>u6</STRONG>) through <STRONG>user9</STRONG> (<STRONG>u9</STRONG>), which tell  an
             application  how  to query the terminal's cursor position and its
             device attributes.

          <STRONG>RGB</STRONG>
             (Boolean, numeric, or string) asserts that  the  <STRONG>set_a_foreground</STRONG>
             (<STRONG>setaf</STRONG>)  and  <STRONG>set_a_background</STRONG> (<STRONG>setab</STRONG>) capabilities employ <EM>direct</EM>
             <EM>colors</EM>,  using  an   RGB   (red/green/blue)   convention.    This
             capability  allows <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">color_content(3x)</A></STRONG> to return appropriate values
             without requiring the  application  to  initialize  colors  using
             <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">init_color(3x)</A></STRONG>.

             The capability type determines the values <EM>ncurses</EM> sees.

             Boolean
                implies  that  the number of bits for red, green, and blue are
                the  same.   Starting  with  the  value  of   the   capability
                <STRONG>max_colors</STRONG>  (<STRONG>colors</STRONG>;  <EM>termcap:</EM>  <STRONG>co</STRONG>), <EM>ncurses</EM> adds two, divides
                the sum by three, and assigns the result to  red,  green,  and
                blue, in that order.

                If the number of bits needed for the number of colors is not a
                multiple of three, the blue (and green) color channels lose in
                comparison to red.

             numeric
                tells  <EM>ncurses</EM> what result to add to red, green, and blue.  If
                <EM>ncurses</EM> runs out of bits, blue (and green) lose just as in the
                Boolean case.

             string
                specify the quantity of bits used for  red,  green,  and  blue
                color channels as a slash-separated list of decimal integers.

             Because there are several RGB encodings in use, applications that
             make  assumptions  about the number of bits per color channel are
             unlikely to work reliably.  As a trivial case, one  could  define
             <STRONG>RGB#1</STRONG> to represent the standard eight ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48/ISO 6429
             colors using one bit per color channel.

          <STRONG>U8</STRONG> (numeric)  asserts  whether  <EM>ncurses</EM>  must use Unicode values for
             line-drawing characters, and that it should ignore the  alternate
             character  set  (ACS)  capabilities  when  the  locale uses UTF-8
             encoding.  See the discussion of <STRONG>NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS</STRONG>  in  section
             "ENVIRONMENT" of <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>.

             Set this capability to a nonzero value to enable it.

          <STRONG>XM</STRONG> (string) override <EM>ncurses</EM>'s built-in string that directs <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>
             to enable or disable mouse mode.

             <EM>ncurses</EM>  sends a character sequence to the terminal to initialize
             mouse mode, and when the user clicks the  mouse  buttons  or  (in
             certain  modes) moves the mouse, handles the characters sent back
             by the terminal to tell the application what was  done  with  the
             mouse.

             The  mouse  protocol  is  enabled  when  the <EM>mask</EM> argument to the
             <STRONG><A HREF="curs_mouse.3x.html">mousemask(3x)</A></STRONG> function is nonzero.  By default,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  handles
             the  responses  for  the X11 <EM>xterm</EM> mouse protocol.  It also knows
             about the SGR 1006 <EM>xterm</EM> mouse protocol, but must to be  told  to
             look  for it specifically.  <EM>ncurses</EM> is not be able to guess which
             of the two modes is used, because the responses are enough  alike
             that only confusion would result.

             The  <STRONG>XM</STRONG>  capability  has a single numeric parameter.  If nonzero,
             the mouse  protocol  should  be  enabled.   If  zero,  the  mouse
             protocol should be disabled.  <EM>ncurses</EM> inspects this capability if
             it  is present, to see whether the 1006 protocol is used.  If so,
             it  expects  the  responses  to  use  the  SGR 1006  <EM>xterm</EM>  mouse
             protocol.

             The  <EM>xterm</EM>  mouse  protocol  is used by other terminal emulators.
             The terminal database uses building blocks for the various  <EM>xterm</EM>
             mouse protocols usable in customized terminal descriptions.

             The terminal database building blocks for this mouse feature also
             have  an  experimental  capability,  <STRONG>xm</STRONG>, that describes the mouse
             response.  No known  interpreter  uses  this  information,  which
             could make mouse support completely data-driven.

             <STRONG>xm</STRONG> shows the format of the mouse responses.  In this experimental
             capability, the parameters are as follows.

               <EM>p1</EM>   y-ordinate

               <EM>p2</EM>   x-ordinate

               <EM>p3</EM>   button

               <EM>p4</EM>   state, e.g., pressed or released

               <EM>p5</EM>   y-ordinate starting region

               <EM>p6</EM>   x-ordinate starting region

               <EM>p7</EM>   y-ordinate ending region

               <EM>p8</EM>   x-ordinate ending region

             Here  are  examples  from  the  terminal  database  for  the most
             commonly used <EM>xterm</EM> mouse protocols.

       Several terminals provide the ability  to  send  distinct  strings  for
       combinations  of  modified special keys.  There is no standard for what
       those keys can send.

       Since 1999, <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>  has  supported  <EM>shift</EM>,  <EM>control</EM>,  <EM>alt</EM>,  and  <EM>meta</EM>
       modifiers  which  produce  distinct special-key strings.  In a terminal
       description, <EM>ncurses</EM> has no special knowledge of  the  modifiers  used.
       Applications  can  use  the  <EM>naming</EM> <EM>convention</EM> established for <EM>xterm</EM> to
       find these special keys in the terminal description.

       Starting with the <EM>curses</EM> convention that  capability  codes  describing
       the  input  generated by a terminal's key caps begin with "k", and that
       shifted special keys use uppercase letters in  their  names,  <EM>ncurses</EM>'s
       terminal  database  defines  the  following  names and codes to which a
       suffix is added.

            <STRONG>Code</STRONG>   <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
            -------------------------------------------------------------------
            <STRONG>kDC</STRONG>    shifted kdch1 (delete character)

       Keycap nomenclature on the Unix systems for which <EM>curses</EM> was  developed
       differs  from  today's ubiquitous descendants of the IBM PC/AT keyboard
       layout.  In the foregoing, interpret "backward" as "left", "forward" as
       "right", "next" as "page down", and "prev(ious)" as "page up".

       These are the suffixes used to denote the modifiers:

       <EM>ncurses</EM>  defines  no  capabilities  for   modified   F-keys;   terminal
       descriptions  can  refer  to <EM>names</EM> that <EM>ncurses</EM> allocates at runtime to
       <EM>key</EM> <EM>codes</EM>.  To use these keys in an  <EM>ncurses</EM>  program,  an  application
       could do this:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   using  a  list  of  extended  key <EM>names</EM>, ask <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tigetstr(3x)</A></STRONG> for their
           values, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   given the list of values,  ask  <STRONG><A HREF="key_defined.3x.html">key_defined(3x)</A></STRONG>  for  the  <EM>key-code</EM>
           which would be returned for those keys by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">wgetch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       The  "-x"  extension  feature  of  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  and <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> has been adopted in
       NetBSD <EM>curses</EM>.  That implementation stores  user-defined  capabilities,
       but makes no use of these capabilities itself.

       In  the source form of the terminal database, <EM>terminfo.src</EM>, the section
       "NCURSES USER-DEFINABLE CAPABILITIES".  summarizes commonly-used  user-
       defined  capabilities  employed  in the terminal descriptions.  Some of
       those features are mentioned in <STRONG>screen(1)</STRONG> or <STRONG>tmux(1)</STRONG>.

       <EM>XTerm</EM> <EM>Control</EM> <EM>Sequences</EM> provides further information  on  the  <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>
       features that are used in these extended capabilities.
