<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Panels  are  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></STRONG>  windows with the added feature of
       depth.  Panel functions allow the use of  stacked  windows
       and  ensure  the  proper  portions  of each window and the
       curses <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> window are hidden or displayed  when  panels
       are  added,  moved,  modified or removed.  The set of cur-
       rently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>
       window  is  beneath all panels, and is not considered part
       of the stack.

       A window is associated with every panel.  The  panel  rou-
       tines  enable  you to create, move, hide, and show panels,
       as well as position a panel at any desired location in the
       stack.

       Panel routines are a functional layer added to <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></STRONG>,
       make only high-level curses calls, and work anywhere  ter-
       minfo curses does.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>new_panel(win)</STRONG>
              allocates   a   <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure, associates it with
              <STRONG>win</STRONG>, places the panel  on  the  top  of  the  stack
              (causes   it  to   be   displayed  above  any other
              panel) and returns a pointer to the new panel.

       <STRONG>update_panels()</STRONG>
              refreshes the virtual screen to reflect  the  rela-
              tions between the panels in the stack, but does not
              call doupdate() to  refresh  the  physical  screen.
              Use this function and not <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> or <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>.
              <STRONG>update_panels</STRONG> may be called more than once before a
              call  to doupdate(), but doupdate() is the function
              responsible for updating the physical screen.

       <STRONG>del_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              removes the given panel from the  stack and deallo-
              cates  the  <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure (but not its associated
              window).

       <STRONG>hide_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              removes the given panel from the  panel  stack  and
              thus hides it from view. The <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure is not
              lost, merely removed from the stack.

       <STRONG>panel_hidden(pan)</STRONG>
              returns TRUE if the panel is in  the  panel  stack,
              FALSE  if  it  is  not.   If  the  panel  is a null
              pointer, return ERR.

       <STRONG>show_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              makes a hidden panel visible by placing it  on  top
              of the panels in the panel stack. See COMPATIBILITY
              below.

       <STRONG>top_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              puts the given visible panel on top of  all  panels
              in the stack.  See COMPATIBILITY below.

       <STRONG>bottom_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              puts panel at the bottom of all panels.

       <STRONG>move_panel(pan,starty,startx)</STRONG>
              moves the given panel window so that its upper-left
              corner is at <STRONG>starty</STRONG>, <STRONG>startx</STRONG>.  It  does  not  change
              the position of the panel in the stack.  Be sure to
              use this function, not <STRONG>mvwin()</STRONG>,  to  move  a  panel
              window.

       <STRONG>replace_panel(pan,window)</STRONG>
              replaces  the  current  window of panel with <STRONG>window</STRONG>
              (useful, for example if you want to resize a panel;
              if you're using <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>, you can call <STRONG>replace_panel</STRONG>
              on the output of <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3x)</A></STRONG>).  It does not  change
              the position of the panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>panel_above(pan)</STRONG>
              returns  a  pointer to the panel above pan.  If the
              panel argument is <STRONG>(PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>*)0</STRONG>, it returns a  pointer
              to the bottom panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>panel_below(pan)</STRONG>
              returns  a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If
              the panel argument is  <STRONG>(PANEL</STRONG>  <STRONG>*)0</STRONG>,  it  returns  a
              pointer to the top panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)</STRONG>
              sets the panel's user pointer.

       <STRONG>panel_userptr(pan)</STRONG>
              returns the user pointer for a given panel.

       <STRONG>panel_window(pan)</STRONG>
              returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Each routine that returns a pointer  returns  <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>  if  an
       error  occurs.  Each  routine  that  returns  an int value
       returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG> if it executes successfully and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if not.


</PRE>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2><PRE>
       Reasonable care has been taken to   ensure   compatibility
       with   the   native   panel  facility introduced in SVr3.2
       (inspection  of  the  SVr4  manual  pages   suggests   the
       programming  interface  is  unchanged).   The  <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG>  data
       structures are merely  similar. The   programmer  is  cau-
       tioned not to directly use <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> fields.

       The  functions  <STRONG>show_panel()</STRONG> and <STRONG>top_panel()</STRONG> are identical
       in this implementation, and work equally  well  with  dis-
       played or hidden panels.  In the native System V implemen-
       tation, <STRONG>show_panel()</STRONG> is intended for making a hidden panel
       visible  (at  the  top  of  the  stack) and <STRONG>top_panel()</STRONG> is
       intended for making an already-visible panel move  to  the
       top  of  the  stack.  You are cautioned to use the correct
       function  to  ensure  compatibility  with   native   panel
       libraries.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       In  your  library  list, libpanel.a should be before libn-
       curses.a; that is, you want to  say  `-lpanel  -lncurses',
       not the other way around (which would usually give a link-
       error).
