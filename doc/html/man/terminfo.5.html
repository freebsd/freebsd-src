       /usr/share/terminfo/*/*


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>Terminfo</EM>  is  a  database describing terminals, used by screen-oriented
       programs  such  as  <STRONG>nvi(1)</STRONG>,  <STRONG>lynx(1)</STRONG>,   <STRONG>mutt(1)</STRONG>,   and   other   curses
       applications,  using  high-level calls to libraries such as <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></STRONG>.
       It is also used via low-level calls by  non-curses  applications  which
       may  be  screen-oriented  (such  as  <STRONG><A HREF="clear.1.html">clear(1)</A></STRONG>)  or  non-screen (such as
       <STRONG><A HREF="tabs.1.html">tabs(1)</A></STRONG>).

       <EM>Terminfo</EM> describes terminals by giving a set of capabilities which they
       have, by specifying how to perform screen operations, and by specifying
       padding requirements and initialization sequences.

       This document describes <EM>ncurses</EM> version 6.5 (patch 20240427).


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-terminfo-Entry-Syntax"><EM>terminfo</EM> Entry Syntax</a></H3><PRE>
       Entries in <EM>terminfo</EM> consist of a sequence of fields:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Each field ends with a comma "," (embedded commas  may  be  escaped
           with a backslash or written as "\054").

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   White space between fields is ignored.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The first field in a <EM>terminfo</EM> entry begins in the first column.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Newlines  and  leading  whitespace (spaces or tabs) may be used for
           formatting entries for readability.  These are removed from  parsed
           entries.

           The  <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG>  <STRONG>-f</STRONG> and <STRONG>-W</STRONG> options rely on this to format if-then-else
           expressions, or  to  enforce  maximum  line-width.   The  resulting
           formatted terminal description can be read by <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  first  field for each terminal gives the names which are known
           for the terminal, separated by "|" characters.

           The first name given  is  the  most  common  abbreviation  for  the
           terminal  (its  primary name), the last name given should be a long
           name fully identifying the terminal  (see  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_termattrs.3x.html">longname(3x)</A></STRONG>),  and  all
           others  are  treated as synonyms (aliases) for the primary terminal
           name.

           X/Open Curses advises that all names but  the  last  should  be  in
           lower  case  and  contain no blanks; the last name may well contain
           upper case and blanks for readability.

           This implementation is not so strict; it allows mixed case  in  the
           primary name and aliases.  If the last name has no embedded blanks,
           it allows that to be both an alias and a  verbose  name  (but  will
           warn about this ambiguity).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Lines  beginning  with  a  "#"  in  the first column are treated as
           comments.

           While comment lines are valid at any point, the output of <STRONG>captoinfo</STRONG>
           and  <STRONG>infotocap</STRONG>  (aliases  for <STRONG>tic</STRONG>) will move comments so they occur
           only between entries.

       Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry)  should  be  chosen
       using  the  following  conventions.   The  particular piece of hardware
       making up the terminal should have a root name,  thus  "hp2621".   This
       name should not contain hyphens.  Modes that the hardware can be in, or
       user preferences, should be indicated by appending a hyphen and a  mode
       suffix.   Thus,  a  vt100  in  132-column  mode  would be vt100-w.  The
       following suffixes should be used where possible:

       <STRONG>Suffix</STRONG>   <STRONG>Example</STRONG>     <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       -<EM>nn</EM>      aaa-60      Number of lines on the screen
       -<EM>n</EM>p      c100-4p     Number of pages of memory
       -am      vt100-am    With automargins (usually the default)
       -m       ansi-m      Mono mode; suppress color
       -mc      wy30-mc     Magic cookie; spaces when highlighting
       -na      c100-na     No arrow keys (leave them in local)
       -nam     vt100-nam   Without automatic margins
       -nl      hp2621-nl   No status line
       -ns      hp2626-ns   No status line
       -rv      c100-rv     Reverse video
       -s       vt100-s     Enable status line
       -vb      wy370-vb    Use visible bell instead of beep
       -w       vt100-w     Wide mode (&gt; 80 columns, usually 132)

       For more on terminal naming conventions, see the <STRONG><A HREF="term.7.html">term(7)</A></STRONG> manual page.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-terminfo-Capabilities-Syntax"><EM>terminfo</EM> Capabilities Syntax</a></H3><PRE>
       The terminfo entry consists of  several  <EM>capabilities</EM>,  i.e.,  features
       that  the  terminal  has,  or  methods  for  exercising  the terminal's
       features.

       After the first field (giving the name(s) of the terminal entry), there
       should be one or more <EM>capability</EM> fields.  These are Boolean, numeric or
       string names with corresponding values:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Boolean capabilities are true  when  present,  false  when  absent.
           There is no explicit value for Boolean capabilities.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Numeric  capabilities  have  a  "#"  following  the  name,  then an
           unsigned decimal integer value.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   String capabilities have a "=" following the name, then  an  string
           of characters making up the capability value.

           String  capabilities  can be split into multiple lines, just as the
           fields comprising a terminal  entry  can  be  split  into  multiple
           lines.   While  blanks  between fields are ignored, blanks embedded
           within a string value are retained, except for leading blanks on  a
           line.

       Any  capability  can  be  <EM>canceled</EM>,  i.e., suppressed from the terminal
       entry, by following its name with "@" rather than a capability value.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Similar-Terminals">Similar Terminals</a></H3><PRE>
       If there are two very similar  terminals,  one  (the  variant)  can  be
       defined   as  being  just  like  the  other  (the  base)  with  certain
       exceptions.  In the definition of the variant,  the  string  capability
       <STRONG>use</STRONG> can be given with the name of the base terminal:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  capabilities  given before <STRONG>use</STRONG> override those in the base type
           named by <STRONG>use</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If there are multiple <STRONG>use</STRONG> capabilities, they are merged in  reverse
           order.   That  is,  the rightmost <STRONG>use</STRONG> reference is processed first,
           then the one to its left, and so forth.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Capabilities given explicitly in the entry override  those  brought
           in by <STRONG>use</STRONG> references.

       A  capability  can  be  canceled  by placing <STRONG>xx@</STRONG> to the left of the use
       reference that imports it, where <EM>xx</EM> is the  capability.   For  example,
       the entry

              2621-nl, smkx@, rmkx@, use=2621,

       defines a 2621-nl that does not have the <STRONG>smkx</STRONG> or <STRONG>rmkx</STRONG> capabilities, and
       hence does not turn on the function key labels  when  in  visual  mode.
       This  is  useful  for  different modes for a terminal, or for different
       user preferences.

       An entry included via <STRONG>use</STRONG> can contain canceled capabilities, which have
       the  same  effect as if those cancels were inline in the using terminal
       entry.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Predefined-Capabilities">Predefined Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       Tables of capabilities <EM>ncurses</EM> recognizes in a <EM>terminfo</EM>  terminal  type
       description and available to <EM>terminfo</EM>-using code follow.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  capability  name identifies the symbol by which the programmer
           using the <EM>terminfo</EM> API accesses the capability.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The TI (<EM>terminfo</EM>) code is the short name used by a person composing
           or updating a terminal type entry.

           Whenever  possible, these codes are the same as or similar to those
           of the ANSI X3.64-1979 standard (now superseded by  ECMA-48,  which
           uses identical or very similar names).  Semantics are also intended
           to match those of the specification.

           <EM>terminfo</EM> codes have no hard length limit, but <EM>ncurses</EM> maintains  an
           informal  one  of  5 characters to keep them short and to allow the
           tabs in the source file <EM>Caps</EM> to line  up  nicely.   (Some  standard
           codes exceed this limit regardless.)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  TC  (<EM>termcap</EM>)  code  is  that used by the corresponding API of
           <EM>ncurses</EM>.  (Some capabilities are  new,  and  have  names  that  BSD
           <EM>termcap</EM> did not originate.)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The   description   field   attempts  to  convey  the  capability's
           semantics.

       The description field employs a handful of notations.

       <STRONG>(P)</STRONG>    indicates that padding may be specified.

       <STRONG>(P*)</STRONG>   indicates that padding may vary in proportion to the  number  of
              output lines affected.

       <STRONG>#</STRONG><EM>i</EM>     indicates   the  <EM>i</EM>th  parameter  of  a  string  capability;  the
              programmer  should  pass  the  string  to  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>  with   the
              parameters listed.

              If  the  description  lists no parameters, passing the string to
              <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG> may produce unexpected behavior, for instance  if  the
              string contains percent signs.

       The  XSI  Curses standard added these hardcopy capabilities.  They were
       used in some post-4.1 versions of System V curses,  e.g.,  Solaris  2.5
       and  IRIX  6.x.   Except for <STRONG>YI</STRONG>, the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> termcap names for them are
       invented.  According to the XSI Curses standard, they have  no  termcap
       names.   If  your  compiled terminfo entries use these, they may not be
       binary-compatible with System V terminfo entries after SVr4.1; beware!

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-User-Defined-Capabilities">User-Defined Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The  preceding  section  listed the <EM>predefined</EM> capabilities.  They deal
       with some special features for terminals no longer (or possibly  never)
       produced.   Occasionally  there are special features of newer terminals
       which are awkward or impossible to represent by reusing the  predefined
       capabilities.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>    addresses   this   limitation   by   allowing   user-defined
       capabilities.  The <STRONG>tic</STRONG> and <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> programs provide the <STRONG>-x</STRONG>  option  for
       this purpose.  When <STRONG>-x</STRONG> is set, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> treats unknown capabilities as user-
       defined.  That is, if <STRONG>tic</STRONG> encounters a capability name  which  it  does
       not  recognize, it infers its type (Boolean, number or string) from the
       syntax and makes an extended table  entry  for  that  capability.   The
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_extend.3x.html">use_extended_names(3x)</A></STRONG>  function  makes  this information conditionally
       available to applications.   The  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  provides  the  data
       leaving most of the behavior to applications:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   User-defined  capability  strings  whose  name  begins with "k" are
           treated as function keys.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The types (Boolean,  number,  string)  determined  by  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  can  be
           inferred by successful calls on <STRONG>tigetflag</STRONG>, etc.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the capability name happens to be two characters, the capability
           is also available through the termcap interface.

       While termcap is said to be  extensible  because  it  does  not  use  a
       predefined  set of capabilities, in practice it has been limited to the
       capabilities defined by terminfo implementations.   As  a  rule,  user-
       defined capabilities intended for use by termcap applications should be
       limited to Booleans and numbers to avoid running  past  the  1023  byte
       limit  assumed  by  termcap implementations and their applications.  In
       particular, providing extended sets  of  function  keys  (past  the  60
       numbered keys and the handful of special named keys) is best done using
       the longer names available using terminfo.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> library uses a few of these user-defined  capabilities,  as
       described  in <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>.  Other user-defined capabilities (including
       function keys) are described in the terminal database, in  the  section
       on <EM>NCURSES</EM> <EM>USER-DEFINABLE</EM> <EM>CAPABILITIES</EM>

       Entries  may continue onto multiple lines by placing white space at the
       beginning of each line except the first.  Comments may be  included  on
       lines beginning with "#".  Capabilities in <EM>terminfo</EM> are of three types:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Boolean  capabilities  which  indicate  that  the terminal has some
           particular feature,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   numeric capabilities giving the size of the terminal or the size of
           particular delays, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   string  capabilities,  which  give  a sequence which can be used to
           perform particular terminal operations.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Types-of-Capabilities">Types of Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       All capabilities have names.  For instance, the fact that ANSI-standard
       terminals  have  <EM>automatic</EM> <EM>margins</EM> (i.e., an automatic return and line-
       feed when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the  capability
       <STRONG>am</STRONG>.   Hence  the description of ansi includes <STRONG>am</STRONG>.  Numeric capabilities
       are followed by the character "#" and  then  a  positive  value.   Thus
       <STRONG>cols</STRONG>, which indicates the number of columns the terminal has, gives the
       value "80" for ansi.  Values for numeric capabilities may be  specified
       in  decimal,  octal,  or  hexadecimal, using the C programming language
       conventions (e.g., 255, 0377 and 0xff or 0xFF).

       Finally, string valued capabilities, such as <STRONG>el</STRONG> (clear to end  of  line
       sequence)  are  given  by  the  two-character  code, an "=", and then a
       string ending at the next following ",".

       A number  of  escape  sequences  are  provided  in  the  string  valued
       capabilities for easy encoding of characters there:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Both <STRONG>\E</STRONG> and <STRONG>\e</STRONG> map to an ESCAPE character,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>^</STRONG><STRONG><EM>x</EM></STRONG> maps to a control-<EM>x</EM> for any appropriate <EM>x</EM>, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the sequences

             <STRONG>\n</STRONG>, <STRONG>\l</STRONG>, <STRONG>\r</STRONG>, <STRONG>\t</STRONG>, <STRONG>\b</STRONG>, <STRONG>\f</STRONG>, and <STRONG>\s</STRONG>

           produce

             <EM>newline</EM>, <EM>line-feed</EM>, <EM>return</EM>, <EM>tab</EM>, <EM>backspace</EM>, <EM>form-feed</EM>, and <EM>space</EM>,

           respectively.

       X/Open Curses does not say what "appropriate <EM>x</EM>" might be.  In practice,
       that is a printable ASCII graphic character.  The special case "^?"  is
       interpreted  as  DEL (127).  In all other cases, the character value is
       AND'd with 0x1f, mapping to ASCII control codes in the range 0  through
       31.

       Other escapes include

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\^</STRONG> for <STRONG>^</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\\</STRONG> for <STRONG>\</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\</STRONG>, for comma,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\:</STRONG> for <STRONG>:</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and <STRONG>\0</STRONG> for null.

           <STRONG>\0</STRONG> will produce \200, which does not terminate a string but behaves
           as a null character on most terminals, providing CS7 is  specified.
           See <STRONG>stty(1)</STRONG>.

           The  reason  for  this quirk is to maintain binary compatibility of
           the compiled terminfo files with other implementations,  e.g.,  the
           SVr4  systems,  which  document  this.  Compiled terminfo files use
           null-terminated strings, with no  lengths.   Modifying  this  would
           require  a  new  binary  format,  which  would  not work with other
           implementations.

       Finally, characters may be given as three octal digits after a <STRONG>\</STRONG>.

       A delay in milliseconds may appear anywhere  in  a  string  capability,
       enclosed  in  $&lt;..&gt;  brackets, as in <STRONG>el</STRONG>=\EK$&lt;5&gt;, and padding characters
       are supplied by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tputs(3x)</A></STRONG> to provide this delay.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The delay must be a number  with  at  most  one  decimal  place  of
           precision; it may be followed by suffixes "*" or "/" or both.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A  "*"  indicates  that the padding required is proportional to the
           number of lines affected by the operation, and the amount given  is
           the  per-affected-unit  padding  required.   (In the case of insert
           character, the factor is still the number of <EM>lines</EM> affected.)

           Normally, padding is advisory if the device has the <STRONG>xon</STRONG> capability;
           it is used for cost computation but does not trigger delays.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A  "/"  suffix indicates that the padding is mandatory and forces a
           delay of the given number of milliseconds even on devices for which
           <STRONG>xon</STRONG> is present to indicate flow control.

       Sometimes  individual  capabilities must be commented out.  To do this,
       put a period before the capability name.  For example, see  the  second
       <STRONG>ind</STRONG> in the example above.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Fetching-Compiled-Descriptions">Fetching Compiled Descriptions</a></H3><PRE>
       Terminal  descriptions  in  <EM>ncurses</EM>  are  stored in terminal databases.
       These databases, which are found by their pathname, may  be  configured
       either as directory trees or hashed databases (see <STRONG><A HREF="term.5.html">term(5)</A></STRONG>),

       The  library  uses  a  compiled-in  list  of  pathnames,  which  can be
       overridden  by  environment  variables.   Before  starting  to  search,
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  checks  the  search list, eliminating duplicates and pathnames
       where no terminal database is found.  The  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  reads  the
       first description which passes its consistency checks.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  environment variable <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> is checked first, for a terminal
           database containing the terminal description.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Next, <EM>ncurses</EM> looks in <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM> for a compiled description.

           This is an optional feature which may be omitted entirely from  the
           library,  or  limited  to  prevent  accidental  use  by  privileged
           applications.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Next, if the environment variable  <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM>  is  set,  <EM>ncurses</EM>
           interprets  the  contents  of  that  variable  as  a list of colon-
           separated pathnames of terminal databases to be searched.

           An empty pathname (i.e., if the variable  begins  or  ends  with  a
           colon,  or  contains  adjacent colons) is interpreted as the system
           location <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Finally, <EM>ncurses</EM> searches these compiled-in locations:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a list of directories (/usr/share/terminfo), and

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the system terminfo directory, <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>

       The <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> variable can contain a terminal description instead of the
       pathname  of  a terminal database.  If this variable begins with "hex:"
       or "b64:" then <EM>ncurses</EM> reads a terminal description  from  hexadecimal-
       or  base64-encoded  data,  and  if  that  description  matches the name
       sought, will use that.  This encoded data can be  set  using  the  "-Q"
       option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> or <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG>.

       The  preceding addresses the usual configuration of <EM>ncurses</EM>, which uses
       terminal descriptions prepared in <EM>terminfo</EM> format.   While  <EM>termcap</EM>  is
       less  expressive,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  can  also  be  configured  to  read <EM>termcap</EM>
       descriptions.   In  that  configuration,  it  checks  the  <EM>TERMCAP</EM>  and
       <EM>TERMPATH</EM>  variables  (for  content and search path, respectively) after
       the system terminal database.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Preparing-Descriptions">Preparing Descriptions</a></H3><PRE>
       We now outline how to prepare  descriptions  of  terminals.   The  most
       effective  way  to  prepare  a terminal description is by imitating the
       description of a similar  terminal  in  <EM>terminfo</EM>  and  to  build  up  a
       description gradually, using partial descriptions with <EM>vi</EM> or some other
       screen-oriented program to check that they are correct.  Be aware  that
       a  very  unusual terminal may expose deficiencies in the ability of the
       <EM>terminfo</EM> file to describe it or bugs in the screen-handling code of the
       test program.

       To  get the padding for insert line right (if the terminal manufacturer
       did not document it) a severe test is to edit  a  large  file  at  9600
       baud, delete 16 or so lines from the middle of the screen, then hit the
       "u" key several times quickly.  If the terminal messes up, more padding
       is usually needed.  A similar test can be used for insert character.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Basic-Capabilities">Basic Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The  number  of  columns  on each line for the terminal is given by the
       <STRONG>cols</STRONG> numeric capability.  If the terminal is a CRT, then the number  of
       lines  on the screen is given by the <STRONG>lines</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal
       wraps around to the beginning of the next  line  when  it  reaches  the
       right  margin,  then it should have the <STRONG>am</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal
       can clear its screen, leaving the cursor in  the  home  position,  then
       this  is  given  by  the  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>  string  capability.   If  the terminal
       overstrikes (rather than clearing a position when a character is struck
       over)  then  it  should  have  the <STRONG>os</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal is a
       printing terminal, with no soft copy unit, give it both <STRONG>hc</STRONG> and <STRONG>os</STRONG>.  (<STRONG>os</STRONG>
       applies  to  storage scope terminals, such as TEKTRONIX 4010 series, as
       well as hard copy and APL terminals.)  If there is a code to  move  the
       cursor to the left edge of the current row, give this as <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.  (Normally
       this will be carriage return,  control/M.)   If  there  is  a  code  to
       produce an audible signal (bell, beep, etc) give this as <STRONG>bel</STRONG>.

       If there is a code to move the cursor one position to the left (such as
       backspace) that capability should be given as <STRONG>cub1</STRONG>.   Similarly,  codes
       to  move  to the right, up, and down should be given as <STRONG>cuf1</STRONG>, <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>, and
       <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>.  These local cursor motions should not alter the text  they  pass
       over,  for  example,  you  would  not normally use "<STRONG>cuf1</STRONG>= " because the
       space would erase the character moved over.

       A very important point here is that the local cursor motions encoded in
       <EM>terminfo</EM>  are  undefined  at  the left and top edges of a CRT terminal.
       Programs should never attempt to backspace around the left edge, unless
       <STRONG>bw</STRONG>  is given, and never attempt to go up locally off the top.  In order
       to scroll text up, a program will go to the bottom left corner  of  the
       screen and send the <STRONG>ind</STRONG> (index) string.

       To  scroll  text  down,  a  program  goes to the top left corner of the
       screen and sends the <STRONG>ri</STRONG> (reverse index) string.  The strings <STRONG>ind</STRONG> and <STRONG>ri</STRONG>
       are undefined when not on their respective corners of the screen.

       Parameterized  versions  of  the  scrolling  sequences are <STRONG>indn</STRONG> and <STRONG>rin</STRONG>
       which have the same semantics as <STRONG>ind</STRONG> and <STRONG>ri</STRONG> except that they  take  one
       parameter,  and scroll that many lines.  They are also undefined except
       at the appropriate edge of the screen.

       The <STRONG>am</STRONG> capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the right edge  of
       the  screen when text is output, but this does not necessarily apply to
       a <STRONG>cuf1</STRONG> from the last column.  The only local motion  which  is  defined
       from  the  left  edge is if <STRONG>bw</STRONG> is given, then a <STRONG>cub1</STRONG> from the left edge
       will move to the right edge of the previous row.  If <STRONG>bw</STRONG> is  not  given,
       the  effect  is undefined.  This is useful for drawing a box around the
       edge of the screen, for example.  If the terminal has switch selectable
       automatic  margins,  the <EM>terminfo</EM> file usually assumes that this is on;
       i.e., <STRONG>am</STRONG>.  If the terminal has a  command  which  moves  to  the  first
       column  of  the  next line, that command can be given as <STRONG>nel</STRONG> (newline).
       It does not matter if the command clears the remainder of  the  current
       line,  so  if the terminal has no <STRONG>cr</STRONG> and <STRONG>lf</STRONG> it may still be possible to
       craft a working <STRONG>nel</STRONG> out of one or both of them.

       These  capabilities  suffice  to  describe  hard-copy  and  "glass-tty"
       terminals.  Thus the model 33 teletype is described as

       33|tty33|tty|model 33 teletype,
               bel=^G, cols#72, cr=^M, cud1=^J, hc, ind=^J, os,

       while the Lear Siegler ADM-3 is described as

       adm3|3|lsi adm3,
               am, bel=^G, clear=^Z, cols#80, cr=^M, cub1=^H, cud1=^J,
               ind=^J, lines#24,


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Parameterized-Strings">Parameterized Strings</a></H3><PRE>
       Cursor  addressing  and  other  strings  requiring  parameters  in  the
       terminal are described  by  a  parameterized  string  capability,  with
       <EM>printf</EM>-like  escapes  such  as  <EM>%x</EM>  in it.  For example, to address the
       cursor, the <STRONG>cup</STRONG> capability is given, using two parameters: the row  and
       column  to  address  to.   (Rows and columns are numbered from zero and
       refer to the physical screen visible to the user,  not  to  any  unseen
       memory.)   If  the terminal has memory relative cursor addressing, that
       can be indicated by <STRONG>mrcup</STRONG>.

       The parameter mechanism uses a stack and special <STRONG>%</STRONG> codes to  manipulate
       it.   Typically  a  sequence  will  push one of the parameters onto the
       stack and then print it in  some  format.   Print  (e.g.,  "%d")  is  a
       special  case.  Other operations, including "%t" pop their operand from
       the stack.   It  is  noted  that  more  complex  operations  are  often
       necessary, e.g., in the <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> string.

       The <STRONG>%</STRONG> encodings have the following meanings:

       <STRONG>%%</STRONG>   outputs "%"

       <STRONG>%</STRONG><EM>[[</EM>:<EM>]flags][width[.precision]][</EM><STRONG>doxXs</STRONG><EM>]</EM>
            as  in  <STRONG>printf(3)</STRONG>,  flags are <EM>[-+#]</EM> and <EM>space</EM>.  Use a ":" to allow
            the next character to be a "-" flag, avoiding interpreting "%-" as
            an operator.

       <STRONG>%c</STRONG>   print <EM>pop()</EM> like %c in <STRONG>printf</STRONG>

       <STRONG>%s</STRONG>   print <EM>pop()</EM> like %s in <STRONG>printf</STRONG>

       <STRONG>%p</STRONG><EM>[1-9]</EM>
            push <EM>i</EM>'th parameter

       <STRONG>%P</STRONG><EM>[a-z]</EM>
            set dynamic variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> to <EM>pop()</EM>

       <STRONG>%g</STRONG><EM>[a-z]</EM>
            get dynamic variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> and push it

       <STRONG>%P</STRONG><EM>[A-Z]</EM>
            set static variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> to <EM>pop()</EM>

       <STRONG>%g</STRONG><EM>[A-Z]</EM>
            get static variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> and push it

            The  terms  "static"  and "dynamic" are misleading.  Historically,
            these are simply two different sets of variables, whose values are
            not  reset  between calls to <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>.  However, that fact is not
            documented in other implementations.  Relying on it will adversely
            impact portability to other implementations:

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr2  curses  supported <EM>dynamic</EM> variables.  Those are set only
                by a <STRONG>%P</STRONG> operator.  A <STRONG>%g</STRONG> for a  given  variable  without  first
                setting  it  with  <STRONG>%P</STRONG> will give unpredictable results, because
                dynamic variables are an  uninitialized  local  array  on  the
                stack in the <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> function.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr3.2  curses supported <EM>static</EM> variables.  Those are an array
                in the <EM>TERMINAL</EM> structure (declared in <STRONG>term.h</STRONG>), and are zeroed
                automatically when the <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> function allocates the data.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4 curses made no further improvements to the <EM>dynamic/static</EM>
                variable feature.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Solaris XPG4 curses does not distinguish between  <EM>dynamic</EM>  and
                <EM>static</EM>  variables.  They are the same.  Like SVr4 curses, XPG4
                curses does not initialize these explicitly.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Before version 6.3, <EM>ncurses</EM> stores  both  <EM>dynamic</EM>  and  <EM>static</EM>
                variables in persistent storage, initialized to zeros.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Beginning  with version 6.3, <EM>ncurses</EM> stores <EM>static</EM> and <EM>dynamic</EM>
                variables in the same manner as SVr4.

                <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Unlike  other  implementations,  <EM>ncurses</EM>   zeros   dynamic
                    variables before the first <STRONG>%g</STRONG> or <STRONG>%P</STRONG> operator.

                <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Like  SVr2,  the  scope of dynamic variables in <EM>ncurses</EM> is
                    within the current call to <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>.  Use static variables if
                    persistent storage is needed.

       <STRONG>%?</STRONG> <EM>expr</EM> <STRONG>%t</STRONG> <EM>thenpart</EM> <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <EM>elsepart</EM> <STRONG>%;</STRONG>
            This forms an if-then-else.  The <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <EM>elsepart</EM> is optional.  Usually
            the <STRONG>%?</STRONG> <EM>expr</EM> part pushes a value onto the stack,  and  <STRONG>%t</STRONG>  pops  it
            from  the  stack,  testing if it is nonzero (true).  If it is zero
            (false), control passes to the <STRONG>%e</STRONG> (else) part.

            It is possible to form else-if's a la Algol 68:
            <STRONG>%?</STRONG> c1 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b1 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c2 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b2 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c3 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b3 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c4 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b4 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <STRONG>%;</STRONG>

            where ci are conditions, bi are bodies.

            Use the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> or <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> to see the  structure  of  if-
            then-else's.  Some strings, e.g., <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> can be very complicated when
            written on one line.  The <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option splits the string  into  lines
            with the parts indented.

       Binary  operations  are  in postfix form with the operands in the usual
       order.  That is, to get x-5 one  would  use  "%gx%{5}%-".   <STRONG>%P</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>%g</STRONG>
       variables are persistent across escape-string evaluations.

       Consider  the HP2645, which, to get to row 3 and column 12, needs to be
       sent \E&amp;a12c03Y padded for 6 milliseconds.  The order of the  rows  and
       columns  is  inverted  here,  and the row and column are printed as two
       digits.  The corresponding terminal description is expressed thus:
              cup=\E&amp;a%p2%dc%p1%dY$&lt;6&gt;,

       The Microterm ACT-IV needs the current row and column sent preceded  by
       a <STRONG>^T</STRONG>, with the row and column simply encoded in binary,
              cup=^T%p1%c%p2%c

       Terminals  which  use  "%c"  need  to  be  able to backspace the cursor
       (<STRONG>cub1</STRONG>), and to move the cursor up one line on the screen (<STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>).   This
       is necessary because it is not always safe to transmit <STRONG>\n</STRONG> <STRONG>^D</STRONG> and <STRONG>\r</STRONG>, as
       the system may change or discard them.  (The library  routines  dealing
       with  terminfo  set tty modes so that tabs are never expanded, so \t is
       safe to send.  This turns out to be essential for the Ann Arbor 4080.)

       A final example is the LSI ADM-3a, which uses row and column offset  by
       a blank character, thus
              cup=\E=%p1%' '%+%c%p2%' '%+%c

       After  sending "\E=", this pushes the first parameter, pushes the ASCII
       value for a space (32), adds them (pushing the  sum  on  the  stack  in
       place  of  the  two  previous  values)  and  outputs  that  value  as a
       character.  Then the same is  done  for  the  second  parameter.   More
       complex arithmetic is possible using the stack.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Cursor-Motions">Cursor Motions</a></H3><PRE>
       If  the  terminal has a fast way to home the cursor (to very upper left
       corner of screen) then this can be given as <STRONG>home</STRONG>; similarly a fast  way
       of  getting  to the lower left-hand corner can be given as <STRONG>ll</STRONG>; this may
       involve going up with <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG> from the home position, but a program should
       never do this itself (unless <STRONG>ll</STRONG> does) because it can make no assumption
       about the effect of moving up from the home position.   Note  that  the
       home  position  is  the  same  as  addressing to (0,0): to the top left
       corner of the screen, not of memory.  (Thus, the  \EH  sequence  on  HP
       terminals cannot be used for <STRONG>home</STRONG>.)

       If the terminal has row or column absolute cursor addressing, these can
       be given as single  parameter  capabilities  <STRONG>hpa</STRONG>  (horizontal  position
       absolute)  and  <STRONG>vpa</STRONG>  (vertical position absolute).  Sometimes these are
       shorter than the more general  two  parameter  sequence  (as  with  the
       hp2645)   and  can  be  used  in  preference  to  <STRONG>cup</STRONG>.   If  there  are
       parameterized local motions (e.g., move <EM>n</EM> spaces to  the  right)  these
       can  be  given  as  <STRONG>cud</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cub</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuf</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>  with a single parameter
       indicating how many spaces to move.  These are primarily useful if  the
       terminal does not have <STRONG>cup</STRONG>, such as the TEKTRONIX 4025.

       If  the  terminal  needs to be in a special mode when running a program
       that uses these capabilities, the codes to enter and exit this mode can
       be  given as <STRONG>smcup</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>.  This arises, for example, from terminals
       like the Concept with more than one page of memory.   If  the  terminal
       has  only  memory  relative  cursor  addressing and not screen relative
       cursor addressing, a one screen-sized window must  be  fixed  into  the
       terminal for cursor addressing to work properly.  This is also used for
       the TEKTRONIX 4025, where <STRONG>smcup</STRONG> sets the command character  to  be  the
       one  used  by  terminfo.   If  the  <STRONG>smcup</STRONG> sequence will not restore the
       screen after an <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>  sequence  is  output  (to  the  state  prior  to
       outputting <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>), specify <STRONG>nrrmc</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Margins">Margins</a></H3><PRE>
       SVr4  (and  X/Open Curses) list several string capabilities for setting
       margins.  Two were intended for use with  terminals,  and  another  six
       were intended for use with printers.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The two terminal capabilities assume that the terminal may have the
           capability of setting the left and/or right margin at  the  current
           cursor column position.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The printer capabilities assume that the printer may have two types
           of capability:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the ability to set a top and/or bottom margin using the current
               line position, and

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   parameterized  capabilities  for setting the top, bottom, left,
               right margins given the number of rows or columns.

       In practice, the categorization into "terminal" and  "printer"  is  not
       suitable:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  AT&amp;T  SVr4  terminal  database  uses <STRONG>smgl</STRONG> four times, for AT&amp;T
           hardware.

           Three of the four are printers.   They  lack  the  ability  to  set
           left/right margins by specifying the column.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Other  (non-AT&amp;T) terminals may support margins but using different
           assumptions from AT&amp;T.

           For instance, the DEC VT420 supports left/right margins,  but  only
           using a column parameter.  As an added complication, the VT420 uses
           two settings to fully enable left/right margins (left/right  margin
           mode,  and  origin  mode).   The  former enables the margins, which
           causes printed text to wrap  within  margins,  but  the  latter  is
           needed to prevent cursor-addressing outside those margins.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Both  DEC  VT420  left/right  margins are set with a single control
           sequence.  If either is omitted, the corresponding margin is set to
           the  left  or  right  edge  of the display (rather than leaving the
           margin unmodified).

       These are the margin-related capabilities:

                 <STRONG>Name</STRONG>    <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
                 ---------------------------------------------------
                 <STRONG>smgl</STRONG>    Set left margin at current column
                 <STRONG>smgr</STRONG>    Set right margin at current column
                 <STRONG>smgb</STRONG>    Set bottom margin at current line
                 <STRONG>smgt</STRONG>    Set top margin at current line
                 <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG>   Set bottom margin at line <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smglp</STRONG>   Set left margin at column <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG>   Set right margin at column <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG>   Set top margin at line <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smglr</STRONG>   Set both left and right margins to <EM>L</EM> and <EM>R</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgtb</STRONG>   Set both top and bottom margins to <EM>T</EM> and <EM>B</EM>

       When writing an application that uses these  string  capabilities,  the
       pairs  should be first checked to see if each capability in the pair is
       set or only one is set:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If both <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG>  are  set,  each  is  used  with  a  single
           argument,  <EM>N</EM>,  that  gives  the column number of the left and right
           margin, respectively.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If both <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> are set, each is used to set  the  top  and
           bottom margin, respectively:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> is used with a single argument, <EM>N</EM>, the line number of the
               top margin.

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> is used with two arguments, <EM>N</EM> and <EM>M</EM>, that give  the  line
               number of the bottom margin, the first counting from the top of
               the page  and  the  second  counting  from  the  bottom.   This
               accommodates  the two styles of specifying the bottom margin in
               different manufacturers' printers.

           When designing a terminfo entry for a printer that has  a  settable
           bottom  margin,  only  the first or second argument should be used,
           depending on the printer.  When developing an application that uses
           <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> to set the bottom margin, both arguments must be given.

       Conversely, when only one capability in the pair is set:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  only  one  of  <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG> is set, then it is used with two
           arguments, the column number of the left and right margins, in that
           order.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Likewise,  if  only  one of <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> is set, then it is used
           with two arguments that give the top and bottom  margins,  in  that
           order, counting from the top of the page.

           When designing a terminfo entry for a printer that requires setting
           both left and right or top and bottom margins simultaneously,  only
           one  capability  in  the  pairs  <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG> or <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG>
           should be defined, leaving the other unset.

       Except for very old terminal descriptions, e.g.,  those  developed  for
       SVr4,  the  scheme  just  described  should be considered obsolete.  An
       improved set of capabilities was added late in the SVr4 releases (<STRONG>smglr</STRONG>
       and  <STRONG>smgtb</STRONG>),  which  explicitly  use  two  parameters  for  setting the
       left/right or top/bottom margins.

       When setting margins, the line- and column-values are zero-based.

       The <STRONG>mgc</STRONG> string capability should  be  defined.   Applications  such  as
       <STRONG><A HREF="tabs.1.html">tabs(1)</A></STRONG> rely upon this to reset all margins.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Area-Clears">Area Clears</a></H3><PRE>
       If  the  terminal can clear from the current position to the end of the
       line, leaving the cursor where it is, this should be given as  <STRONG>el</STRONG>.   If
       the  terminal  can  clear from the beginning of the line to the current
       position inclusive, leaving the cursor where  it  is,  this  should  be
       given  as  <STRONG>el1</STRONG>.  If the terminal can clear from the current position to
       the end of the display, then this should be given as <STRONG>ed</STRONG>.   <STRONG>Ed</STRONG>  is  only
       defined from the first column of a line.  (Thus, it can be simulated by
       a request to delete a large number of  lines,  if  a  true  <STRONG>ed</STRONG>  is  not
       available.)


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Insert_Delete-Line-and-Vertical-Motions">Insert/Delete Line and Vertical Motions</a></H3><PRE>
       If  the  terminal  can  open a new blank line before the line where the
       cursor is, this should be given as <STRONG>il1</STRONG>; this  is  done  only  from  the
       first  position  of  a  line.  The cursor must then appear on the newly
       blank line.  If the terminal can delete the line which  the  cursor  is
       on,  then this should be given as <STRONG>dl1</STRONG>; this is done only from the first
       position on the line to be deleted.  Versions of <STRONG>il1</STRONG> and <STRONG>dl1</STRONG> which take
       a single parameter and insert or delete that many lines can be given as
       <STRONG>il</STRONG> and <STRONG>dl</STRONG>.

       If the terminal has a settable scrolling region (like  the  vt100)  the
       command  to  set  this  can be described with the <STRONG>csr</STRONG> capability, which
       takes two parameters: the top and bottom lines of the scrolling region.
       The cursor position is, alas, undefined after using this command.

       It  is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line using <STRONG>csr</STRONG> on
       a properly chosen region; the <STRONG>sc</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>rc</STRONG>  (save  and  restore  cursor)
       commands may be useful for ensuring that your synthesized insert/delete
       string does not move the cursor.  (Note that  the  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>  library
       does   this   synthesis   automatically,   so   you  need  not  compose
       insert/delete strings for an entry with <STRONG>csr</STRONG>).

       Yet another way to construct insert  and  delete  might  be  to  use  a
       combination  of  index  with  the  memory-lock  feature  found  on some
       terminals  (like  the  HP-700/90  series,  which   however   also   has
       insert/delete).

       Inserting  lines  at  the  top or bottom of the screen can also be done
       using <STRONG>ri</STRONG> or <STRONG>ind</STRONG> on many terminals without a  true  insert/delete  line,
       and is often faster even on terminals with those features.

       The  Boolean  <STRONG>non_dest_scroll_region</STRONG>  should  be  set if each scrolling
       window is effectively a view port on a screen-sized  canvas.   To  test
       for  this  capability,  create  a scrolling region in the middle of the
       screen, write something to the bottom line, move the cursor to the  top
       of  the region, and do <STRONG>ri</STRONG> followed by <STRONG>dl1</STRONG> or <STRONG>ind</STRONG>.  If the data scrolled
       off the bottom of the region by the <STRONG>ri</STRONG> re-appears,  then  scrolling  is
       non-destructive.  System V and X/Open Curses expect that <STRONG>ind</STRONG>, <STRONG>ri</STRONG>, <STRONG>indn</STRONG>,
       and  <STRONG>rin</STRONG>  will  simulate  destructive  scrolling;  their  documentation
       cautions  you  not  to  define  <STRONG>csr</STRONG>  unless  this is true.  This <STRONG>curses</STRONG>
       implementation is more  liberal  and  will  do  explicit  erases  after
       scrolling if <STRONG>ndsrc</STRONG> is defined.

       If  the  terminal has the ability to define a window as part of memory,
       which all commands affect, it should  be  given  as  the  parameterized
       string  <STRONG>wind</STRONG>.  The four parameters are the starting and ending lines in
       memory and the starting and ending columns in memory, in that order.

       If the terminal can retain display memory above, then the <STRONG>da</STRONG> capability
       should  be  given;  if  display  memory  can be retained below, then <STRONG>db</STRONG>
       should be given.  These indicate that deleting a line or scrolling  may
       bring  non-blank lines up from below or that scrolling back with <STRONG>ri</STRONG> may
       bring down non-blank lines.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Insert_Delete-Character">Insert/Delete Character</a></H3><PRE>
       There are two basic kinds of  intelligent  terminals  with  respect  to
       insert/delete  character  which  can  be described using <EM>terminfo</EM>.  The
       most  common  insert/delete  character  operations  affect   only   the
       characters  on the current line and shift characters off the end of the
       line rigidly.  Other terminals, such as the Concept 100 and the  Perkin
       Elmer  Owl,  make a distinction between typed and untyped blanks on the
       screen, shifting upon an insert or delete only to an untyped  blank  on
       the  screen  which  is  either  eliminated,  or expanded to two untyped
       blanks.

       You can determine the kind of terminal you have by clearing the  screen
       and  then  typing  text separated by cursor motions.  Type "abc    def"
       using local cursor motions (not  spaces)  between  the  "abc"  and  the
       "def".   Then position the cursor before the "abc" and put the terminal
       in insert mode.  If typing characters causes the rest of  the  line  to
       shift  rigidly  and  characters to fall off the end, then your terminal
       does not distinguish between blanks  and  untyped  positions.   If  the
       "abc"  shifts over to the "def" which then move together around the end
       of the current line and onto the next  as  you  insert,  you  have  the
       second  type  of  terminal,  and  should  give the capability <STRONG>in</STRONG>, which
       stands for "insert null".

       While these are two logically  separate  attributes  (one  line  versus
       multi-line  insert  mode,  and  special treatment of untyped spaces) we
       have seen no terminals whose insert mode cannot be described  with  the
       single attribute.

       Terminfo  can  describe  both  terminals which have an insert mode, and
       terminals which send a simple sequence to open a blank position on  the
       current line.  Give as <STRONG>smir</STRONG> the sequence to get into insert mode.  Give
       as <STRONG>rmir</STRONG> the sequence to leave  insert  mode.   Now  give  as  <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>  any
       sequence  needed  to  be  sent  just before sending the character to be
       inserted.  Most terminals with a true insert mode will not  give  <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>;
       terminals  which  send a sequence to open a screen position should give
       it here.

       If your terminal has both, insert mode is usually preferable  to  <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>.
       Technically,  you  should  not  give  both unless the terminal actually
       requires both to be used in combination.  Accordingly, some  non-curses
       applications  get  confused if both are present; the symptom is doubled
       characters in an update using insert.  This requirement  is  now  rare;
       most  <STRONG>ich</STRONG>  sequences do not require previous smir, and most smir insert
       modes do not require <STRONG>ich1</STRONG> before each character.   Therefore,  the  new
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  actually  assumes this is the case and uses either <STRONG>rmir</STRONG>/<STRONG>smir</STRONG> or
       <STRONG>ich</STRONG>/<STRONG>ich1</STRONG> as appropriate (but not both).  If you have to write an  entry
       to  be  used  under  new curses for a terminal old enough to need both,
       include the <STRONG>rmir</STRONG>/<STRONG>smir</STRONG> sequences in <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>.

       If post insert padding is needed, give this as a number of milliseconds
       in  <STRONG>ip</STRONG> (a string option).  Any other sequence which may need to be sent
       after an insert of a single character may also be given in <STRONG>ip</STRONG>.  If your
       terminal  needs  both  to be placed into an "insert mode" and a special
       code to precede each inserted character, then both <STRONG>smir</STRONG>/<STRONG>rmir</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>
       can  be  given,  and  both  will be used.  The <STRONG>ich</STRONG> capability, with one
       parameter, <EM>n</EM>, will repeat the effects of <STRONG>ich1</STRONG> <EM>n</EM> times.

       If padding is necessary between characters typed while  not  in  insert
       mode, give this as a number of milliseconds padding in <STRONG>rmp</STRONG>.

       It  is  occasionally  necessary  to move around while in insert mode to
       delete characters on the same line (e.g., if there is a tab  after  the
       insertion  position).   If  your terminal allows motion while in insert
       mode you can give the capability <STRONG>mir</STRONG> to  speed  up  inserting  in  this
       case.   Omitting  <STRONG>mir</STRONG>  will affect only speed.  Some terminals (notably
       Datamedia's) must not have <STRONG>mir</STRONG> because of the  way  their  insert  mode
       works.

       Finally,  you  can  specify <STRONG>dch1</STRONG> to delete a single character, <STRONG>dch</STRONG> with
       one parameter, <EM>n</EM>, to delete <EM>n</EM>characters, and delete mode by giving <STRONG>smdc</STRONG>
       and  <STRONG>rmdc</STRONG> to enter and exit delete mode (any mode the terminal needs to
       be placed in for <STRONG>dch1</STRONG> to work).

       A command to erase <EM>n</EM> characters  (equivalent  to  outputting  <EM>n</EM>  blanks
       without moving the cursor) can be given as <STRONG>ech</STRONG> with one parameter.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Highlighting_Underlining_and-Visible-Bells">Highlighting, Underlining, and Visible Bells</a></H3><PRE>
       If your terminal has one or more kinds of display attributes, these can
       be represented in a number of different ways.  You  should  choose  one
       display  form  as  <EM>standout</EM>  <EM>mode</EM>,  representing a good, high contrast,
       easy-on-the-eyes, format for  highlighting  error  messages  and  other
       attention  getters.   (If  you  have a choice, reverse video plus half-
       bright is good, or reverse video alone.)  The sequences  to  enter  and
       exit  standout  mode  are given as <STRONG>smso</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmso</STRONG>, respectively.  If the
       code to change into or out of standout mode  leaves  one  or  even  two
       blank  spaces  on  the screen, as the TVI 912 and Teleray 1061 do, then
       <STRONG>xmc</STRONG> should be given to tell how many spaces are left.

       Codes to begin underlining and end underlining can be given as <STRONG>smul</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>rmul</STRONG> respectively.  If the terminal has a code to underline the current
       character and move the cursor one space  to  the  right,  such  as  the
       Microterm Mime, this can be given as <STRONG>uc</STRONG>.

       Other  capabilities  to  enter various highlighting modes include <STRONG>blink</STRONG>
       (blinking) <STRONG>bold</STRONG> (bold or extra bright) <STRONG>dim</STRONG> (dim or  half-bright)  <STRONG>invis</STRONG>
       (blanking  or invisible text) <STRONG>prot</STRONG> (protected) <STRONG>rev</STRONG> (reverse video) <STRONG>sgr0</STRONG>
       (turn off <EM>all</EM> attribute modes) <STRONG>smacs</STRONG>  (enter  alternate  character  set
       mode) and <STRONG>rmacs</STRONG> (exit alternate character set mode).  Turning on any of
       these modes singly may or may not turn off other modes.

       If there is a sequence to set arbitrary  combinations  of  modes,  this
       should  be  given  as  <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> (set attributes), taking 9 parameters.  Each
       parameter is either zero (0) or nonzero, as the corresponding attribute
       is  on  or  off.   The 9 parameters are, in order: standout, underline,
       reverse, blink, dim, bold, blank,  protect,  alternate  character  set.
       Not  all  modes  need  be  supported  by  <STRONG>sgr</STRONG>,  only  those  for  which
       corresponding separate attribute commands exist.

       For example, the DEC vt220 supports most of the modes:

                   <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameter</STRONG>   <STRONG>Attribute</STRONG>    <STRONG>Escape</STRONG> <STRONG>Sequence</STRONG>
                   ------------------------------------------------
                   none              none         \E[0m
                   p1                standout     \E[0;1;7m
                   p2                underline    \E[0;4m
                   p3                reverse      \E[0;7m
                   p4                blink        \E[0;5m
                   p5                dim          not available
                   p6                bold         \E[0;1m
                   p7                invis        \E[0;8m
                   p8                protect      not used
                   p9                altcharset   ^O (off) ^N (on)

       We begin each escape sequence by turning off any existing modes,  since
       there  is  no quick way to determine whether they are active.  Standout
       is set up to be  the  combination  of  reverse  and  bold.   The  vt220
       terminal  has  a  protect  mode,  though it is not commonly used in sgr
       because it protects characters on the screen from the host's  erasures.
       The  altcharset  mode  also is different in that it is either ^O or ^N,
       depending on whether it is off or on.  If all modes are turned on,  the
       resulting sequence is \E[0;1;4;5;7;8m^N.

       Some  sequences  are  common  to  different  modes.  For example, ;7 is
       output when either p1 or p3 is true, that is,  if  either  standout  or
       reverse modes are turned on.

       Writing out the above sequences, along with their dependencies yields

                 <STRONG>Sequence</STRONG>   <STRONG>When</STRONG> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <STRONG>Output</STRONG>      <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> <STRONG>Translation</STRONG>
                 ----------------------------------------------------
                 \E[0       always              \E[0
                 ;1         if p1 or p6         %?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;
                 ;4         if p2               %?%p2%|%t;4%;
                 ;5         if p4               %?%p4%|%t;5%;
                 ;7         if p1 or p3         %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
                 ;8         if p7               %?%p7%|%t;8%;
                 m          always              m
                 ^N or ^O   if p9 ^N, else ^O   %?%p9%t^N%e^O%;

       Putting this all together into the sgr sequence gives:

           sgr=\E[0%?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p4%t;5%;
               %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;%?%p7%t;8%;m%?%p9%t\016%e\017%;,

       Remember  that  if  you specify sgr, you must also specify sgr0.  Also,
       some implementations rely on sgr  being  given  if  sgr0  is,  Not  all
       terminfo  entries  necessarily  have  an  sgr  string,  however.   Many
       terminfo entries are derived from termcap entries  which  have  no  sgr
       string.  The only drawback to adding an sgr string is that termcap also
       assumes that sgr0 does not exit alternate character set mode.

       Terminals  with  the  "magic  cookie"  glitch  (<STRONG>xmc</STRONG>)  deposit   special
       "cookies"  when  they  receive mode-setting sequences, which affect the
       display algorithm rather than having extra  bits  for  each  character.
       Some  terminals, such as the HP 2621, automatically leave standout mode
       when they move to a new line or  the  cursor  is  addressed.   Programs
       using  standout mode should exit standout mode before moving the cursor
       or sending a newline, unless the <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> capability, asserting that it  is
       safe to move in standout mode, is present.

       If  the  terminal has a way of flashing the screen to indicate an error
       quietly (a bell replacement) then this can be given as <STRONG>flash</STRONG>;  it  must
       not move the cursor.

       If  the cursor needs to be made more visible than normal when it is not
       on the bottom line (to make, for example, a non-blinking underline into
       an  easier  to  find block or blinking underline) give this sequence as
       <STRONG>cvvis</STRONG>.  If there is a way to make the cursor completely invisible, give
       that  as  <STRONG>civis</STRONG>.  The capability <STRONG>cnorm</STRONG> should be given which undoes the
       effects of both of these modes.

       If your terminal correctly generates  underlined  characters  (with  no
       special  codes  needed)  even  though  it does not overstrike, then you
       should give the capability <STRONG>ul</STRONG>.  If  a  character  overstriking  another
       leaves  both  characters  on the screen, specify the capability <STRONG>os</STRONG>.  If
       overstrikes are erasable with a blank, then this should be indicated by
       giving <STRONG>eo</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Keypad-and-Function-Keys">Keypad and Function Keys</a></H3><PRE>
       If  the  terminal  has  a keypad that transmits codes when the keys are
       pressed, this information can be given.  Note that it is  not  possible
       to handle terminals where the keypad only works in local (this applies,
       for example, to the unshifted HP 2621 keys).  If the keypad can be  set
       to  transmit  or  not  transmit,  give  these  codes  as <STRONG>smkx</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmkx</STRONG>.
       Otherwise the keypad is assumed to always transmit.

       The codes sent by the left arrow, right arrow, up  arrow,  down  arrow,
       and  home  keys  can  be given as <STRONG>kcub1,</STRONG> <STRONG>kcuf1,</STRONG> <STRONG>kcuu1,</STRONG> <STRONG>kcud1,</STRONG> and <STRONG>khome</STRONG>
       respectively.  If there are function keys such as f0, f1, ..., f10, the
       codes  they  send  can  be given as <STRONG>kf0,</STRONG> <STRONG>kf1,</STRONG> <STRONG>...,</STRONG> <STRONG>kf10</STRONG>.  If these keys
       have labels other than the default f0 through f10, the  labels  can  be
       given as <STRONG>lf0,</STRONG> <STRONG>lf1,</STRONG> <STRONG>...,</STRONG> <STRONG>lf10</STRONG>.

       The codes transmitted by certain other special keys can be given:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kll</STRONG> (home down),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kbs</STRONG> (backspace),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>ktbc</STRONG> (clear all tabs),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kctab</STRONG> (clear the tab stop in this column),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kclr</STRONG> (clear screen or erase key),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kdch1</STRONG> (delete character),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kdl1</STRONG> (delete line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>krmir</STRONG> (exit insert mode),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kel</STRONG> (clear to end of line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>ked</STRONG> (clear to end of screen),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kich1</STRONG> (insert character or enter insert mode),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kil1</STRONG> (insert line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>knp</STRONG> (next page),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kpp</STRONG> (previous page),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kind</STRONG> (scroll forward/down),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kri</STRONG> (scroll backward/up),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>khts</STRONG> (set a tab stop in this column).

       In  addition,  if  the  keypad has a 3 by 3 array of keys including the
       four arrow keys, the other five keys can be given  as  <STRONG>ka1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>ka3</STRONG>,  <STRONG>kb2</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>kc1</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>kc3</STRONG>.   These  keys  are  useful when the effects of a 3 by 3
       directional pad are needed.

       Strings to program function keys can be given as <STRONG>pfkey</STRONG>, <STRONG>pfloc</STRONG>, and <STRONG>pfx</STRONG>.
       A  string to program screen labels should be specified as <STRONG>pln</STRONG>.  Each of
       these strings takes two parameters: the function key number to  program
       (from 0 to 10) and the string to program it with.  Function key numbers
       out of this range may program undefined keys in  a  terminal  dependent
       manner.   The  difference between the capabilities is that <STRONG>pfkey</STRONG> causes
       pressing the given key to be the same as  the  user  typing  the  given
       string;  <STRONG>pfloc</STRONG>  causes  the  string  to  be executed by the terminal in
       local; and <STRONG>pfx</STRONG> causes the string to be transmitted to the computer.

       The capabilities <STRONG>nlab</STRONG>, <STRONG>lw</STRONG> and <STRONG>lh</STRONG>  define  the  number  of  programmable
       screen  labels  and  their  width and height.  If there are commands to
       turn the labels on and off, give  them  in  <STRONG>smln</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>rmln</STRONG>.   <STRONG>smln</STRONG>  is
       normally  output  after one or more pln sequences to make sure that the
       change becomes visible.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Tabs-and-Initialization">Tabs and Initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       A few capabilities are used only for tabs:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the terminal has hardware tabs, the command to  advance  to  the
           next tab stop can be given as <STRONG>ht</STRONG> (usually control/I).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A "back-tab" command which moves leftward to the preceding tab stop
           can be given as <STRONG>cbt</STRONG>.

           By convention, if the teletype modes indicate that tabs  are  being
           expanded  by  the  computer rather than being sent to the terminal,
           programs should not use <STRONG>ht</STRONG> or <STRONG>cbt</STRONG> even if they are  present,  since
           the user may not have the tab stops properly set.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  the  terminal has hardware tabs which are initially set every <EM>n</EM>
           spaces when the terminal is powered up, the numeric parameter <STRONG>it</STRONG> is
           given, showing the number of spaces the tabs are set to.

           The <STRONG>it</STRONG> capability is normally used by the <STRONG>tset</STRONG> command to determine
           whether to set the mode for hardware tab expansion, and whether  to
           set the tab stops.  If the terminal has tab stops that can be saved
           in non-volatile memory, the terminfo description  can  assume  that
           they are properly set.

       Other capabilities include

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>is1</STRONG>, <STRONG>is2</STRONG>, and <STRONG>is3</STRONG>, initialization strings for the terminal,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>,  the  path  name  of  a  program to be run to initialize the
           terminal,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and <STRONG>if</STRONG>, the name of a file containing long initialization strings.

       These strings are expected to set the terminal  into  modes  consistent
       with  the  rest of the terminfo description.  They are normally sent to
       the terminal, by the <EM>init</EM> option of the <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  program,  each  time  the
       user logs in.  They will be printed in the following order:

              run the program
                     <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>

              output
                     <STRONG>is1</STRONG> and
                     <STRONG>is2</STRONG>

              set the margins using
                     <STRONG>mgc</STRONG> or
                     <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG> or
                     <STRONG>smgl</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgr</STRONG>

              set tabs using
                     <STRONG>tbc</STRONG> and <STRONG>hts</STRONG>

              print the file
                     <STRONG>if</STRONG>

              and finally output
                     <STRONG>is3</STRONG>.

       Most  initialization  is  done with <STRONG>is2</STRONG>.  Special terminal modes can be
       set up without duplicating strings by putting the common  sequences  in
       <STRONG>is2</STRONG> and special cases in <STRONG>is1</STRONG> and <STRONG>is3</STRONG>.

       A  set  of  sequences  that  does a harder reset from a totally unknown
       state can be given as <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rf</STRONG> and <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, analogous to <STRONG>is1</STRONG> <STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>is2</STRONG> <STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>if</STRONG>
       and  <STRONG>is3</STRONG>  respectively.   These  strings  are output by <EM>reset</EM> option of
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>, or by the <STRONG>reset</STRONG> program (an alias of <STRONG>tset</STRONG>), which  is  used  when
       the terminal gets into a wedged state.  Commands are normally placed in
       <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG> <STRONG>rs3</STRONG> and <STRONG>rf</STRONG> only if they produce annoying effects on the screen
       and are not necessary when logging in.  For example, the command to set
       the vt100 into 80-column mode would normally be part  of  <STRONG>is2</STRONG>,  but  it
       causes  an  annoying  glitch  of  the screen and is not normally needed
       since the terminal is usually already in 80-column mode.

       The <STRONG>reset</STRONG> program writes strings including <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>,  etc.,  in  the  same
       order  as  the  <EM>init</EM> program, using <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, etc., instead of <STRONG>is1</STRONG>, etc.  If
       any of <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, or <STRONG>rf</STRONG> reset capability strings are  missing,  the
       <STRONG>reset</STRONG>   program   falls  back  upon  the  corresponding  initialization
       capability string.

       If there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can be given  as
       <STRONG>tbc</STRONG> (clear all tab stops) and <STRONG>hts</STRONG> (set a tab stop in the current column
       of every row).  If a more complex sequence is needed to  set  the  tabs
       than can be described by this, the sequence can be placed in <STRONG>is2</STRONG> or <STRONG>if</STRONG>.

       The  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  command uses the same capability strings as the <STRONG>reset</STRONG>
       command, although the two programs (<STRONG>tput</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG>)  provide  different
       command-line options.

       In  practice,  these  terminfo  capabilities  are  not  often  used  in
       initialization of tabs (though they are required for the <STRONG>tabs</STRONG> program):

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Almost all hardware terminals (at least those which supported tabs)
           initialized those to every <EM>eight</EM> columns:

           The  only  exception  was  the  AT&amp;T 2300 series, which set tabs to
           every <EM>five</EM> columns.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In particular, developers  of  the  hardware  terminals  which  are
           commonly  used  as  models  for  modern terminal emulators provided
           documentation demonstrating that <EM>eight</EM> columns were the standard.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Because of this, the terminal initialization programs <STRONG>tput</STRONG> and <STRONG>tset</STRONG>
           use   the  <STRONG>tbc</STRONG>  (<STRONG>clear_all_tabs</STRONG>)  and  <STRONG>hts</STRONG>  (<STRONG>set_tab</STRONG>)  capabilities
           directly only when the <STRONG>it</STRONG> (<STRONG>init_tabs</STRONG>) capability is set to a  value
           other than <EM>eight</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Delays-and-Padding">Delays and Padding</a></H3><PRE>
       Many  older  and slower terminals do not support either XON/XOFF or DTR
       handshaking, including hard copy terminals and some very  archaic  CRTs
       (including,  for  example,  DEC  VT100s).   These  may  require padding
       characters after certain cursor motions and screen changes.

       If the terminal uses xon/xoff handshaking for flow control (that is, it
       automatically  emits  ^S  back  to  the host when its input buffers are
       close to full), set <STRONG>xon</STRONG>.  This capability suppresses  the  emission  of
       padding.   You  can  also  set  it  for  memory-mapped  console devices
       effectively that do not have a speed limit.  Padding information should
       still  be  included  so  that  routines can make better decisions about
       relative costs, but actual pad characters will not be transmitted.

       If <STRONG>pb</STRONG> (padding baud rate) is given, padding is suppressed at baud rates
       below  the  value  of  <STRONG>pb</STRONG>.  If the entry has no padding baud rate, then
       whether padding is emitted or not is completely controlled by <STRONG>xon</STRONG>.

       If the terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as  a  pad,
       then  this  can  be  given as <STRONG>pad</STRONG>.  Only the first character of the <STRONG>pad</STRONG>
       string is used.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Status-Lines">Status Lines</a></H3><PRE>
       Some terminals have an extra "status line" which is not  normally  used
       by software (and thus not counted in the terminal's <STRONG>lines</STRONG> capability).

       The  simplest case is a status line which is cursor-addressable but not
       part of the main scrolling region on the screen; the Heathkit H19 has a
       status  line  of  this  kind,  as  would a 24-line VT100 with a 23-line
       scrolling region set up on initialization.  This situation is indicated
       by the <STRONG>hs</STRONG> capability.

       Some  terminals  with status lines need special sequences to access the
       status line.  These may be expressed as a string with single  parameter
       <STRONG>tsl</STRONG>  which takes the cursor to a given zero-origin column on the status
       line.  The  capability  <STRONG>fsl</STRONG>  must  return  to  the  main-screen  cursor
       positions before the last <STRONG>tsl</STRONG>.  You may need to embed the string values
       of <STRONG>sc</STRONG> (save  cursor)  and  <STRONG>rc</STRONG>  (restore  cursor)  in  <STRONG>tsl</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>fsl</STRONG>  to
       accomplish this.

       The  status  line is normally assumed to be the same width as the width
       of the terminal.  If this is  untrue,  you  can  specify  it  with  the
       numeric capability <STRONG>wsl</STRONG>.

       A command to erase or blank the status line may be specified as <STRONG>dsl</STRONG>.

       The  Boolean  capability  <STRONG>eslok</STRONG>  specifies that escape sequences, tabs,
       etc., work ordinarily in the status line.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation does not yet use any of these  capabilities.
       They are documented here in case they ever become important.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Line-Graphics">Line Graphics</a></H3><PRE>
       Many  terminals have alternate character sets useful for forms-drawing.
       Terminfo and <STRONG>curses</STRONG> have built-in  support  for  most  of  the  drawing
       characters  supported  by the VT100, with some characters from the AT&amp;T
       4410v1 added.  This alternate character set may  be  specified  by  the
       <STRONG>acsc</STRONG> capability.

       A few notes apply to the table itself:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open  Curses  incorrectly  states that the mapping for <EM>lantern</EM> is
           uppercase "I" although Unix implementations use the  lowercase  "i"
           mapping.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  DEC  VT100  implemented graphics using the alternate character
           set feature, temporarily switching <EM>modes</EM> and sending characters  in
           the  range  0x60  (96)  to 0x7e (126) (the <STRONG>acsc</STRONG> <STRONG>Value</STRONG> column in the
           table).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The AT&amp;T terminal added graphics characters outside that range.

           Some of the characters within the range do  not  match  the  VT100;
           presumably  they  were  used in the AT&amp;T terminal: <EM>board</EM> <EM>of</EM> <EM>squares</EM>
           replaces the VT100 <EM>newline</EM> symbol, while  <EM>lantern</EM>  <EM>symbol</EM>  replaces
           the VT100 <EM>vertical</EM> <EM>tab</EM> symbol.  The other VT100 symbols for control
           characters (<EM>horizontal</EM> <EM>tab</EM>, <EM>carriage</EM> <EM>return</EM> and <EM>line-feed</EM>) are  not
           (re)used in curses.

       The  best  way to define a new device's graphics set is to add a column
       to a copy of this table for your terminal, giving the  character  which
       (when  emitted  between  <STRONG>smacs</STRONG>/<STRONG>rmacs</STRONG>  switches) will be rendered as the
       corresponding graphic.  Then read off the VT100/your terminal character
       pairs right to left in sequence; these become the ACSC string.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Color-Handling">Color Handling</a></H3><PRE>
       The  curses  library  functions <STRONG>init_pair</STRONG> and <STRONG>init_color</STRONG> manipulate the
       <EM>color</EM>  <EM>pairs</EM>  and  <EM>color</EM>  <EM>values</EM>  discussed  in   this   section   (see
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">curs_color(3x)</A></STRONG> for details on these and related functions).

       Most color terminals are either "Tektronix-like" or "HP-like":

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Tektronix-like terminals have a predefined set of <EM>N</EM> colors (where <EM>N</EM>
           is usually 8), and can set character-cell foreground and background
           characters independently, mixing them into <EM>N</EM> * <EM>N</EM> color pairs.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On  HP-like  terminals,  the  user  must  set  each  color  pair up
           separately  (foreground  and  background  are   not   independently
           settable).   Up  to  <EM>M</EM> color pairs may be set up from 2*<EM>M</EM> different
           colors.  ANSI-compatible terminals are Tektronix-like.

       Some basic color capabilities are independent of the color method.  The
       numeric  capabilities  <STRONG>colors</STRONG>  and <STRONG>pairs</STRONG> specify the maximum numbers of
       colors and color pairs that can be displayed  simultaneously.   The  <STRONG>op</STRONG>
       (original pair) string resets foreground and background colors to their
       default values for the terminal.  The <STRONG>oc</STRONG> string resets  all  colors  or
       color  pairs  to their default values for the terminal.  Some terminals
       (including many PC terminal emulators)  erase  screen  areas  with  the
       current  background  color rather than the power-up default background;
       these should have the Boolean capability <STRONG>bce</STRONG>.

       While the  curses  library  works  with  <EM>color</EM>  <EM>pairs</EM>  (reflecting  the
       inability  of  some  devices  to  set  foreground and background colors
       independently), there  are  separate  capabilities  for  setting  these
       features:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   To   change  the  current  foreground  or  background  color  on  a
           Tektronix-type terminal, use <STRONG>setaf</STRONG> (set ANSI foreground) and  <STRONG>setab</STRONG>
           (set  ANSI  background)  or  <STRONG>setf</STRONG>  (set  foreground)  and <STRONG>setb</STRONG> (set
           background).  These take one parameter, the color number.  The SVr4
           documentation  describes only <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG>; the XPG4 draft says that
           "If the terminal supports ANSI escape sequences to  set  background
           and   foreground,   they  should  be  coded  as  <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>setab</STRONG>,
           respectively.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the terminal supports other escape sequences to  set  background
           and   foreground,   they   should   be  coded  as  <STRONG>setf</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>setb</STRONG>,
           respectively.  The <STRONG>vidputs</STRONG> and the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG>  functions  use  the
           <STRONG>setaf</STRONG> and <STRONG>setab</STRONG> capabilities if they are defined.

       The  <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>setf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setb</STRONG>  capabilities  take  a  single numeric
       argument each.  Argument values 0-7 of <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG> are portably defined
       as  follows (the middle column is the symbolic #define available in the
       header for the <STRONG>curses</STRONG> or <EM>ncurses</EM> libraries).  The terminal hardware  is
       free  to  map  these  as  it  likes, but the RGB values indicate normal
       locations in color space.

       It  is  important  to  not  confuse the two sets of color capabilities;
       otherwise red/blue will be interchanged on the display.

       On an HP-like terminal, use <STRONG>scp</STRONG> with a color pair number  parameter  to
       set which color pair is current.

       Some terminals allow the <EM>color</EM> <EM>values</EM> to be modified:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On  a Tektronix-like terminal, the capability <STRONG>ccc</STRONG> may be present to
           indicate that colors can be modified.  If so, the <STRONG>initc</STRONG>  capability
           will take a color number (0 to <STRONG>colors</STRONG> - 1)and three more parameters
           which describe the color.  These three parameters default to  being
           interpreted  as  RGB  (Red,  Green,  Blue)  values.  If the Boolean
           capability <STRONG>hls</STRONG> is present, they are instead as HLS (Hue, Lightness,
           Saturation) indices.  The ranges are terminal-dependent.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On  an HP-like terminal, <STRONG>initp</STRONG> may give a capability for changing a
           color pair value.  It will take  seven  parameters;  a  color  pair
           number  (0  to  <STRONG>max_pairs</STRONG>  -  1),  and two triples describing first
           background and then foreground colors.  These  parameters  must  be
           (Red,  Green,  Blue)  or  (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) depending on
           <STRONG>hls</STRONG>.

       On some color terminals,  colors  collide  with  highlights.   You  can
       register  these collisions with the <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> capability.  This is a bit mask
       of  attributes  not  to  be  used  when  colors   are   enabled.    The
       correspondence with the attributes understood by <STRONG>curses</STRONG> is as follows:

                         <STRONG>Attribute</STRONG>     <STRONG>Bit</STRONG>   <STRONG>Decimal</STRONG>   <STRONG>Set</STRONG> <STRONG>by</STRONG>

       For  example, on many IBM PC consoles, the underline attribute collides
       with the foreground color blue and is  not  available  in  color  mode.
       These should have an <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> capability of 2.

       SVr4  curses does nothing with <STRONG>ncv</STRONG>, <EM>ncurses</EM> recognizes it and optimizes
       the output in favor of colors.

       If the terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as  a  pad,
       then  this  can  be  given as pad.  Only the first character of the pad
       string is used.  If the terminal does not have a pad character, specify
       npc.   Note that <EM>ncurses</EM> implements the termcap-compatible <STRONG>PC</STRONG> variable;
       though the application may set this value to  something  other  than  a
       null,  <EM>ncurses</EM> will test <STRONG>npc</STRONG> first and use napms if the terminal has no
       pad character.

       If the terminal can move up or down half a line, this can be  indicated
       with  <STRONG>hu</STRONG>  (half-line  up)  and  <STRONG>hd</STRONG> (half-line down).  This is primarily
       useful for superscripts and subscripts on hard-copy  terminals.   If  a
       hard-copy terminal can eject to the next page (form feed), give this as
       <STRONG>ff</STRONG> (usually control/L).

       If there is a command to repeat a given character  a  given  number  of
       times   (to   save  time  transmitting  a  large  number  of  identical
       characters) this can be indicated with the  parameterized  string  <STRONG>rep</STRONG>.
       The  first  parameter is the character to be repeated and the second is
       the number of times to repeat it.  Thus, tparm(repeat_char, 'x', 10) is
       the same as "xxxxxxxxxx".

       If the terminal has a settable command character, such as the TEKTRONIX
       4025, this can be indicated with <STRONG>cmdch</STRONG>.  A prototype command  character
       is  chosen  which is used in all capabilities.  This character is given
       in the <STRONG>cmdch</STRONG> capability to identify it.  The  following  convention  is
       supported on some Unix systems: The environment is to be searched for a
       <STRONG>CC</STRONG> variable, and if found, all occurrences of the  prototype  character
       are replaced with the character in the environment variable.

       Terminal  descriptions  that  do not represent a specific kind of known
       terminal, such as <EM>switch</EM>, <EM>dialup</EM>, <EM>patch</EM>, and  <EM>network</EM>,  should  include
       the  <STRONG>gn</STRONG> (generic) capability so that programs can complain that they do
       not know how to talk to the terminal.  (This capability does not  apply
       to  <EM>virtual</EM>  terminal  descriptions  for which the escape sequences are
       known.)

       If the terminal has a "meta key" which acts as a shift key, setting the
       8th  bit  of any character transmitted, this fact can be indicated with
       <STRONG>km</STRONG>.  Otherwise, software will assume that the 8th bit is parity and  it
       will  usually be cleared.  If strings exist to turn this "meta mode" on
       and off, they can be given as <STRONG>smm</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmm</STRONG>.

       If the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on the screen at
       once,  the number of lines of memory can be indicated with <STRONG>lm</STRONG>.  A value
       of <STRONG>lm</STRONG>#0 indicates that the number of lines is not fixed, but that there
       is still more memory than fits on the screen.

       If  the terminal is one of those supported by the Unix virtual terminal
       protocol, the terminal number can be given as <STRONG>vt</STRONG>.

       Media copy strings which control an auxiliary printer connected to  the
       terminal  can  be  given as <STRONG>mc0</STRONG>: print the contents of the screen, <STRONG>mc4</STRONG>:
       turn off the printer, and <STRONG>mc5</STRONG>: turn on the printer.  When  the  printer
       is  on,  all text sent to the terminal will be sent to the printer.  It
       is undefined whether the text is also displayed on the terminal  screen
       when  the  printer  is  on.   A variation <STRONG>mc5p</STRONG> takes one parameter, and
       leaves the printer on for as  many  characters  as  the  value  of  the
       parameter, then turns the printer off.  The parameter should not exceed
       255.  All text, including <STRONG>mc4</STRONG>, is transparently passed to  the  printer
       while an <STRONG>mc5p</STRONG> is in effect.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Glitches-and-Brain-Damage">Glitches and Brain Damage</a></H3><PRE>
       Hazeltine  terminals, which do not allow "~" characters to be displayed
       should indicate <STRONG>hz</STRONG>.

       Terminals which ignore a line-feed immediately after an <STRONG>am</STRONG>  wrap,  such
       as the Concept and vt100, should indicate <STRONG>xenl</STRONG>.

       If  <STRONG>el</STRONG>  is  required  to get rid of standout (instead of merely writing
       normal text on top of it), <STRONG>xhp</STRONG> should be given.

       Teleray terminals, where tabs turn all characters moved over to blanks,
       should  indicate  <STRONG>xt</STRONG> (destructive tabs).  Note: the variable indicating
       this  is  now  "dest_tabs_magic_smso";  in  older  versions,   it   was
       teleray_glitch.   This  glitch  is  also  taken  to mean that it is not
       possible to position the cursor on top of a  "magic  cookie",  that  to
       erase  standout  mode  it is instead necessary to use delete and insert
       line.  The <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation ignores this glitch.

       The Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly transmit the  escape
       or  control/C  characters,  has <STRONG>xsb</STRONG>, indicating that the f1 key is used
       for escape and f2 for control/C.  (Only  certain  Superbees  have  this
       problem,  depending on the ROM.)  Note that in older terminfo versions,
       this capability was called "beehive_glitch"; it is now "no_esc_ctl_c".

       Other specific terminal  problems  may  be  corrected  by  adding  more
       capabilities of the form <STRONG>x</STRONG><EM>x</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Pitfalls-of-Long-Entries">Pitfalls of Long Entries</a></H3><PRE>
       Long  terminfo  entries are unlikely to be a problem; to date, no entry
       has  even  approached  terminfo's   4096-byte   string-table   maximum.
       Unfortunately,  the termcap translations are much more strictly limited
       (to 1023 bytes), thus termcap translations of long terminfo entries can
       cause problems.

       The  man  pages  for  4.3BSD and older versions of <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> instruct the
       user to allocate a 1024-byte buffer for the termcap entry.   The  entry
       gets  null-terminated by the termcap library, so that makes the maximum
       safe length for a termcap entry 1k-1 (1023) bytes.  Depending  on  what
       the  application  and the termcap library being used does, and where in
       the termcap file the terminal type that <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> is  searching  for  is,
       several bad things can happen:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some termcap libraries print a warning message,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some exit if they find an entry that's longer than 1023 bytes,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some neither exit nor warn, doing nothing useful, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some simply truncate the entries to 1023 bytes.

       Some application programs allocate more than the recommended 1K for the
       termcap entry; others do not.

       Each termcap entry has two important sizes associated with  it:  before
       "tc"  expansion, and after "tc" expansion.  "tc" is the capability that
       tacks on another termcap entry to the end of the current one, to add on
       its capabilities.  If a termcap entry does not use the "tc" capability,
       then of course the two lengths are the same.

       The "before tc expansion" length is the most important one, because  it
       affects  more than just users of that particular terminal.  This is the
       length of the entry as it exists in /etc/termcap, minus the  backslash-
       newline pairs, which <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> strips out while reading it.  Some termcap
       libraries strip off the final newline, too (GNU termcap does not).  Now
       suppose:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a termcap entry before expansion is more than 1023 bytes long,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and the application has only allocated a 1k buffer,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and  the termcap library (like the one in BSD/OS 1.1 and GNU) reads
           the whole entry into the buffer, no matter what its length, to  see
           if it is the entry it wants,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  is  searching  for a terminal type that either is the
           long entry, appears in the termcap file after the  long  entry,  or
           does  not  appear in the file at all (so that <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> has to search
           the whole termcap file).

       Then <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> will overwrite memory, perhaps  its  stack,  and  probably
       core   dump   the  program.   Programs  like  telnet  are  particularly
       vulnerable; modern telnets pass along values  like  the  terminal  type
       automatically.   The  results  are almost as undesirable with a termcap
       library, like SunOS 4.1.3 and Ultrix 4.4, that prints warning  messages
       when  it  reads  an  overly  long  termcap entry.  If a termcap library
       truncates long entries, like OSF/1 3.0, it is immune to dying here  but
       will return incorrect data for the terminal.

       The  "after  tc  expansion"  length  will  have a similar effect to the
       above, but only for people who actually set <EM>TERM</EM> to that terminal type,
       since  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  only  does "tc" expansion once it is found the terminal
       type it was looking for, not while searching.

       In summary, a termcap entry that is longer than 1023 bytes  can  cause,
       on  various  combinations of termcap libraries and applications, a core
       dump, warnings, or incorrect operation.  If it is too long even  before
       "tc"  expansion,  it will have this effect even for users of some other
       terminal types and users whose <EM>TERM</EM> variable does not  have  a  termcap
       entry.

       When  in  -C (translate to termcap) mode, the <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation of
       <STRONG><A HREF="tic.1m.html">tic(1m)</A></STRONG> issues warning messages when the pre-tc  length  of  a  termcap
       translation  is  too  long.  The -c (check) option also checks resolved
       (after tc expansion) lengths.

       Searching   for   terminal   descriptions   in   <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM>    and
       <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM> is not supported by older implementations.

       Some  SVr4  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  implementations,  and  all previous to SVr4, do not
       interpret the %A and %O operators in parameter strings.

       SVr4/XPG4 do not specify whether <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> licenses  movement  while  in  an
       alternate-character-set  mode  (such modes may, among other things, map
       CR and NL to characters  that  do  not  trigger  local  motions).   The
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  implementation  ignores  <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> in <STRONG>ALTCHARSET</STRONG> mode.  This raises
       the  possibility  that  an  XPG4  implementation  making  the  opposite
       interpretation  may need terminfo entries made for <EM>ncurses</EM> to have <STRONG>msgr</STRONG>
       turned off.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> library handles insert-character and insert-character modes
       in  a  slightly  non-standard way to get better update efficiency.  See
       the <STRONG>Insert/Delete</STRONG> <STRONG>Character</STRONG> subsection above.

       The parameter substitutions for <STRONG>set_clock</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>display_clock</STRONG>  are  not
       documented  in  SVr4  or  X/Open  Curses.   They  are  deduced from the
       documentation for the AT&amp;T 505 terminal.

       Be careful assigning the <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> capability.  The <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  wants
       to  interpret  it as <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>, for use by terminals and emulators like
       xterm that can return mouse-tracking information in the  keyboard-input
       stream.

       X/Open  Curses  does  not  mention italics.  Portable applications must
       assume that  numeric  capabilities  are  signed  16-bit  values.   This
       includes  the  <EM>no</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>color</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>video</EM>  (<STRONG>ncv</STRONG>)  capability.  The 32768 mask value
       used for italics with <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> can be confused with an absent  or  cancelled
       <STRONG>ncv</STRONG>.   If  italics  should work with colors, then the <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> value must be
       specified, even if it is zero.

       Different commercial ports of <EM>terminfo</EM>  and  <EM>curses</EM>  support  different
       subsets  of  X/Open  Curses  and  (in some cases) different extensions.
       Here is a summary,  accurate  as  of  October  1995,  after  which  the
       commercial Unix market contracted and lost diversity.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4, Solaris, and <EM>ncurses</EM> support all SVr4 capabilities.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   IRIX  supports  the  SVr4  set  and  adds one undocumented extended
           string capability (<STRONG>set_pglen</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr1  and  Ultrix  support  a   restricted   subset   of   <EM>terminfo</EM>
           capabilities.   The  Booleans  end with <STRONG>xon_xoff</STRONG>; the numerics with
           <STRONG>width_status_line</STRONG>; and the strings with <STRONG>prtr_non</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   HP/UX  supports  the  SVr1  subset,  plus  the  SVr[234]   numerics
           <STRONG>num_labels</STRONG>,   <STRONG>label_height</STRONG>,  <STRONG>label_width</STRONG>,  plus  function  keys  11
           through 63, plus <STRONG>plab_norm</STRONG>, <STRONG>label_on</STRONG>, and <STRONG>label_off</STRONG>, plus a  number
           of incompatible string table extensions.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   AIX  supports  the  SVr1  subset, plus function keys 11 through 63,
           plus a number of incompatible string table extensions.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   OSF/1 supports both the SVr4 set and the AIX extensions.
