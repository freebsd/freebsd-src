</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>menu_driver</STRONG> - command-processing loop of the menu system


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;menu.h&gt;</STRONG>
       int menu_driver(MENU *menu, int c);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Once a menu has been posted (displayed), you should funnel
       input events to it through <STRONG>menu_driver</STRONG>.  This routine  has
       three major input cases:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  input  is  a form navigation request.  Navigation
           request codes are constants defined in <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG>, which
           are   distinct  from  the  key-  and  character  codes
           returned by <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The input is a printable character.  Printable charac-
           ters  (which  must  be  positive,  less  than 256) are
           checked according to the program's locale settings.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The input is the KEY_MOUSE special key associated with
           an mouse event.

       The menu driver requests are as follows:

       REQ_LEFT_ITEM
            Move left to an item.

       REQ_RIGHT_ITEM
            Move right to an item.

       REQ_UP_ITEM
            Move up to an item.

       REQ_DOWN_ITEM
            Move down to an item.

       REQ_SCR_ULINE
            Scroll up a line.

       REQ_SCR_DLINE
            Scroll down a line.

       REQ_SCR_DPAGE
            Scroll down a page.

       REQ_SCR_UPAGE
            Scroll up a page.

       REQ_FIRST_ITEM
            Move to the first item.

       REQ_LAST_ITEM
            Move to the last item.

       REQ_NEXT_ITEM
            Move to the next item.

       REQ_PREV_ITEM
            Move to the previous item.

       REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM
            Select/deselect an item.

       REQ_CLEAR_PATTERN
            Clear the menu pattern buffer.

       REQ_BACK_PATTERN
            Delete   the  previous  character  from  the  pattern
            buffer.

       REQ_NEXT_MATCH
            Move to the next item matching the pattern match.

       REQ_PREV_MATCH
            Move to the previous item matching the pattern match.

       If  the second argument is a printable character, the code
       appends it to the pattern buffer and attempts to  move  to
       the  next  item  matching the new pattern.  If there is no
       such match, <STRONG>menu_driver</STRONG> returns <STRONG>E_NO_MATCH</STRONG> and deletes the
       appended character from the buffer.

       If  the  second  argument  is one of the above pre-defined
       requests, the corresponding action is performed.

   <STRONG>MOUSE</STRONG> <STRONG>HANDLING</STRONG>
       If the second argument is the KEY_MOUSE special  key,  the
       associated mouse event is translated into one of the above
       pre-defined requests.  Currently only clicks in  the  user
       window  (e.g., inside the menu display area or the decora-
       tion window) are handled.

       If you click above the display region of the menu:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_SCR_ULINE is generated for a single click,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_SCR_UPAGE is generated for a double-click and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_FIRST_ITEM is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click below the display region of the menu:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_SCR_DLINE is generated for a single click,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_SCR_DPAGE is generated for a double-click and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a REQ_LAST_ITEM is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click at an item inside the  display  area  of  the
       menu:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the menu cursor is positioned to that item.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  you double-click an item a REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM is gen-
           erated and <STRONG>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</STRONG> is returned.  This return
           value  makes  sense,  because  a  double click usually
           means that an item-specific action should be returned.
           It is exactly the purpose of this return value to sig-
           nal that an application  specific  command  should  be
           executed.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  a translation into a request was done, <STRONG>menu_driver</STRONG>
           returns the result of this request.

       If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse  event
       could   not   be   translated   into  a  menu  request  an
       <STRONG>E_REQUEST_DENIED</STRONG> is returned.

   <STRONG>APPLICATION-DEFINED</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
       If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the
       above  pre-defined  menu  requests or KEY_MOUSE, the drive
       assumes it is an application-specific command and  returns
       <STRONG>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</STRONG>.  Application-defined commands should be
       defined relative to  <STRONG>MAX_COMMAND</STRONG>,  the  maximum  value  of
       these pre-defined requests.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>menu_driver</STRONG> return one of the following error codes:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine  detected  an incorrect or out-of-range argu-
            ment.

       <STRONG>E_BAD_STATE</STRONG>
            Routine was called from an initialization or termina-
            tion function.

       <STRONG>E_NOT_POSTED</STRONG>
            The menu has not been posted.

       <STRONG>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</STRONG>
            The menu driver code saw an unknown request code.

       <STRONG>E_NO_MATCH</STRONG>
            Character failed to match.

       <STRONG>E_REQUEST_DENIED</STRONG>
            The menu driver could not process the request.

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines emulate the System V  menu  library.   They
       were  not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions. The sup-
       port for mouse events is ncurses specific.
