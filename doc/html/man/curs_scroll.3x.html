<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>scroll</STRONG>, <STRONG>scrl</STRONG>, <STRONG>wscrl</STRONG> - scroll a <STRONG>curses</STRONG> window


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scroll(WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>*win);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>scrl(int</STRONG> <STRONG>n);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>wscrl(WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>*win,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>n);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>scroll</STRONG>  routine scrolls the window up one line.  This
       involves moving the lines in the  window  data  structure.
       As  an optimization, if the scrolling region of the window
       is the entire screen, the physical screen may be  scrolled
       at the same time.

       For  positive  <EM>n</EM>,  the  <STRONG>scrl</STRONG> and <STRONG>wscrl</STRONG> routines scroll the
       window up <EM>n</EM> lines (line <EM>i</EM>+<EM>n</EM> becomes <EM>i</EM>);  otherwise  scroll
       the  window  down <EM>n</EM> lines.  This involves moving the lines
       in the window character image structure.  The current cur-
       sor position is not changed.

       For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
       <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       These routines return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure, and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4  only
       specifies "an integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon success-
       ful completion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.

       This implementation returns an error if the window pointer
       is  null,  or  if  scrolling is not enabled in the window,
       e.g., with <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>scrl</STRONG> and <STRONG>scroll</STRONG> may be macros.

       The SVr4 documentation says that the optimization of phys-
       ically  scrolling  immediately if the scroll region is the
       entire screen "is"  performed,  not  "may  be"  performed.
       This  implementation  deliberately does not guarantee that
       this will occur, to leave open the possibility of  smarter
       optimization  of  multiple  scroll actions on the next up-
       date.

       Neither the SVr4 nor the XSI documentation specify whether
       the current attribute or current color-pair of blanks gen-
       erated by the scroll function is zeroed.  Under  this  im-
       plementation it is.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue 4 describes these func-
       tions.
