       <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> - CRT screen handling and optimization package


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library  routines  give the user a terminal-
       independent method of updating character screens with rea-
       sonable   optimization.    This  implementation  is  ``new
       curses'' (ncurses) and is  the  approved  replacement  for
       4.4BSD  classic curses, which has been discontinued.  This
       describes <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> version 5.8 (patch 20110226).

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library emulates the curses library of  System
       V  Release  4  UNIX,  and  XPG4 (X/Open Portability Guide)
       curses (also known as XSI curses).  XSI stands for  X/Open
       System  Interfaces  Extension.   The  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library  is
       freely redistributable in source form.   Differences  from
       the  SVr4  curses  are summarized under the <STRONG>EXTENSIONS</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>PORTABILITY</STRONG> sections below and described in detail in  the
       respective  <STRONG>EXTENSIONS</STRONG>,  <STRONG>PORTABILITY</STRONG>  and <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG> sections of
       individual man pages.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library also provides many useful  extensions,
       i.e.,  features  which  cannot  be implemented by a simple
       add-on library but which require access to  the  internals
       of the library.

       A  program  using  these  routines must be linked with the
       <STRONG>-lncurses</STRONG> option, or (if it has been generated)  with  the
       debugging  library  <STRONG>-lncurses_g</STRONG>.   (Your system integrator
       may also have installed these libraries  under  the  names
       <STRONG>-lcurses</STRONG> and <STRONG>-lcurses_g</STRONG>.)  The ncurses_g library generates
       trace logs (in a file called 'trace' in the current direc-
       tory)  that describe curses actions.  See also the section
       on <STRONG>ALTERNATE</STRONG> <STRONG>CONFIGURATIONS</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> package supports: overall screen,  window  and
       pad manipulation; output to windows and pads; reading ter-
       minal input; control over terminal and  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  input  and
       output  options; environment query routines; color manipu-
       lation; use of soft label keys; terminfo capabilities; and
       access to low-level terminal-manipulation routines.

       The  library uses the locale which the calling program has
       initialized.  That is normally done with <STRONG>setlocale</STRONG>:

             <STRONG>setlocale(LC_ALL,</STRONG> <STRONG>"");</STRONG>

       If the locale is not initialized, the library assumes that
       characters  are  printable  as in ISO-8859-1, to work with
       certain legacy programs.  You should initialize the locale
       and  not  rely on specific details of the library when the
       locale has not been setup.

       The function <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> must be called to initial-
       ize the library before any of the other routines that deal
       with windows and screens are  used.   The  routine  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>
       must be called before exiting.

       To  get  character-at-a-time  input  without echoing (most
       interactive, screen oriented programs want this), the fol-
       lowing sequence should be used:

             <STRONG>initscr();</STRONG> <STRONG>cbreak();</STRONG> <STRONG>noecho();</STRONG>

       Most programs would additionally use the sequence:

             <STRONG>nonl();</STRONG>
             <STRONG>intrflush(stdscr,</STRONG> <STRONG>FALSE);</STRONG>
             <STRONG>keypad(stdscr,</STRONG> <STRONG>TRUE);</STRONG>

       Before  a <STRONG>curses</STRONG> program is run, the tab stops of the ter-
       minal should be set and  its  initialization  strings,  if
       defined,  must  be  output.  This can be done by executing
       the <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>init</STRONG> command after the shell environment variable
       <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>  has  been  exported.  <STRONG>tset(1)</STRONG> is usually responsible
       for doing this.  [See <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> for further details.]

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library permits manipulation  of  data  struc-
       tures,  called  <EM>windows</EM>,  which  can be thought of as two-
       dimensional arrays of characters representing all or  part
       of a CRT screen.  A default window called <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>, which is
       the size of the terminal screen, is supplied.  Others  may
       be created with <STRONG>newwin</STRONG>.

       Note  that  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  does  not  handle overlapping windows,
       that's done by the <STRONG><A HREF="panel.3x.html">panel(3x)</A></STRONG> library.  This means that you
       can either use <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> or divide the screen into tiled win-
       dows and not using <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> at all.   Mixing  the  two  will
       result in unpredictable, and undesired, effects.

       Windows are referred to by variables declared as <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG>.
       These  data  structures  are  manipulated  with   routines
       described  here and elsewhere in the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> manual pages.
       Among those, the most basic routines are <STRONG>move</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>addch</STRONG>.
       More  general versions of these routines are included with
       names beginning with <STRONG>w</STRONG>, allowing the  user  to  specify  a
       window.   The routines not beginning with <STRONG>w</STRONG> affect <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       After using routines to manipulate a  window,  <STRONG>refresh</STRONG>  is
       called,  telling <STRONG>curses</STRONG> to make the user's CRT screen look
       like <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.  The characters in a window are  actually  of
       type  <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>, (character and attribute data) so that other
       information about the character may also  be  stored  with
       each character.

       Special  windows  called  <EM>pads</EM>  may  also  be manipulated.
       These are windows which are not constrained to the size of
       the  screen and whose contents need not be completely dis-
       played.  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_pad.3x.html">curs_pad(3x)</A></STRONG> for more information.

       In addition to drawing characters  on  the  screen,  video
       attributes  and colors may be supported, causing the char-
       acters to show up in such modes as underlined, in  reverse
       video,  or in color on terminals that support such display
       enhancements.  Line drawing characters may be specified to
       be  output.   On  input,  <STRONG>curses</STRONG> is also able to translate
       arrow and function keys  that  transmit  escape  sequences
       into  single  values.   The video attributes, line drawing
       characters,  and  input  values  use  names,  defined   in
       <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>, such as <STRONG>A_REVERSE</STRONG>, <STRONG>ACS_HLINE</STRONG>, and <STRONG>KEY_LEFT</STRONG>.

       If the environment variables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> are set, or
       if the program is executing in a window environment,  line
       and  column  information  in the environment will override
       information read by <EM>terminfo</EM>.  This would affect a program
       running  in an AT&amp;T 630 layer, for example, where the size
       of a screen is changeable (see <STRONG>ENVIRONMENT</STRONG>).

       If the environment variable <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> is defined, any  pro-
       gram  using  <STRONG>curses</STRONG> checks for a local terminal definition
       before checking in the standard place.   For  example,  if
       <STRONG>TERM</STRONG> is set to <STRONG>att4424</STRONG>, then the compiled terminal defini-
       tion is found in

             <STRONG>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</STRONG>.

       (The <STRONG>a</STRONG> is copied from the first letter of <STRONG>att4424</STRONG> to avoid
       creation  of  huge  directories.)  However, if <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> is
       set to <STRONG>$HOME/myterms</STRONG>, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> first checks

             <STRONG>$HOME/myterms/a/att4424</STRONG>,

       and if that fails, it then checks

             <STRONG>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</STRONG>.

       This is useful for developing experimental definitions  or
       when write permission in <STRONG>/usr/share/terminfo</STRONG> is not avail-
       able.

       The integer  variables  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>COLS</STRONG>  are  defined  in
       <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>  and will be filled in by <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> with the size
       of the screen.  The constants <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> have the val-
       ues <STRONG>1</STRONG> and <STRONG>0</STRONG>, respectively.

       The  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  routines  also  define  the <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG> variable
       <STRONG>curscr</STRONG> which is used for certain low-level operations like
       clearing  and  redrawing a screen containing garbage.  The
       <STRONG>curscr</STRONG> can be used in only a few routines.

   <STRONG>Routine</STRONG> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <STRONG>Argument</STRONG> <STRONG>Names</STRONG>
       Many <STRONG>curses</STRONG> routines have two or more versions.  The  rou-
       tines prefixed with <STRONG>w</STRONG> require a window argument.  The rou-
       tines prefixed with <STRONG>p</STRONG> require a pad argument.  Those with-
       out a prefix generally use <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       The routines prefixed with <STRONG>mv</STRONG> require a <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM> coordinate
       to move to before performing the appropriate action.   The
       <STRONG>mv</STRONG>  routines  imply  a call to <STRONG>move</STRONG> before the call to the
       other routine.  The coordinate <EM>y</EM> always refers to the  row
       (of  the  window), and <EM>x</EM> always refers to the column.  The
       upper left-hand corner is always (0,0), not (1,1).

       The routines prefixed with <STRONG>mvw</STRONG> take both a window argument
       and  <EM>x</EM>  and  <EM>y</EM> coordinates.  The window argument is always
       specified before the coordinates.

       In each case, <EM>win</EM> is the window affected, and <EM>pad</EM>  is  the
       pad affected; <EM>win</EM> and <EM>pad</EM> are always pointers to type <STRONG>WIN-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>DOW</STRONG>.

       Option setting routines require a Boolean flag <EM>bf</EM> with the
       value  <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>  or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>; <EM>bf</EM> is always of type <STRONG>bool</STRONG>.  Most of
       the data types used in the library routines, such as  <STRONG>WIN-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>DOW</STRONG>,  <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG>,  <STRONG>bool</STRONG>, and <STRONG>chtype</STRONG> are defined in <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>.
       Types used for the terminfo routines such as <STRONG>TERMINAL</STRONG>  are
       defined in <STRONG>&lt;term.h&gt;</STRONG>.

       This  manual  page describes functions which may appear in
       any configuration of the library.  There  are  two  common
       configurations of the library:

              ncurses
                   the  "normal"  library,  which  handles  8-bit
                   characters.  The normal (8-bit) library stores
                   characters  combined with attributes in <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>
                   data.

                   Attributes alone (no corresponding  character)
                   may  be  stored  in  <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>  or the equivalent
                   <STRONG>attr_t</STRONG> data.  In  either  case,  the  data  is
                   stored in something like an integer.

                   Each  cell  (row  and  column)  in a <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> is
                   stored as a <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>.

              ncursesw
                   the so-called "wide"  library,  which  handles
                   multibyte   characters  (see  the  section  on
                   <STRONG>ALTERNATE</STRONG> <STRONG>CONFIGURATIONS</STRONG>).  The "wide" library
                   includes  all  of  the calls from the "normal"
                   library.  It adds about one third  more  calls
                   using data types which store multibyte charac-
                   ters:

                   <STRONG>cchar_t</STRONG>
                        corresponds to <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>.  However it  is  a
                        structure,  because  more  data is stored
                        than can fit into an integer.  The  char-
                        acters are large enough to require a full
                        integer value - and  there  may  be  more
                        than  one  character per cell.  The video
                        attributes and color are stored in  sepa-
                        rate fields of the structure.

                        Each cell (row and column) in a <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> is
                        stored as a <STRONG>cchar_t</STRONG>.

                   <STRONG>wchar_t</STRONG>
                        stores a "wide" character.  Like  <STRONG>chtype</STRONG>,
                        this may be an integer.

                   <STRONG>wint_t</STRONG>
                        stores  a <STRONG>wchar_t</STRONG> or <STRONG>WEOF</STRONG> - not the same,
                        though both may have the same size.

                   The  "wide"  library  provides  new  functions
                   which  are analogous to functions in the "nor-
                   mal" library.  There is  a  naming  convention
                   which  relates  many  of the normal/wide vari-
                   ants: a "_w" is inserted into the  name.   For
                   example, <STRONG>waddch</STRONG> becomes <STRONG>wadd_wch</STRONG>.

       The following table lists each <STRONG>curses</STRONG> routine and the name
       of the manual page on which  it  is  described.   Routines

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines that return an integer return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon  failure
       and  an  integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon successful com-
       pletion, unless otherwise noted in  the  routine  descrip-
       tions.

       All  macros  return  the  value  of  the <STRONG>w</STRONG> version, except
       <STRONG>setscrreg</STRONG>, <STRONG>wsetscrreg</STRONG>, <STRONG>getyx</STRONG>, <STRONG>getbegyx</STRONG>, and <STRONG>getmaxyx</STRONG>.  The

       and <STRONG>getmaxyx</STRONG> are undefined (i.e., these should not be used
       as the right-hand side of assignment statements).

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       The following environment symbols are useful for customiz-
       ing the runtime behavior of the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library.  The most
       important ones have been already discussed in detail.

       BAUDRATE
            The  debugging library checks this environment symbol
            when the application has redirected output to a file.
            The  symbol's numeric value is used for the baudrate.
            If no value is found, <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> uses 9600.  This allows
            testers  to construct repeatable test-cases that take
            into account costs that depend on baudrate.

       CC   When set, change occurrences of the command_character
            (i.e.,  the  <STRONG>cmdch</STRONG> capability) of the loaded terminfo
            entries to the value of this symbol.  Very  few  ter-
            minfo entries provide this feature.

            Because  this  name is also used in development envi-
            ronments to represent the C compiler's name,  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>
            ignores it if it does not happen to be a single char-
            acter.

       COLUMNS
            Specify  the  width  of  the  screen  in  characters.
            Applications  running in a windowing environment usu-
            ally are able to obtain the width of  the  window  in
            which  they  are  executing.   If neither the <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>
            value nor the terminal's screen  size  is  available,
            <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  uses  the size which may be specified in the
            terminfo database (i.e., the <STRONG>cols</STRONG> capability).

            It is important that your application use  a  correct
            size  for  the  screen.   This is not always possible
            because your application may be  running  on  a  host
            which  does not honor NAWS (Negotiations About Window
            Size), or because  you  are  temporarily  running  as
            another  user.  However, setting <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> and/or <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>
            overrides  the  library's  use  of  the  screen  size
            obtained from the operating system.

            Either  <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  symbols  may be specified
            independently.  This is mainly useful  to  circumvent
            legacy  misfeatures  of  terminal descriptions, e.g.,
            xterm which commonly specifies a 65 line screen.  For
            best  results, <STRONG>lines</STRONG> and <STRONG>cols</STRONG> should not be specified
            in a terminal description for terminals which are run
            as emulations.

            Use the <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> function to disable all use of exter-
            nal environment (including system calls) to determine
            the screen size.

       ESCDELAY
            Specifies  the total time, in milliseconds, for which
            ncurses will await  a  character  sequence,  e.g.,  a
            function  key.  The default value, 1000 milliseconds,
            is enough for most uses.  However, it is made a vari-
            able to accommodate unusual applications.

            The most common instance where you may wish to change
            this value is to work with slow hosts, e.g.,  running
            on  a  network.   If  the host cannot read characters
            rapidly enough, it will have the same  effect  as  if
            the  terminal did not send characters rapidly enough.
            The library will still see a timeout.

            Note that xterm mouse events are built up from  char-
            acter  sequences  received  from  the xterm.  If your
            application makes heavy use of multiple-clicking, you
            may  wish  to lengthen this default value because the
            timeout applies to the composed multi-click event  as
            well as the individual clicks.

            In  addition to the environment variable, this imple-
            mentation provides a global variable  with  the  same
            name.  Portable applications should not rely upon the
            presence of ESCDELAY in either form, but setting  the
            environment  variable rather than the global variable
            does not create problems when compiling  an  applica-
            tion.

       HOME Tells  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> where your home directory is.  That is
            where  it  may  read  and  write  auxiliary  terminal
            descriptions:

            $HOME/.termcap
            $HOME/.terminfo

       LINES
            Like  COLUMNS,  specify  the  height of the screen in
            characters.  See COLUMNS for a detailed  description.

       MOUSE_BUTTONS_123
            This applies only to the OS/2 EMX port.  It specifies
            the order of buttons on the mouse.   OS/2  numbers  a
            3-button mouse inconsistently from other platforms:

            1 = left
            2 = right
            3 = middle.

            This symbol lets you customize the mouse.  The symbol
            must be three numeric digits 1-3 in any order,  e.g.,
            123  or  321.   If  it is not specified, <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> uses
            132.

       NCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS
            Override the compiled-in assumption that  the  termi-
            nal's   default   colors   are   white-on-black  (see
            <STRONG><A HREF="default_colors.3x.html">default_colors(3x)</A></STRONG>).  You may set the foreground  and
            background  color  values with this environment vari-
            able by proving a  2-element  list:  foreground,back-
            ground.   For  example, to tell ncurses to not assume
            anything about the colors, set this to  "-1,-1".   To
            make  it  green-on-black, set it to "2,0".  Any posi-
            tive value from zero to the terminfo <STRONG>max_colors</STRONG> value
            is allowed.

       NCURSES_GPM_TERMS
            This  applies  only  to ncurses configured to use the
            GPM interface.

            If present, the environment variable is a list of one
            or  more  terminal names against which the TERM envi-
            ronment variable is matched.  Setting it to an  empty
            value  disables the GPM interface; using the built-in
            support for xterm, etc.

            If the environment variable is absent,  ncurses  will
            attempt to open GPM if TERM contains "linux".

       NCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS
            <STRONG>Ncurses</STRONG>  may  use tabs as part of the cursor movement
            optimization.  In some cases,  your  terminal  driver
            may  not handle these properly.  Set this environment
            variable to disable the feature.  You can also adjust
            your <STRONG>stty</STRONG> settings to avoid the problem.

       NCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIES
            Some  terminals  use  a  magic-cookie  feature  which
            requires special handling to  make  highlighting  and
            other  video  attributes  display  properly.  You can
            suppress the highlighting entirely for  these  termi-
            nals by setting this environment variable.

       NCURSES_NO_PADDING
            Most  of  the  terminal  descriptions in the terminfo
            database are written for real  "hardware"  terminals.
            Many  people  use  terminal  emulators which run in a
            windowing environment and use  curses-based  applica-
            tions.   Terminal  emulators can duplicate all of the
            important aspects of a hardware terminal, but they do
            not  have the same limitations.  The chief limitation
            of a hardware terminal from the  standpoint  of  your
            application is the management of dataflow, i.e., tim-
            ing.  Unless a hardware terminal is interfaced into a
            terminal  concentrator  (which does flow control), it
            (or your application) must manage dataflow,  prevent-
            ing  overruns.   The  cheapest  solution (no hardware
            cost) is for your program to do this by pausing after
            operations  that  the  terminal  does slowly, such as
            clearing the display.

            As a result, many  terminal  descriptions  (including
            the  vt100)  have delay times embedded.  You may wish
            to use these descriptions, but not want  to  pay  the
            performance penalty.

            Set  the NCURSES_NO_PADDING symbol to disable all but
            mandatory padding.  Mandatory padding is  used  as  a
            part of special control sequences such as <EM>flash</EM>.

       NCURSES_NO_SETBUF
            Normally  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> enables buffered output during ter-
            minal initialization.   This  is  done  (as  in  SVr4
            curses)  for  performance  reasons.  For testing pur-
            poses, both of <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> and certain applications, this
            feature    is    made    optional.     Setting    the
            NCURSES_NO_SETBUF variable disables output buffering,
            leaving  the  output  in  the  original (usually line
            buffered) mode.

       NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS
            During initialization, the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library checks for
            special  cases where VT100 line-drawing (and the cor-
            responding  alternate  character  set   capabilities)
            described  in  the  terminfo are known to be missing.
            Specifically, when running in  a  UTF-8  locale,  the
            Linux  console  emulator  and  the GNU screen program
            ignore these.  Ncurses checks  the  TERM  environment
            variable  for  these.   For  other special cases, you
            should set this  environment  variable.   Doing  this
            tells  ncurses to use Unicode values which correspond
            to the VT100 line-drawing glyphs.  That works for the
            special cases cited, and is likely to work for termi-
            nal emulators.

            When setting this variable, you should set  it  to  a
            nonzero  value.   Setting it to zero (or to a nonnum-
            ber) disables  the  special  check  for  "linux"  and
            "screen".

            As   an  alternative  to  the  environment  variable,
            ncurses checks for an  extended  terminfo  capability
            <STRONG>U8</STRONG>.   This  is a numeric capability which can be com-
            piled using <STRONG>tic</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG>.  For example

            # linux console, if patched to provide working
            # VT100 shift-in/shift-out, with corresponding font.
            linux-vt100|linux console with VT100 line-graphics,
                                 U8#0, use=linux,

            # uxterm with vt100Graphics resource set to false
            xterm-utf8|xterm relying on UTF-8 line-graphics,
                                 U8#1, use=xterm,

            The name "U8" is chosen to be two characters, to per-
            mit  it  to be used by applications that use ncurses'
            termcap interface.

       NCURSES_TRACE
            During initialization, the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> debugging  library
            checks  the  NCURSES_TRACE symbol.  If it is defined,
            to a numeric value, <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> calls the <STRONG>trace</STRONG> function,
            using that value as the argument.

            The  argument  values, which are defined in <STRONG>curses.h</STRONG>,
            provide several types of information.   When  running
            with  traces enabled, your application will write the
            file <STRONG>trace</STRONG> to the current directory.

       TERM Denotes your terminal type.  Each  terminal  type  is
            distinct, though many are similar.

       TERMCAP
            If the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library has been configured with <EM>term-</EM>
            <EM>cap</EM> support, <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  will  check  for  a  terminal's
            description in termcap form if it is not available in
            the terminfo database.

            The  TERMCAP  symbol  contains  either   a   terminal
            description  (with  newlines stripped out), or a file
            name telling where the  information  denoted  by  the
            TERM  symbol  exists.   In  either  case,  setting it
            directs <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> to ignore the usual  place  for  this
            information, e.g., /etc/termcap.

       TERMINFO
            Overrides the directory in which <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> searches for
            your terminal description.  This is the simplest, but
            not  the  only way to change the list of directories.
            The complete list of directories in order follows:

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the last directory to  which  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  wrote,  if
                any, is searched first

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the directory specified by the TERMINFO symbol

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   $HOME/.terminfo

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   directories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS symbol

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   one  or  more directories whose names are config-
                ured and compiled into the ncurses library, e.g.,
                /usr/share/terminfo

       TERMINFO_DIRS
            Specifies  a list of directories to search for termi-
            nal descriptions.  The list is  separated  by  colons
            (i.e.,  ":") on Unix, semicolons on OS/2 EMX.  All of
            the terminal descriptions are in terminfo form, which
            makes  a  subdirectory  named for the first letter of
            the terminal names therein.

       TERMPATH
            If TERMCAP does not hold a  file  name  then  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>
            checks  the TERMPATH symbol.  This is a list of file-
            names separated by spaces or colons  (i.e.,  ":")  on
            Unix, semicolons on OS/2 EMX.  If the TERMPATH symbol
            is not set, <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> looks in the files  /etc/termcap,
            /usr/share/misc/termcap  and  $HOME/.termcap, in that
            order.

       The library may be configured to disregard  the  following
       variables  when  the current user is the superuser (root),
       or if the application uses setuid or  setgid  permissions:
       $TERMINFO, $TERMINFO_DIRS, $TERMPATH, as well as $HOME.


</PRE>
<H2>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</H2><PRE>
       Several  different  configurations are possible, depending
       on  the  configure  script  options  used  when   building
       <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>.   There  are a few main options whose effects are
       visible to the applications developer using <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>:

       --disable-overwrite
            The standard include for <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> is as noted in  <STRONG>SYN-</STRONG>
            <STRONG>OPSIS</STRONG>:

            <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

            This  option is used to avoid filename conflicts when
            <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> is not the main implementation of  curses  of
            the  computer.   If  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  is  installed disabling
            overwrite, it puts its  headers  in  a  subdirectory,
            e.g.,

            <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;ncurses/curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

            It  also  omits a symbolic link which would allow you
            to use <STRONG>-lcurses</STRONG> to build executables.

       --enable-widec
            The configure script renames the library and (if  the
            <STRONG>--disable-overwrite</STRONG>  option  is used) puts the header
            files  in  a  different  subdirectory.   All  of  the
            library  names  have  a  "w"  appended to them, i.e.,
            instead of

            <STRONG>-lncurses</STRONG>

            you link with

            <STRONG>-lncursesw</STRONG>

            You must also define <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</STRONG> when com-
            piling  for  the  wide-character  library  to use the
            extended (wide-character)  functions.   The  <STRONG>curses.h</STRONG>
            file   which  is  installed  for  the  wide-character
            library is designed to be compatible with the  normal
            library's header.  Only the size of the <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> struc-
            ture differs, and very few applications require  more
            than  a  pointer  to  <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG>s.   If  the  headers are
            installed  allowing  overwrite,  the   wide-character
            library's  headers should be installed last, to allow
            applications to be built using  either  library  from
            the same set of headers.

       --with-shared

       --with-normal

       --with-debug

       --with-profile
            The  shared  and normal (static) library names differ
            by   their   suffixes,   e.g.,   <STRONG>libncurses.so</STRONG>    and
            <STRONG>libncurses.a</STRONG>.   The debug and profiling libraries add
            a "_g" and a "_p" to  the  root  names  respectively,
            e.g., <STRONG>libncurses_g.a</STRONG> and <STRONG>libncurses_p.a</STRONG>.

       --with-trace
            The  <STRONG>trace</STRONG>  function  normally  resides  in the debug
            library, but it is sometimes useful to configure this
            in  the  shared  library.   Configure  scripts should
            check for the function's existence rather than assum-
            ing it is always in the debug library.

<H2>EXTENSIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library  can  be  compiled  with  an  option
       (<STRONG>-DUSE_GETCAP</STRONG>) that falls back to the old-style /etc/term-
       cap file if the terminal setup code cannot find a terminfo
       entry  corresponding  to <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>.  Use of this feature is not
       recommended, as it essentially includes an entire  termcap
       compiler  in the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> startup code, at significant cost
       in core and startup cycles.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library  includes  facilities  for  capturing
       mouse  events on certain terminals (including xterm).  See
       the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_mouse.3x.html">curs_mouse(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page for details.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library includes facilities for responding  to
       window  resizing  events,  e.g., when running in an xterm.
       See the <STRONG><A HREF="resizeterm.3x.html">resizeterm(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3x)</A></STRONG>  manual  pages  for
       details.   In addition, the library may be configured with
       a SIGWINCH handler.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library extends the fixed set of function  key
       capabilities  of  terminals  by  allowing  the application
       designer to define additional key  sequences  at  runtime.
       See the <STRONG><A HREF="define_key.3x.html">define_key(3x)</A></STRONG> <STRONG><A HREF="key_defined.3x.html">key_defined(3x)</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A HREF="keyok.3x.html">keyok(3x)</A></STRONG> man-
       ual pages for details.

       The <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library can exploit the capabilities of termi-
       nals  which  implement the ISO-6429 SGR 39 and SGR 49 con-
       trols, which allow an application to reset the terminal to
       its  original  foreground and background colors.  From the
       users' perspective, the application is able to  draw  col-
       ored  text  on  a  background  whose color is set indepen-
       dently, providing better  control  over  color  contrasts.
       See the <STRONG><A HREF="default_colors.3x.html">default_colors(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page for details.

       The  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library  includes  a  function for directing
       application output to a printer attached to  the  terminal
       device.  See the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_print.3x.html">curs_print(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page for details.

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  library is intended to be BASE-level confor-
       mant with XSI Curses.  The EXTENDED XSI Curses functional-
       ity (including color support) is supported.

       A  small  number of local differences (that is, individual
       differences between the XSI Curses and <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> calls)  are
       described  in  <STRONG>PORTABILITY</STRONG>  sections  of  the  library man
       pages.

       This implementation also contains several extensions:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The routine <STRONG>has_key</STRONG> is not part of  XPG4,  nor  is  it
           present  in  SVr4.  See the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">curs_getch(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page
           for details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The routine <STRONG>slk_attr</STRONG> is not part of XPG4,  nor  is  it
           present in SVr4.  See the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">curs_slk(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page for
           details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The routines <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>, <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG>, <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG>, <STRONG>mousein-</STRONG>
           <STRONG>terval</STRONG>, and <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG> relating to mouse interfacing are
           not part of XPG4, nor are they present in  SVr4.   See
           the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_mouse.3x.html">curs_mouse(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page for details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  routine  <STRONG>mcprint</STRONG>  was not present in any previous
           curses implementation.  See the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_print.3x.html">curs_print(3x)</A></STRONG>  manual
           page for details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  routine  <STRONG>wresize</STRONG>  is  not part of XPG4, nor is it
           present in SVr4.  See the <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page  for
           details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  WINDOW structure's internal details can be hidden
           from application programs.   See  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_opaque.3x.html">curs_opaque(3x)</A></STRONG>  for
           the discussion of <STRONG>is_scrollok</STRONG>, etc.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   This implementation can be configured to provide rudi-
           mentary support for multi-threaded applications.   See
           <STRONG><A HREF="curs_threads.3x.html">curs_threads(3x)</A></STRONG> for details.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   This  implementation can also be configured to provide
           a set of functions which improve the ability to manage
           multiple  screens.  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_sp_funcs.3x.html">curs_sp_funcs(3x)</A></STRONG> for details.

       In historic curses versions, delays embedded in the  capa-
       bilities <STRONG>cr</STRONG>, <STRONG>ind</STRONG>, <STRONG>cub1</STRONG>, <STRONG>ff</STRONG> and <STRONG>tab</STRONG> activated corresponding
       delay bits in the UNIX tty driver.   In  this  implementa-
       tion,  all  padding  is  done  by sending NUL bytes.  This
       method is slightly more expensive, but narrows the  inter-
       face  to  the  UNIX kernel significantly and increases the
       package's portability correspondingly.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The header  file  <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>  automatically  includes  the
       header files <STRONG>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</STRONG> and <STRONG>&lt;unctrl.h&gt;</STRONG>.

       If  standard  output from a <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> program is re-directed
       to something which is not a tty, screen  updates  will  be
       directed to standard error.  This was an undocumented fea-
       ture of AT&amp;T System V Release 3 curses.
