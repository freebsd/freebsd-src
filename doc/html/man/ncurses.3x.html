       <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> - character-cell terminal interface with optimized output


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       The  "new  curses" library offers the programmer a terminal-independent
       means of reading keyboard and mouse input and  updating  character-cell
       terminals  with  output  optimized to minimize screen updates.  <EM>ncurses</EM>
       replaces the <EM>curses</EM> libraries from System V Release 4 Unix ("SVr4") and
       4.4BSD  Unix,  the  development  of  which  ceased  in the 1990s.  This
       document describes <EM>ncurses</EM> version 6.5 (patch 20240427).

       <EM>ncurses</EM> permits control of the terminal screen's contents;  abstraction
       and  subdivision thereof with <EM>windows</EM> and <EM>pads</EM>; the reading of terminal
       input; control of terminal input and output options; environment  query
       routines;  color  manipulation;  the  definition  and use of <EM>soft</EM> <EM>label</EM>
       keys; <EM>terminfo</EM> capability access; a  <EM>termcap</EM>  compatibility  interface;
       and  an  abstraction  of the system's API for manipulating the terminal
       (such as <STRONG>termios(3)</STRONG>).

       <EM>ncurses</EM> implements the standard interface described  by  X/Open  Curses
       Issue 7.   In  many  behavioral  details  not  standardized  by X/Open,
       <EM>ncurses</EM> emulates the <EM>curses</EM>  library  of  SVr4  and  provides  numerous
       useful extensions.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>  man  pages employ several sections to clarify matters of usage
       and interoperability with other <EM>curses</EM> implementations.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   "NOTES" describes issues and caveats  of  which  any  user  of  the
           <EM>ncurses</EM>  API should be aware, such as limitations on the size of an
           underlying integral type or  the  availability  of  a  preprocessor
           macro  exclusive  of  a  function  definition  (which  prevents its
           address  from  being   taken).    This   section   also   describes
           implementation  details  that will be significant to the programmer
           but which are not standardized.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   "EXTENSIONS" presents <EM>ncurses</EM> innovations beyond the X/Open  Curses
           standard  and/or  the  SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> implementation.  They are termed
           <EM>extensions</EM> to indicate that they cannot be  implemented  solely  by
           using the library API, but require access to the library's internal
           state.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   "PORTABILITY" discusses matters (beyond the exercise of extensions)
           that should be considered when writing to a <EM>curses</EM> standard, or for
           multiple implementations.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   "HISTORY" examines points of detail in  <EM>ncurses</EM>  and  other  <EM>curses</EM>
           implementations over the decades of their development, particularly
           where precedent or inertia have frustrated better design (and, in a
           few cases, where such inertia has been overcome).

       A <EM>curses</EM> application must be linked with the library; use the <STRONG>-lncurses</STRONG>
       option to your compiler or linker.  A debugging version of the  library
       may  be available; if so, link with it using <STRONG>-lncurses_g</STRONG>.  (Your system
       integrator may have installed these libraries such that you can use the
       options  <STRONG>-lcurses</STRONG> and <STRONG>-lcurses_g</STRONG>, respectively.)  The <EM>ncurses</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>g</EM> library
       generates trace logs (in a file called <EM>trace</EM> in the current  directory)
       that  describe <EM>ncurses</EM> actions.  See section "ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS"
       below.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Application-Structure">Application Structure</a></H3><PRE>
       A  <EM>curses</EM>  application  uses  information  from  the   system   locale;
       <STRONG>setlocale(3)</STRONG> prepares it for <EM>curses</EM> library calls.

           setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

       If  the  locale  is  not  thus  initialized,  the  library assumes that
       characters are printable as in ISO 8859-1, to work with certain  legacy
       programs.   You  should initialize the locale; do not expect consistent
       behavior from the library when the locale has not been set up.

       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">initscr(3x)</A></STRONG> or <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">newterm(3x)</A></STRONG> must be called to initialize  <EM>curses</EM>  before
       use of any functions that deal with windows and screens.

       To  get  character-at-a-time  input  without echoing--most interactive,
       screen-oriented programs want this--use the following sequence.

           initscr(); cbreak(); noecho();

       Most applications perform further setup as follows.

           intrflush(stdscr, FALSE);
           keypad(stdscr, TRUE);

       A <EM>curses</EM> program then often enters an event loop of  some  sort.   Call
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">endwin(3x)</A></STRONG> before exiting.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Overview">Overview</a></H3><PRE>
       A  <EM>curses</EM>  library abstracts the terminal screen by representing all or
       part of it as a <EM>WINDOW</EM> data structure.  A <EM>window</EM> is a rectangular  grid
       of  character  cells,  addressed  by row and column coordinates (<EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>),
       with the upper left corner as (0, 0).  A window called <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>, the same
       size  as  the terminal screen, is always available.  Create others with
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_window.3x.html">newwin(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       A <EM>curses</EM> library does not manage overlapping windows (but  see  below).
       You  can either use <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> to manage one screen-filling window, or tile
       the screen into non-overlapping windows and  not  use  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>  at  all.
       Mixing  the  two  approaches will result in unpredictable and undesired
       effects.

       Functions permit manipulation of a window and  the  <EM>cursor</EM>  identifying
       the  cell  within  it  at  which  the next output operation will occur.
       Among those, the most basic are <STRONG><A HREF="curs_move.3x.html">move(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_addch.3x.html">addch(3x)</A></STRONG>: these place the
       cursor and write a character to <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>, respectively.

       Frequent changes to the terminal screen can cause unpleasant flicker or
       inefficient use of the communication channel  to  the  device,  so  the
       library  does  not generally update it automatically.  Therefore, after
       using <EM>curses</EM> functions to accumulate a set of desired updates that make
       sense to present together, call <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG> to tell the library to make
       the user's screen look like <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.  The library <EM>optimizes</EM>  its  output
       by  computing  a minimal number of operations to mutate the screen from
       its  state  at  the  previous  refresh  to  the  new  one.    Effective
       optimization  demands  accurate  information about the terminal device:
       the management of such information is the province of the  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">terminfo(3x)</A></STRONG>
       API, a feature of every standard <EM>curses</EM> implementation.

       Special windows called <EM>pads</EM> may also be manipulated.  These are windows
       that are not constrained to the size of the terminal screen  and  whose
       contents need not be completely displayed.  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_pad.3x.html">curs_pad(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       In  addition  to drawing characters on the screen, rendering attributes
       and colors may be supported, causing the characters to show up in  such
       modes  as  underlined,  in reverse video, or in color on terminals that
       support such display enhancements.  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_attr.3x.html">curs_attr(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>curses</EM> predefines constants for a small set of  forms-drawing  graphics
       corresponding  to  the  DEC Alternate Character Set (ACS), a feature of
       VT100 and other terminals.  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_addch.3x.html">waddch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>curses</EM> is implemented using the  operating  system's  terminal  driver;
       keystroke  events are received not as scan codes but as byte sequences.
       Graphical keycaps (alphanumeric and punctuation keys,  and  the  space)
       appear  as-is.   Everything  else,  including  the  tab,  enter/return,
       keypad, arrow, and function keys, appears as a control character  or  a
       multibyte  <EM>escape</EM>  <EM>sequence.</EM>   <EM>curses</EM>  translates these into unique <EM>key</EM>
       <EM>codes.</EM>  See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">getch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM> provides reimplementations of the SVr4 <STRONG><A HREF="panel.3x.html">panel(3x)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="form.3x.html">form(3x)</A></STRONG>, and
       <STRONG><A HREF="menu.3x.html">menu(3x)</A></STRONG> libraries to ease construction of user interfaces with <EM>curses</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Initialization">Initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       The   selection  of  an  appropriate  value  of  <EM>TERM</EM>  in  the  process
       environment  is  essential  to  correct  <EM>curses</EM>  and  <EM>terminfo</EM>  library
       operation.   A  well-configured  system  selects  a  correct <EM>TERM</EM> value
       automatically;  <STRONG><A HREF="tset.1.html">tset(1)</A></STRONG>  may   assist   with   troubleshooting   exotic
       situations.

       If  you  change the terminal type, export the <EM>TERM</EM> environment variable
       in the shell, then  run  <STRONG><A HREF="tset.1.html">tset(1)</A></STRONG>  or  the  "<STRONG>tput</STRONG>  <STRONG>init</STRONG>"  command.   See
       subsection "Tabs and Initialization" of <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.

       If  the  environment  variables  <EM>LINES</EM>  and  <EM>COLUMNS</EM> are set, or if the
       <EM>curses</EM> program is executing in a graphical windowing  environment,  the
       information  obtained  thence  overrides that obtained by <EM>terminfo</EM>.  An
       <EM>ncurses</EM> extension supports resizable terminals; see <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       If the environment variable  <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  is  defined,  a  <EM>curses</EM>  program
       checks  first  for  a  terminal  type  description  in  the location it
       identifies.   <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  is  useful  for  developing  experimental  type
       descriptions  or  when  write  permission to <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM> is not
       available.

       See section "ENVIRONMENT" below.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Naming-Conventions">Naming Conventions</a></H3><PRE>
       <EM>curses</EM> offers many functions in variant forms using a  regular  set  of
       alternatives  to the name of an elemental one.  Those prefixed with "w"
       require a <EM>WINDOW</EM> pointer argument;  those  with  a  "mv"  prefix  first
       perform cursor movement using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_move.3x.html">wmove(3x)</A></STRONG>; a "mvw" prefix indicates both.
       The "w" function is typically the elemental one; the  removal  of  this
       prefix usually indicates operation on <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       Four functions prefixed with "p" require a pad argument.

       In  function  synopses,  <EM>ncurses</EM> man pages apply the following names to
       parameters.

                       <EM>bf</EM>    <EM>bool</EM> (<STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>)
                       <EM>c</EM>     a <EM>char</EM> or <EM>int</EM>
                       <EM>ch</EM>    a <EM>chtype</EM>
                       <EM>wc</EM>    a <EM>wchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM> or <EM>wint</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>
                       <EM>wch</EM>   a <EM>cchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>
                       <EM>win</EM>   pointer to a <EM>WINDOW</EM>
                       <EM>pad</EM>   pointer to a <EM>WINDOW</EM> that is a pad


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Wide-and-Non-wide-Character-Configurations">Wide and Non-wide Character Configurations</a></H3><PRE>
       This manual page describes functions that appear in  any  configuration
       of  the  library.   There  are  two  common configurations; see section
       "ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS" below.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>   is the library in its "non-wide" configuration, handling only
                 eight-bit  characters.   It  stores a character combined with
                 attributes in a <EM>chtype</EM> datum, which is often an alias of <EM>int</EM>.

                 Attributes alone (with no  corresponding  character)  can  be
                 stored  in  variables  of  <EM>chtype</EM>  or <EM>attr</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM> type.  In either
                 case, they are represented as an integral bit mask.

                 Each cell of a <EM>WINDOW</EM> is stored as a <EM>chtype</EM>.

       <EM>ncursesw</EM>  is the library in its  "wide"  configuration,  which  handles
                 character encodings requiring a larger data type than <EM>char</EM> (a
                 byte-sized type) can represent.  It adds about one third more
                 calls  using  additional  data  types  that  can  store  such
                 <EM>multibyte</EM> characters.

                 <EM>cchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>  corresponds to the non-wide configuration's  <EM>chtype</EM>.
                          It  always  a structure type, because it stores more
                          data than  fit  into  a  standard  scalar  type.   A
                          character  code  may not be representable as a <EM>char</EM>,
                          and moreover more than one character  may  occupy  a
                          cell  (as  with  accent marks and other diacritics).
                          Each  character  is  of  type  <EM>wchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>;  a   complex
                          character contains one spacing character and zero or
                          more non-spacing characters (see below).  Attributes
                          and  color data are stored in separate fields of the
                          structure, not combined as in <EM>chtype</EM>.

                 Each cell of a <EM>WINDOW</EM> is stored as a <EM>cchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>.

                 <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getcchar.3x.html">setcchar(3x)</A></STRONG> and  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getcchar.3x.html">getcchar(3x)</A></STRONG>  store  and  retrieve  <EM>cchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>
                 data.   The  wide  library API of <EM>ncurses</EM> depends on two data
                 types standardized by ISO C95.

                 <EM>wchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>  stores a wide character.  Like <EM>chtype</EM>, it may be  an
                          alias  of <EM>int</EM>.  Depending on the character encoding,
                          a wide character may be  <EM>spacing</EM>,  meaning  that  it
                          occupies  a  character  cell by itself and typically
                          accompanies  cursor  advancement,  or   <EM>non-spacing</EM>,
                          meaning  that it occupies the same cell as a spacing
                          character, is often regarded as a "modifier" of  the
                          base  glyph  with  which  it combines, and typically
                          does not advance the cursor.

                 <EM>wint</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>   can  store  a  <EM>wchar</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>t</EM>   or   the   constant   <STRONG>WEOF</STRONG>,
                          analogously  to the <EM>int</EM>-sized character manipulation
                          functions of ISO C and its constant <STRONG>EOF</STRONG>.

                 The  wide  library   provides   additional   functions   that
                 complement  those  in  the non-wide library where the size of
                 the underlying character type  is  significant.   A  somewhat
                 regular  naming  convention relates many of the wide variants
                 to their non-wide counterparts;  where  a  non-wide  function
                 name  contains  "ch"  or "str", prefix it with "_w" to obtain
                 the wide counterpart.  For example, <STRONG>waddch</STRONG> becomes  <STRONG>wadd_wch</STRONG>.
                 (Exceptions  that  add only "w" comprise <STRONG>addwstr</STRONG>, <STRONG>inwstr</STRONG>, and
                 their variants.)

                 This convention is inapplicable  to  some  non-wide  function
                 names,  so  other  transformations  are  used  for  the  wide
                 configuration:  the  window  background  management  function
                 "bkgd"   becomes  "bkgrnd";  the  window  border-drawing  and
                 -clearing functions are suffixed with "_set";  and  character
                 attribute   manipulation   functions   like  "attron"  become
                 "attr_on".

       <EM>ncurses</EM>'s    <EM>screen-pointer</EM>   <EM>extension</EM>   adds   additional   functions
       corresponding to many of the above, each  with  an  "_sp"  suffix;  see
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_sp_funcs.3x.html">curs_sp_funcs(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       The  availability  of  some  extensions is configurable when <EM>ncurses</EM> is
       compiled; see  sections  "ALTERNATE  CONFIGURATIONS"  and  "EXTENSIONS"
       below.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       Unless  otherwise  noted, functions that return an integer return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on
       success and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> on failure.  Functions that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>
       on  failure.   Typically,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  treats  a  null pointer passed as a
       function parameter as a failure.  Functions prefixed  with  "mv"  first
       perform  cursor movement and fail if the position (<EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>) is outside the
       window boundaries.

       The debugging library checks this variable  when  the  application  has
       redirected  output  to a file.  Its integral value is used for the baud
       rate.  If that value is absent or invalid,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  uses  9600.   This
       feature  allows  testers  to  construct repeatable test cases that take
       into account optimization decisions that depend on baud rate.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-CC-_command-character_"><EM>CC</EM> (command character)</a></H3><PRE>
       When set, the <STRONG>command_character</STRONG>  (<STRONG>cmdch</STRONG>)  capability  value  of  loaded
       <EM>terminfo</EM> entries changes to the value of this variable.  Very few <EM>term-</EM>
       <EM>info</EM> entries provide this feature.

       Because this name is also used in development environments to represent
       the  C  compiler's  name,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  ignores  its value if it is not one
       character in length.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-COLUMNS"><EM>COLUMNS</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       This  variable  specifies  the  width  of  the  screen  in  characters.
       Applications  running  in  a  windowing environment usually are able to
       obtain the width of the window in which they are executing.  If <EM>COLUMNS</EM>
       is not defined and the terminal's screen size is not available from the
       terminal driver, <EM>ncurses</EM> uses the size specified by the <STRONG>columns</STRONG>  (<STRONG>cols</STRONG>)
       capability  of  the  terminal type's entry in the <EM>terminfo</EM> database, if
       any.

       It is important that your application  use  the  correct  screen  size.
       Automatic   detection   thereof  is  not  always  possible  because  an
       application may  be  running  on  a  host  that  does  not  honor  NAWS
       (Negotiations  About  Window  Size)  or as a different user ID than the
       owner of the  terminal  device  file.   Setting  <EM>COLUMNS</EM>  and/or  <EM>LINES</EM>
       overrides  the  library's  use  of  the  screen  size obtained from the
       operating system.

       The <EM>COLUMNS</EM> and <EM>LINES</EM> variables may be specified  independently.   This
       property  is  useful  to circumvent misfeatures of legacy terminal type
       descriptions; <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>  descriptions  specifying  65  lines  were  once
       notorious.    For   best  results,  avoid  specifying  <STRONG>cols</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>lines</STRONG>
       capability codes in <EM>terminfo</EM> descriptions of terminal emulators.

       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_env(3x)</A></STRONG> can disable use of the process environment  in  determining
       the  screen size.  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_tioctl(3x)</A></STRONG> can update <EM>COLUMNS</EM> and <EM>LINES</EM> to match
       the screen size obtained from system calls or the terminal database.

       For <EM>curses</EM> to distinguish the ESC character  resulting  from  a  user's
       press  of  the  "Escape"  key on the input device from one beginning an
       <EM>escape</EM> <EM>sequence</EM> (as commonly produced by function keys), it waits after
       receiving  the  escape  character  to  see  if  further  characters are
       available on the input  stream  within  a  short  interval.   A  global
       variable  <STRONG>ESCDELAY</STRONG>  stores  this interval in milliseconds.  The default
       value of 1000 (one second) is adequate for most uses.  This environment
       variable overrides it.

       The  most common instance where you may wish to change this value is to
       work with a remote host over a slow communication channel.  If the host
       running  a  <EM>curses</EM>  application  does  not receive the characters of an
       escape sequence in a timely manner, the library can interpret  them  as
       multiple key stroke events.

       <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG> mouse events are a form of escape sequence; therefore, if your
       application makes heavy use  of  multiple-clicking,  you  may  wish  to
       lengthen  the  default value because the delay applies to the composite
       multi-click event as well as the individual clicks.

       Portable applications should not rely upon the presence of <STRONG>ESCDELAY</STRONG>  in
       either  form,  but  setting  the  environment  variable rather than the
       global variable does not create problems when compiling an application.

       If <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">keypad(3x)</A></STRONG> is disabled for the  <EM>curses</EM>  window  receiving  input,  a
       program must disambiguate escape sequences itself.

       If set, this  variable  overrides  the  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library's  compiled-in

       <STRONG><A HREF="default_colors.3x.html">default_colors(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Set the foreground  and  background  color  values
       with  this  environment  variable  by  assigning  it two integer values
       separated  by  a  comma,  indicating  foregound  and  background  color
       numbers, respectively.

       For  example,  to tell <EM>ncurses</EM> not to assume anything about the colors,
       use a value of "-1,-1".  To make the  default  color  scheme  green  on
       black,  use  "2,0".   <EM>ncurses</EM> accepts integral values from -1 up to the

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-NCURSES_NO_PADDING"><EM>NCURSES_NO_PADDING</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       Most  terminal  type  descriptions  in  the  <EM>terminfo</EM>  database  detail
       hardware   devices.   Many  people  use  <EM>curses</EM>-based  applications  in
       terminal emulator programs that run in a windowing environment.   These
       programs  can  duplicate  all  of  the important features of a hardware
       terminal, but often lack their limitations.  Chief among  these  absent
       drawbacks is the problem of data flow management; that is, limiting the
       speed of communication to what the hardware  could  handle.   Unless  a
       hardware  terminal  is  interfaced  into a terminal concentrator (which
       does flow control), an application must manage flow control  itself  to
       prevent overruns and data loss.

       A  solution  that  comes  at  no hardware cost is for an application to
       pause after directing a  terminal  to  execute  an  operation  that  it
       performs  slowly,  such  as  clearing  the display.  Many terminal type
       descriptions, including that for the VT100, embed delay  specifications
       in  capabilities.   You  may  wish  to  use these terminal descriptions
       without paying the performance penalty.  Set <EM>NCURSES</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>NO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>PADDING</EM> to  any
       value  to disable all but mandatory padding.  Mandatory padding is used
       by such terminal capabilities as <STRONG>flash_screen</STRONG> (<STRONG>flash</STRONG>).


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-NCURSES_NO_SETBUF"><EM>NCURSES_NO_SETBUF</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       (Obsolete) Prior to internal changes developed in <EM>ncurses</EM> 5.9  (patches
       20120825  through 20130126), the library used <STRONG>setbuf(3)</STRONG> to enable fully
       buffered output when initializing the terminal.  This was done,  as  in
       SVr4  <EM>curses</EM>,  to  increase performance.  For testing purposes, both of
       <EM>ncurses</EM> and of certain applications, this feature  was  made  optional.
       Setting  this  variable  disabled  output buffering, leaving the output
       stream in the original (usually line-buffered) mode.

       Nowadays, <EM>ncurses</EM> performs its own buffering and does not require  this
       workaround;  it  does  not  modify the buffering of the standard output
       stream.  This approach makes signal handling, as for  interrupts,  more
       robust.   A  drawback  is  that  certain  unconventional programs mixed
       <STRONG>stdio(3)</STRONG> calls with <EM>ncurses</EM> calls and (usually) got the  behavior  they
       expected.   This  is  no longer the case; <EM>ncurses</EM> does not write to the
       standard output file descriptor through a <EM>stdio</EM>-buffered stream.

       As a special case, low-level API calls such as <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">putp(3x)</A></STRONG> still  use  the
       standard  output stream.  High-level <EM>curses</EM> calls such as <STRONG><A HREF="curs_printw.3x.html">printw(3x)</A></STRONG> do
       not.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS"><EM>NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       At initialization, <EM>ncurses</EM> inspects the <EM>TERM</EM> environment  variable  for
       special   cases   where   VT100   forms-drawing   characters  (and  the
       corresponding alternate character set <EM>terminfo</EM> capabilities) are  known
       to  be  unsupported  by  terminal  types  that  otherwise  claim  VT100
       compatibility.  Specifically, when running in a UTF-8 locale, the Linux
       virtual  console device and the GNU <STRONG>screen(1)</STRONG> program ignore them.  Set
       this  variable  to  a  nonzero  value  to  instruct  <EM>ncurses</EM>  that  the
       terminal's ACS support is broken; the library then outputs Unicode code
       points that correspond to the forms-drawing characters.  Set it to zero
       (or a non-integer) to disable the special check for terminal type names
       matching "linux" or "screen", directing <EM>ncurses</EM> to assume that the  ACS
       feature works if the terminal type description advertises it.

       As  an  alternative  to  use  of  this  variable, <EM>ncurses</EM> checks for an
       extended <EM>terminfo</EM> numeric capability <STRONG>U8</STRONG> that can be compiled using "<STRONG>tic</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-x</STRONG>".  Examples follow.

          # linux console, if patched to provide working
          # VT100 shift-in/shift-out, with corresponding font.
          linux-vt100|linux console with VT100 line-graphics,
                  U8#0, use=linux,

          # uxterm with vt100Graphics resource set to false
          xterm-utf8|xterm relying on UTF-8 line-graphics,
                  U8#1, use=xterm,

       The  two-character name "U8" was chosen to permit its use via <EM>ncurses</EM>'s
       <EM>termcap</EM> interface.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-NCURSES_TRACE"><EM>NCURSES_TRACE</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       At initialization, <EM>ncurses</EM> (in its debugging configuration) checks  for
       this  variable's  presence.   If  defined  with  an integral value, the
       library calls <STRONG><A HREF="curs_trace.3x.html">curses_trace(3x)</A></STRONG> with that value as the argument.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-TERM"><EM>TERM</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       The <EM>TERM</EM> variable denotes the terminal type.  Each is distinct,  though
       many  are  similar.   It  is commonly set by terminal emulators to help
       applications find a  workable  terminal  description.   Some  choose  a
       popular  approximation  such as "ansi", "vt100", or "xterm" rather than
       an exact fit to their capabilities.  Not infrequently,  an  application
       will  have  problems  with that approach; for example, a key stroke may
       not operate  correctly,  or  produce  no  effect  but  seeming  garbage
       characters on the screen.

       Setting  <EM>TERM</EM>  has  no effect on hardware operation; it affects the way
       applications communicate with the terminal.   Likewise,  as  a  general
       rule  (<STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>  being a rare exception), terminal emulators that allow
       you to specify <EM>TERM</EM> as a parameter or configuration value do not change
       their behavior to match that setting.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-TERMCAP"><EM>TERMCAP</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       If <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured with <EM>termcap</EM> support, it checks for a terminal
       type description in <EM>termcap</EM> format if one in  <EM>terminfo</EM>  format  is  not
       available.   Setting  this variable directs <EM>ncurses</EM> to ignore the usual
       <EM>termcap</EM> database location, <EM>/etc/termcap</EM>; see <EM>TERMPATH</EM>  below.   <EM>TERMCAP</EM>
       should  contain  either  a terminal description (with newlines stripped
       out), or a file name indicating where the information required  by  the
       <EM>TERM</EM> environment variable is stored.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-TERMINFO"><EM>TERMINFO</EM></a></H3><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  can  be configured to read terminal type description databases
       in various locations using different formats.  This variable  overrides
       the default location.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Descriptions  in <EM>terminfo</EM> format are normally stored in a directory
           tree using subdirectories named by the common first letters of  the
           terminal types named therein.  This is the scheme used in System V.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured to use hashed databases, then <EM>TERMINFO</EM> may
           name its location,  such  as  <EM>/usr/share/terminfo.db</EM>,  rather  than
           <EM>/usr/share/terminfo/</EM>.

       The  hashed  database  uses less disk space and is a little faster than
       the directory tree.  However, some applications assume the existence of
       the directory tree, and read it directly rather than using the <EM>terminfo</EM>
       API.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured with <EM>termcap</EM> support,  this  variable  may
           contain the location of a <EM>termcap</EM> file.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the value of <EM>TERMINFO</EM> begins with "hex:" or "b64:", <EM>ncurses</EM> uses
           the remainder of the value as a compiled <EM>terminfo</EM> description.  You
           might produce the base64 format using <STRONG><A HREF="infocmp.1m.html">infocmp(1m)</A></STRONG>.

                  TERMINFO=$(infocmp -0 -Q2 -q)
                  export TERMINFO

           The  compiled  description  is  used  only if it corresponds to the
           terminal type identified by <EM>TERM</EM>.

       Setting <EM>TERMINFO</EM> is the simplest, but  not  the  only,  way  to  direct
       <EM>ncurses</EM> to a terminal database.  The search path is as follows.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the last terminal database to which the running <EM>ncurses</EM> application
           wrote, if any

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the location specified by the <EM>TERMINFO</EM> environment variable

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM>

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   locations listed in the <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM> environment variable

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   location(s) configured and compiled into <EM>ncurses</EM>

       <EM>TERMINFO</EM> above.  The list items are separated by  colons  on  Unix  and
       semicolons  on  OS/2  EMX.   System V  <EM>terminfo</EM>  lacks  a corresponding

       <EM>PATH</EM>, in which it searches for <EM>termcap</EM> terminal type descriptions.  The
       list items are separated by colons on Unix and semicolons on OS/2 EMX.

       If both <EM>TERMCAP</EM> and <EM>TERMPATH</EM> are unset or invalid, <EM>ncurses</EM> searches for
       the files <EM>/etc/termcap</EM>, <EM>/usr/share/misc/termcap</EM>, and <EM>$HOME/.termcap</EM>, in

</PRE><H2><a name="h2-ALTERNATE-CONFIGURATIONS">ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       Many  different  <EM>ncurses</EM> configurations are possible, determined by the
       options given to the <EM>configure</EM> script when building the  library.   Run
       the  script  with  the  <STRONG>--help</STRONG> option to peruse them all.  A few are of
       particular significance to the application developer employing <EM>ncurses</EM>.

       <STRONG>--disable-overwrite</STRONG>
            The standard include for <EM>ncurses</EM> is as noted in <STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG>:

                <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

            This option is used to avoid filename conflicts  when  <EM>ncurses</EM>  is
            not the main implementation of curses of the computer.  If <EM>ncurses</EM>
            is installed  disabling  overwrite,  it  puts  its  headers  in  a
            subdirectory, e.g.,

                <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;ncurses/curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

            It  also  omits  a  symbolic  link  which  would  allow you to use
            <STRONG>-lcurses</STRONG> to build executables.

       <STRONG>--enable-widec</STRONG>
            The  configure  script   renames   the   library   and   (if   the
            <STRONG>--disable-overwrite</STRONG>  option  is  used)  puts the header files in a
            different subdirectory.  All of  the  library  names  have  a  "w"
            appended to them, i.e., instead of

                <STRONG>-lncurses</STRONG>

            you link with

                <STRONG>-lncursesw</STRONG>

            You  must  also  enable  the wide-character features in the header
            file when compiling for the  wide-character  library  to  use  the
            extended  (wide-character)  functions.   The  symbol which enables
            these features has changed since X/Open Curses, Issue 4:

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Originally, the wide-character  feature  required  the  symbol
                <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</STRONG>  but  that  was  only  valid  for  XPG4
                (1996).

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Later, that was deemed conflicting with <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE</STRONG>  defined
                to 500.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   As  of  mid-2018,  none of the features in this implementation
                require a <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE</STRONG> feature greater  than  600.   However,
                X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) recommends defining it to 700.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Alternatively,   you   can  enable  the  feature  by  defining
                <STRONG>NCURSES_WIDECHAR</STRONG> with the caveat that some other  header  file
                than  <STRONG>curses.h</STRONG>  may require a specific value for <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE</STRONG>
                (or a system-specific symbol).

            The <EM>curses.h</EM> header file installed for the wide-character  library
            is  designed  to be compatible with the non-wide library's header.
            Only the size of the <EM>WINDOW</EM> structure  differs;  few  applications
            require more than pointers to <EM>WINDOW</EM>s.

            If  the  headers  are  installed  allowing  overwrite,  the  wide-
            character library's headers should be  installed  last,  to  allow
            applications to be built using either library from the same set of
            headers.

       <STRONG>--with-pthread</STRONG>
            The configure script renames the  library.   All  of  the  library
            names  have  a  "t"  appended  to  them  (before  any "w" added by
            <STRONG>--enable-widec</STRONG>).

            The global variables such as <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> are replaced by macros to allow
            read-only access.  At the same time, setter-functions are provided
            to set these values.  Some applications  (very  few)  may  require
            changes to work with this convention.

       <STRONG>--with-shared</STRONG>
       <STRONG>--with-normal</STRONG>
       <STRONG>--with-debug</STRONG>
       <STRONG>--with-profile</STRONG>
            The  shared  and  normal  (static)  library  names differ by their
            suffixes, e.g., <STRONG>libncurses.so</STRONG> and  <STRONG>libncurses.a</STRONG>.   The  debug  and
            profiling  libraries  add  a  "_g"  and  a  "_p" to the root names
            respectively, e.g., <STRONG>libncurses_g.a</STRONG> and <STRONG>libncurses_p.a</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>--with-termlib</STRONG>
            Low-level functions which do not depend upon whether  the  library
            supports wide-characters, are provided in the tinfo library.

            By  doing  this, it is possible to share the tinfo library between
            wide/normal configurations as well  as  reduce  the  size  of  the
            library when only low-level functions are needed.

            Those functions are described in these pages:

       <STRONG>--with-trace</STRONG>
            The  <STRONG>trace</STRONG>  function normally resides in the debug library, but it
            is sometimes useful to  configure  this  in  the  shared  library.
            Configure scripts should check for the function's existence rather
            than assuming it is always in the debug library.

       X/Open Curses permits most functions it specifies to be made  available
       as macros as well.  <EM>ncurses</EM> does so

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   for functions that return values via their parameters,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   to support obsolete features,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   to  reuse functions (for example, those that move the cursor before
           another operation), and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a few special cases.

       If the standard  output  file  descriptor  of  an  <EM>ncurses</EM>  program  is
       redirected  to  something  that  is  not a terminal device, the library
       writes screen updates to the standard error file descriptor.  This  was
       an undocumented feature of SVr3 <EM>curses</EM>.

       See  subsection  "Header  Files"  below  regarding  symbols  exposed by
       inclusion of <EM>curses.h</EM>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-EXTENSIONS">EXTENSIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM> enables an application  to  capture  mouse  events  on  certain
       terminals, including <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG>; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_mouse.3x.html">curs_mouse(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>  provides  a  means of responding to window resizing events, as
       when running in a GUI terminal emulator application such as <EM>xterm</EM>;  see
       <STRONG><A HREF="resizeterm.3x.html">resizeterm(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM> allows an application to query the terminal for the presence of
       a wide variety of special keys; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">has_key(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM> extends the fixed set of function key capabilities specified by
       X/Open   Curses  by  allowing  the  application  programmer  to  define
       additional key events at runtime; see <STRONG><A HREF="define_key.3x.html">define_key(3x)</A></STRONG>,  <STRONG><A HREF="key_defined.3x.html">key_defined(3x)</A></STRONG>,
       <STRONG><A HREF="keybound.3x.html">keybound(3x)</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG><A HREF="keyok.3x.html">keyok(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>   can   exploit  the  capabilities  of  terminals  implementing
       ISO 6429/ECMA-48  SGR 39  and  SGR 49   sequences,   which   allow   an
       application  to  reset  the  terminal  to  its  original foreground and
       background colors.  From a user's perspective, the application is  able
       to  draw colored text on a background whose color is set independently,
       providing better control over color contrasts.  See <STRONG><A HREF="default_colors.3x.html">default_colors(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       An  <EM>ncurses</EM>  application  can  eschew  knowledge  of  <EM>WINDOW</EM>  structure
       internals, instead using accessor functions such as <STRONG><A HREF="curs_opaque.3x.html">is_scrollok(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>  enables  an  application  to  direct  application  output to a
       printer attached to the terminal device; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_print.3x.html">curs_print(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM> offers <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">slk_attr(3x)</A></STRONG> as a counterpart of <STRONG><A HREF="curs_attr.3x.html">attr_get(3x)</A></STRONG> for  soft-

       that can gather color  information  from  them  when  many  colors  are
       supported.

       Some  extensions  are available only if <EM>ncurses</EM> permits modification of
       <STRONG><A HREF="unctrl.3x.html">unctrl(3x)</A></STRONG>'s behavior; see <STRONG><A HREF="legacy_coding.3x.html">use_legacy_coding(3x)</A></STRONG>.  <EM>ncurses</EM> is  compiled
       to support them; section "ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS" describes how.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Rudimentary   support   for   multi-threaded  applications  may  be
           available; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_threads.3x.html">curs_threads(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Functions that ease the  management  of  multiple  screens  can  be
           exposed; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_sp_funcs.3x.html">curs_sp_funcs(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   To aid applications to debug their memory usage, <EM>ncurses</EM> optionally
           offers functions to more aggressively free  memory  it  dynamically
           allocates itself; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_memleaks.3x.html">curs_memleaks(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The   library  facilitates  auditing  and  troubleshooting  of  its
           behavior; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_trace.3x.html">curs_trace(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The compiler option <STRONG>-DUSE_GETCAP</STRONG> causes the library to fall back to
           reading <EM>/etc/termcap</EM> if the terminal setup code cannot find a <EM>term-</EM>
           <EM>info</EM> entry corresponding to <EM>TERM</EM>.   Use  of  this  feature  is  not
           recommended,  as it essentially includes an entire <EM>termcap</EM> compiler
           in the <EM>ncurses</EM>  startup  code,  at  a  cost  in  memory  usage  and
           application launch latency.

       <EM>PDCurses</EM>   and  NetBSD  <EM>curses</EM>  incorporate  some  <EM>ncurses</EM>  extensions.
       Individual man pages indicate where this is the case.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       X/Open Curses defines two levels of conformance, "base" and "enhanced".
       The latter includes several additional features, such as wide-character
       and color support.  <EM>ncurses</EM> intends base-level conformance with  X/Open
       Curses,  and  supports  all  features  of its enhanced level except the
       <STRONG>untic</STRONG> utility.

       Differences between X/Open Curses and <EM>ncurses</EM>  are  documented  in  the
       "PORTABILITY" sections of applicable man pages.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Error-Checking">Error Checking</a></H3><PRE>
       In  many cases, X/Open Curses is vague about error conditions, omitting
       some of the SVr4 documentation.

       Unlike other implementations, <EM>ncurses</EM> checks pointer  parameters,  such
       as  those to <EM>WINDOW</EM> structures, to ensure that they are not null.  This
       is done primarily to guard  against  programmer  error.   The  standard
       interface does not provide a way for the library to tell an application
       which of several possible errors occurred.  Relying on  this  (or  some
       other)   extension   adversely   affects   the  portability  of  <EM>curses</EM>
       applications.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Padding-Differences">Padding Differences</a></H3><PRE>
       In historical <EM>curses</EM> implementations, delays embedded in  the  <EM>terminfo</EM>
       capabilities  <STRONG>carriage_return</STRONG>  (<STRONG>cr</STRONG>),  <STRONG>scroll_forward</STRONG> (<STRONG>ind</STRONG>), <STRONG>cursor_left</STRONG>
       (<STRONG>cub1</STRONG>), <STRONG>form_feed</STRONG> (<STRONG>ff</STRONG>), and <STRONG>tab</STRONG> (<STRONG>ht</STRONG>) activated corresponding delay bits
       in  the  Unix terminal driver.  <EM>ncurses</EM> performs all padding by sending
       NUL bytes to the device.  This method is slightly more  expensive,  but
       narrows   the   interface   to   the   Unix  kernel  significantly  and
       correspondingly increases the package's portability.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Header-Files">Header Files</a></H3><PRE>
       The header file <EM>curses.h</EM> itself includes the header files  <EM>stdio.h</EM>  and
       <EM>unctrl.h</EM>.

       X/Open Curses has more to say,

           The  inclusion  of  <EM>curses.h</EM>  may make visible all symbols from the
           headers <EM>stdio.h</EM>, <EM>term.h</EM>, <EM>termios.h</EM>, and <EM>wchar.h</EM>.

       but does not finish the story.  A more complete account follows.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Starting with 4BSD <EM>curses</EM> (1980) all implementations have  provided
           a <EM>curses.h</EM> file.

           BSD  <EM>curses</EM>  code  included  <EM>curses.h</EM> and <EM>unctrl.h</EM> from an internal
           header file <EM>curses.ext</EM>, where "ext" abbreviated "externs".

           The implementations of <EM>printw</EM> and <EM>scanw</EM> used undocumented  internal
           functions  of  the  standard I/O library (<STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>doprnt</EM> and <STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>doscan</EM>), but
           nothing in <EM>curses.h</EM> itself relied upon <EM>stdio.h</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr2 <EM>curses</EM> added <EM>newterm</EM>, which relies upon  <EM>stdio.h</EM>  because  its
           function prototype employs the <EM>FILE</EM> type.

           SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> added <EM>putwin</EM> and <EM>getwin</EM>, which also use <EM>stdio.h</EM>.

           X/Open Curses specifies all three of these functions.

           SVr4  <EM>curses</EM>  and  X/Open  Curses  do  not require the developer to
           include <EM>stdio.h</EM> before <EM>curses.h</EM>.  Both document use  of  <EM>curses</EM>  as
           requiring only <EM>curses.h</EM>.

           As a result, standard <EM>curses.h</EM> always includes <EM>stdio.h</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open  Curses  and  SVr4  <EM>curses</EM>  are inconsistent with respect to
           <EM>unctrl.h</EM>.

           As noted in <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">curs_util(3x)</A></STRONG>, <EM>ncurses</EM> includes <EM>unctrl.h</EM> from  <EM>curses.h</EM>
           (as SVr4 does).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open  Curses's  comments  about <EM>term.h</EM> and <EM>termios.h</EM> may refer to
           HP-UX and AIX.

           HP-UX <EM>curses</EM> includes <EM>term.h</EM> from <EM>curses.h</EM> to declare <EM>setupterm</EM>  in
           <EM>curses.h</EM>, but <EM>ncurses</EM> and Solaris <EM>curses</EM> do not.

           AIX  <EM>curses</EM>  includes  <EM>term.h</EM>  and  termios.h<EM>.</EM>   Again, <EM>ncurses</EM> and
           Solaris <EM>curses</EM> do not.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses says that <EM>curses.h</EM> <STRONG>may</STRONG> include <EM>term.h</EM>, but  does  not
           require it to do so.

           Some  programs  use functions declared in both <EM>curses.h</EM> and <EM>term.h</EM>,
           and must include both header files in the same  module.   Very  old
           versions  of  AIX  <EM>curses</EM>  required  inclusion  of  <EM>curses.h</EM> before
           <EM>term.h</EM>.

           The header files supplied by <EM>ncurses</EM> include the  standard  library
           headers  required  for  its  declarations,  so <EM>ncurses</EM>'s own header
           files can be included in  any  order.   But  for  portability,  you
           should include <EM>curses.h</EM> before <EM>term.h</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open  Curses  says  "may make visible" because including a header
           file does not necessarily make visible all of  the  symbols  in  it
           (consider <STRONG>#ifdef</STRONG> and similar).

           For  instance, <EM>ncurses</EM>'s <EM>curses.h</EM> <STRONG>may</STRONG> include <EM>wchar.h</EM> if the proper
           symbol is defined, and if <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured for  wide-character
           support.   If  <EM>wchar.h</EM> is included, its symbols <STRONG>may</STRONG> be made visible
           depending on the value of the <STRONG>_XOPEN_SOURCE</STRONG> feature test macro.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses mandates an application's inclusion of one standard C
           library  header  in  a  special  case:  <EM>stdarg.h</EM> before <EM>curses.h</EM> to
           prototype the functions <EM>vw</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>printw</EM> and  <EM>vw</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>scanw</EM>  (as  well  as  the
           obsolete  <EM>vwprintw</EM>  and  <EM>vwscanw</EM>).   Each of these takes a variadic
           argument list, a <EM>va</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>list</EM> parameter, like that of <STRONG>printf(3)</STRONG>.

           SVr3 <EM>curses</EM> introduced  the  two  obsolete  functions,  and  X/Open
           Curses  the  others.   In  between,  SVr4  <EM>curses</EM>  provided for the
           possibility that an application might include either  <EM>varargs.h</EM>  or
           <EM>stdarg.h</EM>.   These  represented  contrasting  approaches to handling
           variadic argument lists.  The older interface,  <EM>varargs.h</EM>,  used  a
           pointer  to <EM>char</EM> for variadic functions' <EM>va</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>list</EM> parameter.  Later,
           the list acquired its own standard data type, <EM>va</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>list</EM>,  defined  in
           <EM>stdarg.h</EM>,  empowering the compiler to check the types of a function
           call's actual parameters against the formal ones  declared  in  its
           prototype.

           No   conforming   implementations   of  X/Open  Curses  require  an
           application to include <EM>stdarg.h</EM> before <EM>curses.h</EM> because they either
           have  allowed  for  a  special type, or, like <EM>ncurses</EM>, they include
           <EM>stdarg.h</EM> themselves to provide a portable interface.
