</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Calling <STRONG>newwin</STRONG> creates and returns a pointer to a new win-
       dow with the given number of lines and columns.  The upper
       left-hand  corner of the window is at line <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM>, column
       <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>.  If either <EM>nlines</EM> or <EM>ncols</EM> is zero, they  default
       to  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG> <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM> and <STRONG>COLS</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG> <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>.  A new full-screen
       window is created by calling <STRONG>newwin(0,0,0,0)</STRONG>.

       Calling <STRONG>delwin</STRONG> deletes the named window, freeing all memo-
       ry associated with it (it does not actually erase the win-
       dow's screen image).  Subwindows must  be  deleted  before
       the main window can be deleted.

       Calling <STRONG>mvwin</STRONG> moves the window so that the upper left-hand
       corner is at position (<EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>).  If the move would cause the
       window to be off the screen, it is an error and the window
       is not moved.  Moving subwindows is allowed, but should be
       avoided.

       Calling <STRONG>subwin</STRONG> creates and returns a pointer to a new win-
       dow with the given number of lines, <EM>nlines</EM>,  and  columns,
       <EM>ncols</EM>.   The  window  is at position (<EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM>, <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>) on
       the screen.  (This position is relative to the screen, and
       not to the window <EM>orig</EM>.)  The window is made in the middle
       of the window <EM>orig</EM>, so that changes  made  to  one  window
       will  affect  both  windows.   The subwindow shares memory
       with the window <EM>orig</EM>.  When using this routine, it is nec-
       essary  to call <STRONG>touchwin</STRONG> or <STRONG>touchline</STRONG> on <EM>orig</EM> before call-
       ing <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> on the subwindow.

       Calling <STRONG>derwin</STRONG> is the same as calling <STRONG>subwin,</STRONG> except  that
       <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM> and <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM> are relative to the origin of the win-
       dow <EM>orig</EM> rather than the screen.  There is  no  difference
       between the subwindows and the derived windows.

       Calling <STRONG>mvderwin</STRONG> moves a derived window (or subwindow) in-
       side its parent window.  The screen-relative parameters of
       the  window are not changed.  This routine is used to dis-
       play different parts of the  parent  window  at  the  same
       physical position on the screen.

       Calling  <STRONG>dupwin</STRONG>  creates  an exact duplicate of the window
       <EM>win</EM>.

       Calling <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> touches all locations in ancestors of  <EM>win</EM>
       that  are changed in <EM>win</EM>.  If <STRONG>syncok</STRONG> is called with second
       argument <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> then <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> is called automatically whenev-
       er there is a change in the window.

       The  <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG>  routine  touches each location in <EM>win</EM> that
       has been touched in any of  its  ancestor  windows.   This
       routine  is  called by <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>, so it should almost never
       be necessary to call it manually.

       The routine <STRONG>wcursyncup</STRONG> updates the current cursor position
       of  all the ancestors of the window to reflect the current
       cursor position of the window.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines that return an integer return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> up-
       on  failure  and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value
       other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In  this  implementa-
       tion

              <STRONG>delwin</STRONG>
                   returns  an  error  if  the  window pointer is
                   null, or if the window is the parent of anoth-
                   er window.

                   This  implementation  also maintains a list of
                   windows, and checks that the pointer passed to
                   <STRONG>delwin</STRONG>  is  one  that it created, returning an
                   error if it was not..

              <STRONG>mvderwin</STRONG>
                   returns an error  if  the  window  pointer  is
                   null,  or  if some part of the window would be
                   placed off-screen.

              <STRONG>mvwin</STRONG>
                   returns an error  if  the  window  pointer  is
                   null,  or if the window is really a pad, or if
                   some part of the window would be  placed  off-
                   screen.

              <STRONG>syncok</STRONG>
                   returns  an  error  if  the  window pointer is
                   null.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If many small changes are made to the window, the  <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG>
       option could degrade performance.

       Note that <STRONG>syncok</STRONG> may be a macro.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The  subwindow  functions (<EM>subwin</EM>, <EM>derwin</EM>, <EM>mvderwin</EM>, <STRONG>wsyn-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>cup</STRONG>, <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG>, <STRONG>wcursyncup</STRONG>, <STRONG>syncok</STRONG>) are flaky, incomplete-
       ly implemented, and not well tested.

       The  System  V  curses documentation is very unclear about
       what <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> and <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG> actually do.  It seems to imply
       that  they  are only supposed to touch exactly those lines
       that are affected by ancestor changes.  The language here,
       and  the  behavior  of  the <STRONG>curses</STRONG> implementation, is pat-
       terned on the XPG4 curses standard.  The weaker XPG4  spec
       may result in slower updates.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue 4 describes these func-
       tions.
