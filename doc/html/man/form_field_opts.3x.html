</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>form_field_opts</STRONG> - set and get field options


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG>
       int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       Field_Options field_opts(const FIELD *field);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  function  <STRONG>set_field_opts</STRONG>  sets  all the given field's
       option bits (field  option  bits  may  be  logically-OR'ed
       together).

       The function <STRONG>field_opts_on</STRONG> turns on the given option bits,
       and leaves others alone.

       The function <STRONG>field_opts_off</STRONG> turns  off  the  given  option
       bits, and leaves others alone.

       The function <STRONG>field_opts</STRONG> returns the field's current option
       bits.

       The following options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_VISIBLE
            The field is displayed.  If this option is off,  dis-
            play of the field is suppressed.

       O_ACTIVE
            The  field  is  visited  during  processing.  If this
            option is off, the field will  not  be  reachable  by
            navigation  keys.  Please  notice  that  an invisible
            field appears to be inactive also.

       O_PUBLIC
            The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_EDIT
            The field can be edited.

       O_WRAP
            Words that do not fit on a line are  wrapped  to  the
            next line.  Words are blank-separated.

       O_BLANK
            The  field is cleared whenever a character is entered
            at the first position.

       O_AUTOSKIP
            Skip to the next field when this one fills.

       O_NULLOK
            Allow a blank field.

       O_STATIC
            Field buffers are fixed  to  field's  original  size.
            Turn this option off to create a dynamic field.

       O_PASSOK
            Validate field only if modified by user.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except  for  <STRONG>field_opts</STRONG>,  each  routine returns one of the
       following:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine detected an incorrect or  out-of-range  argu-
            ment.

       <STRONG>E_CURRENT</STRONG>
            The field is the current field.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).
