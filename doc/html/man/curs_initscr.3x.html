</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-initscr">initscr</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> determines the terminal  type  and  initializes  the  library's
       <EM>SCREEN</EM>,  <EM>WINDOW</EM>,  and  other data structures.  It is normally the first
       <EM>curses</EM> function call a program performs.  However, an application  with
       unusual needs might employ a few other <EM>curses</EM> functions beforehand:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">slk_init(3x)</A></STRONG> to set up soft-label keys;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">filter(3x)</A></STRONG>  if  the  program  is  designed  to operate in a process
           pipeline;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">ripoffline(3x)</A></STRONG> to reserve up to five lines at the top and/or bottom
           of the screen  from  management  by  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>,  the  standard  <EM>curses</EM>
           window; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_env(3x)</A></STRONG>  and/or  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_tioctl(3x)</A></STRONG> to configure use of the process
           environment and operating system's terminal  driver,  respectively,
           when determining the dimensions of the terminal display.

       Further,  a  <EM>curses</EM>  program  might call <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> prior to or instead of
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> in two specialized cases described in its subsection below.

       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> causes the first <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG> call  to  clear  the  screen.   If
       errors  occur,  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> writes an appropriate diagnostic message to the
       standard error stream and exits; otherwise, it  returns  a  pointer  to
       <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-newterm">newterm</a></H3><PRE>
       An application that manages multiple terminals should call <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> once
       for each such device <EM>instead</EM> of <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>'s arguments are

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  <EM>type</EM>  of the associated terminal, or a null pointer to use the
           <EM>TERM</EM> environment variable;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   an output stream <EM>outf</EM> connected to the terminal; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   an input stream <EM>inf</EM> connected to the terminal.

       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> returns a variable of pointer-to-<EM>SCREEN</EM> type, which  should  be
       saved for later use with <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> and <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> passes the file descriptor of the output stream to the <EM>terminfo</EM>
       function <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>, which returns a pointer to a <EM>TERMINAL</EM> structure
       that <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> stores in the <EM>SCREEN</EM> it returns to the application.

       An application that needs to inspect a terminal type's capabilities, so
       that  it  can  continue  to run in a line-oriented mode if the terminal
       type does not support capabilities the application demands, would  also
       use  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.   If  at  most  one  terminal  connection  is needed, the
       programmer could perform such a capability test,  decide  the  mode  in
       which  to  operate,  then  call  <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  on  the pointer returned by
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>, and proceed with either <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or a non-<EM>curses</EM> interface.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-endwin">endwin</a></H3><PRE>
       The program must also call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> for each terminal being  used  before
       exiting  from <EM>curses</EM>.  If <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called more than once for the same
       terminal, the first terminal referred to must be the last one for which
       <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> is called.

       A program should always call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> before exiting the  application  or
       temporarily suspending <EM>curses</EM>'s management of the terminal.  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   (if   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">start_color(3x)</A></STRONG>   has  been  called)  resets  the  terminal's
           foreground and background colors to correspond with those of  color
           pair 0 (the default pair),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   moves the cursor to the lower left-hand corner of the screen,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   (if  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">start_color(3x)</A></STRONG>  has  been  called) restores the default color
           pair,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   clears the line,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   sets the cursor to normal visibility (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">curs_set(3x)</A></STRONG>),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if applicable, stops cursor-addressing mode using the  <STRONG>exit_ca_mode</STRONG>
           (<STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>) terminal capability, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   restores terminal modes (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">reset_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>).

       Calling <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG> or <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">doupdate(3x)</A></STRONG> after a temporary suspension causes
       <EM>curses</EM> to resume managing the terminal.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-isendwin">isendwin</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>isendwin</STRONG>  returns  <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>  if  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">wrefresh(3x)</A></STRONG> has not been called since the
       most recent <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> call, and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> otherwise.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-set_term">set_term</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> re-orients the <EM>curses</EM> library's operations to another terminal
       when the application has arranged to manage more than one with <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.
       <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> expects a <EM>SCREEN</EM> pointer previously returned by <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> as  an
       argument,  and returns the previous one.  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> is the only standard
       <EM>curses</EM> API function that manipulates <EM>SCREEN</EM> pointers; all others affect
       only the current terminal (but see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_sp_funcs.3x.html">curs_sp_funcs(3x)</A></STRONG>).


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-delscreen">delscreen</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  frees  the  storage  backing  the  supplied  <EM>SCREEN</EM>  pointer
       argument.   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> does not, so that an application can resume managing
       a terminal with <EM>curses</EM> after  a  (possibly  conditional  or  temporary)
       suspension;  see  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">curs_kernel(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Use <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> when the
       application has no more need of a terminal device  but  will  not  soon
       exit.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  returns  no  value.  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> on
       failure.  <STRONG>isendwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> as described above.

       In <EM>ncurses</EM>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the terminal was not initialized,

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   it is called more than once without updating the screen, or

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   its call of <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">reset_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if it cannot allocate storage  for  the  <EM>SCREEN</EM>
           structure  or  the  <EM>WINDOW</EM> structures automatically associated with
           it: <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>, <STRONG>newscr</STRONG>, and <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       Functions that return pointers  return  null  pointers  on  error.   In
       <EM>ncurses</EM>,  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG>  does not fail, and <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> exits the application if
       it does not operate successfully.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-NOTES">NOTES</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM> establishes signal handlers when a function that initializes  a
       <EM>SCREEN</EM>,  either <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>, is first called.  Applications that
       wish to handle the following signals themselves  should  set  up  their
       corresponding handlers <EM>after</EM> initializing the screen.

       <EM>SIGINT</EM> <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  handler  <EM>attempts</EM>  to  clean  up  the screen on exit.
              Although it <EM>usually</EM> works as expected, there are limitations.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Walking the <EM>SCREEN</EM> list is unsafe, since all list management
                  is done without any signal blocking.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   When an application has been built with the <STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>REENTRANT</EM> macro
                  defined (and corresponding system  support),  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG>  uses
                  functions that could deadlock or misbehave in other ways.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  calls other functions, many of which use <STRONG>stdio(3)</STRONG> or
                  other library functions that are clearly unsafe.

       <EM>SIGTERM</EM>
              <EM>ncurses</EM> uses the same handler  as  for  <EM>SIGINT</EM>,  with  the  same
              limitations.   It is not mentioned in X/Open Curses, but is more
              suitable for  this  purpose  than  <EM>SIGQUIT</EM>  (which  is  used  in
              debugging).

       <EM>SIGTSTP</EM>
              <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  handler  manages  the terminal-generated stop signal,
              used  in  job  control.   When  resuming  the  process,  <EM>ncurses</EM>
              discards  pending  input  with  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">flushinp(3x)</A></STRONG>  and  repaints  the
              screen, assuming that it has been completely altered.   It  also
              updates the saved terminal modes with <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <EM>SIGWINCH</EM>
              <EM>ncurses</EM>  handles  changes  to  the  terminal's  window  size,  a
              phenomenon  ignored  in  standardization  efforts.   It  sets  a
              (signal-safe)  variable  that  is later tested by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">wgetch(3x)</A></STRONG> and
              <STRONG><A HREF="curs_get_wch.3x.html">wget_wch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> returns the key code <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>wget_wch</STRONG> returns <STRONG>KEY_CODE_YES</STRONG> and sets its <EM>wch</EM> parameter  to
                  <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>.

              At  the  same  time,  <EM>ncurses</EM> calls <STRONG><A HREF="resizeterm.3x.html">resizeterm(3x)</A></STRONG> to adjust the
              standard screen <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> and update global variables such as <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>
              and <STRONG>COLS</STRONG>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       X/Open Curses Issue 4 describes these functions.  It specifies no error
       conditions for them.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Differences">Differences</a></H3><PRE>
       X/Open Curses  specifies  that  portable  applications  must  not  call
       <EM>initscr</EM> more than once.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  portable  way  to  use  <EM>initscr</EM> is once only, using <EM>refresh</EM> to
           restore the screen after <EM>endwin</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> permits use of <EM>initscr</EM> after <EM>endwin</EM>.

       <EM>initscr</EM> in BSD, from its inception (1980)  through  the  Net/2  release
       (1991)  returned  <EM>ERR</EM> cast to a <EM>WINDOW</EM> pointer when detecting an error.
       4.4BSD (1995) instead returned a  null  pointer.   Neither  exited  the
       application.   It  is  safe  but redundant to check the return value of
       <EM>initscr</EM> in X/Open Curses.

       Calling <EM>endwin</EM> does not dispose of the memory allocated by  <EM>initscr</EM>  or
       <EM>newterm</EM>.  Deleting a <EM>SCREEN</EM> provides a way to do this.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open  Curses  does not say what happens to <EM>WINDOW</EM>s when <EM>delscreen</EM>
           "frees storage associated  with  the  <EM>SCREEN</EM>"  nor  does  the  SVr4
           documentation help, adding that it should be called after <EM>endwin</EM> if
           a <EM>SCREEN</EM> is no longer needed.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   However, every <EM>WINDOW</EM> is implicitly associated with a <EM>SCREEN</EM>, so it
           is reasonable to expect <EM>delscreen</EM> to dispose of them.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4  deletes  the  standard <EM>WINDOW</EM> structures <EM>stdscr</EM> and <EM>curscr</EM> as
           well as a work area <EM>newscr</EM>.  It ignores other windows.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Since version 4.0 (1996), <EM>ncurses</EM> has  maintained  a  list  of  all
           windows  for  each  screen,  using that information to delete those
           windows when <EM>delscreen</EM> is called.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD copied this feature of <EM>ncurses</EM> in  2001.   <EM>PDCurses</EM>  follows
           the  SVr4  model,  deleting only the standard <EM>WINDOW</EM> structures and
           <EM>newscr</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-High-level-versus-Low-level-Functions">High-level versus Low-level Functions</a></H3><PRE>
       Implementations disagree regarding the level of abstraction  applicable
       to  a  function or property.  For example, <EM>SCREEN</EM> (returned by <EM>newterm</EM>)
       and <EM>TERMINAL</EM> (returned by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>) hold file descriptors for  the
       output  stream.   If an application switches screens using <EM>set</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>term</EM>, or
       switches terminals using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">set_curterm(3x)</A></STRONG>, applications using the output
       file descriptor can  behave  differently  depending  on  the  structure
       holding the corresponding descriptor.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD's   <EM>baudrate</EM>  function  uses  the  descriptor  in  <EM>TERMINAL</EM>.
           <EM>ncurses</EM> and SVr4 use the descriptor in <EM>SCREEN</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD and <EM>ncurses</EM> use the descriptor in <EM>TERMINAL</EM> for terminal  I/O
           modes,  e.g., <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_prog_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>.  SVr4 uses the
           descriptor in <EM>SCREEN</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Unset-TERM-Environment-Variable">Unset TERM Environment Variable</a></H3><PRE>
       If the <EM>TERM</EM> variable is not set in the  environment  or  has  an  empty
       value,  <EM>initscr</EM> uses the value "unknown", which normally corresponds to
       a terminal entry with the <STRONG>generic</STRONG> (<STRONG>gn</STRONG>) capability.  Generic entries are
       detected by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG> and cannot be used for full-screen operation.
       Other implementations may handle  a  missing  or  empty  <EM>TERM</EM>  variable
       differently.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Signal-Handlers">Signal Handlers</a></H3><PRE>
       Quoting X/Open Curses Issue 7, section 3.1.1:

            Curses  implementations  may  provide  for special handling of the
            SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and  SIGTSTP  signals  if  their  disposition  is
            SIG_DFL at the time <EM>initscr</EM>() is called...

            Any  special  handling  for these signals may remain in effect for
            the  life  of  the  process  or  until  the  process  changes  the
            disposition of the signal.
