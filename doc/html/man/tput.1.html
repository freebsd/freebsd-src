</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>tput</STRONG> utility uses the <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> database  to  make  the
       values  of terminal-dependent capabilities and information
       available to the shell (see <STRONG><A HREF="sh.1.html">sh(1)</A></STRONG>), to initialize or reset
       the  terminal,  or  return  the long name of the requested
       terminal type.  The result depends upon  the  capability's
       type:

              string
                   <STRONG>tput</STRONG> writes the string to the standard output.
                   No trailing newline is supplied.

              integer
                   <STRONG>tput</STRONG> writes the decimal value to the  standard
                   output, with a trailing newline.

              boolean
                   <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  simply sets the exit code (<STRONG>0</STRONG> for TRUE if
                   the terminal has the capability, <STRONG>1</STRONG>  for  FALSE
                   if  it  does  not),  and writes nothing to the
                   standard output.

       Before using a value returned on the standard output,  the
       application  should  test  the  exit  code  (e.g., <STRONG>$?</STRONG>, see
       <STRONG><A HREF="sh.1.html">sh(1)</A></STRONG>) to be sure it is <STRONG>0</STRONG>.  (See the <STRONG>EXIT</STRONG> <STRONG>CODES</STRONG> and  <STRONG>DIAG-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>NOSTICS</STRONG>  sections.)   For  a complete list of capabilities
       and the <EM>capname</EM> associated with each, see <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>-T</STRONG><EM>type</EM> indicates the  <EM>type</EM>  of  terminal.   Normally  this
              option is unnecessary, because the default is taken
              from the environment variable <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>-T</STRONG> is spec-
              ified,  then  the shell variables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>
              will be ignored,and the operating system  will  not
              be queried for the actual screen size.

       <EM>capname</EM>
              indicates   the   capability   from   the  <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG>
              database.  When <STRONG>termcap</STRONG> support is compiled in, the
              <STRONG>termcap</STRONG> name for the capability is also accepted.

       <EM>parms</EM>  If  the  capability  is a string that takes parame-
              ters, the arguments <EM>parms</EM> will be instantiated into
              the string.

              Most  parameters  are numbers.  Only a few terminfo
              capabilities require string parameters; <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses a
              table to decide which to pass as strings.  Normally
              <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> (3x) to perform  the  substitution.
              If no parameters are given for the capability, <STRONG>tput</STRONG>
              writes   the   string   without   performing    the
              substitution.

       <STRONG>-S</STRONG>     allows  more  than one capability per invocation of
              <STRONG>tput</STRONG>.  The capabilities must be passed to <STRONG>tput</STRONG> from
              the standard input instead of from the command line
              (see example).  Only one  <EM>capname</EM>  is  allowed  per
              line.   The  <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option changes the meaning of the <STRONG>0</STRONG>
              and <STRONG>1</STRONG> boolean and string exit codes (see  the  EXIT
              CODES section).

              Again, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> uses a table and the presence of param-
              eters in its input to decide whether to  use  <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>
              (3x), and how to interpret the parameters.

       <STRONG>-V</STRONG>     reports  the  version  of ncurses which was used in
              this program, and exits.

       <STRONG>init</STRONG>   If the <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> database is present  and  an  entry
              for the user's terminal exists (see <STRONG>-T</STRONG><EM>type</EM>, above),
              the following will occur:

              (1)    if present,  the  terminal's  initialization
                     strings  will  be  output as detailed in the
                     <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> section on <EM>Tabs</EM> <EM>and</EM>  <EM>Initializa-</EM>
                     <EM>tion</EM>,

              (2)    any  delays (e.g., newline) specified in the
                     entry will be set in the tty driver,

              (3)    tabs expansion will  be  turned  on  or  off
                     according to the specification in the entry,
                     and

              (4)    if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will
                     be set (every 8 spaces).

              If an entry does not contain the information needed
              for any of the four above activities, that activity
              will silently be skipped.

       <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  Instead  of putting out initialization strings, the
              terminal's reset strings will be output if  present
              (<STRONG>rs1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, <STRONG>rf</STRONG>).  If the reset strings are not
              present, but initialization strings are,  the  ini-
              tialization  strings  will  be  output.  Otherwise,
              <STRONG>reset</STRONG> acts identically to <STRONG>init</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>longname</STRONG>
              If the <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> database is present  and  an  entry
              for  the user's terminal exists (see <STRONG>-T</STRONG><EM>type</EM> above),
              then the long name of the terminal will be put out.
              The long name is the last name in the first line of
              the terminal's description in the <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> database
              [see <STRONG><A HREF="term.5.html">term(5)</A></STRONG>].

       If  <STRONG>tput</STRONG>  is  invoked  by a link named <STRONG>reset</STRONG>, this has the
       same effect as <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.  See <STRONG>tset</STRONG> for comparison, which
       has similar behavior.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>init</STRONG>
            Initialize the terminal according to the type of ter-
            minal in the environmental variable <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>.  This  com-
            mand  should be included in everyone's .profile after
            the environmental variable <STRONG>TERM</STRONG> has been exported, as
            illustrated on the <STRONG><A HREF="profile.5.html">profile(5)</A></STRONG> manual page.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-T5620</STRONG> <STRONG>reset</STRONG>
            Reset  an  AT&amp;T 5620 terminal, overriding the type of
            terminal in the environmental variable <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG> <STRONG>0</STRONG>
            Send the sequence to move the cursor to row <STRONG>0</STRONG>, column
            <STRONG>0</STRONG> (the upper left corner of the screen, usually known
            as the "home" cursor position).

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>clear</STRONG>
            Echo the clear-screen sequence for the current termi-
            nal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cols</STRONG>
            Print the number of columns for the current terminal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-T450</STRONG> <STRONG>cols</STRONG>
            Print the number of columns for the 450 terminal.

       <STRONG>bold=`tput</STRONG> <STRONG>smso`</STRONG> <STRONG>offbold=`tput</STRONG> <STRONG>rmso`</STRONG>
            Set the shell variables <STRONG>bold</STRONG>, to begin stand-out mode
            sequence, and <STRONG>offbold</STRONG>, to end standout mode sequence,
            for the current terminal.  This might be followed  by
            a  prompt:  <STRONG>echo</STRONG>  <STRONG>"${bold}Please</STRONG>  <STRONG>type</STRONG>  <STRONG>in</STRONG> <STRONG>your</STRONG> <STRONG>name:</STRONG>
            <STRONG>${offbold}\c"</STRONG>

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>hc</STRONG>
            Set exit code to indicate if the current terminal  is
            a hard copy terminal.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>23</STRONG> <STRONG>4</STRONG>
            Send  the sequence to move the cursor to row 23, col-
            umn 4.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG>
            Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement, with no
            parameters substituted.

       <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>longname</STRONG>
            Print  the  long  name from the <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> database for
            the type of terminal specified in  the  environmental
            variable <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>.

            <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>-S</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;&lt;!</STRONG>
            <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> <STRONG>clear</STRONG>
            <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> <STRONG>cup</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG> <STRONG>10</STRONG>
            <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> <STRONG>bold</STRONG>
            <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> <STRONG>!</STRONG>

            This  example shows <STRONG>tput</STRONG> processing several capabili-
            ties in one invocation.  It clears the screen,  moves
            the  cursor  to  position  10,  10  and turns on bold
            (extra bright) mode.  The list is  terminated  by  an
            exclamation mark (<STRONG>!</STRONG>) on a line by itself.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>/usr/share/terminfo</STRONG>
              compiled terminal description database

       <STRONG>/usr/share/tabset/*</STRONG>
              tab settings for some terminals, in a format appro-
              priate  to  be  output  to  the  terminal   (escape
              sequences  that  set  margins  and  tabs); for more
              information, see the "Tabs and Initialization" sec-
              tion of <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>EXIT CODES</H2><PRE>
       If the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option is used, <STRONG>tput</STRONG> checks for errors from each
       line, and if any errors are found, will set the exit  code
       to  4  plus the number of lines with errors.  If no errors
       are found, the exit code is <STRONG>0</STRONG>.   No  indication  of  which
       line failed can be given so exit code <STRONG>1</STRONG> will never appear.
       Exit codes <STRONG>2</STRONG>, <STRONG>3</STRONG>, and <STRONG>4</STRONG> retain their usual  interpretation.
       If the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option is not used, the exit code depends on the
       type of <EM>capname</EM>:

            <EM>boolean</EM>
                   a value of <STRONG>0</STRONG> is set for TRUE and <STRONG>1</STRONG> for  FALSE.

            <EM>string</EM> a  value of <STRONG>0</STRONG> is set if the <EM>capname</EM> is defined
                   for this terminal <EM>type</EM> (the value  of  <EM>capname</EM>
                   is  returned on standard output); a value of <STRONG>1</STRONG>
                   is set if <EM>capname</EM> is not defined for this ter-
                   minal  <EM>type</EM>  (nothing  is  written to standard
                   output).

            <EM>integer</EM>
                   a value of <STRONG>0</STRONG> is always  set,  whether  or  not
                   <EM>capname</EM> is defined for this terminal <EM>type</EM>.  To
                   determine if <EM>capname</EM> is defined for this  ter-
                   minal <EM>type</EM>, the user must test the value writ-
                   ten to standard output.  A value of  <STRONG>-1</STRONG>  means
                   that  <EM>capname</EM> is not defined for this terminal
                   <EM>type</EM>.

            <EM>other</EM>  <STRONG>reset</STRONG> or <STRONG>init</STRONG> may fail to find  their  respec-
                   tive  files.   In  that case, the exit code is
                   set to 4 + <STRONG>errno</STRONG>.

       Any other exit code indicates an error; see  the  DIAGNOS-
       TICS section.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>longname</STRONG> and <STRONG>-S</STRONG> options, and  the  parameter-substitu-
       tion  features  used in the <STRONG>cup</STRONG> example, are not supported
       in BSD curses or in AT&amp;T/USL curses before SVr4.

       X/Open documents only the operands  for  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>,  <STRONG>init</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.   In this implementation, <STRONG>clear</STRONG> is part of the <EM>cap-</EM>
       <EM>name</EM> support.  Other implementations of <STRONG>tput</STRONG> on SVr4-based
       systems such as Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX as well as others
       such  as  AIX  and  Tru64  provide  support  for   <EM>capname</EM>
       operands.  A few platforms such as FreeBSD and NetBSD rec-
       ognize termcap names rather than terminfo capability names
       in their respective <STRONG>tput</STRONG> commands.
