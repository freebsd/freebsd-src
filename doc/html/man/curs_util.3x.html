</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-unctrl_wunctrl">unctrl, wunctrl</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>   returns   a   null-terminated   character   string   printably
       representing the <EM>curses</EM> character <EM>ch</EM>,  often  one  that  originated  in
       keyboard input; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">getch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Printable   characters  represent  themselves  as  a  one-character
           string.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Control characters are expressed in <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM> notation,  where  <EM>X</EM>  is  the
           printable  symbol  of  the  control  code's  value  plus  32 in the
           ISO 646/"ASCII" character set.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   DEL (character code 127) is represented as <STRONG>^?</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A character code greater than 127 is  represented  in  one  of  two
           ways.

           If  the  screen  has  not  been initialized or is in meta mode (see
           <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">meta(3x)</A></STRONG>), it  is  expressed  in  <STRONG>M-</STRONG><EM>X</EM>  notation,  where  X  is  the
           representation of the code's value minus 128, as described above.

           If the screen is not in meta mode, the character code is assumed to
           represent  itself.   It  nevertheless may not be printable; this is
           the case for character codes 128-159 in ISO 8859 encodings.

           <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  <STRONG><A HREF="legacy_coding.3x.html">use_legacy_coding(3x)</A></STRONG>   function   configures   <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>'s
           handling of these character codes.

       <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG>  returns  a  null-terminated  wide-character  string  printably
       representing the <EM>curses</EM> complex character <EM>wch</EM>.

       Both functions ignore the attributes and color pair selection of  their
       argument.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-keyname_key_name">keyname, key_name</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> routine returns a character string corresponding to the key
       <EM>c</EM>.  Key codes are different from character codes.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Key  codes  below  256  are  characters.   They are displayed using
           <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Values above 256 may be the codes for function keys.  The  function
           key name is displayed.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Otherwise  (if  there is no corresponding name and the key is not a
           character) the function returns null, to denote an  error.   X/Open
           also   lists   an   "UNKNOWN   KEY"   return   value,   which  some
           implementations return rather than null.

       The  corresponding  <STRONG>key_name</STRONG>  returns  a  multibyte  character   string
       corresponding  to  the  wide-character  value  <EM>wc</EM>.   The  two functions
       (<STRONG>keyname</STRONG> and <STRONG>key_name</STRONG>) do not return the same set of strings:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> returns null where <STRONG>key_name</STRONG> would display a meta character.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>key_name</STRONG> does not return the name of a function key.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-filter_nofilter">filter, nofilter</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine, if used, must be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>
       are called.  Calling <STRONG>filter</STRONG> causes these changes in initialization:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> is set to 1;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  capabilities  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cud</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cup</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>,  <STRONG>vpa</STRONG>  are
           disabled;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the capability <STRONG>ed</STRONG> is disabled if <STRONG>bce</STRONG> is set;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and the <STRONG>home</STRONG> string is set to the value of <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG> routine cancels the effect of  a  preceding  <STRONG>filter</STRONG>  call.
       That  allows  the  caller to initialize a screen on a different device,
       using a different value of <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG>.  The limitation  arises  because  the
       <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine modifies the in-memory copy of the terminal information.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-use_env">use_env</a></H3><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG>  routine,  if  used,  should  be  called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> are  called  (because  those  compute  the  screen  size).   It
       modifies  the way <EM>ncurses</EM> treats environment variables when determining
       the screen size.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Normally <EM>ncurses</EM> looks first  at  the  terminal  database  for  the
           screen size.

           If  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG>  was  called  with  <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>  for parameter, it stops here
           unless <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> was also called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> for parameter.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Then it asks for the screen size via operating  system  calls.   If
           successful, it overrides the values from the terminal database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Finally  (unless  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> was called with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> parameter), <EM>ncurses</EM>
           examines the <EM>LINES</EM> or <EM>COLUMNS</EM> environment variables, using a  value
           in  those  to  override  the  results  from the operating system or
           terminal database.

           <EM>curses</EM> also updates the screen size in response to <EM>SIGWINCH</EM>, unless
           overridden by the <EM>LINES</EM> or <EM>COLUMNS</EM> environment variables,


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-use_tioctl">use_tioctl</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> routine, if used, should be  called  before  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  or
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  are  called  (because  those  compute the screen size).  After
       <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> as an  argument,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  modifies  the
       last step in its computation of screen size as follows:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   checks  whether the <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM> environment variables are set
           to a number greater than zero.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   for each, <EM>ncurses</EM> updates the  corresponding  environment  variable
           with  the  value  that it has obtained via operating system call or
           from the terminal database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> re-fetches the value of the environment variables  so  that
           it is still the environment variables that set the screen size.

       The <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> and <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> routines combine as follows.

              <STRONG>use_env</STRONG>   <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG>   <STRONG>Summary</STRONG>
              -----------------------------------------------------------------
              <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>      <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>        <EM>ncurses</EM>   uses   operating  system  calls
                                     unless overridden  by  <EM>LINES</EM>  or  <EM>COLUMNS</EM>
                                     environment variables; default.
              <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>      <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>         <EM>ncurses</EM>  updates  <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM> based
                                     on operating system calls.
              <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>     <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>         <EM>ncurses</EM> ignores <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM>,  using
                                     operating system calls to obtain size.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-putwin_getwin">putwin, getwin</a></H3><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routine writes all data associated with window (or pad) <EM>win</EM>
       into the file to which <EM>filep</EM> points.  This  information  can  be  later
       retrieved using the <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> function.

       The  <STRONG>getwin</STRONG>  routine  reads  window  related data stored in the file by
       <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>.  The routine then creates and initializes a  new  window  using
       that  data.   It  returns a pointer to the new window.  There are a few
       caveats:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the data written is  a  copy  of  the  <EM>WINDOW</EM>  structure,  and  its
           associated  character  cells.  The format differs between the wide-
           character (<EM>ncursesw</EM>) and non-wide  (<EM>ncurses</EM>)  libraries.   You  can
           transfer data between the two, however.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  retrieved  window  is always created as a top-level window (or
           pad), rather than a subwindow.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the window's character cells contain the color pair <EM>value</EM>, but  not
           the  actual  color  <EM>numbers</EM>.   If cells in the retrieved window use
           color pairs that have not been created  in  the  application  using
           <STRONG>init_pair</STRONG>, they will not be colored when the window is refreshed.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-delay_output">delay_output</a></H3><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>delay_output</STRONG>  routine  inserts  an <EM>ms</EM> millisecond pause in output.
       Employ this function judiciously when  terminal  output  uses  padding,
       because  <EM>ncurses</EM>  transmits  null  characters  (consuming  CPU  and I/O
       resources) instead of  sleeping  and  requesting  resumption  from  the
       operating system.  Padding is used unless:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the terminal description has <STRONG>npc</STRONG> (<STRONG>no_pad_char</STRONG>) capability, or

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the environment variable <STRONG>NCURSES_NO_PADDING</STRONG> is set.

       If  padding is not in use, <EM>ncurses</EM> uses <STRONG>napms</STRONG> to perform the delay.  If
       the value of <EM>ms</EM> exceeds 30,000 (thirty seconds), it is capped  at  that
       value.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-flushinp">flushinp</a></H3><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>  routine throws away any typeahead that has been typed by
       the user and has not yet been read by the program.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       Except for <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>, functions that return  integers  return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon
       failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon success.

       Functions that return pointers return a null pointer on failure.

       In <EM>ncurses</EM>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if the terminal was not initialized, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if its associated <STRONG>write(2)</STRONG> calls return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-NOTES">NOTES</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG>  is  part of <EM>ncurses</EM>'s wide-character API, and is not available
       in its non-wide-character configuration.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       X/Open Curses Issue 4 describes these functions.  It specifies no error
       conditions for them.

       SVr4 describes a successful return value  only  as  "an  integer  value
       other than <EM>ERR</EM>".


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-filter">filter</a></H3><PRE>
       The  SVr4  documentation  describes  the  action  of <STRONG>filter</STRONG> only in the
       vaguest terms.  The description here  is  adapted  from  X/Open  Curses
       (which erroneously fails to describe the disabling of <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>).


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-delay_output-padding">delay_output padding</a></H3><PRE>
       The  limitation  to  30  seconds and the use of <STRONG>napms</STRONG> differ from other
       implementations.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> does not delay if no padding character is available.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD <EM>curses</EM> uses <STRONG>napms</STRONG> when no padding  character  is  available,
           but  does  not  take  timing  into  account  when using the padding
           character.

       Neither limits the delay.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-keyname">keyname</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> function  may  return  the  names  of  user-defined  string
       capabilities  that  are defined in the terminfo entry via the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option
       of <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.  This implementation  automatically  assigns  at  run-time  key
       codes to user-defined strings that begin with "k".  The key codes start
       at  KEY_MAX,  but are not guaranteed to be the same value for different
       runs  because  user-defined  codes  are  merged   from   all   terminal
       descriptions   that   have  been  loaded.   The  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_extend.3x.html">use_extended_names(3x)</A></STRONG>
       function controls  whether  this  data  is  loaded  when  the  terminal
       description is read by the library.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-nofilter_use_tioctl">nofilter, use_tioctl</a></H3><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG>  routines are specific to <EM>ncurses</EM>.  They
       were not supported on Version 7, BSD or System V  implementations.   It
       is  recommended  that  any  code  depending  on  <EM>ncurses</EM>  extensions be
       conditioned using <STRONG>NCURSES_VERSION</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-putwin_getwin-file-format">putwin/getwin file-format</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> and <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> functions have several issues with portability:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  files  written  and   read   by   these   functions   use   an
           implementation-specific  format.  Although the format is an obvious
           target for standardization, it has been overlooked.

           Interestingly enough, according to the copyright dates  in  Solaris
           source,  the  functions (along with <STRONG>scr_init</STRONG>, etc.) originated with
           the University of California, Berkeley (in 1982) and were later (in
           1988) incorporated into SVr4.  Oddly, there are no  such  functions
           in the 4.3BSD <EM>curses</EM> sources.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Most implementations simply dump the binary <EM>WINDOW</EM> structure to the
           file.   These  include SVr4 <EM>curses</EM>, NetBSD <EM>curses</EM>, and <EM>PDCurses</EM>, as
           well as older <EM>ncurses</EM> versions.  This implementation  (as  well  as
           <EM>xcurses</EM>,  the  X/Open  variant  of Solaris <EM>curses</EM>, dated 1995) uses
           textual dumps.

           The implementations that use binary dumps use block  I/O  (<STRONG>write(2)</STRONG>
           and  <STRONG>read(2)</STRONG> functions).  Those that use textual dumps use buffered
           I/O.  A few applications may happen to write extra data in the file
           using these functions.  Doing that can  run  into  problems  mixing
           block and buffered I/O.  This implementation reduces the problem on
           writes  by  flushing  the  output.   However,  reading  from a file
           written using mixed schemes may not be successful.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-unctrl_wunctrl">unctrl, wunctrl</a></H3><PRE>
       X/Open Curses Issue 4 describes these functions.  It specifies no error
       conditions for them.  It states that <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> and <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG> will  return  a
       null  pointer  if  unsuccessful.   This implementation checks for three
       cases:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII code.   This  is  the  case  that
           X/Open Curses documented.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the parameter is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1 control code.  If
           <STRONG><A HREF="legacy_coding.3x.html">use_legacy_coding(3x)</A></STRONG>  has  been  called with a <STRONG>2</STRONG> parameter, <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>
           returns the  parameter,  i.e.,  a  one-character  string  with  the
           parameter  as  the  first  character.   Otherwise, it returns "~@",
           "~A", etc., analogous to "^@", "^A", C0 controls.

           X/Open Curses does not document whether <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> can be called before
           initializing <EM>curses</EM>.  This implementation permits that, and returns
           the "~@", etc., values in that case.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   parameter values outside the 0 to 255 range.  <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> returns a null
           pointer.

       The strings returned by <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> in this implementation are determined at
       compile time, showing C1 controls from the upper-128 codes with  a  "~"
       prefix   rather   than   "^".   Other  implementations  have  different
       conventions.   For  example,  they  may  show  both  sets  of   control
       characters  with  "^",  and strip the parameter to 7 bits.  Or they may
       ignore C1 controls and treat all of the upper-128 codes  as  printable.
       This  implementation  uses  8  bits  but  does not modify the string to
       reflect locale.  The <STRONG><A HREF="legacy_coding.3x.html">use_legacy_coding(3x)</A></STRONG> function allows  the  caller
       to change the output of <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>.

       Likewise,  the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">meta(3x)</A></STRONG> function allows the caller to change the output
       of <STRONG>keyname</STRONG>, i.e., it determines whether to  use  the  "M-"  prefix  for
       "meta"    keys    (codes    in   the   range   128   to   255).    Both
       <STRONG><A HREF="legacy_coding.3x.html">use_legacy_coding(3x)</A></STRONG>  and  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">meta(3x)</A></STRONG>  succeed  only  after  <EM>curses</EM>   is
       initialized.   X/Open  Curses  does not document the treatment of codes
       128 to 159.  When treating them as "meta" keys (or if <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> is called
       before  initializing  <EM>curses</EM>),  this  implementation  returns   strings
       "M-^@", "M-^A", etc.

       X/Open  Curses  documents <EM>unctrl</EM> as declared in <EM>unctrl.h</EM>, which <EM>ncurses</EM>
       does.  However, <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  <EM>curses.h</EM>  includes  <EM>unctrl.h</EM>,  matching  the
       behavior of SVr4 <EM>curses</EM>.  Other implementations may not do that.

       If  <EM>ncurses</EM>  is  configured  to provide the sp-functions extension, the
       state of <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> and <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> may be  updated  before  creating  each
       <EM>screen</EM>  rather  than  once  only  (<STRONG><A HREF="curs_sp_funcs.3x.html">curs_sp_funcs(3x)</A></STRONG>).  This feature of
       <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> is not provided by other implementations of <EM>curses</EM>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       4BSD (1980) introduced <EM>unctrl</EM>, defining it as a macro in <EM>unctrl.h</EM>.

       SVr2 (1984) added <EM>delay</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>output</EM>, <EM>flushinp</EM>, and <EM>keyname</EM>.

       SVr3 (1987) supplied <EM>filter</EM>.  Later that year,  SVr3.1  brought  <EM>getwin</EM>
       and  <EM>putwin</EM>,  reading  and  writing  window  dumps  with  <STRONG>fread(3)</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>fwrite(3)</STRONG>, respectively.

       SVr4 (1989) furnished <EM>use</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>env</EM>.

       X/Open Curses Issue 4 (1995) specified <EM>key</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>name</EM> and <EM>wunctrl</EM>.

       <EM>ncurses</EM> 5.6 (2006) added <EM>nofilter</EM>, and 6.0 (2015) <EM>use</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>tioctl</EM>.
