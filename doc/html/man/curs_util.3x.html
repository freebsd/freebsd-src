<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>  routine returns a character string which is a
       printable representation of the character <EM>c</EM>, ignoring  at-
       tributes.   Control characters are displayed in the <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM> no-
       tation.  Printing characters are  displayed  as  is.   The
       corresponding  <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG>  returns a printable representation
       of a wide character.

       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> routine returns a character string correspond-
       ing to the key <EM>c</EM>:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Printable  characters  are displayed as themselves,
              e.g., a one-character string containing the key.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Control characters are displayed in  the  <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM>  nota-
              tion.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   DEL (character 127) is displayed as <STRONG>^?</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Values above 128 are either meta characters (if the
              screen has not been initialized,  or  if  <STRONG>meta</STRONG>  has
              been  called  with  a TRUE parameter), shown in the
              <STRONG>M-</STRONG><EM>X</EM> notation, or are displayed as  themselves.   In
              the  latter  case, the values may not be printable;
              this follows the X/Open specification.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Values above 256 may be the names of the  names  of
              function keys.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Otherwise  (if  there is no corresponding name) the
              function returns null, to denote an error.   X/Open
              also  lists  an  "UNKNOWN  KEY" return value, which
              some implementations return rather than null.

       The corresponding <STRONG>key_name</STRONG> returns a character string cor-
       responding  to  the wide-character value <EM>w</EM>.  The two func-
       tions do not return the same set of  strings;  the  latter
       returns null where the former would display a meta charac-
       ter.

       The <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine, if used, must be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>
       or  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  are called.  The effect is that, during those
       calls, <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> is set to 1;  the  capabilities  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cup</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>cud</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>,  <STRONG>vpa</STRONG>  are  disabled; and the <STRONG>home</STRONG>
       string is set to the value of <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG> routine cancels the  effect  of  a  preceding
       <STRONG>filter</STRONG>  call.   That  allows  the  caller  to initialize a
       screen on a different device, using a different  value  of
       <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG>.   The  limitation arises because the <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine
       modifies the in-memory copy of the terminal information.

       The <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> routine, if  used,  should  be  called  before
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> are called (because those compute the
       screen size).  It modifies the way <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> treats environ-
       ment variables when determining the screen size.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Normally  ncurses looks first at the terminal database
           for the screen size.

           If <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> was called with  <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>  for  parameter,  it
           stops  here  unless If <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> was also called with
           <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> for parameter.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Then it asks for the screen size via operating  system
           calls.   If  successful,  it overrides the values from
           the terminal database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Finally (unless <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> was called with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>  parame-
           ter),  ncurses  examines the <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> or <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> environ-
           ment variables, using a value in those to override the
           results  from  the  operating system or terminal data-
           base.

           Ncurses also updates the screen size  in  response  to
           SIGWINCH,  unless  overridden  by the <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> or <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>
           environment variables,

       The <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> routine, if used, should be  called  before
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> are called (because those compute the
       screen size).  After <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> as  an
       argument,  ncurses  modifies the last step in its computa-
       tion of screen size as follows:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   checks if the <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> environment  variables
           are set to a number greater than zero.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   for  each,  ncurses updates the corresponding environ-
           ment variable with the value that it has obtained  via
           operating system call or from the terminal database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   ncurses  re-fetches the value of the environment vari-
           ables so that it is still  the  environment  variables
           which set the screen size.

       The  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> and <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG> routines combine as summarized
       here:

     <EM>use</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>env</EM>   <EM>use</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>tioctl</EM>   <EM>Summary</EM>
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     TRUE      FALSE        This is the default  behavior.   ncurses
                            uses operating system calls unless over-
                            ridden by $LINES or $COLUMNS environment
                            variables.
     TRUE      TRUE         ncurses   updates  $LINES  and  $COLUMNS
                            based on operating system calls.

     FALSE     TRUE         ncurses ignores $LINES and $COLUMNS, us-
                            es  operating  system  calls  to  obtain
                            size.
     FALSE     FALSE        ncurses relies on the terminal  database
                            to determine size.

       The  <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routine writes all data associated with window
       <EM>win</EM> into the file to which <EM>filep</EM> points.  This information
       can be later retrieved using the <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> function.

       The <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> routine reads window related data stored in the
       file by <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>.  The routine then creates and  initializes
       a new window using that data.  It returns a pointer to the
       new window.

       The <STRONG>delay_output</STRONG> routine inserts an <EM>ms</EM>  millisecond  pause
       in  output.   This  routine should not be used extensively
       because padding characters are  used  rather  than  a  CPU
       pause.   If  no  padding character is specified, this uses
       <STRONG>napms</STRONG> to perform the delay.

       The <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG> routine throws away any  typeahead  that  has
       been  typed  by  the user and has not yet been read by the
       program.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except for <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>, routines that return an  integer  re-
       turn  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 specifies only "an in-
       teger value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this  im-
       plementation

          <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>
               returns  an error if the terminal was not initial-
               ized.

          <STRONG>meta</STRONG> returns an error if the terminal was not  initial-
               ized.

          <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>
               returns  an  error  if the associated <STRONG>fwrite</STRONG> calls
               return an error.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue  4  describes  these  func-
       tions.   It  states  that <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> and <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG> will return a
       null pointer if unsuccessful, but does not define any  er-
       ror conditions.  This implementation checks for three cas-
       es:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII  code.   This  is
              the case that X/Open Curses documented.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  parameter  is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1
              control code.  If <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> has been called
              with  a  <STRONG>2</STRONG> parameter, <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> returns the parameter,
              i.e., a one-character string with the parameter  as
              the  first  character.  Otherwise, it returns "~@",
              "~A", etc., analogous to "^@", "^A", C0 controls.

              X/Open Curses does not document whether <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>  can
              be  called before initializing curses.  This imple-
              mentation permits that, and returns the "~@", etc.,
              values in that case.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   parameter  values outside the 0 to 255 range.  <STRONG>unc-</STRONG>
              <STRONG>trl</STRONG> returns a null pointer.

       The SVr4 documentation describes the action of <STRONG>filter</STRONG> only
       in  the  vaguest  terms.   The description here is adapted
       from the XSI Curses standard (which erroneously  fails  to
       describe the disabling of <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>).

       The  strings returned by <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> in this implementation are
       determined at compile time, showing C1 controls  from  the
       upper-128  codes with a `~' prefix rather than `^'.  Other
       implementations have different conventions.  For  example,
       they  may  show  both sets of control characters with `^',
       and strip the parameter to 7 bits.  Or they may ignore  C1
       controls  and  treat  all of the upper-128 codes as print-
       able.  This implementation uses 8 bits but does not modify
       the string to reflect locale.  The <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> func-
       tion allows the caller to change the output of <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>.

       Likewise, the <STRONG>meta</STRONG> function allows the  caller  to  change
       the  output of <STRONG>keyname</STRONG>, i.e., it determines whether to use
       the `M-' prefix for "meta" keys (codes in the range 128 to
       255).   Both <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> and <STRONG>meta</STRONG> succeed only after
       curses is initialized.  X/Open Curses  does  not  document
       the  treatment of codes 128 to 159.  When treating them as
       "meta" keys (or if <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> is called  before  initializing
       curses),   this  implementation  returns  strings  "M-^@",
       "M-^A", etc.

       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> function may return the names of  user-defined
       string  capabilities which are defined in the terminfo en-
       try via the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.  This  implementation  auto-
       matically  assigns  at  run-time  keycodes to user-defined
       strings which begin  with  "k".   The  keycodes  start  at
       KEY_MAX,  but  are not guaranteed to be the same value for
       different runs because user-defined codes are merged  from
       all  terminal  descriptions  which  have been loaded.  The
       <STRONG>use_extended_names</STRONG> function controls whether this data  is
       loaded  when  the  terminal description is read by the li-
       brary.

       The <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>use_tioctl</STRONG>  routines  are  specific  to
       ncurses.   They  were  not  supported on Version 7, BSD or
       System V implementations.  It is recommended that any code
       depending  on  ncurses  extensions  be  conditioned  using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
