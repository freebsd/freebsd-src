<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>wresize</STRONG> - resize a curses window


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>wresize(WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>*win,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>lines,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>columns);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This  is  an  extension to the curses library.  It reallo-
       cates storage for an <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> window to adjust  its  dimen-
       sions  to  the  specified  values.  If either dimension is
       larger than the  current  values,  the  window's  data  is
       filled with blanks that have the current background rendi-
       tion (as set by <STRONG>wbkgdset</STRONG>) merged into them.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The function returns the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure  and  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>
       on success.  It will fail if either of the dimensions less
       than or equal  to  zero,  or  if  an  error  occurs  while
       (re)allocating memory for the window.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they
       be greater than zero.  The dimensions are not compared  to
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG>   screen   dimensions  to  simplify  the  logic  of
       <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG>.  The caller  must  ensure  that  the  window's
       dimensions fit within the actual screen dimensions.
