.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_hs_get

.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_hs.h
.Ft void *
.Fn ck_hs_get "ck_hs_t *hs" "unsigned long hash" "const void *key"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_hs_get 3
function will return a pointer to a key in the hash set
.Fa hs
that is of equivalent value to the object pointed to by
.Fa key .
The key specified by
.Fa key
is expected to have the hash value specified by the
.Fa hash
argument (which is to have been previously generated using the
.Xr CK_HS_HASH 3
macro).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the provided key is a member of
.Fa hs
then a pointer to the key as stored in
.Fa hs
is returned. If the key was not found in
.Fa hs
then a value of
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa entry
or
.Fa hs
are uninitialized.
