.Dt CK_HS_REBUILD 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_hs_rebuild
.Nd rebuild a hash set
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_hs.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_hs_rebuild "ck_hs_t *hs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_hs_rebuild 3
function will regenerate the hash set pointed to by
.Fa hs .
This has the side-effect of pruning degradatory side-effects
of workloads that are delete heavy. The regenerated hash
set should have shorter probe sequences on average. This
operation will require a significant amount of memory
and is free to allocate a duplicate hash set in the
rebuild process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn ck_hs_rebuild 3
returns true and otherwise returns false on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
This function will only return false if there are internal memory allocation
failures.
