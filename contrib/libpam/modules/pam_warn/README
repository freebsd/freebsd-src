This module is an authentication module that does not authenticate.
Instead it always returns PAM_IGNORE, indicating that it does not want
to affect the authentication process.

Its purpose is to log a message to the syslog indicating the
pam_item's available at the time it was invoked. It is a diagnostic
tool.

Recognized arguments:

	<none>

module services provided:

	auth		_authenticate and _setcred (blank)
	acct		_acct_mgmt [mapped to _authenticate]
	session		_open_session and
			_close_session [mapped to _authenticate ]
	password	_chauthtok [mapped to _authenticate]
