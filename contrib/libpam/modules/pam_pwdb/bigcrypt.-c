/*
 * This function implements the "bigcrypt" algorithm specifically for
 * Linux-PAM.
 *  
 * This algorithm is algorithm 0 (default) shipped with the C2 secure
 * implementation of Digital UNIX.
 * 
 * Disclaimer: This work is not based on the source code to Digital
 * UNIX, nor am I connected to Digital Equipment Corp, in any way
 * other than as a customer. This code is based on published
 * interfaces and reasonable guesswork.
 * 
 * Description: The cleartext is divided into blocks of SEGMENT_SIZE=8
 * characters or less. Each block is encrypted using the standard UNIX
 * libc crypt function. The result of the encryption for one block
 * provides the salt for the suceeding block.
 * 
 * Restrictions: The buffer used to hold the encrypted result is
 * statically allocated. (see MAX_PASS_LEN below).  This is necessary,
 * as the returned pointer points to "static data that are overwritten
 * by each call", (XPG3: XSI System Interface + Headers pg 109), and
 * this is a drop in replacement for crypt();
