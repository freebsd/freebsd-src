## Note, to get this to work as it is currently typed you need
##
## 1. to run an application as root
## 2. add the following groups to the /etc/group file:
##		floppy, games, sound
##
#
# *** Please note that giving group membership on a session basis is
# *** NOT inherently secure. If a user can create an executable that
# *** is setgid a group that they are infrequently given membership
# *** of, they can basically obtain group membership any time they
# *** like. Example: games are allowed between the hours of 6pm and 6am
# *** user joe logs in at 7pm writes a small C-program toplay.c that
# *** invokes their favorite shell, compiles it and does
# *** "chgrp games toplay; chmod g+s toplay". They are basically able
# *** to play games any time... You have been warned. AGM

# this is an example configuration file for the pam_group module. Its
# syntax is based on that of the pam_time module and (at some point in
# the distant past was inspired by the 'shadow' package)
#
# the syntax of the lines is as follows:
#
#       services;ttys;users;times;groups
#
# white space is ignored and lines maybe extended with '\\n' (escaped
# newlines). From reading these comments, it is clear that
# text following a '#' is ignored to the end of the line.
#
# the first four fields are described in the pam_time directory.
# The only difference for these is how the time field is interpretted:
# it is used to indicate "when" these groups are to be given to the user.
#
# groups
#	The (comma or space separated) list of groups that the user 
#	inherits membership of. These groups are added if the previous
#	fields are satisfied by the user's request
#

#
# Here is a simple example: running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device),
# the user 'us' is given access to the floppy (through membership of
# the floppy group)
#

#xsh;tty*&!ttyp*;us;Al0000-2400;floppy

#
# another example: running 'xsh' on tty* (any ttyXXX device),
# the user 'sword' is given access to games (through membership of
# the floppy group) after work hours
#

#xsh; tty* ;sword;!Wk0900-1800;games, sound
#xsh; tty* ;*;Al0900-1800;floppy

#
# End of group.conf file
