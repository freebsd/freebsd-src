# This is the configuration file for pam_env, a PAM module to load in 
# a configurable list of environment variables for a

# The original idea for this came from Andrew G. Morgan ...

#   Mmm. Perhaps you might like to write a pam_env module that reads a
#   default environment from a file? I can see that as REALLY
#   useful... Note it would be an "auth" module that returns PAM_IGNORE
#   for the auth part and sets the environment returning PAM_SUCCESS in
#   the setcred function...

# What I wanted was the REMOTEHOST variable set, purely for selfish
# reasons, and AGM didn't want it added to the SimpleApps login
# program (which is where I added the patch). So, my first concern is
# that variable, from there there are numerous others that might/would
# be useful to be set: NNTPSERVER, LESS, PATH, PAGER, MANPAGER .....
#
# Of course, these are a different kind of variable than REMOTEHOST in
# that they are things that are likely to be configured by
# administrators rather than set by logging in, how to treat them both
# in the same config file?
#
# Here is my idea: 
#
# Each line starts with the variable name, there are then two possible
# options for each variable DEFAULT and OVERRIDE. 
# DEFAULT allows and administrator to set the value of the
# variable  to some default value, if none is supplied then the empty
# string is assumed. The OVERRIDE option tells pam_env that it should
# enter in its value (overriding the default value) if there is one
# to use. OVERRIDE is not used, "" is assumed and no override will be
# done. 
#
# VARIABLE   [DEFAULT=[value]]  [OVERRIDE=[value]]
#
# (Possibly non-existent) environment variables may be used in values
# using the ${string} syntax and (possibly non-existent) PAM_ITEMs may
# be used in values using the @{string} syntax. Both the $ and @
# characters can be backslash escaped to be used as literal values
# values can be delimited with "", escaped " not supported.
#
#
# First, some special variables
#
# Set the REMOTEHOST variable for any hosts that are remote, default
# to "localhost" rather than not being set at all
REMOTEHOST	DEFAULT=localhost OVERRIDE=@{PAM_RHOST}
#
# Set the DISPLAY variable if it seems reasonable 
DISPLAY		DEFAULT=${REMOTEHOST}:0.0 OVERRIDE=${DISPLAY}
#
#
#  Now some simple variables
#
PAGER		DEFAULT=less
MANPAGER	DEFAULT=less
LESS		DEFAULT="M q e h15 z23 b80"
NNTPSERVER	DEFAULT=localhost
PATH		DEFAULT=${HOME}/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin\
:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin/X11:/usr/bin/X11
#
# silly examples of escaped variables, just to show how they work.
#
DOLLAR		DEFAULT=\$
DOLLARDOLLAR	DEFAULT=	OVERRIDE=\$${DOLLAR}
DOLLARPLUS	DEFAULT=\${REMOTEHOST}${REMOTEHOST}
ATSIGN		DEFAULT=""	OVERRIDE=\@
