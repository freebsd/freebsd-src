# $FreeBSD$

pam_wheel:
	only permit root authentication too members of wheel group

RECOGNIZED ARGUMENTS:
	debug		write a message to syslog indicating success or
			failure.

	use_uid		the check for wheel membership will be done against
			the current uid instead of the original one
			(useful when jumping with su from one account to
			another for example)

	trust		the pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS instead
			of PAM_IGNORE if the user is a member of the wheel
			group (thus with a little play stacking the modules
			the wheel members may be able to su to root without
			being prompted for a passwd).

	deny		Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the user
			is trying to get UID 0 access and is a member of the
			wheel group, deny access (well, kind of nonsense, but
			for use in conjunction with 'group' argument... :-)

	group=xxxx	Instead of checking the GID 0 group, use the xxxx
			group to perform the authentification.

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED:
	auth		_authetication and _setcred (blank)
