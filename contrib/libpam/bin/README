(now we are getting networked apps, be careful to try and test on a
securely isolated system!)

N=2 <-- blank xsh

Following a 'make install' (which should be done as root) in the
parent directory this directory will contain $N binaries. The source
for these programs is in ../examples. They are various short programs
to use and otherwise test-drive the Linux-PAM libraries/modules with.

These programs grant no privileges, but they give an idea of how well
the modules are working.

blank is new as of Linux-PAM-0.21. If you are writing/modifying an
application it might be a place to start...

xsh is new as of Linux-PAM-0.31, it is identical to blank, but invokes
/bin/sh if the user is authenticated.

[other apps are to be found in SimplePAMApps and many more on Red
Hat's server.. http://www.redhat.com/]
