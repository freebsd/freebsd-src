<sect2>Overview of module

<p>
This module is very dangerous. It should be used with extreme
caution. Its action is always to permit access. It does nothing else.

<sect2>Account+Authentication+Password+Session components

<p>
<descrip>

<tag><bf>Recognized arguments:</bf></tag>

<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

No matter what management group, the action of this module is to
simply return <tt/PAM_SUCCESS/ -- operation successful.

<p>
In the case of authentication, the user's name will be acquired. Many
applications become confused if this name is unknown.

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>

It is seldom a good idea to use this module. However, it does have
some legitimate uses.  For example, if the system-administrator wishes
to turn off the account management on a workstation, and at the same
time continue to allow logins, then she might use the following
configuration file entry for login:
<tscreen>
<verb>
#
# add this line to your other login entries to disable account
# management, but continue to permit users to log in...
#
login	account	 required	pam_permit.so
</verb>
</tscreen>
