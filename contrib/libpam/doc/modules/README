This directory contains a number of sgml sub-files. One for each
documented module. They contain a description of each module and give
some indication of its reliability.

Additionally, there is a 'module.sgml-template' file which should be
used as a blank form for new module descriptions.

Please feel free to submit amendments/comments etc. regarding these
files to:
