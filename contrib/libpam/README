Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM-0.65.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin:

  * This distribution requires GNU's Make
  * It requires GNU's C-compiler: gcc (and 'ld')
  * it also requires the GNU shell: bash
  * some of the modules require the presence of libpwdb see redhat
  * two modules have some need for libcrack too..

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[
Zeroth (optional) thing to do: check the detatched "pgp" signature for
this distribution file, it should be signed by

Type Bits/KeyID    Date       User ID
pub  1024/2A398175 1996/11/17 Andrew G. Morgan <morgan@linux.kernel.org>
]

First thing to do (I assume you have successfully unpacked it!) is to
run:

    make check                           [ requires md5sum to be present ]

This will also check that the distribution has arrived intact. [
Later, If you change some things, running this command from this
directory will show you what files you have altered. ]

If you choose to get and install the RCS files that accompany this
release, you may also run

	make RCScheck

from this directory.

Next, you should check the symbolic link

	.../Linux-PAM-X.YY/default.defs

points to the file that best describes your system. The various *.defs
files that are included in this distribution are to be found in the
directory:

	.../Linux-PAM-X.YY/defs/

This should configure the distribution to compile on your system. The
default is the version I use for maintaining the distribution. [If you
don't find one that suits your needs, please try to create one, email
it to me and I will include it in a future release.]

If you are running an ELF based Linux system you should be able to
compile the distribution straight from the box. If you are running an
a.out based system, then some of the functionality of Linux-PAM will
be unavailable to you. Instead, you must switch the DYNAMIC variables
*off* in your "defs" file: comment out the DYNAMIC and DYNAMIC_LIBPAM
defines and uncomment the STATIC and STATIC_LIBPAM defines. NOTE, for
ELF based systems, almost any combination of these four definitions is
legal... If you have ELF, I recommend the default however.

Second, try to compile it. Use the following command in *this*
directory:

	make

[ or 'make all' if you prefer ]. The first time you type make, it is
likely to complain. This is to remind you to remove any libraries from
previous versions of the distribution that are likely to confuse this
make... Type 'make' again.

Before you do the third thing. You should think about whether you want
the default configuration scripts to be installed or not. If you have
a working PAM based system you probably do *not* want this.. Whatever,
before Linux-PAM installs the default scripts you will be prompted as
to whether it is a good idea. Be sure to say NO if you are worried!
** You have been warned. **

Third, to install the stuff you need to be root. Do the following:

	su -c "make install"

If everything has worked as intended there should now be

	some executables		in	./bin/
	some filters for pam_filter	in	/usr/sbin/pam_filter/
	some configuration files:
		/etc/pam.conf
		/etc/security/*.conf
	libpam_misc.a (static library)	in	/usr/lib/

In addition:

    if dynamically linked:

	libpam.so.XXX (shared library)	        in	/usr/lib/
	libpam_misc.so.XXX (shared library)	in	/usr/lib/
	pam_*.so (modules)		        in	/usr/lib/security/

    if statically linked:

	libpam.a (static library)	in	/usr/lib/

[These are the default directories that I use. Your own system may
differ as specified in your XXX.defs file.]

NOTES:

* The documentation, what there is of it, is in ./doc. I am only
including the sgml format source-files. But try to make .ps files
available from the above http address. To locally use these sgml files
you should have linuxdoc-sgml installed. Sorry, but I'm conserving net
bandwidth by only including sources!

* The source for each module is to be found in ./modules/XXX. If you
want to add a new one, make a directory like XXX for it. Add the name
(XXX) to MODDIRS in ./modules/Makefile and hopefully it will become
part of the overall make. Note, the Makefile in ./modules/ is now
smart enough to check if the directory is there before it changes into
it; If you want to start working on a module, send me its name and I
will add it to the "official" Makefile.. This way, you should be able
to insert your developing module into any new release, and not have to
worry at first about letting it out to the public. This may also give
other people some idea about whether a module is currently being
worked on or not.

* Currently, you have to 'make' binaries from this directory. 'make
clean', however, works in any directory that has a Makefile.

* Also, you can 'make remove' (as root) from *this* directory and it
will delete the various installed files dotted around the system. THIS
IS A VERY BAD IDEA IF YOUR SYSTEM DEPENDS ON PAM TO WORK!!!

* 'make sterile' does 'make remove' and then 'make extraclean', this
might be required if you are alternating your choice of
STATIC(_LIBPAM) and DYNAMIC(_LIBPAM) compilation. SEE COMMENT IN
UPPERCASE IN PARAGRAPH ABOVE!!!!

Best wishes
