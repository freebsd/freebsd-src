WPA Supplicant
	originals can be found at: http://hostap.epitest.fi/releases/


For the import files and directories were pruned by:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -zxf wpa_supplicant-0.3.8.tar.gz

then imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Import of WPA supplicant 0.3.8' \
		src/contrib/wpa_supplicant MALINEN v0_3_8

To make local changes to wpa_supplcaint, simply patch and commit
to the main branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the
vendor (MALINEN) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to Jouni Malinen for inclusion in
the next vendor release.
