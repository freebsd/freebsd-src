    <title>WPA</title>

    <para>The original security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was
    not designed to be strong and has proven to be insufficient for
    most networks that require some kind of security. Task group I
    (Security) of IEEE 802.11 working group
    (http://www.ieee802.org/11/) has worked to address the flaws of
    the base standard and has in practice completed its work in May
    2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard was
    approved in June 2004 and published in July 2004.</para>

    <para>Wi-Fi Alliance (http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a draft version
    of the IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) to define a subset of the
    security enhancements that can be implemented with existing wlan
    hardware. This is called Wi-Fi Protected Access&lt;TM&gt; (WPA). This
    has now become a mandatory component of interoperability testing
    and certification done by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi provides
    information about WPA at its web site
    (http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).</para>

    <para>IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP)
    algorithm for protecting wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with
    40-bit keys, 24-bit initialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to
    protect against packet forgery. All these choices have proven to
    be insufficient: key space is too small against current attacks,
    RC4 key scheduling is insufficient (beginning of the pseudorandom
    stream should be skipped), IV space is too small and IV reuse
    makes attacks easier, there is no replay protection, and non-keyed
    authentication does not protect against bit flipping packet
    data.</para>

    <para>WPA is an intermediate solution for the security issues. It
    uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP. TKIP
    is a compromise on strong security and possibility to use existing
    hardware. It still uses RC4 for the encryption like WEP, but with
    per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it implements replay protection,
    keyed packet authentication mechanism (Michael MIC).</para>

    <para>Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can
    either use an external authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) and
    EAP just like IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without need
    for additional servers. Wi-Fi calls these "WPA-Enterprise" and
    "WPA-Personal", respectively. Both mechanisms will generate a
    master session key for the Authenticator (AP) and Supplicant
    (client station).</para>

    <para>WPA implements a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and
    Group Key Handshake) for generating and exchanging data encryption
    keys between the Authenticator and Supplicant. This handshake is
    also used to verify that both Authenticator and Supplicant know
    the master session key. These handshakes are identical regardless
    of the selected key management mechanism (only the method for
    generating master session key changes).</para>

    <title>IEEE 802.11i / WPA2</title>

    <para>The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included
    in WPA has finished (May 2004) and this amendment to IEEE 802.11
    was approved in June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE
    802.11i as a new version of WPA called WPA2. This includes, e.g.,
    support for more robust encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES in Counter
    mode with CBC-MAC) to replace TKIP and optimizations for handoff
    (reduced number of messages in initial key handshake,
    pre-authentication, and PMKSA caching).</para>
