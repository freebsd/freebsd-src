.SH NAME
lwres_net_ntop \- lightweight resolver IP address presentation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <lwres/net.h>
.sp
.na
const char *
lwres_net_ntop(int af, const void *src, char *dst, size_t size);
.ad
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlwres_net_ntop()\fR converts an IP address of
protocol family \fIaf\fR \(em IPv4 or IPv6 \(em
at location \fIsrc\fR from network format to its
conventional representation as a string. For IPv4 addresses, that
string would be a dotted-decimal. An IPv6 address would be
represented in colon notation as described in RFC1884.
.PP
The generated string is copied to \fIdst\fR provided
\fIsize\fR indicates it is long enough to store the
ASCII representation of the address.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
If successful, the function returns \fIdst\fR:
a pointer to a string containing the presentation format of the
address. \fBlwres_net_ntop()\fR returns
\fBNULL\fR and sets the global variable
errno to EAFNOSUPPORT if
the protocol family given in \fIaf\fR is not
supported.
