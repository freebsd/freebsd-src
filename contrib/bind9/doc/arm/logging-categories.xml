	    Log queries that have been forced to use plain

	    (not always returning FORMERR or similar to
	    EDNS queries and other extensions to the DNS
	    when they are not understood).  In other words, this is

	    DNS queries that they don't understand.

	  <para>
	    Note: the log message can also be due to
	    packet loss.  Before reporting servers for
	    non-RFC 1034 compliance they should be re-tested
	    to determine the nature of the non-compliance.
	    This testing should prevent or reduce the
	    number of false-positive reports.

	  <para>
	    Note: eventually <command>named</command> will have to stop
	    treating such timeouts as due to RFC 1034 non
	    compliance and start treating it as plain
	    packet loss.  Falsely classifying packet
	    loss as due to RFC 1034 non compliance impacts
	    on DNSSEC validation which requires EDNS for
	    the DNSSEC records to be returned.
