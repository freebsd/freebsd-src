    the journal file is formed by appending the
    extension <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.jnl</TT
> to the
    name of the corresponding zone file.  The journal file is in a
    binary format and should not be edited manually.</P
><P
>The server will also occasionally write ("dump")
    the complete contents of the updated zone to its zone file.
    This is not done immediately after
    each dynamic update, because that would be too slow when a large
    zone is updated frequently.  Instead, the dump is delayed by
    up to 15 minutes, allowing additional updates to take place.</P
><P
>When a server is restarted after a shutdown or crash, it will replay
    the journal file to incorporate into the zone any updates that took
    place after the last zone dump.</P
><P
>Changes that result from incoming incremental zone transfers are also
    journalled in a similar way.</P
><P
>The zone files of dynamic zones cannot normally be edited by
    hand because they are not guaranteed to contain the most recent
    dynamic changes - those are only in the journal file.
    The only way to ensure that the zone file of a dynamic zone
    is up to date is to run <B
CLASS="command"
>rndc stop</B
>.</P
><P
>If you have to make changes to a dynamic zone
    manually, the following procedure will work: Disable dynamic updates
    to the zone using
    <B
CLASS="command"
>rndc freeze <VAR
CLASS="replaceable"
>zone</VAR

    This will also remove the zone's <TT

></H1
><P
>Setting up different views, or visibility, of the DNS space to
internal and external resolvers is usually referred to as a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Split
DNS</I
></SPAN
> setup. There are several reasons an organization
would want to set up its DNS this way.</P
><P
>One common reason for setting up a DNS system this way is
to hide "internal" DNS information from "external" clients on the
Internet. There is some debate as to whether or not this is actually useful.
Internal DNS information leaks out in many ways (via email headers,
for example) and most savvy "attackers" can find the information
they need using other means.</P
><P
>Another common reason for setting up a Split DNS system is
to allow internal networks that are behind filters or in RFC 1918
space (reserved IP space, as documented in RFC 1918) to resolve DNS
on the Internet. Split DNS can also be used to allow mail from outside
back in to the internal network.</P
><P
>Here is an example of a split DNS setup:</P
><P
>Let's say a company named <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Example, Inc.</I
></SPAN
>
(<VAR
CLASS="literal"
>example.com</VAR
>)
has several corporate sites that have an internal network with reserved
Internet Protocol (IP) space and an external demilitarized zone (DMZ),
or "outside" section of a network, that is available to the public.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Example, Inc.</I
></SPAN
> wants its internal clients
to be able to resolve external hostnames and to exchange mail with
people on the outside. The company also wants its internal resolvers
to have access to certain internal-only zones that are not available
at all outside of the internal network.</P
><P
>In order to accomplish this, the company will set up two sets
of name servers. One set will be on the inside network (in the reserved
IP space) and the other set will be on bastion hosts, which are "proxy"
hosts that can talk to both sides of its network, in the DMZ.</P
><P
>The internal servers will be configured to forward all queries,
except queries for <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1.internal</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.internal</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1.example.com</TT
>,
and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.example.com</TT
>, to the servers in the
DMZ. These internal servers will have complete sets of information
for <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1.example.com</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.example.com</TT
>,<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
> </I
></SPAN
><TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1.internal</TT
>,
and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.internal</TT
>.</P
><P
>To protect the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1.internal</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.internal</TT
> domains,
the internal name servers must be configured to disallow all queries
to these domains from any external hosts, including the bastion
hosts.</P
><P
>The external servers, which are on the bastion hosts, will
be configured to serve the "public" version of the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.example.com</TT
> zones.
This could include things such as the host records for public servers
(<TT
CLASS="filename"
>www.example.com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>ftp.example.com</TT
>),
and mail exchange (MX)  records (<TT
CLASS="filename"
>a.mx.example.com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>b.mx.example.com</TT
>).</P
><P
>In addition, the public <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>site2.example.com</TT
> zones
should have special MX records that contain wildcard (`*') records
pointing to the bastion hosts. This is needed because external mail
servers do not have any other way of looking up how to deliver mail
to those internal hosts. With the wildcard records, the mail will
be delivered to the bastion host, which can then forward it on to
internal hosts.</P
><P
>Here's an example of a wildcard MX record:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
><VAR
CLASS="literal"
>*   IN MX 10 external1.example.com.</VAR
></PRE
><P
>Now that they accept mail on behalf of anything in the internal
network, the bastion hosts will need to know how to deliver mail
to internal hosts. In order for this to work properly, the resolvers on
the bastion hosts will need to be configured to point to the internal
name servers for DNS resolution.</P
><P
>Queries for internal hostnames will be answered by the internal
servers, and queries for external hostnames will be forwarded back
out to the DNS servers on the bastion hosts.</P
><P
>In order for all this to work properly, internal clients will
need to be configured to query <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>only</I
></SPAN
> the internal
name servers for DNS queries. This could also be enforced via selective
filtering on the network.</P
><P
>If everything has been set properly, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Example, Inc.</I
