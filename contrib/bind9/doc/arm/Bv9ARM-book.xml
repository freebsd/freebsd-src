    <para>
      The Internet Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)
      consists of the syntax
      to specify the names of entities in the Internet in a hierarchical
      manner, the rules used for delegating authority over names, and the
      system implementation that actually maps names to Internet
      addresses.  <acronym>DNS</acronym> data is maintained in a
      group of distributed
      hierarchical databases.

      <title>Scope of Document</title>

      <para>
        The Berkeley Internet Name Domain
        (<acronym>BIND</acronym>) implements a
        domain name server for a number of operating systems. This
        document provides basic information about the installation and
        care of the Internet Systems Consortium (<acronym>ISC</acronym>)
        <acronym>BIND</acronym> version 9 software package for
        system administrators.
      </para>

      <para>
        This version of the manual corresponds to BIND version 9.6.

      <title>Organization of This Document</title>
      <para>
        In this document, <emphasis>Chapter 1</emphasis> introduces
        the basic <acronym>DNS</acronym> and <acronym>BIND</acronym> concepts. <emphasis>Chapter 2</emphasis>
        describes resource requirements for running <acronym>BIND</acronym> in various
        environments. Information in <emphasis>Chapter 3</emphasis> is
        <emphasis>task-oriented</emphasis> in its presentation and is
        organized functionally, to aid in the process of installing the
        <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 software. The task-oriented
        section is followed by
        <emphasis>Chapter 4</emphasis>, which contains more advanced
        concepts that the system administrator may need for implementing
        certain options. <emphasis>Chapter 5</emphasis>
        describes the <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 lightweight
        resolver.  The contents of <emphasis>Chapter 6</emphasis> are
        organized as in a reference manual to aid in the ongoing
        maintenance of the software. <emphasis>Chapter 7</emphasis> addresses
        security considerations, and
        <emphasis>Chapter 8</emphasis> contains troubleshooting help. The
        main body of the document is followed by several
        <emphasis>appendices</emphasis> which contain useful reference
        information, such as a <emphasis>bibliography</emphasis> and
        historic information related to <acronym>BIND</acronym>
        and the Domain Name
        System.

      <title>The Domain Name System (<acronym>DNS</acronym>)</title>
      <para>
        The purpose of this document is to explain the installation
        and upkeep of the <acronym>BIND</acronym> (Berkeley Internet
	Name Domain) software package, and we
        begin by reviewing the fundamentals of the Domain Name System
        (<acronym>DNS</acronym>) as they relate to <acronym>BIND</acronym>.
      </para>

      <sect2>
        <title>DNS Fundamentals</title>

        <para>
          The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed
          database.  It stores information for mapping Internet host names to
          IP
          addresses and vice versa, mail routing information, and other data
          used by Internet applications.
        </para>

        <para>
          Clients look up information in the DNS by calling a
          <emphasis>resolver</emphasis> library, which sends queries to one or
          more <emphasis>name servers</emphasis> and interprets the responses.
          The <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 software distribution
          contains a
          name server, <command>named</command>, and a resolver
          library, <command>liblwres</command>.  The older
          <command>libbind</command> resolver library is also available
          from ISC as a separate download.
        </para>

        </sect2><sect2>
        <title>Domains and Domain Names</title>

        <para>
          The data stored in the DNS is identified by <emphasis>domain names</emphasis> that are organized as a tree according to
          organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree,
          called a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, is given a label. The domain
          name of the
          node is the concatenation of all the labels on the path from the
          node to the <emphasis>root</emphasis> node.  This is represented
          in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and
          separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its parent
          domain.
        </para>

        <para>
          For example, a domain name for a host at the
          company <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> could be
          <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal>,
          where <literal>com</literal> is the
          top level domain to which
          <literal>ourhost.example.com</literal> belongs,
          <literal>example</literal> is
          a subdomain of <literal>com</literal>, and
          <literal>ourhost</literal> is the
          name of the host.
        </para>

        <para>
          For administrative purposes, the name space is partitioned into
          areas called <emphasis>zones</emphasis>, each starting at a node and
          extending down to the leaf nodes or to nodes where other zones
          start.
          The data for each zone is stored in a <emphasis>name server</emphasis>, which answers queries about the zone using the
          <emphasis>DNS protocol</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
          The data associated with each domain name is stored in the
          form of <emphasis>resource records</emphasis> (<acronym>RR</acronym>s).
          Some of the supported resource record types are described in
          <xref linkend="types_of_resource_records_and_when_to_use_them"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
          For more detailed information about the design of the DNS and
          the DNS protocol, please refer to the standards documents listed in
          <xref linkend="rfcs"/>.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Zones</title>
        <para>
          To properly operate a name server, it is important to understand
          the difference between a <emphasis>zone</emphasis>
          and a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
          As stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
          the <acronym>DNS</acronym> tree. A zone consists of
          those contiguous parts of the domain
          tree for which a name server has complete information and over which
          it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
          downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
          other zones. A delegation point is marked by one or more
          <emphasis>NS records</emphasis> in the
          parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
          the root of the delegated zone.
        </para>

        <para>
          For instance, consider the <literal>example.com</literal>
          domain which includes names
          such as <literal>host.aaa.example.com</literal> and
          <literal>host.bbb.example.com</literal> even though
          the <literal>example.com</literal> zone includes
          only delegations for the <literal>aaa.example.com</literal> and
          <literal>bbb.example.com</literal> zones.  A zone can
          map
          exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a
          domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
          name servers. Every name in the <acronym>DNS</acronym>
          tree is a
          <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, even if it is
          <emphasis>terminal</emphasis>, that is, has no
          <emphasis>subdomains</emphasis>.  Every subdomain is a domain and
          every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is
          not intuitive and we suggest that you read RFCs 1033, 1034 and 1035
          to
          gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle
          topic.
        </para>

        <para>
          Though <acronym>BIND</acronym> is called a "domain name
          server",
          it deals primarily in terms of zones. The master and slave
          declarations in the <filename>named.conf</filename> file
          specify
          zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing to
          be a slave server for your <emphasis>domain</emphasis>, you are
          actually asking for slave service for some collection of zones.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Authoritative Name Servers</title>

        <para>
          Each zone is served by at least
          one <emphasis>authoritative name server</emphasis>,
          which contains the complete data for the zone.
          To make the DNS tolerant of server and network failures,
          most zones have two or more authoritative servers, on
          different networks.
        </para>

        <para>
          Responses from authoritative servers have the "authoritative
          answer" (AA) bit set in the response packets.  This makes them
          easy to identify when debugging DNS configurations using tools like
          <command>dig</command> (<xref linkend="diagnostic_tools"/>).
        </para>

        <sect3>
          <title>The Primary Master</title>

          <para>
            The authoritative server where the master copy of the zone
            data is maintained is called the
	    <emphasis>primary master</emphasis> server, or simply the
            <emphasis>primary</emphasis>.  Typically it loads the zone
            contents from some local file edited by humans or perhaps
            generated mechanically from some other local file which is
            edited by humans.  This file is called the
	    <emphasis>zone file</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>master file</emphasis>.
          </para>

	  <para>
	    In some cases, however, the master file may not be edited
	    by humans at all, but may instead be the result of
	    <emphasis>dynamic update</emphasis> operations.
	  </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>Slave Servers</title>
          <para>
            The other authoritative servers, the <emphasis>slave</emphasis>
            servers (also known as <emphasis>secondary</emphasis> servers)
            load
            the zone contents from another server using a replication process
            known as a <emphasis>zone transfer</emphasis>.  Typically the data
            are
            transferred directly from the primary master, but it is also
            possible
            to transfer it from another slave.  In other words, a slave server
            may itself act as a master to a subordinate slave server.
          </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>
          <title>Stealth Servers</title>

          <para>
            Usually all of the zone's authoritative servers are listed in
            NS records in the parent zone.  These NS records constitute
            a <emphasis>delegation</emphasis> of the zone from the parent.
            The authoritative servers are also listed in the zone file itself,
            at the <emphasis>top level</emphasis> or <emphasis>apex</emphasis>
            of the zone.  You can list servers in the zone's top-level NS
            records that are not in the parent's NS delegation, but you cannot
            list servers in the parent's delegation that are not present at
            the zone's top level.
          </para>

          <para>
            A <emphasis>stealth server</emphasis> is a server that is
            authoritative for a zone but is not listed in that zone's NS
            records.  Stealth servers can be used for keeping a local copy of
            a
            zone to speed up access to the zone's records or to make sure that

            A configuration where the primary master server itself is a
            stealth server is often referred to as a "hidden primary"
            configuration.  One use for this configuration is when the primary
            master
            is behind a firewall and therefore unable to communicate directly
            with the outside world.

        <title>Caching Name Servers</title>

	<!--

	  - convert to using "recursive name server" everywhere
	  - with just a note about "caching" terminology.
	  -->

        <para>
          The resolver libraries provided by most operating systems are
          <emphasis>stub resolvers</emphasis>, meaning that they are not
          capable of
          performing the full DNS resolution process by themselves by talking
          directly to the authoritative servers.  Instead, they rely on a
          local
          name server to perform the resolution on their behalf.  Such a
          server
          is called a <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> name server; it performs
          <emphasis>recursive lookups</emphasis> for local clients.
        </para>

        <para>
          To improve performance, recursive servers cache the results of
          the lookups they perform.  Since the processes of recursion and
          caching are intimately connected, the terms
          <emphasis>recursive server</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>caching server</emphasis> are often used synonymously.
        </para>

        <para>
          The length of time for which a record may be retained in
          the cache of a caching name server is controlled by the
          Time To Live (TTL) field associated with each resource record.

        <sect3>
          <title>Forwarding</title>

          <para>
            Even a caching name server does not necessarily perform
            the complete recursive lookup itself.  Instead, it can
            <emphasis>forward</emphasis> some or all of the queries
            that it cannot satisfy from its cache to another caching name
            server,
            commonly referred to as a <emphasis>forwarder</emphasis>.
          </para>

          <para>
            There may be one or more forwarders,
            and they are queried in turn until the list is exhausted or an
            answer
            is found. Forwarders are typically used when you do not
            wish all the servers at a given site to interact directly with the
            rest of
            the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number
            of internal <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers and an
            Internet firewall. Servers unable
            to pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server
            that can do it, and that server would query the Internet <acronym>DNS</acronym> servers
            on the internal server's behalf.

        <title>Name Servers in Multiple Roles</title>

        <para>
          The <acronym>BIND</acronym> name server can
          simultaneously act as
          a master for some zones, a slave for other zones, and as a caching
          (recursive) server for a set of local clients.
        </para>

        <para>
          However, since the functions of authoritative name service
          and caching/recursive name service are logically separate, it is
          often advantageous to run them on separate server machines.

          A server that only provides authoritative name service
          (an <emphasis>authoritative-only</emphasis> server) can run with
          recursion disabled, improving reliability and security.

          A server that is not authoritative for any zones and only provides
          recursive service to local
          clients (a <emphasis>caching-only</emphasis> server)
          does not need to be reachable from the Internet at large and can
          be placed inside a firewall.

      <title>Memory Requirements</title>
      <para>
        The memory of the server has to be large enough to fit the
        cache and zones loaded off disk.  The <command>max-cache-size</command>
        option can be used to limit the amount of memory used by the cache,
        at the expense of reducing cache hit rates and causing more <acronym>DNS</acronym>
        traffic.
        Additionally, if additional section caching
        (<xref linkend="acache"/>) is enabled,
        the <command>max-acache-size</command> option can be used to
        limit the amount
        of memory used by the mechanism.
        It is still good practice to have enough memory to load
        all zone and cache data into memory &mdash; unfortunately, the best
        way
        to determine this for a given installation is to watch the name server
        in operation. After a few weeks the server process should reach
        a relatively stable size where entries are expiring from the cache as
        fast as they are being inserted.

      <title>Name Server Intensive Environment Issues</title>
      <para>
        For name server intensive environments, there are two alternative
        configurations that may be used. The first is where clients and
        any second-level internal name servers query a main name server, which
        has enough memory to build a large cache. This approach minimizes
        the bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative
        is to set up second-level internal name servers to make queries
        independently.
        In this configuration, none of the individual machines needs to
        have as much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but
        this has the disadvantage of making many more external queries,
        as none of the name servers share their cached data.

                <para>
                  A configuration file is required, since all
                  communication with the server is authenticated with
                  digital signatures that rely on a shared secret, and
                  there is no way to provide that secret other than with a
                  configuration file.  The default location for the
                  <command>rndc</command> configuration file is
                  <filename>/etc/rndc.conf</filename>, but an
                  alternate
                  location can be specified with the <option>-c</option>
                  option.  If the configuration file is not found,
                  <command>rndc</command> will also look in
                  <filename>/etc/rndc.key</filename> (or whatever
                  <varname>sysconfdir</varname> was defined when
                  the <acronym>BIND</acronym> build was
                  configured).
                  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file is
                  generated by
                  running <command>rndc-confgen -a</command> as
                  described in
                  <xref linkend="controls_statement_definition_and_usage"/>.
                </para>

                <para>
                  The format of the configuration file is similar to
                  that of <filename>named.conf</filename>, but
                  limited to
                  only four statements, the <command>options</command>,
                  <command>key</command>, <command>server</command> and
                  <command>include</command>
                  statements.  These statements are what associate the
                  secret keys to the servers with which they are meant to
                  be shared.  The order of statements is not
                  significant.
                </para>

                <para>
                  The <command>options</command> statement has
                  three clauses:
                  <command>default-server</command>, <command>default-key</command>,
                  and <command>default-port</command>.
                  <command>default-server</command> takes a
                  host name or address argument  and represents the server
                  that will
                  be contacted if no <option>-s</option>
                  option is provided on the command line.
                  <command>default-key</command> takes
                  the name of a key as its argument, as defined by a <command>key</command> statement.
                  <command>default-port</command> specifies the
                  port to which
                  <command>rndc</command> should connect if no
                  port is given on the command line or in a
                  <command>server</command> statement.
                </para>

                <para>
                  The <command>key</command> statement defines a
                  key to be used
                  by <command>rndc</command> when authenticating
                  with
                  <command>named</command>.  Its syntax is
                  identical to the
                  <command>key</command> statement in <filename>named.conf</filename>.
                  The keyword <userinput>key</userinput> is
                  followed by a key name, which must be a valid
                  domain name, though it need not actually be hierarchical;
                  thus,
                  a string like "<userinput>rndc_key</userinput>" is a valid
                  name.
                  The <command>key</command> statement has two
                  clauses:
                  <command>algorithm</command> and <command>secret</command>.
                  While the configuration parser will accept any string as the
                  argument
                  to algorithm, currently only the string "<userinput>hmac-md5</userinput>"
                  has any meaning.  The secret is a base-64 encoded string
		  as specified in RFC 3548.
                </para>

                <para>
                  The <command>server</command> statement
                  associates a key
                  defined using the <command>key</command>
                  statement with a server.
                  The keyword <userinput>server</userinput> is followed by a
                  host name or address.  The <command>server</command> statement
                  has two clauses: <command>key</command> and <command>port</command>.
                  The <command>key</command> clause specifies the
                  name of the key
                  to be used when communicating with this server, and the
                  <command>port</command> clause can be used to
                  specify the port <command>rndc</command> should
                  connect
                  to on the server.
                </para>

                <para>
                  A sample minimal configuration file is as follows:

      <para>
        <acronym>DNS</acronym> NOTIFY is a mechanism that allows master
        servers to notify their slave servers of changes to a zone's data. In
        response to a <command>NOTIFY</command> from a master server, the
        slave will check to see that its version of the zone is the
        current version and, if not, initiate a zone transfer.

      <title>Dynamic Update</title>

      <para>
        Dynamic Update is a method for adding, replacing or deleting
        records in a master server by sending it a special form of DNS
        messages.  The format and meaning of these messages is specified
        in RFC 2136.
      </para>

      <para>
	Dynamic update is enabled by including an
	<command>allow-update</command> or <command>update-policy</command>
	clause in the <command>zone</command> statement.  The
	<command>tkey-gssapi-credential</command> and
	<command>tkey-domain</command> clauses in the
	<command>options</command>        statement enable the
	server to negotiate keys that can be matched against those
	in <command>update-policy</command> or
	<command>allow-update</command>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Updating of secure zones (zones using DNSSEC) follows RFC
	3007: RRSIG, NSEC and NSEC3 records affected by updates are
	automatically regenerated by the server using an online
	zone key.  Update authorization is based on transaction
	signatures and an explicit server policy.
      </para>

      <sect2 id="journal">
        <title>The journal file</title>

        <para>
          All changes made to a zone using dynamic update are stored
          in the zone's journal file.  This file is automatically created
          by the server when the first dynamic update takes place.
          The name of the journal file is formed by appending the extension
          <filename>.jnl</filename> to the name of the
          corresponding zone
          file unless specifically overridden.  The journal file is in a
          binary format and should not be edited manually.
        </para>

        <para>
          The server will also occasionally write ("dump")
          the complete contents of the updated zone to its zone file.
          This is not done immediately after
          each dynamic update, because that would be too slow when a large
          zone is updated frequently.  Instead, the dump is delayed by
          up to 15 minutes, allowing additional updates to take place.
          During the dump process, transient files will be created
          with the extensions <filename>.jnw</filename> and
          <filename>.jbk</filename>; under ordinary circumstances, these
          will be removed when the dump is complete, and can be safely
          ignored.
        </para>

        <para>
          When a server is restarted after a shutdown or crash, it will replay
              the journal file to incorporate into the zone any updates that
          took
          place after the last zone dump.
        </para>

        <para>

        </para>

        <para>
          The zone files of dynamic zones cannot normally be edited by
          hand because they are not guaranteed to contain the most recent
          dynamic changes &mdash; those are only in the journal file.
          The only way to ensure that the zone file of a dynamic zone

          If you have to make changes to a dynamic zone

          This will also remove the zone's <filename>.jnl</filename> file

      <title>Split DNS</title>
      <para>
        Setting up different views, or visibility, of the DNS space to
        internal and external resolvers is usually referred to as a
	<emphasis>Split DNS</emphasis> setup. There are several
        reasons an organization would want to set up its DNS this way.
      </para>
      <para>
        One common reason for setting up a DNS system this way is
        to hide "internal" DNS information from "external" clients on the
        Internet. There is some debate as to whether or not this is actually
        useful.
        Internal DNS information leaks out in many ways (via email headers,
        for example) and most savvy "attackers" can find the information
        they need using other means.
	However, since listing addresses of internal servers that
        external clients cannot possibly reach can result in
        connection delays and other annoyances, an organization may
        choose to use a Split DNS to present a consistent view of itself
        to the outside world.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another common reason for setting up a Split DNS system is
        to allow internal networks that are behind filters or in RFC 1918
        space (reserved IP space, as documented in RFC 1918) to resolve DNS
        on the Internet. Split DNS can also be used to allow mail from outside
        back in to the internal network.
      </para>
     <sect2>
      <title>Example split DNS setup</title>
      <para>
        Let's say a company named <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>
        (<literal>example.com</literal>)
        has several corporate sites that have an internal network with
        reserved
        Internet Protocol (IP) space and an external demilitarized zone (DMZ),
        or "outside" section of a network, that is available to the public.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis> wants its internal clients
        to be able to resolve external hostnames and to exchange mail with
        people on the outside. The company also wants its internal resolvers
        to have access to certain internal-only zones that are not available
        at all outside of the internal network.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to accomplish this, the company will set up two sets
        of name servers. One set will be on the inside network (in the
        reserved
        IP space) and the other set will be on bastion hosts, which are
        "proxy"
        hosts that can talk to both sides of its network, in the DMZ.
      </para>
      <para>
        The internal servers will be configured to forward all queries,
        except queries for <filename>site1.internal</filename>, <filename>site2.internal</filename>, <filename>site1.example.com</filename>,
        and <filename>site2.example.com</filename>, to the servers
        in the
        DMZ. These internal servers will have complete sets of information
        for <filename>site1.example.com</filename>, <filename>site2.example.com</filename>,<emphasis/> <filename>site1.internal</filename>,
        and <filename>site2.internal</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
        To protect the <filename>site1.internal</filename> and <filename>site2.internal</filename> domains,
        the internal name servers must be configured to disallow all queries
        to these domains from any external hosts, including the bastion
        hosts.
      </para>
      <para>
        The external servers, which are on the bastion hosts, will
        be configured to serve the "public" version of the <filename>site1</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones.
        This could include things such as the host records for public servers
        (<filename>www.example.com</filename> and <filename>ftp.example.com</filename>),
        and mail exchange (MX)  records (<filename>a.mx.example.com</filename> and <filename>b.mx.example.com</filename>).
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, the public <filename>site1</filename> and <filename>site2.example.com</filename> zones
        should have special MX records that contain wildcard (`*') records
        pointing to the bastion hosts. This is needed because external mail
        servers do not have any other way of looking up how to deliver mail
        to those internal hosts. With the wildcard records, the mail will
        be delivered to the bastion host, which can then forward it on to
        internal hosts.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's an example of a wildcard MX record:
      </para>
      <programlisting>*   IN MX 10 external1.example.com.</programlisting>
      <para>
        Now that they accept mail on behalf of anything in the internal
        network, the bastion hosts will need to know how to deliver mail
        to internal hosts. In order for this to work properly, the resolvers
        on
        the bastion hosts will need to be configured to point to the internal
        name servers for DNS resolution.
      </para>
      <para>
        Queries for internal hostnames will be answered by the internal
        servers, and queries for external hostnames will be forwarded back
        out to the DNS servers on the bastion hosts.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order for all this to work properly, internal clients will
        need to be configured to query <emphasis>only</emphasis> the internal
        name servers for DNS queries. This could also be enforced via
        selective
        filtering on the network.
      </para>
      <para>
        If everything has been set properly, <emphasis>Example, Inc.</emphasis>'s
        internal clients will now be able to:

        <title>Errors</title>

        <para>
          The processing of TSIG signed messages can result in
          several errors. If a signed message is sent to a non-TSIG aware
          server, a FORMERR (format error) will be returned, since the server will not
          understand the record. This is a result of misconfiguration,
          since the server must be explicitly configured to send a TSIG
          signed message to a specific server.
        </para>

        <para>
          If a TSIG aware server receives a message signed by an
          unknown key, the response will be unsigned with the TSIG
          extended error code set to BADKEY. If a TSIG aware server
          receives a message with a signature that does not validate, the
          response will be unsigned with the TSIG extended error code set
          to BADSIG. If a TSIG aware server receives a message with a time
          outside of the allowed range, the response will be signed with
          the TSIG extended error code set to BADTIME, and the time values
          will be adjusted so that the response can be successfully
          verified. In any of these cases, the message's rcode (response code) is set to
          NOTAUTH (not authenticated).

      <title>TKEY</title>

      <para><command>TKEY</command>
        is a mechanism for automatically generating a shared secret
        between two hosts.  There are several "modes" of
        <command>TKEY</command> that specify how the key is generated
        or assigned.  <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 implements only one of
        these modes, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  Both hosts are
        required to have a Diffie-Hellman KEY record (although this
        record is not required to be present in a zone).  The
        <command>TKEY</command> process must use signed messages,
        signed either by TSIG or SIG(0).  The result of
        <command>TKEY</command> is a shared secret that can be used to
        sign messages with TSIG.  <command>TKEY</command> can also be
        used to delete shared secrets that it had previously
        generated.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <command>TKEY</command> process is initiated by a
        client
        or server by sending a signed <command>TKEY</command>
        query
        (including any appropriate KEYs) to a TKEY-aware server.  The
        server response, if it indicates success, will contain a
        <command>TKEY</command> record and any appropriate keys.
        After
        this exchange, both participants have enough information to
        determine the shared secret; the exact process depends on the
        <command>TKEY</command> mode.  When using the
        Diffie-Hellman
        <command>TKEY</command> mode, Diffie-Hellman keys are
        exchanged,
        and the shared secret is derived by both participants.

        <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 partially supports DNSSEC SIG(0)
            transaction signatures as specified in RFC 2535 and RFC 2931.
        SIG(0)
        uses public/private keys to authenticate messages.  Access control
        is performed in the same manner as TSIG keys; privileges can be
        granted or denied based on the key name.
      </para>

      <para>
        When a SIG(0) signed message is received, it will only be
        verified if the key is known and trusted by the server; the server
        will not attempt to locate and/or validate the key.

        SIG(0) signing of multiple-message TCP streams is not

          The <command>dnssec-keygen</command> program is used to
          generate keys.
        </para>

        <para>
          A secure zone must contain one or more zone keys.  The
          zone keys will sign all other records in the zone, as well as
          the zone keys of any secure delegated zones.  Zone keys must
          have the same name as the zone, a name type of
          <command>ZONE</command>, and must be usable for
          authentication.
          It is recommended that zone keys use a cryptographic algorithm
          designated as "mandatory to implement" by the IETF; currently
          the only one is RSASHA1.
        </para>

        <para>
          The following command will generate a 768-bit RSASHA1 key for

          (where
          12345 is an example of a key tag).  The key filenames contain

          algorithm (3
          is DSA, 1 is RSAMD5, 5 is RSASHA1, etc.), and the key tag (12345 in
          this case).
          The private key (in the <filename>.private</filename>
          file) is
          used to generate signatures, and the public key (in the

      <title>The Lightweight Resolver Library</title>
      <para>
        Traditionally applications have been linked with a stub resolver
        library that sends recursive DNS queries to a local caching name
        server.
      </para>
      <para>
        IPv6 once introduced new complexity into the resolution process,
        such as following A6 chains and DNAME records, and simultaneous
        lookup of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Though most of the complexity was
        then removed, these are hard or impossible
        to implement in a traditional stub resolver.
      </para>
      <para>
        <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 therefore can also provide resolution
        services to local clients
        using a combination of a lightweight resolver library and a resolver
        daemon process running on the local host.  These communicate using
        a simple UDP-based protocol, the "lightweight resolver protocol"
        that is distinct from and simpler than the full DNS protocol.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="lwresd">
      <title>Running a Resolver Daemon</title>

      <para>
        To use the lightweight resolver interface, the system must
        run the resolver daemon <command>lwresd</command> or a
        local
        name server configured with a <command>lwres</command>
        statement.
      </para>

      <para>
        By default, applications using the lightweight resolver library will
        make
        UDP requests to the IPv4 loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 921.
        The
        address can be overridden by <command>lwserver</command>
        lines in
        <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The daemon currently only looks in the DNS, but in the future
        it may use other sources such as <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>,
        NIS, etc.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <command>lwresd</command> daemon is essentially a
        caching-only name server that responds to requests using the
        lightweight
        resolver protocol rather than the DNS protocol.  Because it needs
        to run on each host, it is designed to require no or minimal
        configuration.
        Unless configured otherwise, it uses the name servers listed on
        <command>nameserver</command> lines in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>
        as forwarders, but is also capable of doing the resolution
        autonomously if
        none are specified.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>lwresd</command> daemon may also be
        configured with a
        <filename>named.conf</filename> style configuration file,
        in
        <filename>/etc/lwresd.conf</filename> by default.  A name
        server may also
        be configured to act as a lightweight resolver daemon using the
        <command>lwres</command> statement in <filename>named.conf</filename>.

          <title>Definition and Usage</title>
          <para>
            Address match lists are primarily used to determine access
            control for various server operations. They are also used in
            the <command>listen-on</command> and <command>sortlist</command>
            statements. The elements which constitute an address match
            list can be any of the following:
          </para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)</simpara>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>an IP prefix (in `/' notation)</simpara>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>
                a key ID, as defined by the <command>key</command>
                statement
              </simpara>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>the name of an address match list defined with
                the <command>acl</command> statement
              </simpara>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>a nested address match list enclosed in braces</simpara>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>
            Elements can be negated with a leading exclamation mark (`!'),
            and the match list names "any", "none", "localhost", and
            "localnets" are predefined. More information on those names
            can be found in the description of the acl statement.
          </para>

          <para>
            The addition of the key clause made the name of this syntactic
            element something of a misnomer, since security keys can be used
            to validate access without regard to a host or network address.
            Nonetheless, the term "address match list" is still used
            throughout the documentation.
          </para>

          <para>
            When a given IP address or prefix is compared to an address
            match list, the comparison takes place in approximately O(1)
            time.  However, key comparisons require that the list of keys
            be traversed until a matching key is found, and therefore may
            be somewhat slower.
          </para>

          <para>
            The interpretation of a match depends on whether the list is being
            used for access control, defining <command>listen-on</command> ports, or in a
            <command>sortlist</command>, and whether the element was negated.
          </para>

	  <para>
	    When used as an access control list, a non-negated match
	    allows access and a negated match denies access. If
	    there is no match, access is denied. The clauses
	    <command>allow-notify</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion</command>,
	    <command>allow-recursion-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache</command>,
	    <command>allow-query-cache-on</command>,
	    <command>allow-transfer</command>,
	    <command>allow-update</command>,
	    <command>allow-update-forwarding</command>, and
	    <command>blackhole</command> all use address match
	    lists.  Similarly, the <command>listen-on</command> option will cause the
	    server to refuse queries on any of the machine's
	    addresses which do not match the list.
	  </para>

          <para>
            Order of insertion is significant.  If more than one element
            in an ACL is found to match a given IP address or prefix,
            preference will be given to the one that came
            <emphasis>first</emphasis> in the ACL definition.
            Because of this first-match behavior, an element that
            defines a subset of another element in the list should
            come before the broader element, regardless of whether
            either is negated. For example, in
            <command>1.2.3/24; ! 1.2.3.13;</command>
            the 1.2.3.13 element is completely useless because the
            algorithm will match any lookup for 1.2.3.13 to the 1.2.3/24
            element.  Using <command>! 1.2.3.13; 1.2.3/24</command> fixes
            that problem by having 1.2.3.13 blocked by the negation, but
            all other 1.2.3.* hosts fall through.

        <para>
          The <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 comment syntax allows for
          comments to appear
          anywhere that whitespace may appear in a <acronym>BIND</acronym> configuration
          file. To appeal to programmers of all kinds, they can be written
          in the C, C++, or shell/perl style.

          </para>
          <para>
            C-style comments start with the two characters /* (slash,
            star) and end with */ (star, slash). Because they are completely
            delimited with these characters, they can be used to comment only
            a portion of a line or to span multiple lines.
          </para>
          <para>
            C-style comments cannot be nested. For example, the following
            is not valid because the entire comment ends with the first */:
          </para>
          <para>

<programlisting>/* This is the start of a comment.
   This is still part of the comment.
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */
   This is no longer in any comment. */
</programlisting>

          </para>

          <para>
            C++-style comments start with the two characters // (slash,
            slash) and continue to the end of the physical line. They cannot
            be continued across multiple physical lines; to have one logical
            comment span multiple lines, each line must use the // pair.
            For example:
          </para>
          <para>

<programlisting>// This is the start of a comment.  The next line
// is a new comment, even though it is logically
// part of the previous comment.
</programlisting>

          </para>
          <para>
            Shell-style (or perl-style, if you prefer) comments start
            with the character <literal>#</literal> (number sign)
            and continue to the end of the
            physical line, as in C++ comments.
            For example:
          </para>

          <para>

<programlisting># This is the start of a comment.  The next line
# is a new comment, even though it is logically
# part of the previous comment.
</programlisting>

            <para>
              You cannot use the semicolon (`;') character
              to start a comment such as you would in a zone file. The
              semicolon indicates the end of a configuration
              statement.

          The <command>controls</command> statement declares control
          channels to be used by system administrators to control the
          operation of the name server. These control channels are
          used by the <command>rndc</command> utility to send
          commands to and retrieve non-DNS results from a name server.
        </para>

        <para>
          An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections will be
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
          use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
          If you will only use <command>rndc</command> on the local host,
          using the loopback address (<literal>127.0.0.1</literal>
          or <literal>::1</literal>) is recommended for maximum security.
        </para>

        <para>
          If no port is specified, port 953 is used. The asterisk
	  "<literal>*</literal>" cannot be used for <command>ip_port</command>.

        <para>
          The ability to issue commands over the control channel is
          restricted by the <command>allow</command> and
          <command>keys</command> clauses.
	  Connections to the control channel are permitted based on the
          <command>address_match_list</command>.  This is for simple
          IP address based filtering only; any <command>key_id</command>

          If no <command>controls</command> statement is present,

          and its IPv6 counterpart ::1.
          In this case, and also when the <command>controls</command> statement
          is present but does not have a <command>keys</command> clause,
          <command>named</command> will attempt to load the command channel key
          from the file <filename>rndc.key</filename> in
          <filename>/etc</filename> (or whatever <varname>sysconfdir</varname>
          was specified as when <acronym>BIND</acronym> was built).
          To create a <filename>rndc.key</filename> file, run
          <userinput>rndc-confgen -a</userinput>.
        </para>

        <para>
          The <filename>rndc.key</filename> feature was created to
          ease the transition of systems from <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8,
          which did not have digital signatures on its command channel
          messages and thus did not have a <command>keys</command> clause.

          It makes it possible to use an existing <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8
          configuration file in <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 unchanged,
          and still have <command>rndc</command> work the same way
          <command>ndc</command> worked in BIND 8, simply by executing the
          command <userinput>rndc-confgen -a</userinput> after BIND 9 is
          installed.
        </para>

        <para>
          Since the <filename>rndc.key</filename> feature
          is only intended to allow the backward-compatible usage of
          <acronym>BIND</acronym> 8 configuration files, this
          feature does not
          have a high degree of configurability.  You cannot easily change
          the key name or the size of the secret, so you should make a
          <filename>rndc.conf</filename> with your own key if you
          wish to change
          those things.  The <filename>rndc.key</filename> file
          also has its
          permissions set such that only the owner of the file (the user that
          <command>named</command> is running as) can access it.
          If you
          desire greater flexibility in allowing other users to access
          <command>rndc</command> commands, then you need to create
          a
          <filename>rndc.conf</filename> file and make it group
          readable by a group
          that contains the users who should have access.
        </para>

          The <command>logging</command> statement configures a
          wide
          variety of logging options for the name server. Its <command>channel</command> phrase
          associates output methods, format options and severity levels with
          a name that can then be used with the <command>category</command> phrase
          to select how various classes of messages are logged.
        </para>
        <para>
          Only one <command>logging</command> statement is used to
          define
          as many channels and categories as are wanted. If there is no <command>logging</command> statement,
          the logging configuration will be:

        <para>
          In <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9, the logging configuration
          is only established when

          established as soon as the <command>logging</command>
          statement
          was parsed. When the server is starting up, all logging messages
          regarding syntax errors in the configuration file go to the default
          channels, or to standard error if the "<option>-g</option>" option
          was specified.

          </para>

          <para>
            Every channel definition must include a destination clause that
            says whether messages selected for the channel go to a file, to a
            particular syslog facility, to the standard error stream, or are
            discarded. It can optionally also limit the message severity level
            that will be accepted by the channel (the default is
            <command>info</command>), and whether to include a
            <command>named</command>-generated time stamp, the
            category name
            and/or severity level (the default is not to include any).
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>null</command> destination clause
            causes all messages sent to the channel to be discarded;
            in that case, other options for the channel are meaningless.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>file</command> destination clause directs
            the channel
            to a disk file.  It can include limitations
            both on how large the file is allowed to become, and how many
            versions
            of the file will be saved each time the file is opened.
          </para>

          <para>
            If you use the <command>versions</command> log file
            option, then
            <command>named</command> will retain that many backup
            versions of the file by
            renaming them when opening.  For example, if you choose to keep
            three old versions
            of the file <filename>lamers.log</filename>, then just
            before it is opened
            <filename>lamers.log.1</filename> is renamed to
            <filename>lamers.log.2</filename>, <filename>lamers.log.0</filename> is renamed
            to <filename>lamers.log.1</filename>, and <filename>lamers.log</filename> is
            renamed to <filename>lamers.log.0</filename>.
            You can say <command>versions unlimited</command> to
            not limit
            the number of versions.
            If a <command>size</command> option is associated with
            the log file,
            then renaming is only done when the file being opened exceeds the
            indicated size.  No backup versions are kept by default; any
            existing
            log file is simply appended.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>size</command> option for files is used
            to limit log
            growth. If the file ever exceeds the size, then <command>named</command> will
            stop writing to the file unless it has a <command>versions</command> option
            associated with it.  If backup versions are kept, the files are
            rolled as
            described above and a new one begun.  If there is no
            <command>versions</command> option, no more data will
            be written to the log
            until some out-of-band mechanism removes or truncates the log to
            less than the
            maximum size.  The default behavior is not to limit the size of
            the
            file.

          <para>
            The <command>syslog</command> destination clause
            directs the
            channel to the system log.  Its argument is a
            syslog facility as described in the <command>syslog</command> man
            page. Known facilities are <command>kern</command>, <command>user</command>,
            <command>mail</command>, <command>daemon</command>, <command>auth</command>,
            <command>syslog</command>, <command>lpr</command>, <command>news</command>,
            <command>uucp</command>, <command>cron</command>, <command>authpriv</command>,
            <command>ftp</command>, <command>local0</command>, <command>local1</command>,
            <command>local2</command>, <command>local3</command>, <command>local4</command>,
            <command>local5</command>, <command>local6</command> and
            <command>local7</command>, however not all facilities
            are supported on
            all operating systems.
            How <command>syslog</command> will handle messages
            sent to
            this facility is described in the <command>syslog.conf</command> man
            page. If you have a system which uses a very old version of <command>syslog</command> that
            only uses two arguments to the <command>openlog()</command> function,
            then this clause is silently ignored.
          </para>
          <para>
            The <command>severity</command> clause works like <command>syslog</command>'s
            "priorities", except that they can also be used if you are writing
            straight to a file rather than using <command>syslog</command>.
            Messages which are not at least of the severity level given will
            not be selected for the channel; messages of higher severity
            levels
            will be accepted.
          </para>
          <para>
            If you are using <command>syslog</command>, then the <command>syslog.conf</command> priorities
            will also determine what eventually passes through. For example,
            defining a channel facility and severity as <command>daemon</command> and <command>debug</command> but
            only logging <command>daemon.warning</command> via <command>syslog.conf</command> will
            cause messages of severity <command>info</command> and
            <command>notice</command> to
            be dropped. If the situation were reversed, with <command>named</command> writing
            messages of only <command>warning</command> or higher,
            then <command>syslogd</command> would
            print all messages it received from the channel.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>stderr</command> destination clause
            directs the
            channel to the server's standard error stream.  This is intended
            for
            use when the server is running as a foreground process, for
            example
            when debugging a configuration.
          </para>

          <para>
            The server can supply extensive debugging information when
            it is in debugging mode. If the server's global debug level is
            greater
            than zero, then debugging mode will be active. The global debug
            level is set either by starting the <command>named</command> server
            with the <option>-d</option> flag followed by a positive integer,
            or by running <command>rndc trace</command>.
            The global debug level
            can be set to zero, and debugging mode turned off, by running <command>rndc
notrace</command>. All debugging messages in the server have a debug
            level, and higher debug levels give more detailed output. Channels
            that specify a specific debug severity, for example:
          </para>

<programlisting>channel specific_debug_level {
    file "foo";
    severity debug 3;
};
</programlisting>

          <para>
            will get debugging output of level 3 or less any time the
            server is in debugging mode, regardless of the global debugging
            level. Channels with <command>dynamic</command>
            severity use the
            server's global debug level to determine what messages to print.
          </para>
          <para>
            If <command>print-time</command> has been turned on,
            then
            the date and time will be logged. <command>print-time</command> may
            be specified for a <command>syslog</command> channel,
            but is usually
            pointless since <command>syslog</command> also logs
            the date and
            time. If <command>print-category</command> is
            requested, then the
            category of the message will be logged as well. Finally, if <command>print-severity</command> is
            on, then the severity level of the message will be logged. The <command>print-</command> options may
            be used in any combination, and will always be printed in the
            following
            order: time, category, severity. Here is an example where all
            three <command>print-</command> options
            are on:
          </para>

          </para>

          <para>
            There are four predefined channels that are used for
            <command>named</command>'s default logging as follows.
            How they are
            used is described in <xref linkend="the_category_phrase"/>.
          </para>

<programlisting>channel default_syslog {
    syslog daemon;                      // send to syslog's daemon
                                        // facility
    severity info;                      // only send priority info
                                        // and higher
};

channel default_debug {
    file "named.run";                   // write to named.run in
                                        // the working directory
                                        // Note: stderr is used instead
                                        // of "named.run"
                                        // if the server is started
                                        // with the '-f' option.
    severity dynamic;                   // log at the server's
                                        // current debug level
};

channel default_stderr {
    stderr;                             // writes to stderr
    severity info;                      // only send priority info
                                        // and higher
};

channel null {
   null;                                // toss anything sent to
                                        // this channel
};
</programlisting>

          <para>
            The <command>default_debug</command> channel has the
            special
            property that it only produces output when the server's debug
            level is
            nonzero.  It normally writes to a file called <filename>named.run</filename>
            in the server's working directory.
          </para>

          <para>
            For security reasons, when the "<option>-u</option>"
            command line option is used, the <filename>named.run</filename> file
            is created only after <command>named</command> has
            changed to the
            new UID, and any debug output generated while <command>named</command> is
            starting up and still running as root is discarded.  If you need
            to capture this output, you must run the server with the "<option>-g</option>"
            option and redirect standard error to a file.
          </para>

          <para>
            Once a channel is defined, it cannot be redefined. Thus you
            cannot alter the built-in channels directly, but you can modify
            the default logging by pointing categories at channels you have
            defined.
          </para>
        </sect3>

        <sect3 id="the_category_phrase">
          <title>The <command>category</command> Phrase</title>

          <para>
            There are many categories, so you can send the logs you want
            to see wherever you want, without seeing logs you don't want. If
            you don't specify a list of channels for a category, then log
            messages
            in that category will be sent to the <command>default</command> category
            instead. If you don't specify a default category, the following
            "default default" is used:
          </para>

<programlisting>category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
</programlisting>

          <para>
            As an example, let's say you want to log security events to
            a file, but you also want keep the default logging behavior. You'd
            specify the following:
          </para>

<programlisting>channel my_security_channel {
    file "my_security_file";
    severity info;
};
category security {
    my_security_channel;
    default_syslog;
    default_debug;
};</programlisting>

          <para>
            To discard all messages in a category, specify the <command>null</command> channel:
          </para>

<programlisting>category xfer-out { null; };
category notify { null; };
</programlisting>

          <para>
            Following are the available categories and brief descriptions
            of the types of log information they contain. More
            categories may be added in future <acronym>BIND</acronym> releases.

	  <title>The <command>query-errors</command> Category</title>
	  <para>
	    The <command>query-errors</command> category is
	    specifically intended for debugging purposes: To identify
	    why and how specific queries result in responses which
	    indicate an error.
	    Messages of this category are therefore only logged
	    with <command>debug</command> levels.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    At the debug levels of 1 or higher, each response with the
	    rcode of SERVFAIL is logged as follows:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>client 127.0.0.1#61502: query failed (SERVFAIL) for www.example.com/IN/AAAA at query.c:3880</computeroutput>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This means an error resulting in SERVFAIL was
	    detected at line 3880 of source file
	    <filename>query.c</filename>.
	    Log messages of this level will particularly
	    help identify the cause of SERVFAIL for an
	    authoritative server.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    At the debug levels of 2 or higher, detailed context
	    information of recursive resolutions that resulted in
	    SERVFAIL is logged.
	    The log message will look like as follows:
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <computeroutput>fetch completed at resolver.c:2970 for www.example.com/A in 30.000183: timed out/success [domain:example.com,referral:2,restart:7,qrysent:8,timeout:5,lame:0,neterr:0,badresp:1,adberr:0,findfail:0,valfail:0]</computeroutput>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The first part before the colon shows that a recursive
	    resolution for AAAA records of www.example.com completed
	    in 30.000183 seconds and the final result that led to the
	    SERVFAIL was determined at line 2970 of source file
	    <filename>resolver.c</filename>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The following part shows the detected final result and the
	    latest result of DNSSEC validation.
	    The latter is always success when no validation attempt
	    is made.
	    In this example, this query resulted in SERVFAIL probably
	    because all name servers are down or unreachable, leading
	    to a timeout in 30 seconds.
	    DNSSEC validation was probably not attempted.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The last part enclosed in square brackets shows statistics
	    information collected for this particular resolution
	    attempt.
	    The <varname>domain</varname> field shows the deepest zone
	    that the resolver reached;
	    it is the zone where the error was finally detected.
	    The meaning of the other fields is summarized in the
	    following table.

                The source of entropy to be used by the server.  Entropy is
                primarily needed

                update of signed

                to read
                entropy.  If this is a file, operations requiring entropy will
                fail when the

		DS queries are expected to be made to and be answered by

	      <para>
		If a delegation only zone server also serves a child
		zone it is not always possible to determine whether
		a answer comes from the delegation only zone or the
		child zone.  SOA NS and DNSKEY records are apex
		only records and a matching response that contains
		these records or DS is treated as coming from a
		child zone.  RRSIG records are also examined to see
		if they are signed by a child zone or not.  The
		authority section is also examined to see if there
		is evidence that the answer is from the child zone.
		Answers that are determined to be from a child zone
		are not converted to NXDOMAIN responses.  Despite
		all these checks there is still a possibility of
		false negatives when a child zone is being served.
	      </para>

		Similarly false positives can arise from empty nodes
		(no records at the name) in the delegation only zone

                  number check in the slave (providing it supports NOTIFY)
                  allowing the slave

                  These options control the behavior of an authoritative
                  server when
                  answering queries which have additional data, or when
                  following CNAME
                  and DNAME chains.
                </para>

                <para>
                  When both of these options are set to <userinput>yes</userinput>
                  (the default) and a
                  query is being answered from authoritative data (a zone
                  configured into the server), the additional data section of
                  the
                  reply will be filled in using data from other authoritative
                  zones
                  and from the cache.  In some situations this is undesirable,
                  such
                  as when there is concern over the correctness of the cache,
                  or
                  in servers where slave zones may be added and modified by
                  untrusted third parties.  Also, avoiding
                  the search for this additional data will speed up server
                  operations
                  at the possible expense of additional queries to resolve
                  what would
                  otherwise be provided in the additional section.
                </para>

                <para>
                  For example, if a query asks for an MX record for host <literal>foo.example.com</literal>,
                  and the record found is "<literal>MX 10 mail.example.net</literal>", normally the address
                  records (A and AAAA) for <literal>mail.example.net</literal> will be provided as well,
                  if known, even though they are not in the example.com zone.
                  Setting these options to <command>no</command>
                  disables this behavior and makes
                  the server only search for additional data in the zone it
                  answers from.

                  These options are intended for use in authoritative-only
                  servers, or in authoritative-only views.  Attempts to set
                  them to <command>no</command> without also
                  specifying
                  <command>recursion no</command> will cause the
                  server to
                  ignore the options and log a warning message.
                </para>

                <para>
                  Specifying <command>additional-from-cache no</command> actually
                  disables the use of the cache not only for additional data
                  lookups
                  but also when looking up the answer.  This is usually the
                  desired
                  behavior in an authoritative-only server where the
                  correctness of
                  the cached data is an issue.
                </para>

                <para>
                  When a name server is non-recursively queried for a name
                  that is not
                  below the apex of any served zone, it normally answers with
                  an
                  "upwards referral" to the root servers or the servers of
                  some other
                  known parent of the query name.  Since the data in an
                  upwards referral
                  comes from the cache, the server will not be able to provide
                  upwards
                  referrals when <command>additional-from-cache no</command>
                  has been specified.  Instead, it will respond to such
                  queries
                  with REFUSED.  This should not cause any problems since
                  upwards referrals are not required for the resolution
                  process.

                  This option was introduced to work around a kernel quirk

                  connections, such as zone transfers, to be accepted on an
                  IPv6 socket using mapped addresses.  This caused address
                  match lists designed for IPv4 to fail to match.  However,
                  <command>named</command> now solves this problem

                  When <userinput>yes</userinput> and the server loads a new version of a master
                  zone from its zone file or receives a new version of a slave
                  file by a non-incremental zone transfer, it will compare
                  the new version to the previous one and calculate a set
                  of differences.  The differences are then logged in the
                  zone's journal file such that the changes can be transmitted
                  to downstream slaves as an incremental zone transfer.
                </para>
                <para>
                  By allowing incremental zone transfers to be used for
                  non-dynamic zones, this option saves bandwidth at the
                  expense of increased CPU and memory consumption at the
                  master.
                  In particular, if the new version of a zone is completely
                  different from the previous one, the set of differences
                  will be of a size comparable to the combined size of the
                  old and new zone version, and the server will need to
                  temporarily allocate memory to hold this complete
                  difference set.

          <title>Forwarding</title>
          <para>
            The forwarding facility can be used to create a large site-wide
            cache on a few servers, reducing traffic over links to external
            name servers. It can also be used to allow queries by servers that
            do not have direct access to the Internet, but wish to look up
            exterior
            names anyway. Forwarding occurs only on those queries for which
            the server is not authoritative and does not have the answer in
            its cache.

	    <command>named</command> will check if the operating
	    system provides a programming interface to retrieve the
	    system's default range for ephemeral ports.
	    If such an interface is available,
	    <command>named</command> will use the corresponding system
	    default range; otherwise, it will use its own defaults:

	    Note: make sure the ranges be sufficiently large for
	    security.  A desirable size depends on various parameters,
	    but we generally recommend it contain at least 16384 ports
	    (14 bits of entropy).
	    Note also that the system's default range when used may be
	    too small for this purpose, and that the range may even be
	    changed while <command>named</command> is running; the new
	    range will automatically be applied when <command>named</command>
	    is reloaded.
	    It is encouraged to
	    configure <command>use-v4-udp-ports</command> and
            <command>use-v6-udp-ports</command> explicitly so that the
            ranges are sufficiently large and are reasonably
            independent from the ranges used by other applications.

	  <para>
	    Note: the operational configuration
	    where <command>named</command> runs may prohibit the use
	    of some ports.  For example, UNIX systems will not allow
	    <command>named</command> running without a root privilege
	    to use ports less than 1024.
	    If such ports are included in the specified (or detected)
	    set of query ports, the corresponding query attempts will
	    fail, resulting in resolution failures or delay.
	    It is therefore important to configure the set of ports
	    that can be safely used in the expected operational environment.

                  Slave servers will periodically query master servers
                  to find out if zone serial numbers have changed. Each such

                  limit the
                  amount of bandwidth used, BIND 9 limits the rate at which
                  queries are

                  second.

          <title>Operating System Resource Limits</title>

          <para>
            The server's usage of many system resources can be limited.
            Scaled values are allowed when specifying resource limits.  For
            example, <command>1G</command> can be used instead of
            <command>1073741824</command> to specify a limit of
            one
            gigabyte. <command>unlimited</command> requests
            unlimited use, or the
            maximum available amount. <command>default</command>
            uses the limit
            that was in force when the server was started. See the description
            of <command>size_spec</command> in <xref linkend="configuration_file_elements"/>.
          </para>

          <para>
            The following options set operating system resource limits for
            the name server process.  Some operating systems don't support
            some or
            any of the limits. On such systems, a warning will be issued if
            the
            unsupported limit is used.

                  The maximum amount of data memory the server

                  This is a hard limit on server memory usage.
                  If the server attempts to allocate memory in excess of this
                  limit, the allocation will fail, which may in turn leave
                  the server unable to perform DNS service.  Therefore,
                  this option is rarely useful as a way of limiting the
                  amount of memory used by the server, but it can be used
                  to raise an operating system data size limit that is
                  too small by default.  If you wish to limit the amount
                  of memory used by the server, use the
                  <command>max-cache-size</command> and

                  When the amount of data in the cache

                  prematurely based on an LRU based strategy so that
                  the limit is not exceeded.
                  A value of 0 is special, meaning that
                  records are purged from the cache only when their
                  TTLs expire.

            All other things being equal, when the server chooses a name
            server
            to query from a list of name servers, it prefers the one that is
            topologically closest to itself. The <command>topology</command> statement
            takes an <command>address_match_list</command> and
            interprets it
            in a special way. Each top-level list element is assigned a
            distance.
            Non-negated elements get a distance based on their position in the
            list, where the closer the match is to the start of the list, the
            shorter the distance is between it and the server. A negated match
            will be assigned the maximum distance from the server. If there
            is no match, the address will get a distance which is further than
            any non-negated list element, and closer than any negated element.

          <title>The <command>sortlist</command> Statement</title>

          <para>
            The response to a DNS query may consist of multiple resource
            records (RRs) forming a resource records set (RRset).
            The name server will normally return the
            RRs within the RRset in an indeterminate order
            (but see the <command>rrset-order</command>
            statement in <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>).
            The client resolver code should rearrange the RRs as appropriate,
            that is, using any addresses on the local net in preference to
            other addresses.
            However, not all resolvers can do this or are correctly
            configured.
            When a client is using a local server, the sorting can be performed
            in the server, based on the client's address. This only requires
            configuring the name servers, not all the clients.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>sortlist</command> statement (see below)
            takes
            an <command>address_match_list</command> and
            interprets it even
            more specifically than the <command>topology</command>
            statement
            does (<xref linkend="topology"/>).
            Each top level statement in the <command>sortlist</command> must
            itself be an explicit <command>address_match_list</command> with
            one or two elements. The first element (which may be an IP
            address,
            an IP prefix, an ACL name or a nested <command>address_match_list</command>)
            of each top level list is checked against the source address of
            the query until a match is found.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once the source address of the query has been matched, if
            the top level statement contains only one element, the actual
            primitive
            element that matched the source address is used to select the
            address
            in the response to move to the beginning of the response. If the
            statement is a list of two elements, then the second element is
            treated the same as the <command>address_match_list</command> in
            a <command>topology</command> statement. Each top
            level element
            is assigned a distance and the address in the response with the
            minimum
            distance is moved to the beginning of the response.
          </para>
          <para>
            In the following example, any queries received from any of
            the addresses of the host itself will get responses preferring
            addresses
            on any of the locally connected networks. Next most preferred are
            addresses
            on the 192.168.1/24 network, and after that either the
            192.168.2/24
            or
            192.168.3/24 network with no preference shown between these two
            networks. Queries received from a host on the 192.168.1/24 network
            will prefer other addresses on that network to the 192.168.2/24
            and
            192.168.3/24 networks. Queries received from a host on the
            192.168.4/24
            or the 192.168.5/24 network will only prefer other addresses on
            their directly connected networks.

            The following example will give reasonable behavior for the
            local host and hosts on directly connected networks. It is similar
            to the behavior of the address sort in <acronym>BIND</acronym> 4.9.x. Responses sent
            to queries from the local host will favor any of the directly
            connected
            networks. Responses sent to queries from any other hosts on a
            directly
            connected network will prefer addresses on that same network.
            Responses
            to other queries will not be sorted.

                  values
                  are set by the master, giving slave server administrators
                  little

                  globally.
                  These options are valid for slave and stub zones,
                  and clamp the SOA refresh and retry times to the specified

          <title>Additional Section Caching</title>

          <para>
            The additional section cache, also called <command>acache</command>,
            is an internal cache to improve the response performance of BIND 9.
            When additional section caching is enabled, BIND 9 will
            cache an internal short-cut to the additional section content for
            each answer RR.
            Note that <command>acache</command> is an internal caching
            mechanism of BIND 9, and is not related to the DNS caching
            server function.
          </para>

          <para>
            Additional section caching does not change the
            response content (except the RRsets ordering of the additional
            section, see below), but can improve the response performance
            significantly.
            It is particularly effective when BIND 9 acts as an authoritative
            server for a zone that has many delegations with many glue RRs.
          </para>

          <para>
            In order to obtain the maximum performance improvement
            from additional section caching, setting
            <command>additional-from-cache</command>
            to <command>no</command> is recommended, since the current
            implementation of <command>acache</command>
            does not short-cut of additional section information from the
            DNS cache data.
          </para>

          <para>
            One obvious disadvantage of <command>acache</command> is
            that it requires much more
            memory for the internal cached data.
            Thus, if the response performance does not matter and memory
            consumption is much more critical, the
            <command>acache</command> mechanism can be
            disabled by setting <command>acache-enable</command> to
            <command>no</command>.
            It is also possible to specify the upper limit of memory
            consumption
            for acache by using <command>max-acache-size</command>.
          </para>

          <para>
            Additional section caching also has a minor effect on the
            RRset ordering in the additional section.
            Without <command>acache</command>,
            <command>cyclic</command> order is effective for the additional
            section as well as the answer and authority sections.
            However, additional section caching fixes the ordering when it
            first caches an RRset for the additional section, and the same
            ordering will be kept in succeeding responses, regardless of the
            setting of <command>rrset-order</command>.
            The effect of this should be minor, however, since an
            RRset in the additional section
            typically only contains a small number of RRs (and in many cases
            it only contains a single RR), in which case the
            ordering does not matter much.

          <para>
            The <command>server</command> statement defines
            characteristics
            to be associated with a remote name server.  If a prefix length is
            specified, then a range of servers is covered.  Only the most
            specific
            server clause applies regardless of the order in
            <filename>named.conf</filename>.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>server</command> statement can occur at
            the top level of the
            configuration file or inside a <command>view</command>
            statement.
            If a <command>view</command> statement contains
            one or more <command>server</command> statements, only
            those
            apply to the view and any top-level ones are ignored.
            If a view contains no <command>server</command>
            statements,
            any top-level <command>server</command> statements are
            used as
            defaults.
          </para>

          <para>
            If you discover that a remote server is giving out bad data,
            marking it as bogus will prevent further queries to it. The
            default
            value of <command>bogus</command> is <command>no</command>.
          </para>
          <para>
            The <command>provide-ixfr</command> clause determines
            whether
            the local server, acting as master, will respond with an
            incremental
            zone transfer when the given remote server, a slave, requests it.
            If set to <command>yes</command>, incremental transfer
            will be provided
            whenever possible. If set to <command>no</command>,
            all transfers
            to the remote server will be non-incremental. If not set, the
            value
            of the <command>provide-ixfr</command> option in the
            view or
            global options block is used as a default.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>request-ixfr</command> clause determines
            whether
            the local server, acting as a slave, will request incremental zone
            transfers from the given remote server, a master. If not set, the
            value of the <command>request-ixfr</command> option in
            the view or
            global options block is used as a default.
          </para>

          <para>
            IXFR requests to servers that do not support IXFR will
            automatically
            fall back to AXFR.  Therefore, there is no need to manually list
            which servers support IXFR and which ones do not; the global
            default
            of <command>yes</command> should always work.
            The purpose of the <command>provide-ixfr</command> and
            <command>request-ixfr</command> clauses is
            to make it possible to disable the use of IXFR even when both
            master
            and slave claim to support it, for example if one of the servers
            is buggy and crashes or corrupts data when IXFR is used.

          <para>
            The <command>edns</command> clause determines whether
            the local server will attempt to use EDNS when communicating
	    with the remote server.  The default is <command>yes</command>.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>edns-udp-size</command> option sets the EDNS UDP size
	    that is advertised by <command>named</command> when querying the remote server.
	    Valid values are 512 to 4096 bytes (values outside this range will be
	    silently adjusted).  This option is useful when you wish to
	    advertises a different value to this server than the value you
	    advertise globally, for example, when there is a firewall at the
	    remote site that is blocking large replies.
          </para>

          <para>
	    The <command>max-udp-size</command> option sets the
	    maximum EDNS UDP message size <command>named</command> will send.  Valid
	    values are 512 to 4096 bytes (values outside this range will
	    be silently adjusted).  This option is useful when you
	    know that there is a firewall that is blocking large
	    replies from <command>named</command>.
	  </para>

          <para>
            The server supports two zone transfer methods. The first, <command>one-answer</command>,
            uses one DNS message per resource record transferred. <command>many-answers</command> packs
            as many resource records as possible into a message. <command>many-answers</command> is
            more efficient, but is only known to be understood by <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9, <acronym>BIND</acronym>
            8.x, and patched versions of <acronym>BIND</acronym>
            4.9.5. You can specify which method
            to use for a server with the <command>transfer-format</command> option.
            If <command>transfer-format</command> is not
            specified, the <command>transfer-format</command>
            specified
            by the <command>options</command> statement will be
            used.
          </para>

          <para><command>transfers</command>
	    is used to limit the number of concurrent inbound zone
            transfers from the specified server. If no
            <command>transfers</command> clause is specified, the
            limit is set according to the
            <command>transfers-per-ns</command> option.
          </para>

          <para>
            The <command>keys</command> clause identifies a
            <command>key_id</command> defined by the <command>key</command> statement,
            to be used for transaction security (TSIG, <xref linkend="tsig"/>)
            when talking to the remote server.
            When a request is sent to the remote server, a request signature
            will be generated using the key specified here and appended to the

          The <command>statistics-channels</command> statement

	  the name server.
        </para>

        <para>
	  This statement intends to be flexible to support multiple
	  communication protocols in the future, but currently only
	  HTTP access is supported.
	  It requires that BIND 9 be compiled with libxml2;
	  the <command>statistics-channels</command> statement is
	  still accepted even if it is built without the library,
	  but any HTTP access will fail with an error.
        </para>

        <para>
          An <command>inet</command> control channel is a TCP socket
	  listening at the specified <command>ip_port</command> on the
	  specified <command>ip_addr</command>, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6
	  address.  An <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) is
	  interpreted as the IPv4 wildcard address; connections will be
	  accepted on any of the system's IPv4 addresses.
	  To listen on the IPv6 wildcard address,
          use an <command>ip_addr</command> of <literal>::</literal>.
        </para>

	  <para>
	    The <command>trusted-keys</command> statement defines

	    public key for a non-authoritative zone is known, but
	    cannot be securely obtained through DNS, either because
	    it is the DNS root zone or because its parent zone is
	    unsigned.  Once a key has been configured as a trusted
	    key, it is treated as if it had been validated and
	    proven secure. The resolver attempts DNSSEC validation
	    on all DNS data in subdomains of a security root.
	  </para>

          <para>
            The <command>view</command> statement is a powerful
            feature
            of <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 that lets a name server
            answer a DNS query differently
            depending on who is asking. It is particularly useful for
            implementing
            split DNS setups without having to run multiple servers.
          </para>

          <para>
            Each <command>view</command> statement defines a view
            of the
            DNS namespace that will be seen by a subset of clients.  A client
            matches
            a view if its source IP address matches the
            <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the view's
            <command>match-clients</command> clause and its
            destination IP address matches
            the <varname>address_match_list</varname> of the
            view's
            <command>match-destinations</command> clause.  If not
            specified, both
            <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
            default to matching all addresses.  In addition to checking IP
            addresses
            <command>match-clients</command> and <command>match-destinations</command>
            can also take <command>keys</command> which provide an
            mechanism for the
            client to select the view.  A view can also be specified
            as <command>match-recursive-only</command>, which
            means that only recursive
            requests from matching clients will match that view.
            The order of the <command>view</command> statements is
            significant &mdash;
            a client request will be resolved in the context of the first
            <command>view</command> that it matches.
          </para>

          <para>
            Zones defined within a <command>view</command>
            statement will
            only be accessible to clients that match the <command>view</command>.
            By defining a zone of the same name in multiple views, different
            zone data can be given to different clients, for example,
            "internal"
            and "external" clients in a split DNS setup.
          </para>

          <para>
            Many of the options given in the <command>options</command> statement
            can also be used within a <command>view</command>
            statement, and then
            apply only when resolving queries with that view.  When no
            view-specific
            value is given, the value in the <command>options</command> statement
            is used as a default.  Also, zone options can have default values
            specified
            in the <command>view</command> statement; these
            view-specific defaults
            take precedence over those in the <command>options</command> statement.
          </para>

          <para>
            Views are class specific.  If no class is given, class IN
            is assumed.  Note that all non-IN views must contain a hint zone,
            since only the IN class has compiled-in default hints.
          </para>

          <para>
            If there are no <command>view</command> statements in
            the config
            file, a default view that matches any client is automatically
            created
            in class IN. Any <command>zone</command> statements
            specified on
            the top level of the configuration file are considered to be part
            of
            this default view, and the <command>options</command>
            statement will

<programlisting>view "internal" {

      recursion yes;

      match-clients { any; };

      // Refuse recursive service to external clients.
      recursion no;

                      <para>
                        A slave zone is a replica of a master
                        zone. The <command>masters</command> list
                        specifies one or more IP addresses
                        of master servers that the slave contacts to update
                        its copy of the zone.
                        Masters list elements can also be names of other
                        masters lists.
                        By default, transfers are made from port 53 on the
                        servers; this can
                        be changed for all servers by specifying a port number
                        before the
                        list of IP addresses, or on a per-server basis after
                        the IP address.
                        Authentication to the master can also be done with
                        per-server TSIG keys.
                        If a file is specified, then the
                        replica will be written to this file whenever the zone
                        is changed,
                        and reloaded from this file on a server restart. Use
                        of a file is
                        recommended, since it often speeds server startup and
                        eliminates
                        a needless waste of bandwidth. Note that for large
                        numbers (in the
                        tens or hundreds of thousands) of zones per server, it
                        is best to
                        use a two-level naming scheme for zone filenames. For
                        example,
                        a slave server for the zone <literal>example.com</literal> might place
                        the zone contents into a file called
                        <filename>ex/example.com</filename> where <filename>ex/</filename> is
                        just the first two letters of the zone name. (Most
                        operating systems
                        behave very slowly if you put 100000 files into
                        a single directory.)

                        A stub zone is similar to a slave zone,
                        except that it replicates only the NS records of a
                        master zone instead
                        of the entire zone. Stub zones are not a standard part
                        of the DNS;
                        they are a feature specific to the <acronym>BIND</acronym> implementation.
                      </para>

                      <para>
                        Stub zones can be used to eliminate the need for glue
                        NS record
                        in a parent zone at the expense of maintaining a stub
                        zone entry and
                        a set of name server addresses in <filename>named.conf</filename>.
                        This usage is not recommended for new configurations,
                        and BIND 9
                        supports it only in a limited way.
                        In <acronym>BIND</acronym> 4/8, zone
                        transfers of a parent zone
                        included the NS records from stub children of that
                        zone. This meant
                        that, in some cases, users could get away with
                        configuring child stubs
                        only in the master server for the parent zone. <acronym>BIND</acronym>
                        9 never mixes together zone data from different zones
                        in this
                        way. Therefore, if a <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 master serving a parent
                        zone has child stub zones configured, all the slave
                        servers for the
                        parent zone also need to have the same child stub
                        zones
                        configured.
                      </para>

                      <para>
                        Stub zones can also be used as a way of forcing the
                        resolution

                        servers for that domain.

                        A "forward zone" is a way to configure
                        forwarding on a per-domain basis.  A <command>zone</command> statement
                        of type <command>forward</command> can
                        contain a <command>forward</command>
                        and/or <command>forwarders</command>
                        statement,
                        which will apply to queries within the domain given by
                        the zone
                        name. If no <command>forwarders</command>
                        statement is present or
                        an empty list for <command>forwarders</command> is given, then no
                        forwarding will be done for the domain, canceling the
                        effects of
                        any forwarders in the <command>options</command> statement. Thus
                        if you want to use this type of zone to change the
                        behavior of the
                        global <command>forward</command> option
                        (that is, "forward first"
                        to, then "forward only", or vice versa, but want to
                        use the same
                        servers as set globally) you need to re-specify the
                        global forwarders.

                        The initial set of root name servers is
                        specified using a "hint zone". When the server starts
                        up, it uses

                        most recent
                        list of root name servers. If no hint zone is
                        specified for class
                        IN, the server uses a compiled-in default set of root
                        servers hints.
                        Classes other than IN have no built-in defaults hints.

	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>allow-update</command> clause works the
	      same way as in previous versions of <acronym>BIND</acronym>.
	      It grants given clients the permission to update any
	      record of any name in the zone.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The <command>update-policy</command> clause is new
	      in <acronym>BIND</acronym> 9 and allows more fine-grained
	      control over what updates are allowed.  A set of rules
	      is specified, where each rule either grants or denies
	      permissions for one or more names to be updated by
	      one or more identities.  If the dynamic update request
	      message is signed (that is, it includes either a TSIG
	      or SIG(0) record), the identity of the signer can be
	      determined.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Rules are specified in the <command>update-policy</command>
	      zone option, and are only meaningful for master zones.
	      When the <command>update-policy</command> statement
	      is present, it is a configuration error for the
	      <command>allow-update</command> statement to be
	      present.  The <command>update-policy</command> statement
	      only examines the signer of a message; the source
	      address is not relevant.
	    </para>

	    <para>
              This is how a rule definition looks:
            </para>

<programlisting>
( <command>grant</command> | <command>deny</command> ) <replaceable>identity</replaceable> <replaceable>nametype</replaceable> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <optional> <replaceable>types</replaceable> </optional>
</programlisting>

            <para>
              Each rule grants or denies privileges.  Once a message has
              successfully matched a rule, the operation is immediately
              granted
              or denied and no further rules are examined.  A rule is matched
              when the signer matches the identity field, the name matches the
              name field in accordance with the nametype field, and the type
              matches
              the types specified in the type field.
            </para>
            <para>
	      No signer is required for <replaceable>tcp-self</replaceable>
	      or <replaceable>6to4-self</replaceable> however the standard
	      reverse mapping / prefix conversion must match the identity
	      field.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The identity field specifies a name or a wildcard
	      name.  Normally, this is the name of the TSIG or
	      SIG(0) key used to sign the update request.  When a
	      TKEY exchange has been used to create a shared secret,
	      the identity of the shared secret is the same as the
	      identity of the key used to authenticate the TKEY
	      exchange.  TKEY is also the negotiation method used
	      by GSS-TSIG, which establishes an identity that is
	      the Kerberos principal of the client, such as
	      <userinput>"user@host.domain"</userinput>.  When the
	      <replaceable>identity</replaceable> field specifies
	      a wildcard name, it is subject to DNS wildcard
	      expansion, so the rule will apply to multiple identities.
	      The <replaceable>identity</replaceable> field must
	      contain a fully-qualified domain name.
	    </para>

          <para>
            This section, largely borrowed from RFC 1034, describes the
            concept of a Resource Record (RR) and explains when each is used.
            Since the publication of RFC 1034, several new RRs have been
            identified
            and implemented in the DNS. These are also included.
          </para>

            <title>Resource Records</title>

            <para>
              A domain name identifies a node.  Each node has a set of
              resource information, which may be empty.  The set of resource
              information associated with a particular name is composed of
              separate RRs. The order of RRs in a set is not significant and
              need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other
              parts of the DNS. However, sorting of multiple RRs is
              permitted for optimization purposes, for example, to specify
              that a particular nearby server be tried first. See <xref linkend="the_sortlist_statement"/> and <xref linkend="rrset_ordering"/>.

            <para>
              The owner name is often implicit, rather than forming an
              integral
              part of the RR.  For example, many name servers internally form
              tree
              or hash structures for the name space, and chain RRs off nodes.
              The remaining RR parts are the fixed header (type, class, TTL)
              which is consistent for all RRs, and a variable part (RDATA)
              that
              fits the needs of the resource being described.
            </para>
            <para>
              The meaning of the TTL field is a time limit on how long an
              RR can be kept in a cache.  This limit does not apply to
              authoritative
              data in zones; it is also timed out, but by the refreshing
              policies
              for the zone.  The TTL is assigned by the administrator for the
              zone where the data originates.  While short TTLs can be used to
              minimize caching, and a zero TTL prohibits caching, the
              realities
              of Internet performance suggest that these times should be on
              the
              order of days for the typical host.  If a change can be
              anticipated,
              the TTL can be reduced prior to the change to minimize
              inconsistency
              during the change, and then increased back to its former value
              following
              the change.
            </para>
            <para>
              The data in the RDATA section of RRs is carried as a combination
              of binary strings and domain names.  The domain names are
              frequently
              used as "pointers" to other data in the DNS.
            </para>

          <sect3>
            <title>Textual expression of RRs</title>
            <para>
              RRs are represented in binary form in the packets of the DNS
              protocol, and are usually represented in highly encoded form
              when
              stored in a name server or resolver.  In the examples provided
              in
              RFC 1034, a style similar to that used in master files was
              employed
              in order to show the contents of RRs.  In this format, most RRs
              are shown on a single line, although continuation lines are
              possible
              using parentheses.
            </para>
            <para>
              The start of the line gives the owner of the RR.  If a line
              begins with a blank, then the owner is assumed to be the same as
              that of the previous RR.  Blank lines are often included for
              readability.
            </para>
            <para>
              Following the owner, we list the TTL, type, and class of the
              RR.  Class and type use the mnemonics defined above, and TTL is
              an integer before the type field.  In order to avoid ambiguity
              in
              parsing, type and class mnemonics are disjoint, TTLs are
              integers,
              and the type mnemonic is always last. The IN class and TTL
              values
              are often omitted from examples in the interests of clarity.
            </para>
            <para>
              The resource data or RDATA section of the RR are given using
              knowledge of the typical representation for the data.
            </para>
            <para>
              For example, we might show the RRs carried in a message as:

              The MX RRs have an RDATA section which consists of a 16-bit
              number followed by a domain name.  The address RRs use a
              standard
              IP address format to contain a 32-bit internet address.

          <title>Discussion of MX Records</title>

          <para>
            As described above, domain servers store information as a
            series of resource records, each of which contains a particular
            piece of information about a given domain name (which is usually,
            but not always, a host). The simplest way to think of a RR is as
            a typed pair of data, a domain name matched with a relevant datum,
            and stored with some additional type information to help systems
            determine when the RR is relevant.
          </para>

          <para>
            MX records are used to control delivery of email. The data
            specified in the record is a priority and a domain name. The
            priority
            controls the order in which email delivery is attempted, with the
            lowest number first. If two priorities are the same, a server is
            chosen randomly. If no servers at a given priority are responding,
            the mail transport agent will fall back to the next largest
            priority.
            Priority numbers do not have any absolute meaning &mdash; they are
            relevant
            only respective to other MX records for that domain name. The
            domain
            name given is the machine to which the mail will be delivered.
	    It <emphasis>must</emphasis> have an associated address record
	    (A or AAAA) &mdash; CNAME is not sufficient.
          </para>
          <para>
            For a given domain, if there is both a CNAME record and an
            MX record, the MX record is in error, and will be ignored.
            Instead,
            the mail will be delivered to the server specified in the MX
            record
            pointed to by the CNAME.

          <para>
            The time-to-live of the RR field is a 32-bit integer represented
            in units of seconds, and is primarily used by resolvers when they
            cache RRs. The TTL describes how long a RR can be cached before it
            should be discarded. The following three types of TTL are
            currently
            used in a zone file.

          <title>Inverse Mapping in IPv4</title>
          <para>
            Reverse name resolution (that is, translation from IP address
            to name) is achieved by means of the <emphasis>in-addr.arpa</emphasis> domain
            and PTR records. Entries in the in-addr.arpa domain are made in
            least-to-most significant order, read left to right. This is the
            opposite order to the way IP addresses are usually written. Thus,
            a machine with an IP address of 10.1.2.3 would have a
            corresponding
            in-addr.arpa name of
            3.2.1.10.in-addr.arpa. This name should have a PTR resource record
            whose data field is the name of the machine or, optionally,
            multiple
            PTR records if the machine has more than one name. For example,
            in the <optional>example.com</optional> domain:

                      symbols within the <command>lhs</command> string
                      are replaced by the iterator value.

                      To get a $ in the output, you need to escape the

                      by modifiers which change the offset from the
                      iterator, field width and base.

                      Modifiers are introduced by a
                      <command>{</command> (left brace) immediately following the

                      subtracts 20 from the current value, prints the
                      result as a decimal in a zero-padded field of
                      width 3.

                      for uppercase).  The default modifier is
                      <command>${0,0,d}</command>.  If the

	  <title>Additional File Formats</title>
	  <para>
	    In addition to the standard textual format, BIND 9
	    supports the ability to read or dump to zone files in
	    other formats.  The <constant>raw</constant> format is
	    currently available as an additional format.  It is a
	    binary format representing BIND 9's internal data
	    structure directly, thereby remarkably improving the
	    loading time.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For a primary server, a zone file in the
	    <constant>raw</constant> format is expected to be
	    generated from a textual zone file by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command.  For a
	    secondary server or for a dynamic zone, it is automatically
	    generated (if this format is specified by the
	    <command>masterfile-format</command> option) when
	    <command>named</command> dumps the zone contents after
	    zone transfer or when applying prior updates.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If a zone file in a binary format needs manual modification,
	    it first must be converted to a textual form by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command.  All
	    necessary modification should go to the text file, which
	    should then be converted to the binary form by the
	    <command>named-compilezone</command> command again.
	  </para>
    	  <para>
	     Although the <constant>raw</constant> format uses the
	     network byte order and avoids architecture-dependent
	     data alignment so that it is as much portable as
	     possible, it is primarily expected to be used inside
	     the same single system.  In order to export a zone
	     file in the <constant>raw</constant> format or make a
	     portable backup of the file, it is recommended to
	     convert the file to the standard textual representation.

      <sect1 id="Access_Control_Lists">
        <title>Access Control Lists</title>
        <para>
          Access Control Lists (ACLs) are address match lists that
          you can set up and nickname for future use in <command>allow-notify</command>,
          <command>allow-query</command>, <command>allow-query-on</command>,
	  <command>allow-recursion</command>, <command>allow-recursion-on</command>,
          <command>blackhole</command>, <command>allow-transfer</command>,
          etc.
        </para>
        <para>
          Using ACLs allows you to have finer control over who can access
          your name server, without cluttering up your config files with huge
          lists of IP addresses.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is a <emphasis>good idea</emphasis> to use ACLs, and to
          control access to your server. Limiting access to your server by
          outside parties can help prevent spoofing and denial of service (DoS) attacks against
          your server.
        </para>
        <para>
          Here is an example of how to properly apply ACLs:
        </para>

<programlisting>
// Set up an ACL named "bogusnets" that will block RFC1918 space
// and some reserved space, which is commonly used in spoofing attacks.
acl bogusnets {
	0.0.0.0/8; 1.0.0.0/8; 2.0.0.0/8; 192.0.2.0/24; 224.0.0.0/3;
	10.0.0.0/8; 172.16.0.0/12; 192.168.0.0/16;
};

// Set up an ACL called our-nets. Replace this with the real IP numbers.
acl our-nets { x.x.x.x/24; x.x.x.x/21; };
options {
  ...
  ...
  allow-query { our-nets; };
  allow-recursion { our-nets; };
  ...
  blackhole { bogusnets; };
  ...
};

zone "example.com" {
  type master;
  file "m/example.com";
  allow-query { any; };
};
</programlisting>

        <para>
          This allows recursive queries of the server from the outside
          unless recursion has been previously disabled.
        </para>
        <para>

        <para>
	  On UNIX servers, it is possible to run <acronym>BIND</acronym>
	  in a <emphasis>chrooted</emphasis> environment (using
	  the <command>chroot()</command> function) by specifying
	  the "<option>-t</option>" option for <command>named</command>.
	  This can help improve system security by placing
	  <acronym>BIND</acronym> in a "sandbox", which will limit
	  the damage done if a server is compromised.
        </para>
        <para>
          Another useful feature in the UNIX version of <acronym>BIND</acronym> is the
          ability to run the daemon as an unprivileged user ( <option>-u</option> <replaceable>user</replaceable> ).
          We suggest running as an unprivileged user when using the <command>chroot</command> feature.
        </para>
        <para>
          Here is an example command line to load <acronym>BIND</acronym> in a <command>chroot</command> sandbox,
          <command>/var/named</command>, and to run <command>named</command> <command>setuid</command> to
          user 202:

          <para>
            In order for a <command>chroot</command> environment
            to
            work properly in a particular directory
            (for example, <filename>/var/named</filename>),
            you will need to set up an environment that includes everything
            <acronym>BIND</acronym> needs to run.
            From <acronym>BIND</acronym>'s point of view, <filename>/var/named</filename> is
            the root of the filesystem.  You will need to adjust the values of
            options like
            like <command>directory</command> and <command>pid-file</command> to account
            for this.
          </para>
          <para>
            Unlike with earlier versions of BIND, you typically will
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to compile <command>named</command>
            statically nor install shared libraries under the new root.
            However, depending on your operating system, you may need
            to set up things like
            <filename>/dev/zero</filename>,
            <filename>/dev/random</filename>,
            <filename>/dev/log</filename>, and

            Prior to running the <command>named</command> daemon,
            use
            the <command>touch</command> utility (to change file

            to write.
          </para>
	  <note>
	    Note that if the <command>named</command> daemon is running as an

      <sect1 id="dynamic_update_security">
        <title>Dynamic Update Security</title>

        <para>
          Access to the dynamic
          update facility should be strictly limited.  In earlier versions of
          <acronym>BIND</acronym>, the only way to do this was
          based on the IP
          address of the host requesting the update, by listing an IP address
          or
          network prefix in the <command>allow-update</command>
          zone option.
          This method is insecure since the source address of the update UDP
          packet
          is easily forged.  Also note that if the IP addresses allowed by the
          <command>allow-update</command> option include the
          address of a slave
          server which performs forwarding of dynamic updates, the master can
          be
          trivially attacked by sending the update to the slave, which will
          forward it to the master with its own source IP address causing the
          master to approve it without question.
        </para>

        <para>
          For these reasons, we strongly recommend that updates be
          cryptographically authenticated by means of transaction signatures
          (TSIG).  That is, the <command>allow-update</command>
          option should
          list only TSIG key names, not IP addresses or network
          prefixes. Alternatively, the new <command>update-policy</command>
          option can be used.

          Some sites choose to keep all dynamically-updated DNS data
          in a subdomain and delegate that subdomain to a separate zone. This
          way, the top-level zone containing critical data such as the IP
          addresses
          of public web and mail servers need not allow dynamic update at
          all.

          <para>
            The best solution to solving installation and
            configuration issues is to take preventative measures by setting
            up logging files beforehand. The log files provide a
            source of hints and information that can be used to figure out
            what went wrong and how to fix the problem.

        <title>Incrementing and Changing the Serial Number</title>

	<para>
	  Zone serial numbers are just numbers &mdash; they aren't
	  date related.  A lot of people set them to a number that
	  represents a date, usually of the form YYYYMMDDRR.
	  Occasionally they will make a mistake and set them to a
	  "date in the future" then try to correct them by setting
	  them to the "current date".  This causes problems because
	  serial numbers are used to indicate that a zone has been
	  updated.  If the serial number on the slave server is
	  lower than the serial number on the master, the slave
	  server will attempt to update its copy of the zone.
	</para>

        <para>
          Setting the serial number to a lower number on the master
          server than the slave server means that the slave will not perform
          updates to its copy of the zone.
        </para>

        <para>
          The solution to this is to add 2147483647 (2^31-1) to the
          number, reload the zone and make sure all slaves have updated to
          the new zone serial number, then reset the number to what you want
          it to be, and reload the zone again.

            Although the "official" beginning of the Domain Name
            System occurred in 1984 with the publication of RFC 920, the
            core of the new system was described in 1983 in RFCs 882 and
            883. From 1984 to 1987, the ARPAnet (the precursor to today's
            Internet) became a testbed of experimentation for developing the
            new naming/addressing scheme in a rapidly expanding,
            operational network environment.  New RFCs were written and
            published in 1987 that modified the original documents to
            incorporate improvements based on the working model. RFC 1034,
            "Domain Names-Concepts and Facilities", and RFC 1035, "Domain
            Names-Implementation and Specification" were published and
            became the standards upon which all <acronym>DNS</acronym> implementations are
            built.
          </para>

          <para>
            The first working domain name server, called "Jeeves", was
            written in 1983-84 by Paul Mockapetris for operation on DEC
            Tops-20
            machines located at the University of Southern California's
            Information
            Sciences Institute (USC-ISI) and SRI International's Network
            Information
            Center (SRI-NIC). A <acronym>DNS</acronym> server for
            Unix machines, the Berkeley Internet
            Name Domain (<acronym>BIND</acronym>) package, was
            written soon after by a group of
            graduate students at the University of California at Berkeley
            under
            a grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects
            Administration
            (DARPA).

	    Versions of <acronym>BIND</acronym> through
            4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer
            Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley. Douglas Terry, Mark
            Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou made up the initial <acronym>BIND</acronym>
            project team. After that, additional work on the software package
            was done by Ralph Campbell. Kevin Dunlap, a Digital Equipment
            Corporation
            employee on loan to the CSRG, worked on <acronym>BIND</acronym> for 2 years, from 1985
            to 1987. Many other people also contributed to <acronym>BIND</acronym> development
            during that time: Doug Kingston, Craig Partridge, Smoot
            Carl-Mitchell,
            Mike Muuss, Jim Bloom and Mike Schwartz. <acronym>BIND</acronym> maintenance was subsequently

        <sect2 id="ipv6addresses">
          <title>IPv6 addresses (AAAA)</title>
          <para>
            IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and
            sets of interfaces which were introduced in the <acronym>DNS</acronym> to facilitate
            scalable Internet routing. There are three types of addresses: <emphasis>Unicast</emphasis>,
            an identifier for a single interface;
            <emphasis>Anycast</emphasis>,
            an identifier for a set of interfaces; and <emphasis>Multicast</emphasis>,
            an identifier for a set of interfaces. Here we describe the global
            Unicast address scheme. For more information, see RFC 3587,
	    "Global Unicast Address Format."
          </para>
          <para>
	    IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a
	    <emphasis>global routing prefix</emphasis>, a
	    <emphasis>subnet identifier</emphasis>, and an
	    <emphasis>interface identifier</emphasis>.
          </para>
          <para>
            The global routing prefix is provided by the
            upstream provider or ISP, and (roughly) corresponds to the
	    IPv4 <emphasis>network</emphasis> section
            of the address range.

	    The subnet identifier is for local subnetting, much the
            same as subnetting an
            IPv4 /16 network into /24 subnets.

	    The interface identifier is the address of an individual
            interface on a given network; in IPv6, addresses belong to
            interfaces rather than to machines.
          </para>
          <para>
            The subnetting capability of IPv6 is much more flexible than
            that of IPv4: subnetting can be carried out on bit boundaries,
            in much the same way as Classless InterDomain Routing
            (CIDR), and the DNS PTR representation ("nibble" format)
            makes setting up reverse zones easier.
          </para>
          <para>
            The Interface Identifier must be unique on the local link,
            and is usually generated automatically by the IPv6
            implementation, although it is usually possible to
            override the default setting if necessary.  A typical IPv6
            address might look like:
	    <command>2001:db8:201:9:a00:20ff:fe81:2b32</command>
	  </para>
          <para>
            IPv6 address specifications often contain long strings
            of zeros, so the architects have included a shorthand for
            specifying
            them. The double colon (`::') indicates the longest possible
            string
            of zeros that can fit, and can be used only once in an address.

            Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of
            the Internet Engineering Task Force. They are, in essence, RFCs
            in the preliminary stages of development. Implementors are
            cautioned not
            to regard IDs as archival, and they should not be quoted or cited
            in any formal documents unless accompanied by the disclaimer that
            they are "works in progress." IDs have a lifespan of six months
            after which they are deleted unless updated by their authors.
