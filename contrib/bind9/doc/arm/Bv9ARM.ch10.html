            Although the "official" beginning of the Domain Name
            System occurred in 1984 with the publication of RFC 920, the
            core of the new system was described in 1983 in RFCs 882 and
            883. From 1984 to 1987, the ARPAnet (the precursor to today's
            Internet) became a testbed of experimentation for developing the
            new naming/addressing scheme in a rapidly expanding,
            operational network environment.  New RFCs were written and
            published in 1987 that modified the original documents to
            incorporate improvements based on the working model. RFC 1034,
            "Domain Names-Concepts and Facilities", and RFC 1035, "Domain
            Names-Implementation and Specification" were published and
            became the standards upon which all <acronym class="acronym">DNS</acronym> implementations are
            built.
          </p>
<p>
            The first working domain name server, called "Jeeves", was
            written in 1983-84 by Paul Mockapetris for operation on DEC
            Tops-20
            machines located at the University of Southern California's
            Information
            Sciences Institute (USC-ISI) and SRI International's Network
            Information
            Center (SRI-NIC). A <acronym class="acronym">DNS</acronym> server for
            Unix machines, the Berkeley Internet
            Name Domain (<acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym>) package, was
            written soon after by a group of
            graduate students at the University of California at Berkeley
            under
            a grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects
            Administration
            (DARPA).
          </p>
<p>
            Versions of <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> through
            4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer
            Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley. Douglas Terry, Mark
            Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou made up the initial <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym>
            project team. After that, additional work on the software package
            was done by Ralph Campbell. Kevin Dunlap, a Digital Equipment
            Corporation
            employee on loan to the CSRG, worked on <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> for 2 years, from 1985
            to 1987. Many other people also contributed to <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> development
            during that time: Doug Kingston, Craig Partridge, Smoot
            Carl-Mitchell,
            Mike Muuss, Jim Bloom and Mike Schwartz. <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> maintenance was subsequently
            handled by Mike Karels and Øivind Kure.
          </p>
<p>
            <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> versions 4.9 and 4.9.1 were
            released by Digital Equipment
            Corporation (now Compaq Computer Corporation). Paul Vixie, then
            a DEC employee, became <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym>'s
            primary caretaker. He was assisted
            by Phil Almquist, Robert Elz, Alan Barrett, Paul Albitz, Bryan
            Beecher, Andrew
            Partan, Andy Cherenson, Tom Limoncelli, Berthold Paffrath, Fuat
            Baran, Anant Kumar, Art Harkin, Win Treese, Don Lewis, Christophe
            Wolfhugel, and others.
          </p>
<p>
            In 1994, <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> version 4.9.2 was sponsored by
            Vixie Enterprises. Paul
            Vixie became <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym>'s principal
            architect/programmer.
          </p>
<p>
            <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> versions from 4.9.3 onward
            have been developed and maintained
            by the Internet Systems Consortium and its predecessor,
            the Internet Software Consortium,  with support being provided
            by ISC's sponsors.
          </p>
<p>
            As co-architects/programmers, Bob Halley and
            Paul Vixie released the first production-ready version of
            <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> version 8 in May 1997.
          </p>
<p>
            BIND version 9 was released in September 2000 and is a
            major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the underlying
            BIND architecture.
          </p>
<p>
            BIND versions 4 and 8 are officially deprecated.
            No additional development is done
            on BIND version 4 or BIND version 8.
          </p>
<p>
            <acronym class="acronym">BIND</acronym> development work is made
            possible today by the sponsorship
            of several corporations, and by the tireless work efforts of
            numerous individuals.
