Internet-Draft      RFC 3597 Interoperability Report         August 2004


1. Introduction

    This memo documents the result from the RFC 3597 (Handling of Unknown
    DNS Resource Record Types) interoperability testing.  The test was
    performed during June and July 2004 by request of the IETF DNS
    Extensions Working Group.

2. Implementations

    The following is a list, in alphabetic order, of implementations for
    compliance of RFC 3597:

       DNSJava 1.6.4
       ISC BIND 8.4.5rc4
       ISC BIND 9.3.0rc2
       NSD 2.1.1
       Net::DNS 0.47 patchlevel 1
       Nominum ANS 2.2.1.0.d

    These implementations covers the following functions (number of
    implementations tested for each function in paranthesis):

       Authoritative Name Servers (4)
       Full Recursive Resolver (2)
       Stub Resolver (4)
       DNSSEC Zone Signers (2)

3. Tests

3.1 Authoritative Primary Name Server

    The test zone data (Appendix A) was loaded into the name server
    implementation and the server was queried for the loaded information.

3.2 Authoritative Secondary Name Server

    The test zone data (Appendix A) was transferred using AXFR from
    another name server implementation and the server was queried for the
    transferred information.

3.3 Full Recursive Resolver

    A recursive resolver was queried for resource records from a domain
    with the test zone data (Appendix A).

3.4 Stub Resolver

    A stub resolver was used to query resource records from a domain with

    the test zone data (Appendix A).

3.5 DNSSEC Signer

    A DNSSEC signer was used to sign a zone with test zone data (Appendix
    A).

4. Problems found

    Two implementations had problems with text presentation of zero
    length RDATA.

    One implementation had problems with text presentation of RR type
    code and classes >= 4096.

    Bug reports were filed for problems found.

5. Summary

    Unknown type codes works in the tested authoritative servers,
    recursive resolvers and stub clients.

    No changes are needed to advance RFC 3597 to draft standard.
