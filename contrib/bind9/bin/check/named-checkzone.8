.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as
\fBnamed\fR
does when loading a zone. This makes
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
useful for checking zone files before configuring them into a name server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Enable debugging.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quiet mode \- exit code only.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Print the version of the
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
program and exit.
.RE
.PP
\-j
.RS 4
When loading the zone file read the journal if it exists.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified "IN" is assumed.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fImode\fR
.RS 4
Perform
\fB"check\-names"\fR
checks with the specified failure mode. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-n \fImode\fR
.RS 4
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-o \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Write zone output to
\fIfilename\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Chroot to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that include directives in the configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.
.RE
.PP
\-w \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
chdir to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that relative filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
Dump zone file in canonical format.
.RE
.PP
zonename
.RS 4
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.RE
.PP
filename
.RS 4
The name of the zone file.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
