.SH NAME
named-checkzone \- zone file validity checking tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR [ \fB-d\fR ]  [ \fB-j\fR ]  [ \fB-q\fR ]  [ \fB-v\fR ]  [ \fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-k \fImode\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-n \fImode\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-o \fIfilename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-w \fIdirectory\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-D\fR ]  \fBzonename\fR \fBfilename\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR checks the syntax and integrity of
a zone file. It performs the same checks as \fBnamed\fR
does when loading a zone. This makes
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR useful for checking zone
files before configuring them into a name server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet mode - exit code only.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print the version of the \fBnamed-checkzone\fR
program and exit.
.TP
\fB-j\fR
When loading the zone file read the journal if it exists.
.TP
\fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified "IN" is assumed.
.TP
\fB-k \fImode\fB\fR
Perform \fB"check-name"\fR checks with the specified failure mode.
Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP
\fB-n \fImode\fB\fR
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they
are addresses. Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP
\fB-o \fIfilename\fB\fR
Write zone output to \fIdirectory\fR.
.TP
\fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR
chroot to \fIdirectory\fR so that include
directives in the configuration file are processed as if
run by a similarly chrooted named.
.TP
\fB-w \fIdirectory\fB\fR
chdir to \fIdirectory\fR so that relative
filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This
is similar to the directory clause in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Dump zone file in canonical format.
.TP
\fBzonename\fR
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.TP
\fBfilename\fR
The name of the zone file.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed-checkzone\fR returns an exit status of 1 if
errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
