.SH NAME
dnssec-makekeyset \- DNSSEC zone signing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR [ \fB-a\fR ]  [ \fB-s \fIstart-time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-e \fIend-time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-p\fR ]  [ \fB-r \fIrandomdev\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-t\fIttl\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-v \fIlevel\fB\fR ]  \fBkey\fR\fI...\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR generates a key set from one
or more keys created by \fBdnssec-keygen\fR. It creates
a file containing a KEY record for each key, and self-signs the key
set with each zone key. The output file is of the form
\fIkeyset-nnnn.\fR, where \fInnnn\fR
is the zone name.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Verify all generated signatures.
.TP
\fB-s \fIstart-time\fB\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records
become valid. This can be either an absolute or relative
time. An absolute start time is indicated by a number
in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation; 20000530144500 denotes
14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A relative start time is
indicated by +N, which is N seconds from the current time.
If no \fBstart-time\fR is specified, the current
time is used.
.TP
\fB-e \fIend-time\fB\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records
expire. As with \fBstart-time\fR, an absolute
time is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative
to the start time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from
the start time. A time relative to the current time is
indicated with now+N. If no \fBend-time\fR is
specified, 30 days from the start time is used as a default.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is faster,
but less secure, than using real random data. This option
may be useful when signing large zones or when the entropy
source is limited.
.TP
\fB-r \fIrandomdev\fB\fR
Specifies the source of randomness. If the operating
system does not provide a \fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness
is keyboard input. \fIrandomdev\fR specifies
the name of a character device or file containing random
data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR indicates that keyboard
input should be used.
.TP
\fB-t \fIttl\fB\fR
Specify the TTL (time to live) of the KEY and SIG records.
The default is 3600 seconds.
.TP
\fB-v \fIlevel\fB\fR
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fBkey\fR
The list of keys to be included in the keyset file. These keys
are expressed in the form \fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fR
as generated by \fBdnssec-keygen\fR.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
The following command generates a keyset containing the DSA key for
\fBexample.com\fR generated in the
\fBdnssec-keygen\fR man page.
.PP
\fBdnssec-makekeyset -t 86400 -s 20000701120000 -e +2592000 Kexample.com.+003+26160\fR
.PP
In this example, \fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR creates
the file \fIkeyset-example.com.\fR. This file
contains the specified key and a self-generated signature.
.PP
The DNS administrator for \fBexample.com\fR could
send \fIkeyset-example.com.\fR to the DNS
administrator for \fB.com\fR for signing, if the
\&.com zone is DNSSEC-aware and the administrators of the two zones
have some mechanism for authenticating each other and exchanging
the keys and signatures securely.
