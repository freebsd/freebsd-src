.SH "NAME"
dnssec\-dsfromkey \- DNSSEC DS RR generation tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 17
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR [\fB\-v\ \fR\fB\fIlevel\fR\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-2\fR] [\fB\-a\ \fR\fB\fIalg\fR\fR] {keyfile}

\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR {\-s} [\fB\-v\ \fR\fB\fIlevel\fR\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-2\fR] [\fB\-a\ \fR\fB\fIalg\fR\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fR\fB\fIclass\fR\fR] [\fB\-d\ \fR\fB\fIdir\fR\fR] {dnsname}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR
outputs the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record (RR), as defined in RFC 3658 and RFC 4509, for the given key(s).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-1
.RS 4
Use SHA\-1 as the digest algorithm (the default is to use both SHA\-1 and SHA\-256).
.RE
.PP
\-2
.RS 4
Use SHA\-256 as the digest algorithm.
.RE
.PP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Select the digest algorithm. The value of
\fBalgorithm\fR
must be one of SHA\-1 (SHA1) or SHA\-256 (SHA256). These values are case insensitive.
.RE
.PP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Sets the debugging level.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a keyset file. Following options make sense only in this mode.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIclass\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the DNS class (default is IN), useful only in the keyset mode.
.RE
.PP
\-d \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Look for
\fIkeyset\fR
files in
\fBdirectory\fR
as the directory, ignored when not in the keyset mode.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To build the SHA\-256 DS RR from the
\fBKexample.com.+003+26160\fR
keyfile name, the following command would be issued:
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey \-2 Kexample.com.+003+26160\fR
.PP
The command would print something like:
.PP
\fBexample.com. IN DS 26160 5 2 3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0 C5EA0B94\fR
.SH "FILES"
.PP
The keyfile can be designed by the key identification
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fR
or the full file name
\fIKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fR
as generated by
dnssec\-keygen(8).
.PP
The keyset file name is built from the
\fBdirectory\fR, the string
\fIkeyset\-\fR
and the
\fBdnsname\fR.
.SH "CAVEAT"
.PP
A keyfile error can give a "file not found" even if the file exists.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
