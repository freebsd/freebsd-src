.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnamed\fR [ \fB-4\fR ]  [ \fB-6\fR ]  [ \fB-c \fIconfig-file\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-d \fIdebug-level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-f\fR ]  [ \fB-g\fR ]  [ \fB-n \fI#cpus\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-p \fIport\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s\fR ]  [ \fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-u \fIuser\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-v\fR ]  [ \fB-x \fIcache-file\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\fR is a Domain Name System (DNS) server,
part of the BIND 9 distribution from ISC. For more
information on the DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.
.PP
When invoked without arguments, \fBnamed\fR will
read the default configuration file
\fI/etc/named.conf\fR, read any initial
data, and listen for queries.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-4\fR
Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv6.
\fB-4\fR and \fB-6\fR are mutually
exclusive.
.TP
\fB-6\fR
Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv4.
\fB-4\fR and \fB-6\fR are mutually
exclusive.
.TP
\fB-c \fIconfig-file\fB\fR
Use \fIconfig-file\fR as the
configuration file instead of the default,
\fI/etc/named.conf\fR. To
ensure that reloading the configuration file continues
to work after the server has changed its working
directory due to to a possible
\fBdirectory\fR option in the configuration
file, \fIconfig-file\fR should be
an absolute pathname.
.TP
\fB-d \fIdebug-level\fB\fR
Set the daemon's debug level to \fIdebug-level\fR.
Debugging traces from \fBnamed\fR become
more verbose as the debug level increases.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not daemonize).
.TP
\fB-g\fR
Run the server in the foreground and force all logging
to \fIstderr\fR.
.TP
\fB-n \fI#cpus\fB\fR
Create \fI#cpus\fR worker threads
to take advantage of multiple CPUs. If not specified,
\fBnamed\fR will try to determine the
number of CPUs present and create one thread per CPU.
If it is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a
single worker thread will be created.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
Listen for queries on port \fIport\fR. If not
specified, the default is port 53.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Write memory usage statistics to \fIstdout\fR on exit.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers
and may be removed or changed in a future release.
.RE
.sp
.TP
\fB-t \fIdirectory\fB\fR
\fBchroot()\fR to \fIdirectory\fR after
processing the command line arguments, but before
reading the configuration file.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
This option should be used in conjunction with the
\fB-u\fR option, as chrooting a process
running as root doesn't enhance security on most
systems; the way \fBchroot()\fR is
defined allows a process with root privileges to
escape a chroot jail.
.RE
.sp
.TP
\fB-u \fIuser\fB\fR
\fBsetuid()\fR to \fIuser\fR after completing
privileged operations, such as creating sockets that
listen on privileged ports.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
On Linux, \fBnamed\fR uses the kernel's
capability mechanism to drop all root privileges
except the ability to \fBbind()\fR to a
privileged port and set process resource limits.
Unfortunately, this means that the \fB-u\fR
option only works when \fBnamed\fR is run
on kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or
later, since previous kernels did not allow privileges
to be retained after \fBsetuid()\fR.
.RE
.sp
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Report the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB-x \fIcache-file\fB\fR
Load data from \fIcache-file\fR into the
cache of the default view.
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
This option must not be used. It is only of interest
to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed in a
future release.
.RE
.sp
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
In routine operation, signals should not be used to control
the nameserver; \fBrndc\fR should be used
instead.
.TP
\fBSIGHUP\fR
Force a reload of the server.
.TP
\fBSIGINT, SIGTERM\fR
Shut down the server.
.PP
The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined.
.PP
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The \fBnamed\fR configuration file is too complex
to describe in detail here. A complete description is
provided in the \fIBIND 9 Administrator Reference
Manual\fR.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/named.conf\fB\fR
The default configuration file.
.TP
\fB\fI/var/run/named.pid\fB\fR
The default process-id file.
