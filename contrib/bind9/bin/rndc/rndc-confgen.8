.SH NAME
rndc-confgen \- rndc key generation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBrndc-confgen\fR [ \fB-a\fR ]  [ \fB-b \fIkeysize\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-c \fIkeyfile\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-k \fIkeyname\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-p \fIport\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-r \fIrandomfile\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s \fIaddress\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-t \fIchrootdir\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-u \fIuser\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrndc-confgen\fR generates configuration files
for \fBrndc\fR. It can be used as a
convenient alternative to writing the
\fIrndc.conf\fR file
and the corresponding \fBcontrols\fR
and \fBkey\fR
statements in \fInamed.conf\fR by hand.
Alternatively, it can be run with the \fB-a\fR
option to set up a \fIrndc.key\fR file and
avoid the need for a \fIrndc.conf\fR file
and a \fBcontrols\fR statement altogether.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Do automatic \fBrndc\fR configuration.
This creates a file \fIrndc.key\fR
in \fI/etc\fR (or whatever
sysconfdir
was specified as when BIND was built)
that is read by both \fBrndc\fR
and \fBnamed\fR on startup. The
\fIrndc.key\fR file defines a default
command channel and authentication key allowing
\fBrndc\fR to communicate with
\fBnamed\fR on the local host
with no further configuration. 

Running \fBrndc-confgen -a\fR allows
BIND 9 and \fBrndc\fR to be used as drop-in
replacements for BIND 8 and \fBndc\fR,
with no changes to the existing BIND 8
\fInamed.conf\fR file.

If a more elaborate configuration than that
generated by \fBrndc-confgen -a\fR
is required, for example if rndc is to be used remotely,
you should run \fBrndc-confgen\fR without the
\fB-a\fR option and set up a
\fIrndc.conf\fR and
\fInamed.conf\fR
as directed.
.TP
\fB-b \fIkeysize\fB\fR
Specifies the size of the authentication key in bits.
Must be between 1 and 512 bits; the default is 128.
.TP
\fB-c \fIkeyfile\fB\fR
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to specify
an alternate location for \fIrndc.key\fR.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBrndc-confgen\fR.
.TP
\fB-k \fIkeyname\fB\fR
Specifies the key name of the rndc authentication key.
This must be a valid domain name.
The default is rndc-key.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the command channel port where \fBnamed\fR
listens for connections from \fBrndc\fR.
The default is 953.
.TP
\fB-r \fIrandomfile\fB\fR
Specifies a source of random data for generating the
authorization. If the operating
system does not provide a \fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness
is keyboard input. \fIrandomdev\fR specifies
the name of a character device or file containing random
data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR indicates that keyboard
input should be used.
.TP
\fB-s \fIaddress\fB\fR
Specifies the IP address where \fBnamed\fR
listens for command channel connections from
\fBrndc\fR. The default is the loopback
address 127.0.0.1.
.TP
\fB-t \fIchrootdir\fB\fR
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to specify
a directory where \fBnamed\fR will run
chrooted. An additional copy of the \fIrndc.key\fR
will be written relative to this directory so that
it will be found by the chrooted \fBnamed\fR.
.TP
\fB-u \fIuser\fB\fR
Used with the \fB-a\fR option to set the owner
of the \fIrndc.key\fR file generated. If
\fB-t\fR is also specified only the file in
the chroot area has its owner changed.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To allow \fBrndc\fR to be used with
no manual configuration, run
.PP
\fBrndc-confgen -a\fR
.PP
To print a sample \fIrndc.conf\fR file and
corresponding \fBcontrols\fR and \fBkey\fR
statements to be manually inserted into \fInamed.conf\fR,
run
.PP
\fBrndc-confgen\fR
