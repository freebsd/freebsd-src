BIND 9

	BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the
	underlying BIND architecture.  Some of the important features of
	BIND 9 are:

		- DNS Security
			DNSSEC (signed zones)
			TSIG (signed DNS requests)

		- IP version 6
			Answers DNS queries on IPv6 sockets
			IPv6 resource records (AAAA)
			Experimental IPv6 Resolver Library

		- DNS Protocol Enhancements
			IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
			Improved standards conformance

		- Views
			One server process can provide multiple "views" of
			the DNS namespace, e.g. an "inside" view to certain
			clients, and an "outside" view to others.

		- Multiprocessor Support

		- Improved Portability Architecture


	BIND version 9 development has been underwritten by the following
	organizations:

		Sun Microsystems, Inc.
		Hewlett Packard
		Compaq Computer Corporation
		IBM
		Process Software Corporation
		Silicon Graphics, Inc.
		Network Associates, Inc.
		U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency
		USENIX Association
		Stichting NLnet - NLnet Foundation
		Nominum, Inc.

BIND 9.9.7-P2

       BIND 9.9.7-P1 is a security release addressing the flaw
       described in CVE-2015-5477.

BIND 9.9.7-P1

       BIND 9.9.7-P1 is a security release addressing the flaw
       described in CVE-2015-4620.

BIND 9.9.7

	BIND 9.9.7 is a maintenance release and addresses bugs
	found in BIND 9.9.6 and earlier, as well as the security
	flaws described in CVE-2014-8500 and CVE-2015-1349.

BIND 9.9.6

	BIND 9.9.6 is a maintenance release, and also includes
	the following new functionality.

	 - The former behavior with respect to capitalization of names
	   (prior to BIND 9.9.5) can be restored for specific clients via
	   the new "no-case-compress" ACL.

BIND 9.9.5

	BIND 9.9.5 is a maintenance release, and patches the security
	flaws described in CVE-2013-6320 and CVE-2014-0591.  It also
	includes the following functional enhancements:

	 - "named" now preserves the capitalization of names when
	   responding to queries.
	 - new "dnssec-importkey" command allows the use of offline
	   DNSSEC keys with automatic DNSKEY management.
	 - When re-signing a zone, the new "dnssec-signzone -Q" option
	   drops signatures from keys that are still published but are
	   no longer active.
	 - "named-checkconf -px" will print the contents of configuration
	   files with the shared secrets obscured, making it easier to
	   share configuration (e.g. when submitting a bug report)
	   without revealing private information.

BIND 9.9.4

	BIND 9.9.4 is a maintenance release, and patches the security
	flaws described in CVE-2013-3919 and CVE-2013-4854. It also
	introduces DNS Response Rate Limiting (DNS RRL) as a
	compile-time option. To use this feature, configure with
	the "--enable-rrl" option.

BIND 9.9.3

	BIND 9.9.3 is a maintenance release and patches the security
	flaws described in CVE-2012-5688, CVE-2012-5689 and CVE-2013-2266.

BIND 9.9.2

	BIND 9.9.2 is a maintenance release and patches the security
	flaw described in CVE-2012-4244.

BIND 9.9.1

	BIND 9.9.1 is a maintenance release.

BIND 9.9.0

	BIND 9.9.0 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.8 and earlier
	releases.  New features include:

	- Inline signing, allowing automatic DNSSEC signing of
	  master zones without modification of the zonefile, or 
	  "bump in the wire" signing in slaves.
	- NXDOMAIN redirection.
	- New 'rndc flushtree' command clears all data under a given
	  name from the DNS cache.
	- New 'rndc sync' command dumps pending changes in a dynamic
	  zone to disk without a freeze/thaw cycle.
	- New 'rndc signing' command displays or clears signing status
	  records in 'auto-dnssec' zones.
	- NSEC3 parameters for 'auto-dnssec' zones can now be set prior
	  to signing, eliminating the need to initially sign with NSEC.
	- Startup time improvements on large authoritative servers.
	- Slave zones are now saved in raw format by default.
	- Several improvements to response policy zones (RPZ).
	- Improved hardware scalability by using multiple threads
	  to listen for queries and using finer-grained client locking
	- The 'also-notify' option now takes the same syntax as
	  'masters', so it can used named masterlists and TSIG keys.
	- 'dnssec-signzone -D' writes an output file containing only DNSSEC
	  data, which can be included by the primary zone file.
	- 'dnssec-signzone -R' forces removal of signatures that are
	  not expired but were created by a key which no longer exists.
	- 'dnssec-signzone -X' allows a separate expiration date to
	  be specified for DNSKEY signatures from other signatures.
	- New '-L' option to dnssec-keygen, dnssec-settime, and
	  dnssec-keyfromlabel sets the default TTL for the key.
	- dnssec-dsfromkey now supports reading from standard input,
	  to make it easier to convert DNSKEY to DS.
	- RFC 1918 reverse zones have been added to the empty-zones
	  table per RFC 6303.
	- Dynamic updates can now optionally set the zone's SOA serial
	  number to the current UNIX time.
	- DLZ modules can now retrieve the source IP address of
	  the querying client.
	- 'request-ixfr' option can now be set at the per-zone level.
	- 'dig +rrcomments' turns on comments about DNSKEY records,
	  indicating their key ID, algorithm and function
	- Simplified nsupdate syntax and added readline support

Building

	BIND 9 currently requires a UNIX system with an ANSI C compiler,
	basic POSIX support, and a 64 bit integer type.

	We've had successful builds and tests on the following systems:

		COMPAQ Tru64 UNIX 5.1B
		Fedora Core 6
		FreeBSD 4.10, 5.2.1, 6.2
		HP-UX 11.11
		Mac OS X 10.5
		NetBSD 3.x, 4.0-beta, 5.0-beta
		OpenBSD 3.3 and up
		Solaris 8, 9, 9 (x86), 10
		Ubuntu 7.04, 7.10
		Windows XP/2003/2008

	NOTE:  As of BIND 9.5.1, 9.4.3, and 9.3.6, older versions of
	Windows, including Windows NT and Windows 2000, are no longer
	supported.

	We have recent reports from the user community that a supported
	version of BIND will build and run on the following systems:

		AIX 4.3, 5L
		CentOS 4, 4.5, 5
		Darwin 9.0.0d1/ARM
		Debian 4, 5, 6
		Fedora Core 5, 7, 8
		FreeBSD 6, 7, 8
		HP-UX 11.23 PA
		MacOS X 10.5, 10.6, 10.7
		Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6
		SCO OpenServer 5.0.6
		Slackware 9, 10
		SuSE 9, 10

	To build, just

		./configure
		make

	Do not use a parallel "make".

	Several environment variables that can be set before running
	configure will affect compilation:

	    CC
		The C compiler to use.	configure tries to figure
		out the right one for supported systems.

	    CFLAGS
		C compiler flags.  Defaults to include -g and/or -O2
		as supported by the compiler.  Please include '-g'
		if you need to set CFLAGS.

	    STD_CINCLUDES
		System header file directories.	 Can be used to specify
		where add-on thread or IPv6 support is, for example.
		Defaults to empty string.

	    STD_CDEFINES
		Any additional preprocessor symbols you want defined.
		Defaults to empty string.

		Possible settings:
		Change the default syslog facility of named/lwresd.
		  -DISC_FACILITY=LOG_LOCAL0	
		Enable DNSSEC signature chasing support in dig.
		  -DDIG_SIGCHASE=1 (sets -DDIG_SIGCHASE_TD=1 and
				    -DDIG_SIGCHASE_BU=1)
		Disable dropping queries from particular well known ports.
		  -DNS_CLIENT_DROPPORT=0
		Sibling glue checking in named-checkzone is enabled by default.
		To disable the default check set.  -DCHECK_SIBLING=0
		named-checkzone checks out-of-zone addresses by default.
		To disable this default set.  -DCHECK_LOCAL=0
		To create the default pid files in ${localstatedir}/run rather
		than ${localstatedir}/run/{named,lwresd}/ set.
		  -DNS_RUN_PID_DIR=0
		Enable workaround for Solaris kernel bug about /dev/poll
		  -DISC_SOCKET_USE_POLLWATCH=1
		  The watch timeout is also configurable, e.g.,
		  -DISC_SOCKET_POLLWATCH_TIMEOUT=20

	    LDFLAGS
		Linker flags. Defaults to empty string.

	The following need to be set when cross compiling.

	    BUILD_CC
		The native C compiler.
	    BUILD_CFLAGS (optional)
	    BUILD_CPPFLAGS (optional)
		Possible Settings:
		-DNEED_OPTARG=1		(optarg is not declared in <unistd.h>)
	    BUILD_LDFLAGS (optional)
	    BUILD_LIBS (optional)

	To build shared libraries, specify "--with-libtool" on the
	configure command line.

	For the server to support DNSSEC, you need to build it
	with crypto support.  You must have OpenSSL 0.9.5a
	or newer installed and specify "--with-openssl" on the
	configure command line.  If OpenSSL is installed under
	a nonstandard prefix, you can tell configure where to
	look for it using "--with-openssl=/prefix".

	On some platforms it is necessary to explictly request large
	file support to handle files bigger than 2GB.  This can be
	done by "--enable-largefile" on the configure command line.

	On some platforms, BIND 9 can be built with multithreading
	support, allowing it to take advantage of multiple CPUs.
	You can specify whether to build a multithreaded BIND 9 
	by specifying "--enable-threads" or "--disable-threads"
	on the configure command line.  The default is operating
	system dependent.

	Support for the "fixed" rrset-order option can be enabled
	or disabled by specifying "--enable-fixed-rrset" or
	"--disable-fixed-rrset" on the configure command line.
	The default is "disabled", to reduce memory footprint.

	If your operating system has integrated support for IPv6, it
	will be used automatically.  If you have installed KAME IPv6
	separately, use "--with-kame[=PATH]" to specify its location.

	"make install" will install "named" and the various BIND 9 libraries.
	By default, installation is into /usr/local, but this can be changed
	with the "--prefix" option when running "configure".

	You may specify the option "--sysconfdir" to set the directory 
	where configuration files like "named.conf" go by default,
	and "--localstatedir" to set the default parent directory
	of "run/named.pid".   For backwards compatibility with BIND 8,
	--sysconfdir defaults to "/etc" and --localstatedir defaults to
	"/var" if no --prefix option is given.  If there is a --prefix
	option, sysconfdir defaults to "$prefix/etc" and localstatedir
	defaults to "$prefix/var".

	To see additional configure options, run "configure --help".
	Note that the help message does not reflect the BIND 8 
	compatibility defaults for sysconfdir and localstatedir.

	If you're planning on making changes to the BIND 9 source, you
	should also "make depend".  If you're using Emacs, you might find
	"make tags" helpful.

	If you need to re-run configure please run "make distclean" first.
	This will ensure that all the option changes take.

	Building with gcc is not supported, unless gcc is the vendor's usual
	compiler (e.g. the various BSD systems, Linux).
	
	Known compiler issues:
	* gcc-3.2.1 and gcc-3.1.1 is known to cause problems with solaris-x86.
	* gcc prior to gcc-3.2.3 ultrasparc generates incorrect code at -02.
	* gcc-3.3.5 powerpc generates incorrect code at -02.
	* Irix, MipsPRO 7.4.1m is known to cause problems.

	A limited test suite can be run with "make test".  Many of
	the tests require you to configure a set of virtual IP addresses
	on your system, and some require Perl; see bin/tests/system/README
	for details.

	SunOS 4 requires "printf" to be installed to make the shared
	libraries.  sh-utils-1.16 provides a "printf" which compiles
	on SunOS 4.

Known limitations

	Linux requires kernel build 2.6.39 or later to get the
	performance benefits from using multiple sockets.

Documentation

	The BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual is included with the
	source distribution in DocBook XML and HTML format, in the
	doc/arm directory.

	Some of the programs in the BIND 9 distribution have man pages
	in their directories.  In particular, the command line
	options of "named" are documented in /bin/named/named.8.
	There is now also a set of man pages for the lwres library.

	If you are upgrading from BIND 8, please read the migration
	notes in doc/misc/migration.  If you are upgrading from
	BIND 4, read doc/misc/migration-4to9.

	Frequently asked questions and their answers can be found in
	FAQ.

	Additional information on various subjects can be found
	in the other README files.
