2001-04-25  Derek Price  <dprice@collab.net>

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated using AM 1.4e as of today at 18:10 -0400.

2001-03-24  Noel Cragg  <noel@shave.red-bean.com>

	* diff.c: fix typo in usage string.

2001-03-20  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>
	    for Karl Tomlinson  <k.tomlinson@auckland.ac.nz>

	* diff3.c (main): changed the common file of the two diffs to
	OLDFILE for merges and edscripts so that the diffs are more likely
	to contain the intended changes.  Not changing the horizon-lines
	arg for the second diff.  If the two diffs have the same parameters
	equal changes in each diff are more likely to appear the same.

	* analyze.c (shift_boundaries): undid Paul Eggert's patch to fix
	the diff3 merge bug described in ccvs/doc/DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG.  The
	patch is no longer necessary now that diff3 does its differences
	differently.  I think the hunk merges provide a better indication
	of the area modified by the user now that the diffs are actually
	done between the appropriate revisions.

2001-03-15  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add -I$(top_srcdir)/lib for platforms which
	need the regex library there.

	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

2001-03-14  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* .cvsignore: Added '.deps'.

	    Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: New file.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

2001-02-22  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>
	    Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.in: Don't define PR_PROGRAM - it's defined by configure.
	Remove separate rule for util.c.

2001-02-06  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>
	    Rex Jolliff  <Rex_Jolliff@notes.ymp.gov>
	    Shawn Smith  <Shawn_Smith@notes.ymp.gov>

	* dir.c: Replace opendir, closedir, & readdir calls with CVS_OPENDIR,
	CVS_CLOSEDIR, & CVS_READDIR in support of changes to handle VMS DEC C
	5.7 {open,read,close}dir problems.  Check today's entry in the vms
	subdir for more.
	* system.h: definitions of CVS_*DIR provided here.

2000-12-21  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* Makefile.in: Some changes to support Automake targets

2000-10-26  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* Makefile.in: Get PR_PROGRAM from autoconf instead of hard coding.
	(Patch submitted by Urs Thuermann <urs@isnogud.escape.de>.)
	Also add a dependency for util.o on Makefile since PR_PROGRAM gets
	compiled in.

2000-08-03  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* diff3.c (read_diff): Use cvs_temp_name () instead of tmpnam () so
	there's at least a chance of getting the file in the correct tmp dir.

2000-07-10  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* util.c (printf_output): Fix type clashes.

2000-06-15  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* diff3.c (diff3_run, make_3way_diff): Plug memory leaks.

1999-12-29  Jim Kingdon  <http://developer.redhat.com/>

	* diff.c (compare_files): Use explicit braces with if-if-else, per
	GNU coding standards and gcc -Wall.

1999-11-23  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* diff3.c: Explicitly initialize zero_diff3 to placate neurotic
	compilers that gripe about implicitly initialized const variables.
	Reported by Eric Veum <sysv@yahoo.com>.

1999-09-15  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* diff.c (diff_run): Move the setjmp call before the options
	processing since option errors can call fatal which in turn
	calls longjmp.

1999-05-06  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove libdiff.mak.
	* libdiff.mak: Removed; we are back to a single makefile for
	Visual C++ version 4.

1999-04-29  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* diff.c (diff_run): Use separate statement for setjmp call and if
	statement.  This is better style in general (IMHO) but in the case
	of setjmp the UNICOS compiler apparently cares (I don't have the
	standard handy, but there are lots of legitimate restrictions on
	how you can call setjmp).

1999-04-26  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add libdiff.dsp libdiff.mak .cvsignore.

1999-04-26 (submitted 1999-03-24) John O'Connor  <john@shore.net>

	* libdiff.dsp: new file. MSVC project file used to build the library.

	* libdiff.mak: new file. Makefile for building from the command-line.

	* .cvsignore: Removed un-used entries related to MSVC.  Added
	entries to ignore directories generated by the NT build, Debug
	and Release.

1999-03-24  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>
	and Olaf Brandes

	* diff3.c (diff3_run): Use a separate stream for the input to
	output_diff3_merge instead of reopening stdin to avoid problems
	with leaving it open.

1999-02-17  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>
	and Hallvard B Furuseth.

	* util.c: Use __STDC__ consistently with ./system.h.
	* system.h: Add comment about PARAMS.

1999-01-12  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, analyze.c, cmpbuf.c, cmpbuf.h, context.c, diff.c,
	diff.h, diff3.c, diffrun.h, dir.c, ed.c, io.c, normal.c, system.h,
	util.c: Remove paragraph containing the old snail mail address of
	the Free Software Foundation.

1998-09-21  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* util.c (printf_output): Make msg static; avoids auto
	initializer, which is not portable to SunOS4 /bin/cc.
	Reported by Mike Sutton@SAIC.

1998-09-14  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add diagmeet.note.

1998-08-15  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* diffrun.h (struct diff_callbacks): Change calling convention of
	write_output so that a zero length means to output zero bytes.
	The cvs_output convention is just too ugly/error-prone.
	* util.c (printf_output): Rewrite to parse format string
	overselves rather than calling vasprintf, which cannot be
	implemented in portable C.

1998-08-06  David Masterson of kla-tencor.com

	* util.c (flush_output): Don't prototype.

Thu Jul  2 16:34:38 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	Simplify the callback interface:
	* diffrun.h: Don't include <stdarg.h> or <varargs.h>.
	(struct diff_callbacks): Remove printf_output field.
	* util.c: Include <stdarg.h> or <varargs.h>.
	(printf_output): Use vasprintf and write_output callback rather
	than printf_output callback.
	* diff3.c (read_diff): Don't set my_callbacks.printf_output.

Thu Jun 18 12:43:53 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* diffrun.h: New file.
	* diff.h: Include diffrun.h.
	(callbacks): New EXTERN variable.
	(write_output, printf_output, flush_output): Declare.
	* diff.c (diff_run): Add parameter callbacks_arg.  Use callback
	functions rather than writing to stdout.  Don't open a file if
	there is a write_output callback.  Call perror_with_name rather
	than perror.
	(usage): Use callbacks if defined rather than writing to stdout.
	(compare_files): Call flush_output rather than fflush (outfile).
	* diff3.c: Include diffrun.h.  Change several functions to use
	output functions from util.c rather than direct printing.  Use
	diff_error and friends rather than printing to stderr.  Set global
	variable outfile.
	(outfile, callbacks): Declare.
	(write_output, printf_output, flush_output): Declare.
	(diff3_run): Add parameter callbacks_arg.  Use callback functions
	rather than writing to stdout.
	(usage): Use callbacks if defined rather than writing to stdout.
	(read_diff): Preserve callbacks and outfile around call to
	diff_run.
	* util.c (perror_with_name): Use error callback if defined.
	(pfatal_with_name, diff_error): Likewise.
	(message5): Use printf_output and write_output.
	(print_message_queue, print_1_line, output_1_line): Likewise.
	(begin_output): Reject paginate_flag if there are output
	callbacks.
	(write_output, printf_output, flush_output): New functions.
	* context.c: Change all output to outfile to use printf_output and
	write_output.
	* ed.c: Likewise.
	* ifdef.c: Likewise.
	* normal.c: Likewise.
	* side.c: Likewise.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add diffrun.h.
	($(OBJECTS)): Depend upon diffrun.h.

Fri Jan 16 14:58:19 1998  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* diff.c, diff3.c: Plug memory leaks.

Thu Jan 15 13:36:46 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): New rule, for when ../Makefile
	recurses into this directory (bug reported by W. L. Estes).

Tue Nov 11 10:48:19 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* diff.c (diff_run): Change #ifdef on HAVE_SETMODE to #if to match
	the other uses (fixes compilation error on unix).

	* diff.c (diff_run): Don't set stdout to binary mode.

Mon, 10 Nov 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* diff.c (run_diff): Open outfile in binary mode if --binary.

Thu Nov  6 12:42:12 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>
	                  and Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* analyze.c: applied Paul Eggert's patch to fix the diff3 merge
	bug described in ccvs/doc/DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG:
	(shift_boundaries): new var `inhibit_hunk_merge'; use it to
	control something important that I don't quite understand, but
	Paul apparently does, so that's okay.

Sat Nov  1 14:17:57 1997  Michael L.H. Brouwer  <michael@thi.nl>

	* Makefile.in: Add call to ranlib to build a table of contents for
	the library since some systems seem to require this.

1997-10-28  Jim Kingdon

	* .cvsignore: Add files du jour for Visual C++, vc50.pdb and vc50.idb.

	* system.h: Define HAVE_TIME_H.
	* dir.c [_WIN32]: Define CLOSEDIR_VOID.

1997-10-18  Jim Kingdon

	* build_diff.com: Add diff3.c

Fri Sep 26 14:24:42 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	* diff.c (diff_run): Save old value of optind before calling
	getopt_long, then restore before returning.  Eventually it would
	be nice if diff_run were fully reentrant.

	New diff3 library for CVS.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add diff3.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add diff3.o.
	* diff3.c: New file, copied from diffutils-2.7.  See diffutils for
	earlier ChangeLogs.  Undefine initialize_main macro. Remove <signal.h>.
	(diff3_run): Renamed from main().  Add `outfile' argument.  Remove
	SIGCLD handling; we do not fork.  Save optind and reset to 0
	before calling getopt_long; restore after option processing done.
	(read_diff): Use diff_run with a temporary output file,
	instead of forking a diff subprocess and reading from a pipe.
	Change DIFF_PROGRAM to "diff"; this argument is now used only for
	diagnostic reporting.
	(xmalloc, xrealloc): Removed.
	(diff_program): Removed.
	(diff_program_name): Made extern, so it may be used in other
	library calls like `error'.
	(initialize_main): New function.

	Namespace munging.  util.c defines both fatal() and
 	perror_with_exit(), but these cannot be used to abort diff3: both
 	attempt to longjmp() to a buffer set in diff.c, used only by
 	diff_run.  This is an awful solution, but necessary until the code
 	can be cleaned up.  (These functions do not *have* to be renamed,
 	since both are declared static to diff3.c and should not clash
 	with libdiff.a, but it reduces potential confusion.)
	* diff3.c (diff3_fatal): Renamed from fatal.
	(diff3_perror_with_exit): Renamed from perror_with_exit.

	Eliminate exit calls.
	(try_help): Change from `void' to `int'.  Return, do not exit.
	(diff3_fatal, diff3_perror_with_exit, process_diff): Change `exit'
	to DIFF3_ABORT.
	(diff3_run): Initialize jump buffer for nonlocal exits.  Change
 	exit calls to returns.  Change `perror_with_exit' to
 	`perror_with_name' and add a return.  Change `fatal' to
 	`diff_error' and add a return.  The reasoning is that we shouldn't
 	rely on setjmp/longjmp any more than necessary.

	Redirect stdout.
	(check_output): Renamed from check_stdout.  Take stream argument
	instead of blindly checking stdout.  Do not close stream, but
	merely fflush it.
	(diff3_run): Initialize outstream, and close when done.  Pass this
	stream (instead of stdout) to output_diff3_edscript,
	output_diff3_merge, and output_diff3.

Thu Sep 25 14:34:22 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* util.c (begin_output, finish_output): If PR_PROGRAM is not
	defined (VMS), just give a fatal error if --paginate specified.

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add ChangeLog build_diff.com
	Makefile.in.
	* build_diff.com: New file.

Wed Sep 24 10:27:00 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Also set top_srcdir.  Needed to make today's other
	Makefile.in change work.

	* .cvsignore: New file.

	* Makefile.in (COMPILE): Add -I options for srcdir (perhaps
	unneeded) and change -I option for lib to use top_srcdir (needed
	to avoid mixups with CVS's regex.h vs. the system one).

Sun Sep 21 19:44:42 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (util.o): Change util.c to $<, needed for srcdir.

Sat Sep 20 12:06:41 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	New diff library for CVS, based on diffutils-2.7.  See diffutils
	for earlier ChangeLogs.
	* Makefile.in, analyze.c, cmpbuf.c, cmpbuf.h, config.hin,
	context.c, diagmeet.note, diff.c, diff.h, dir.c, ed.c, ifdef.c,
	io.c, normal.c, side.c, stamp-h.in, system.h, util.c, version.c:
	New files.
	(COMPILE): Add -I../lib, so we can get getopt.h.

	* Makefile.in: Removed anything not related to libdiff.a.
	(dist-dir): New target, copied from ../lib/Makefile.in.
	(DISTFILES): New variable.
	(SOURCES): Renamed from `srcs'.
	(OBJECTS): Renamed from `libdiff_o'.
	(Makefile): Changed dependencies to reflect
	new, shallow config directory structure.
	(stamp-h.in, config.h.in, config.h, stamp-h): Removed.
	* stamp-h.in, config.h.in: Removed.

	* system.h: Remove dup2 macro (provided by ../lib/dup2.c).
	Include stdlib.h if STDC_HEADERS is defined (not just
	HAVE_STDLIB_H).

Sat Sep 20 05:32:18 1997  Tim Pierce  <twp@twp.tezcat.com>

	Diff librarification.
	
	* diff.c (diff_run): New function, renamed from `main'.
	Initialize `outfile' based on the value of the new `out' filename
	argument.
	(initialize_main): New function.
	* system.h: Removed initialize_main macro.
	* diffmain.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (diff): Added diffmain.o.
 	(libdiff): New target.
	(AR, libdiff_o): New variables.  libdiff_o does not include
	xmalloc.o, fnmatch.o, getopt.o, getopt1.o, regex.o or error.o,
	because these functions are already present in CVS.  It will take
	some work to make this more general-purpose.

	Redirect standard output.
	* util.c: Redirect stdout to outfile: change all naked `printf'
 	and `putchar' statements to `fprintf (outfile)' and `putc (...,
 	outfile)' throughout.  This should permit redirecting diff output
 	by changing `outfile' just once in `diff_run'.
	(output_in_progress): New variable.
	(begin_output, finish_output): Use `output_in_progress', rather than
	`outfile', as a semaphore to avoid reentrancy problems.
	(finish_output): Close `outfile' only if paginate_flag is set.
	* diff.c (check_output): New function, was check_stdout.  Take a
	`file' argument, and flush it instead of closing it.
	(diff_run): Change check_stdout to check_output.
	(compare_files): Fflush outfile, not stdout.
	
	Eliminate exit statements.
	* diff.h: Include setjmp.h.
	(diff_abort_buf): New variable.
	(DIFF_ABORT): New macro.
	* diff.c (diff_run): Change all `exit' statements to `return'.
	Set up diff_abort_buf, so we can abort diff without
	terminating (for libdiff.a).
	(try_help): Return int instead of void; do not exit.
	* util.c (fatal): Use DIFF_ABORT instead of exit.
	(pfatal_with_name): Use DIFF_ABORT instead of exit.

	Namespace cleanup (rudimentary).  Strictly speaking, this is not
 	necessary to make diff into a library.  However, namespace
	clashes between diff and CVS must be resolved immediately, since
	CVS is the first application targeted for use with difflib.
	
	* analyze.c, diff.c, diff.h, util.c (diff_error): Renamed from `error'.
	
	* version.c, diff.c, diff.h, cmp.c, diff3.c, sdiff.c
	(diff_version_string): Renamed from version_string.
	* diff.c, util.c, diff.h, diff3.c, error.c (diff_program_name):
	Renamed from program_name.

	* util.c (xmalloc, xrealloc): Removed.
	* Makefile.in (diff_o): Added error.o and xmalloc.o.
