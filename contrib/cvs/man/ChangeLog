Mon Jan 12 11:10:21 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Refer to Cederqvist as Cederqvist not as cvs.texinfo.
	Describe it in a way which hopefully makes more sense for people
	who aren't getting the CVS source distribution itself.  In "SEE
	ALSO" section, also mention web pages.  Use a period not a comma
	at the end of the references to other manpages.

	* cvs.1: Remove $Id; we decided to get rid of these some time ago.

Sun Jan 11 13:46:54 1998  Peter Wemm  <peter@netplex.com.au>

	* cvs.1: Fix "the the" typo.  From Wolfram Schneider
 	<wosch@freebsd.org> via FreeBSD sources.

Wed Feb 12 14:20:43 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Depend on installdirs.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, cvsbug.8: Remove "675" paragraph;
	see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Sat Nov 30 14:49:32 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Add note at beginning about how cvs.texinfo is more
	complete than this document.  Without some such indication, users
	have no way of knowing which document to consult.

Tue Oct  1 14:01:28 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Revert all changes by Greg Woods since CVS 1.8.86.  They
	are for new features which are not appropriate at this stage of
	the release process.

Mon Sep 30 18:21:05 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs.1: document -D, -g, DIFFBIN, and GREPBIN.

Mon Sep 16 23:22:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsbug.8: Remove references to cvsbug.el (or other aspects of
	emacs interface) and cvsbug.info (or other aspects of texinfo
	documentation).  Neither one has ever existed.

Wed Jul 24 19:01:35 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* cvs.1: Document -x.

Fri Sep 13 11:01:59 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@clapton.seachange.com>

	* cvs.1: add description of -k and -K for rdiff.  Mention that
	import allows '-b 1' to import to the trunk.

Tue May 14 10:23:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Add cvs.texinfo to the SEE ALSO section.  Replace an out
	of date list of default ignore patterns with a reference to
	cvs.texinfo (if someone wants to undo this change that is OK with
	me but I did it this way because it isn't clear people would
	actually keep cvs.1 up to date).

Wed Mar 13 17:06:39 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.8: Removed.
	* Makefile.in, cvs.1, cvs.5: Remove references to cvsinit.

Tue Feb 13 22:30:54 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.in: Remove reference to mkmodules.1

	* Makefile.in: Revise comment regarding install and installdirs.

Tue Nov 14 15:47:44 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs.5:
	- list filenames in alpha sort order
	- describe the cvswrappers file
	- describe the taginfo file
	- fix cvsinit chapter number
	(This is by no means complete -- it's just stuff I noticed.)

	* cvs.1: put the filenames in alpha sort order

	* cvsinit.8: remove the .pl extension from filenames

Wed Oct 18 11:07:07 1995  Vince Demarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* cvs.1 (Flag): Updated the CVSROOT/wrappers stuff. Everyone seems
        to think this is a NEXT specific thing it isn't.

Tue Oct 17 17:38:27 1995  Warren Jones  <wjones@tc.fluke.com>

	* cvs.1: Change \. to \&. at start of line.

Tue Oct  3 13:43:33 1995  Del  <del@matra.com.au>

	* cvs.1: Updated man page for all the new features of 1.6
	(including some that were missed in 1.5 and 1.4.xx).  This includes:
	- -f and -z global options.
	- tag -F, and -r options.
	- rtag -F options
	- CVSROOT/taginfo and CVSROOT/wrappers files (the latter could use a touch
	  up because I don't really understand how wrappers work or why anyone would
	  use them -- I haven't ever played with a NEXT.
	- export -k option
	- New environment variables CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT, CVS_RSH, CVS_SERVER, and
	  CVSWRAPPERS.  I left CVS_CLIENT_LOG, CVS_CLIENT_PORT, and CVS_SERVER_SLEEP
	  undocumented because these appear to be for testing / debugging only.
	  Note that TMPDIR, HOME and PATH are used as well and strictly speaking
	  should be documented.
	- New files ~/.cvsrc and ~/.cvswrappers

Tue Aug 15 08:13:14 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (MANFILES): include $MAN8FILES too, so they get
        tarred up in the distribution just like anything else.

Mon Jul 24 19:11:15 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: Remove references to -q and -Q command options.

Fri Jul 14 23:30:33 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.1: document 'cvs status [-qQ]'
	- note reference to cvsinit(8) and cvsbug(8)
	(from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in: add support for installing in man8, and new cvsbug
        and cvsinit pages (from previous local changes)
        
Sat May 27 08:46:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
	directory when Makefile.in is out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri Apr 28 22:51:31 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Updated.
	(dist-dir): Renamed from dist; changed to work with DISTDIR
	variable passed from parent.

Fri Jul 15 12:58:14 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): Do not depend upon installdirs.

Sat Dec 18 01:23:13 1993  david d zuhn  (zoo@monad.armadillo.com)

	installing the man pages

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced

Thu Dec  5 22:45:59 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.
