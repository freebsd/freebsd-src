First, read the README file.  If you're still happy...

CVS has been tested on the following platforms.  The most recent
version of CVS reported to have been tested is indicated, but more
recent versions of CVS probably will work too.  Please send updates to
this list to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu (doing so in the form of a diff
to this file is encouraged).  "tested" means, at a minimum, that CVS
compiles and appears to work on simple (manual) testing.  In many
cases it also means "make check" and/or "make remotecheck" passes, but
we don't try to list the platforms for which that is true.

(footnote 1)
	AIX 4.1 systems fail to run "configure" due to bugs in their
	"/bin/sh" implementation.  You might want to try feeding the
	configure script to "bash" ported to AIX 4.1.  (about 1.4A2).

(footnote 2)
	Some Irix 4.0 systems may core dump in malloc while running
	CVS.  We believe this is a bug in the Irix malloc.  You can
	workaround this bug by linking with "-lmalloc" if necessary.
	(about 1.4A2).

(footnote 4) Comment out the include of sys/time.h in src/server.c. (1.4.93)
	You also may have to make sure TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is undef'ed.

(footnote 5) Change /usr/tmp to /var/tmp in src/server.c (2 places) (1.4.93).
	(This should no longer be needed; CVS doesn't have /usr/tmp in
	src/server.c any more.  Has anyone tried a more recent version
	on BSDI?  If so, please report it so we can update this file).

(footnote 6) Build in ucb universe with COFF compiler tools.  Put
	/usr/local/bin first in PATH while doing a configure, make
	and install of GNU diffutils-2.7, rcs-5.7, then cvs-1.5.

(footnote 7) Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@pilgrim.umass.edu> reports
        success with this configure command:
  CC=cc CFLAGS='-O2 -Olimit 2000 -std1' ./configure --verbose alpha-dec-osf

(footnote 8) Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@pilgrim.umass.edu> reports
        success with this configure command:
  CC=cc CFLAGS='+O2 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE' ./configure --verbose hppa1.1-hp-hpux

(footnote 9) 
    Had to configure with ./configure --host=<arch>-lynx.

    In src/cvs.h, protected the waitpid prototype with ifdef _POSIX_SOURCE.
    (I might try building with gcc -mposix -D_POSIX_SOURCE.)

    LynxOS has <dirent.h>, but you don't want to use it.
    You want to use <sys/dir.h> instead.
    So after running configure I had to undef HAVE_DIRENT_H and
    define HAVE_SYS_DIR_H.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation under Unix (if you got a binary distribution from
somewhere, install it according to procedure for that binary
distribution, then skip to step 5):

1)  Run "configure":

	$ ./configure

    You can specify an alternate destination to override the default with
    the --prefix option:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu

    or some path that is more appropriate for your site.  The default prefix
    value is "/usr/local", with binaries in sub-directory "bin", manual
    pages in sub-directory "man", and libraries in sub-directory "lib".

    A normal build of CVS will create an executable which supports
    local, server, or client CVS (if you don't know the difference,
    it is described in the Repository chapter of doc/cvs.texinfo).  If
    you do not intend to use client or server CVS, you may want to
    prevent these features from being included in the executable you
    build. You can do this with the --disable-client and
    --disable-server options:

	$ ./configure --disable-client --disable-server

    Typically this can reduce the size of the executable by around 30%.

    If you are using server or local CVS, RCS needs to be installed in
    the user's PATH (or a path you have configured in src/options.h,
    or a path specified with the -b option).  If you don't have RCS,
    you will need to get it from GNU as well.  It is best to get the
    version 5.7 (or later) version of RCS, available from
    prep.ai.mit.edu in the file pub/gnu/rcs-5.7.tar.gz.  If you do not
    have RCS version 5.x (for example, if you are using the old RCS
    shipped with some versions of HPUX), CVS will probably fail to work
    entirely.  To find out what version of RCS you have, invoke "co -V".
    If it fails to print a version number, it is an old version.

    If you want version control of files with binary data, make sure
    that the RCS configure script finds GNU diff 1.15 or later and
    notices that diff supports the -a option.  CVS itself is much less
    picky about which version of diff it uses, and you shouldn't need
    to worry about that.  If you are using GNU diff 2.6 or 2.7, you may
    want to know about a (subtle) bug described in doc/DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG.

    NOTE: The configure program will cache the results of the previous
    configure execution.  If you need to re-run configure from scratch, you
    may need to run "make distclean" first to remove the cached
    configuration information.

    If you are using gcc and are planning to modify CVS, you may want to
    configure with -Wall; see the file HACKING for details.

    If you have Kerberos 4 installed, you can specify the location of
    the header files and libraries using the --with-krb4=DIR option.
    DIR should be a directory with subdirectories include and lib
    holding the Kerberos 4 header files and libraries, respectively.
    The default value is /usr/kerberos.

    If you want to enable support for encryption over Kerberos, use
    the --enable-encryption option.  This option is disabled by
    default.

    Try './configure --help' for further information on its usage.

    NOTE ON CVS's USE OF NDBM:

	By default, CVS uses some built-in ndbm emulation code to allow
	CVS to work in a heterogeneous environment.  However, if you have
	a very large modules database, this may not work well.  You will
	need to edit src/options.h to turn off the MY_NDBM #define and
	re-run configure.  If you do this, the following comments apply.
	If not, you may safely skip these comments.

	If you configure CVS to use the real ndbm(3) libraries and
	you do not have them installed in a "normal" place, you will
	probably want to get the GNU version of ndbm (gdbm) and install
	that before running the CVS configure script.  Be aware that the
	GDBM 1.5 release does NOT install the <ndbm.h> header file included
	with the release automatically.  You may have to install it by hand.

	If you configure CVS to use the ndbm(3) libraries, you cannot
	compile CVS with GNU cc (gcc) on Sun-4 SPARC systems.  However, gcc
	2.0 may have fixed this limitation if -fpcc-struct-return is
	defined.  When using gcc on other systems to compile CVS, you *may*
	need to specify the -fpcc-struct-return option to gcc (you will
	*know* you have to if "cvs checkout" core dumps in some ndbm
	function).  You can do this as follows:

	    $ CC='gcc -fpcc-struct-return' ./configure

	for sh, bash, and ksh users and:

	    % setenv CC 'gcc -fpcc-struct-return'
	    % ./configure

	for csh and tcsh users.

    END OF NOTE FOR NDBM GUNK.

2)  Edit src/options.h.  Appropriate things to look at may be the
    invocation locations of programs like DIFF.
    Also glance at the default values for the environment variables
    that CVS uses, in particular, the RCSBIN variable, which holds the
    path to where the RCS programs live on your system.

3)  Try to build it:

	$ make

    This will (hopefully) make the needed CVS binaries within the
    "src" directory.  If something fails for your system, and you want
    to submit a bug report, you may wish to include your
    "config.status" file, your host type, operating system and
    compiler information, make output, and anything else you think
    will be helpful.

3a)  Run the regression tests (optional).

    You may also wish to validate the correctness of the new binary by
    running the regression tests.  If they succeed, that is nice to
    know.  However, if they fail, it doesn't tell you much.  Often it
    will just be a problem with running the tests on your machine,
    rather than a problem with CVS.  Unless you will have the time to
    determine which of the two it is in case of failure, you might
    want to save yourself the time and just not run the tests.

    If you want to run the tests, see the file TESTS for more information.

4)  Install the binaries/documentation:

	$ make install

    Depending on your installation's configuration, you may need to be
    root to do this.

5)  Take a look at the CVS documentation.

	$ man cvs

    and

	$ info cvs  

    See what it can do for you, and if it fits your environment (or can
    possibly be made to fit your environment).  If things look good,
    continue on...

6)  Set up the master source repository.  See the "Setting up the repository"
    section of cvs.texinfo for details; the one-line summary is (if you
    are putting the repository in /src/master):
    $ cvs -d /src/master init

7)  Have all users of the CVS system set the CVSROOT environment
    variable appropriately to reflect the placement of your source
    repository.  If the above example is used, the following commands
    can be placed in user's ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile file; or in the
    site-wide /etc/profile:

	CVSROOT=/src/master; export CVSROOT

    for sh/bash/ksh users, or place the following commands in the user's
    ~/.cshrc, ~/.login, or /etc/chsrc file:

	setenv CVSROOT /src/master

    for csh/tcsh users.  If these environment variables are not already set
    in your current shell, set them now (or source the login script you
    just edited).  You will need to have the CVSROOT environment variable
    set to continue on to the next step.

8)  It might be a good idea to jump right in and put the CVS distribution
    directly under CVS control.  From within the top-level directory of the
    CVS distribution (the one that contains this README file) do the
    following commands:

	$ make distclean
	$ cvs import -m 'CVS 1.6 distribution' cvs CVS_DIST CVS-1_6

9)  Having done step 8, one should be able to checkout a fresh copy of the
    CVS distribution and hack away at the sources with the following command:

	$ cd
	$ cvs checkout cvs

    This will make the directory "cvs" in your current directory and
    populate it with the appropriate CVS files and directories.

10) You may wish to customize the various administrative files, in particular
    modules.  See cvs.texinfo for details.

11) Read the NEWS file to see what's new.

12) Hack away.

Detailed information about your interaction with "configure":

The "configure" script and its interaction with its options and the
environment is described here.  For more detailed documentation about
"configure", please refer to the GNU Autoconf documentation.

Supported options are:

	--srcdir=DIR		Useful for compiling on many different
				machines sharing one source tree.
	--prefix=DIR		The root of where to install the
				various pieces of CVS (/usr/local).
	--exec_prefix=DIR	If you want executables in a
				host-dependent place and shared
				things in a host-independent place.

The following environment variables override configure's default
behaviour:

	CC			If not set, tries to use gcc first,
				then cc.  Also tries to use "-g -O"
				as options, backing down to -g
				alone if that doesn't work.
	INSTALL			If not set, tries to use "install", then
				"./install-sh" as a final choice.
	RANLIB			If not set, tries to determine if "ranlib"
				is available, choosing "echo" if it doesn't
				appear to be.
	YACC			If not set, tries to determine if "bison"
				is available, choosing "yacc" if it doesn't
				appear to be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation under Windows NT:

You may find interesting information in windows-NT/README.

1) Using Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.1, open the project `cvsnt.mak',
   in the top directory of the CVS distribution.
2) Choose "Build cvs.exe" from the "Project" menu.
3) MSVC will place the executable file cvs.exe in WinDebug, or whatever
   your target directory is.
