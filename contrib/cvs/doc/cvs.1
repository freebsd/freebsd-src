This manpage is a summary of some of the features of
\fBcvs\fP.  It is auto-generated from an appendix of the CVS manual.

.SH "CVS commands"

.SP
This appendix describes the overall structure of
\fBcvs\fR commands, and describes some commands in
detail (others are described elsewhere; for a quick
reference to \fBcvs\fR commands, see node `Invoking CVS\(aq in the CVS manual).

The overall format of all \fBcvs\fR commands is:

.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]

.PD
.IP "" 0
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBcvs\fR
.IP "" 2
The name of the \fBcvs\fR program.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBcvs_options\fR
.IP "" 2
Some options that affect all sub-commands of \fBcvs\fR.  These are
described below.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBcvs_command\fR
.IP "" 2
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit \fBcvs_command\fR: \fBcvs -H\fR elicits a
list of available commands, and \fBcvs -v\fR displays version
information on \fBcvs\fR itself.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBcommand_options\fR
.IP "" 2
Options that are specific for the command.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBcommand_args\fR
.IP "" 2
Arguments to the commands.
.SP
There is unfortunately some confusion between
\fBcvs_options\fR and \fBcommand_options\fR.
When given as a \fBcvs_option\fR, some options only
affect some of the commands.  When given as a
\fBcommand_option\fR it may have a different meaning, and
be accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.
.SP
.SH "Exit status"
.SS "CVS\(aqs exit status"
.IX "Exit status, of CVS"
.SP
\fBcvs\fR can indicate to the calling environment whether it
succeeded or failed by setting its \fIexit status\fR.
The exact way of testing the exit status will vary from
one operating system to another.  For example in a unix
shell script the \fB$?\fR variable will be 0 if the
last command returned a successful exit status, or
greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.
.SP
If \fBcvs\fR is successful, it returns a successful status;
if there is an error, it prints an error message and
returns a failure status.  The one exception to this is
the \fBcvs diff\fR command.  It will return a
successful status if it found no differences, or a
failure status if there were differences or if there
was an error.  Because this behavior provides no good
way to detect errors, in the future it is possible that
\fBcvs diff\fR will be changed to behave like the
other \fBcvs\fR commands.
.SP
.SH "~/.cvsrc"
.SS "Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file"
.IX "\&.cvsrc file"
.IX "Option defaults"
.SP
There are some \fBcommand_options\fR that are used so
often that you might have set up an alias or some other
means to make sure you always specify that option.  One
example (the one that drove the implementation of the
\fB.cvsrc\fR support, actually) is that many people find the
default output of the \fBdiff\fR command to be very
hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs
are much easier to understand.
.SP
The \fB~/.cvsrc\fR file is a way that you can add
default options to \fBcvs_commands\fR within cvs,
instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.
.SP
The format of the \fB~/.cvsrc\fR file is simple.  The
file is searched for a line that begins with the same
name as the \fBcvs_command\fR being executed.  If a
match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and
added to the command arguments \fIbefore\fR any
options from the command line.
.SP
If a command has two names (e.g., \fBcheckout\fR and
\fBco\fR), the official name, not necessarily the one
used on the command line, will be used to match against
the file.  So if this is the contents of the user\(aqs
\fB~/.cvsrc\fR file:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
log -N
.IP "" 2
diff -uN
.IP "" 2
rdiff -u
.IP "" 2
update -Pd
.IP "" 2
checkout -P
.IP "" 2
release -d

.PD
.IP "" 0
.SP
the command \fBcvs checkout foo\fR would have the
\fB-P\fR option added to the arguments, as well as
\fBcvs co foo\fR.
.SP
With the example file above, the output from \fBcvs
diff foobar\fR will be in unidiff format.  \fBcvs diff
-c foobar\fR will provide context diffs, as usual.
Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because \fBdiff\fR doesn\(aqt have an option
to specify use of the "old" format, so you would need
\fBcvs -f diff foobar\fR.
.SP
In place of the command name you can use \fBcvs\fR to
specify global options (see node `Global options\(aq in the CVS manual).  For
example the following line in \fB.cvsrc\fR
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
cvs -z6

.PD
.IP "" 0
.SP
causes \fBcvs\fR to use compression level 6.
.SP
.SH "Global options"
.IX "Options, global"
.IX "Global options"
.IX "Left-hand options"
.SP
The available \fBcvs_options\fR (that are given to the

.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB--allow-root=\fIrootdir\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Specify legal \fBcvsroot\fR directory.  See
`Password authentication server\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
.IX "Authentication, stream"
.IX "Stream authentication"
.IP "" 0
\fB-a\fR
.IP "" 2
Authenticate all communication between the client and
the server.  Only has an effect on the \fBcvs\fR client.
As of this writing, this is only implemented when using
a GSSAPI connection (see node `GSSAPI authenticated\(aq in the CVS manual).
Authentication prevents certain sorts of attacks
involving hijacking the active \fBtcp\fR connection.
Enabling authentication does not enable encryption.
.SP
.IX "RCSBIN, overriding"
.IX "Overriding RCSBIN"
.IP "" 0
\fB-b \fIbindir\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
In \fBcvs\fR 1.9.18 and older, this specified that
\fBrcs\fR programs are in the \fIbindir\fR directory.
Current versions of \fBcvs\fR do not run \fBrcs\fR
programs; for compatibility this option is accepted,
but it does nothing.
.SP
.IX "TMPDIR, overriding"
.IX "Overriding TMPDIR"
.IP "" 0
\fB-T \fItempdir\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Use \fItempdir\fR as the directory where temporary files are
located.  Overrides the setting of the \fB$TMPDIR\fR environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.
(When running client/server, \fB-T\fR affects only the local process;
specifying \fB-T\fR for the client has no effect on the server and
vice versa.)
.SP
.IX "CVSROOT, overriding"
.IX "Overriding CVSROOT"
.IP "" 0
\fB-d \fIcvs_root_directory\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Use \fIcvs_root_directory\fR as the root directory
pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of
the \fB$CVSROOT\fR environment variable.  See `Repository\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
.IX "EDITOR, overriding"
.IX "Overriding EDITOR"
.IP "" 0
\fB-e \fIeditor\fB\fR

Use \fIeditor\fR to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
setting of the \fB$CVSEDITOR\fR and \fB$EDITOR\fR
environment variables.  For more information, see
`Committing your changes\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-f\fR
.IP "" 2
Do not read the \fB~/.cvsrc\fR file.  This
option is most often used because of the
non-orthogonality of the \fBcvs\fR option set.  For
example, the \fBcvs log\fR option \fB-N\fR (turn off
display of tag names) does not have a corresponding
option to turn the display on.  So if you have
\fB-N\fR in the \fB~/.cvsrc\fR entry for \fBlog\fR,
you may need to use \fB-f\fR to show the tag names.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-H\fR
.IP "" 2
.IP "" 0
\fB--help\fR
.IP "" 2
Display usage information about the specified \fBcvs_command\fR
(but do not actually execute the command).  If you don\(aqt specify
a command name, \fBcvs -H\fR displays overall help for
\fBcvs\fR, including a list of other help options.
.SP
.IX "Read-only mode"
.IP "" 0
\fB-n\fR
.IP "" 2
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the
\fBcvs_command\fR, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.
.SP
Note that \fBcvs\fR will not necessarily produce exactly
the same output as without \fB-n\fR.  In some cases
the output will be the same, but in other cases
\fBcvs\fR will skip some of the processing that would
have been required to produce the exact same output.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-Q\fR
.IP "" 2
Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
generate output for serious problems.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-q\fR

Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
suppressed.
.SP
.IX "Read-only files, and -r"
.IP "" 0
\fB-r\fR
.IP "" 2
Make new working files read-only.  Same effect
as if the \fB$CVSREAD\fR environment variable is set
(see node `Environment variables\(aq in the CVS manual).  The default is to
make working files writable, unless watches are on
(see node `Watches\(aq in the CVS manual).
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-s \fIvariable\fB=\fIvalue\fB\fR
.IP "" 2

.IP "" 0
\fB-w\fR
.IP "" 2
Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the
setting of the \fB$CVSREAD\fR environment variable.
Files are created read-write by default, unless \fB$CVSREAD\fR is
set or \fB-r\fR is given.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-x\fR
.IP "" 2
.IX "Encryption"
Encrypt all communication between the client and the
server.  Only has an effect on the \fBcvs\fR client.  As
of this writing, this is only implemented when using a
GSSAPI connection (see node `GSSAPI authenticated\(aq in the CVS manual) or a
Kerberos connection (see node `Kerberos authenticated\(aq in the CVS manual).
Enabling encryption implies that message traffic is
also authenticated.  Encryption support is not
available by default; it must be enabled using a
special configure option, \fB--enable-encryption\fR,
when you build \fBcvs\fR.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-z \fIgzip-level\fB\fR

.IX "Compression"
.IX "Gzip"
Set the compression level.
Valid levels are 1 (high speed, low compression) to
9 (low speed, high compression), or 0 to disable
compression (the default).
Only has an effect on the \fBcvs\fR client.
.SP
.SP
.SH "Common options"
.SS "Common command options"
.IX "Common options"
.IX "Right-hand options"
.SP
This section describes the \fBcommand_options\fR that
are available across several \fBcvs\fR commands.  These
options are always given to the right of
\fBcvs_command\fR. Not all
commands support all of these options; each option is
only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you
can almost always count on the same behavior of the
option as in other commands.  (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one \fBcvs\fR command to the other).
.SP
\fBThe \fBhistory\fB command is an exception; it supports
many options that conflict even with these standard options.\fR
.SP
.IX "Dates"
.IX "Time"
.IX "Specifying dates"
.IP "" 0
\fB-D \fIdate_spec\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Use the most recent revision no later than \fIdate_spec\fR.
\fIdate_spec\fR is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.
.SP
The specification is \fIsticky\fR when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working
file using \fB-D\fR, \fBcvs\fR records the date you specified, so that
further updates in the same directory will use the same date
(for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky tags\(aq in the CVS manual).
.SP
\fB-D\fR is available with the \fBannotate\fR, \fBcheckout\fR,
\fBdiff\fR, \fBexport\fR, \fBhistory\fR,
\fBrdiff\fR, \fBrtag\fR, and \fBupdate\fR commands.
(The \fBhistory\fR command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see node `history options\(aq in the CVS manual).
.SP
.IX "Timezone, in input"
.IX "Zone, time, in input"
A wide variety of date formats are supported by
\fBcvs\fR.  The most standard ones are ISO8601 (from the
International Standards Organization) and the Internet
e-mail standard (specified in RFC822 as amended by
RFC1123).
.SP
ISO8601 dates have many variants but a few examples
are:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 4
1972-09-24
.IP "" 4
1972-09-24 20:05

.PD
.IP "" 2
.SP
There are a lot more ISO8601 date formats, and \fBcvs\fR
accepts many of them, but you probably don\(aqt want to
hear the \fIwhole\fR long story :-).
.SP
In addition to the dates allowed in Internet e-mail
itself, \fBcvs\fR also allows some of the fields to be
omitted.  For example:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 4
24 Sep 1972 20:05
.IP "" 4
24 Sep

.PD
.IP "" 2
.SP
The date is interpreted as being in the
local timezone, unless a specific timezone is
specified.
.SP
These two date formats are preferred.  However,
\fBcvs\fR currently accepts a wide variety of other date
formats.  They are intentionally not documented here in
any detail, and future versions of \fBcvs\fR might not
accept all of them.
.SP
One such format is
\fB\fImonth\fB/\fIday\fB/\fIyear\fB\fR.  This may
confuse people who are accustomed to having the month
and day in the other order; \fB1/4/96\fR is January 4,
not April 1.
.SP
Remember to quote the argument to the \fB-D\fR
flag so that your shell doesn\(aqt interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the \fB-D\fR
flag can look like this:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 4

.PD
.IP "" 2
.SP
.IX "Forcing a tag match"
.IP "" 0
\fB-f\fR
.IP "" 2
When you specify a particular date or tag to \fBcvs\fR commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the \fB-f\fR option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used).
.SP
Note that even with \fB-f\fR, a tag that you specify
must exist (that is, in some file, not necessary in
every file).  This is so that \fBcvs\fR will continue to
give an error if you mistype a tag name.
.SP
\fB-f\fR is available with these commands:
\fBannotate\fR, \fBcheckout\fR, \fBexport\fR,
\fBrdiff\fR, \fBrtag\fR, and \fBupdate\fR.
.SP
\fBWARNING:  The \fBcommit\fB and \fBremove\fB
commands also have a
\fB-f\fB option, but it has a different behavior for
those commands.  See `commit options\(aq in the CVS manual, and
`Removing files\(aq in the CVS manual.\fR
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-k \fIkflag\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Alter the default processing of keywords.
See `Keyword substitution\(aq in the CVS manual, for the meaning of
\fIkflag\fR.  Your \fIkflag\fR specification is
\fIsticky\fR when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the \fBcheckout\fR or \fBupdate\fR commands,
\fBcvs\fR associates your selected \fIkflag\fR with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.
.SP
The \fB-k\fR option is available with the \fBadd\fR,
\fBcheckout\fR, \fBdiff\fR, \fBrdiff\fR, \fBimport\fR and
\fBupdate\fR commands.

Use the revision specified by the \fItag\fR argument instead of the
default \fIhead\fR revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the \fBtag\fR or \fBrtag\fR command, two special tags are
always available: \fBHEAD\fR refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and \fBBASE\fR refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.
.SP
The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with \fBcheckout\fR or \fBupdate\fR to make your own
copy of a file: \fBcvs\fR remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky tags\(aq in the CVS manual).
.SP
The tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as
described in `Tags\(aq in the CVS manual, or the name of a branch, as
described in `Branching and merging\(aq in the CVS manual.
When a command expects a specific revision,
the name of a branch is interpreted as the most recent
revision on that branch.
.SP
Specifying the \fB-q\fR global option along with the
\fB-r\fR command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the \fBrcs\fR file

The \fBadd\fR command is used to present new files

a new directory is created in the repository
immediately.  When used on a file, only the working

not made until the \fBcommit\fR command is used on
the newly added file. 
.SP
The \fBadd\fR command also resurrects files that

This is the \fBcvs\fR interface to assorted

On unix, if there is a group named \fBcvsadmin\fR,
only members of that group can run \fBcvs admin\fR
(except for the \fBcvs admin -k\fR command, which can
be run by anybody).  This group should exist on the

Associate the symbolic name \fIname\fR with the branch

\fIname\fR is already associated with another number.
If \fIrev\fR is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A \fIrev\fR consisting of a branch number
followed by a \fB.\fR stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A \fB:\fR with an empty
\fIrev\fR stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
\fBcvs admin -n\fIname\fB:\fR associates \fIname\fR with the
current latest revision of all the RCS files;
this contrasts with \fBcvs admin -n\fIname\fB:$\fR which
associates \fIname\fR with the revision numbers

If you delete different revisions than you planned,

Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that
\fBcvs\fR only stores the differences associated with going
from rev1 to rev2, not intermediate steps.  For
example, after \fB-o 1.3::1.5\fR one can retrieve
revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the differences to get
from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revision 1.4, or the
differences between 1.3 and 1.4.  Other examples:
\fB-o 1.3::1.4\fR and \fB-o 1.3::1.3\fR have no
effect, because there are no intermediate revisions to
remove.
.SP
.IP "" 2
\fB::\fIrev\fB\fR
.IP "" 4
Collapse revisions between the beginning of the branch
containing \fIrev\fR and \fIrev\fR itself.  The
branchpoint and \fIrev\fR are left intact.  For
example, \fB-o ::1.3.2.6\fR deletes revision 1.3.2.1,

Delete the revisions from \fIrev1\fR to \fIrev2\fR,

retrieve \fIrev1\fR or \fIrev2\fR or any of the

\fBcvs admin -oR_1_01:R_1_02 \&.\fR is rarely useful.
It means to delete revisions up to, and including, the
tag R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
\fIthe same\fR numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!  In most cases you want to
specify \fIrev1\fR::\fIrev2\fR instead.

Delete revisions from revision \fIrev\fR, including

.SP
None of the revisions to be deleted may have
branches or locks.
.SP
If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic
names, and one specifies one of the \fB::\fR syntaxes,
then \fBcvs\fR will give an error and not delete any
revisions.  If you really want to delete both the
symbolic names and the revisions, first delete the
symbolic names with \fBcvs tag -d\fR, then run
\fBcvs admin -o\fR.  If one specifies the
non-\fB::\fR syntaxes, then \fBcvs\fR will delete the
revisions but leave the symbolic names pointing to
nonexistent revisions.  This behavior is preserved for
compatibility with previous versions of \fBcvs\fR, but
because it isn\(aqt very useful, in the future it may
change to be like the \fB::\fR case.
.SP
Due to the way \fBcvs\fR handles branches \fIrev\fR
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
See `Magic branch numbers\(aq in the CVS manual for an explanation.
.SP
Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see node `Merging two revisions\(aq in the CVS manual).

revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for \fIstate\fR.  A useful set of states is
\fBExp\fR (for experimental), \fBStab\fR (for
stable), and \fBRel\fR (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to \fBExp\fR when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
\fIcvs log\fR (see node `log\(aq in the CVS manual), and in the
\fB$\fP\fPLog$\fR and \fB$\fP\fPState$\fR keywords
(see node `Keyword substitution\(aq in the CVS manual).  Note that \fBcvs\fR
uses the \fBdead\fR state for its own purposes (see node `Attic\(aq in the CVS manual); to
take a file to or from the \fBdead\fR state use
commands like \fBcvs remove\fR and \fBcvs add\fR

.SP
Create or update a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by \fImodules\fR.  You must execute
\fBcheckout\fR before using most of the other \fBcvs\fR
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.
.SP
The \fImodules\fR are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the \fBmodules\fR file.
See `modules\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
Depending on the modules you specify, \fBcheckout\fR may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.
.SP
Note that \fBcheckout\fR is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where \fBcheckout\fR is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
\fBcheckout\fR will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the \fB-Q\fR global option).
.SP
The files created by \fBcheckout\fR are created
read-write, unless the \fB-r\fR option to \fBcvs\fR
(see node `Global options\(aq in the CVS manual) is specified, the
\fBCVSREAD\fR environment variable is specified
(see node `Environment variables\(aq in the CVS manual), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see node `Watches\(aq in the CVS manual).
.SP
Note that running \fBcheckout\fR on a directory that was already
built by a prior \fBcheckout\fR is also permitted.
This is similar to specifying the \fB-d\fR option
to the \fBupdate\fR command in the sense that new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.
However, \fBcheckout\fR takes a module name whereas
\fBupdate\fR takes a directory name.  Also
to use \fBcheckout\fR this way it must be run from the
top level directory (where you originally ran
\fBcheckout\fR from), so before you run
\fBcheckout\fR to update an existing directory, don\(aqt
forget to change your directory to the top level
directory.

Create a directory called \fIdir\fR for the working

command without the \fB-d\fR flag.
.SP
There is an important exception, however.  It is very
convenient when checking out a single item to have the
output appear in a directory that doesn\(aqt contain empty
intermediate directories.  In this case \fIonly\fR,
\fBcvs\fR tries to \`\`shorten\(aq\(aq pathnames to avoid those empty
directories.
.SP
For example, given a module \fBfoo\fR that contains
the file \fBbar.c\fR, the command \fBcvs co -d dir
foo\fR will create directory \fBdir\fR and place
\fBbar.c\fR inside.  Similarly, given a module
\fBbar\fR which has subdirectory \fBbaz\fR wherein
there is a file \fBquux.c\fR, the command \fBcvs co
-d dir bar/baz\fR will create directory \fBdir\fR and
place \fBquux.c\fR inside.
.SP
Using the \fB-N\fR flag will defeat this behavior.
Given the same module definitions above, \fBcvs co
-N -d dir foo\fR will create directories \fBdir/foo\fR

the revision specified with the second \fBj\fR option,
into the working directory.
.SP
With one \fB-j\fR option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
\fB-j\fR option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the \fB-j\fR option.
.SP
In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
\fB-j\fISymbolic_Tag\fB:\fIDate_Specifier\fB\fR.

Use \fBcommit\fR when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source
repository.
.SP
If you don\(aqt specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  \fBcommit\fR is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
\fB-R\fR option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the \fB-l\fR option to limit \fBcommit\fR to the
current directory only.
.SP
\fBcommit\fR verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with \fBupdate\fR (see node `update\(aq in the CVS manual).
\fBcommit\fR does not call the \fBupdate\fR command
for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the
time is right.
.SP
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see node `modules\(aq in the CVS manual, and see node `loginfo\(aq in the CVS manual)
and placed in the \fBrcs\fR file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
\fBlog\fR command; see node `log\(aq in the CVS manual.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the \fB-m
\fImessage\fB\fR option, and thus avoid the editor invocation,
or use the \fB-F \fIfile\fB\fR option to specify
that the argument file contains the log message.
.SP

.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-r \fIrevision\fB\fR
.IP "" 2
Commit to \fIrevision\fR.  \fIrevision\fR must be
either a branch, or a revision on the main trunk that
is higher than any existing revision number
(see node `Assigning revisions\(aq in the CVS manual).  You
cannot commit to a specific revision on a branch.
.SP
\fBcommit\fR also supports these options:
.SP
.IP "" 0

the \fB-f\fR option as defined in `Common options\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
Force \fBcvs\fR to commit a new revision even if you haven\(aqt
made any changes to the file.  If the current revision
of \fIfile\fR is 1.7, then the following two commands
are equivalent:
.SP

.IP "" 4
$ cvs commit -f \fIfile\fR
.IP "" 4

.SP
The \fB-f\fR option disables recursion (i.e., it
implies \fB-l\fR).  To force \fBcvs\fR to commit a new
revision for all files in all subdirectories, you must
use \fB-f -R\fR.
.SP

.SH "commit examples"
.SP
.SS "Committing to a branch"
.SP
You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the \fB-r\fR option.  To
create a branch revision, use the \fB-b\fR option
of the \fBrtag\fR or \fBtag\fR commands
(see node `Branching and merging\(aq in the CVS manual).  Then, either \fBcheckout\fR or
\fBupdate\fR can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
\fBcommit\fR changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module

.SS "Creating the branch after editing"

Say you have been working on some extremely
experimental software, based on whatever revision you
happened to checkout last week.  If others in your
group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could
commit your change to a new branch.  Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of \fBcvs\fR conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
[[ hacked sources are present ]]

$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
.IP "" 2
$ cvs update -r EXPR1

.PD
.IP "" 0
.SP
The \fBupdate\fR command will make the \fB-r
EXPR1\fR option sticky on all files.  Note that your
changes to the files will never be removed by the
\fBupdate\fR command.  The \fBcommit\fR will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the
\fB-r\fR is sticky.  You could also do like this:
.SP
.PD 0
.SP
.IP "" 2
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
.IP "" 2
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
.IP "" 2
$ cvs commit -r EXPR1

.PD

but then, only those files that were changed by you
will have the \fB-r EXPR1\fR sticky flag.  If you hack
away, and commit without specifying the \fB-r EXPR1\fR
flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

The \fBprintf\fR conversion specification can be \fB%d\fR,
\fB%o\fR, \fB%x\fR, or \fB%X\fR, specifying decimal, octal,
lower case hexadecimal, or upper case hexadecimal output
respectively.  After the \fB%\fR the following options can appear in
sequence: a \fB-\fR specifying left-justification; an integer
specifying the minimum field width; and a period followed by an
optional integer specifying the minimum number of digits.
For example, \fB%5dN\fR prints the number of new lines in the group
in a field of width 5 characters, using the \fBprintf\fR format \fB"%5d"\fR.

Line formats control how each line taken from an input file is
output as part of a line group in if-then-else format.

For example, the following command outputs text with a one-column

\fBprintf\fR format \fB"%.5d"\fR.  see node `Line group formats\(aq in the CVS manual, for
more about printf conversion specifications.
.SP
.SP
The default line format is \fB%l\fR followed by a newline character.
.SP
If the input contains tab characters and it is important that they line
up on output, you should ensure that \fB%l\fR or \fB%L\fR in a line
format is just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding \fB%l\fR or
\fB%L\fR with a tab character), or you should use the \fB-t\fR or
\fB--expand-tabs\fR option.
.SP
Taken together, the line and line group formats let you specify many
different formats.  For example, the following command uses a format
similar to \fBdiff\fR\(aqs normal format.  You can tailor this command
to get fine control over \fBdiff\fR\(aqs output.

This command is a variant of \fBcheckout\fR; use it
when you want a copy of the source for module without
the \fBcvs\fR administrative directories.  For example, you
might use \fBexport\fR to prepare source for shipment
off-site.  This command requires that you specify a
date or tag (with \fB-D\fR or \fB-r\fR), so that you
can count on reproducing the source you ship to others
(and thus it always prunes empty directories).
.SP
One often would like to use \fB-kv\fR with \fBcvs
export\fR.  This causes any keywords to be
expanded such that an import done at some other site

\fB-kv\fR, one can no longer use the \fBident\fR

Use \fBimport\fR to incorporate an entire source
distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source
vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can
use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module
from the outside source.  See `Tracking sources\(aq in the CVS manual for
a discussion on this subject.
.SP
The \fIrepository\fR argument gives a directory name
(or a path to a directory) under the \fBcvs\fR root directory
for repositories; if the directory did not exist,
import creates it.
.SP
When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior
import), it will notify you of any files that conflict
in the two branches of development; use \fBcheckout
-j\fR to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.
.SP
If \fBcvs\fR decides a file should be ignored
(see node `cvsignore\(aq in the CVS manual), it does not import it and prints
\fBI \fR followed by the filename (see node `import output\(aq in the CVS manual for a
complete description of the output).
.SP
If the file \fB$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers\fR exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported.  See `Wrappers\(aq in the CVS manual.
.SP
The outside source is saved in a first-level
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.
.SP
At least three arguments are required.
\fIrepository\fR is needed to identify the collection
of source.  \fIvendortag\fR is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one \fIreleasetag\fR to uniquely identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute \fBimport\fR.  The
\fIreleasetag\fR should be new, not previously existing in the
repository file, and uniquely identify the imported release,
.SP
Note that \fBimport\fR does \fInot\fR change the
directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it
does not set up that directory as a \fBcvs\fR working
directory; if you want to work with the sources import
them first and then check them out into a different

This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
\fBcvs checkout\fR.  Since \fBcvs\fR doesn\(aqt lock files, it
isn\(aqt strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the \fBcvs\fR history
file (see node `history file\(aq in the CVS manual) that you\(aqve abandoned your

Use \fBcvs release\fR to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a \fBcvs\fR working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

This is useful for updating directories that were

but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you
deliberately avoided certain directories in the

\fBcvs\fR will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran \fBupdate\fR) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while \fBupdate\fR runs.

A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to \fIfile\fR with changes from the source
repository.  \fIfile\fR (the copy in your working
directory) is now the result of attempting to merge
the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
\fB.#\fIfile\fB.\fIrevision\fB\fR where \fIrevision\fR
is the revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
`Conflicts example\(aq in the CVS manual.
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with \fB.#\fR if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under \fBvms\fR, the file name starts with
\fB__\fR rather than \fB.#\fR.

\fIfile\fR is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for \fBcvs\fR to ignore (see the
description of the \fB-I\fR option, and
see node `cvsignore\(aq in the CVS manual).
