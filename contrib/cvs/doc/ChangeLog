	Martin Hamilton.

Tue Dec 23 18:04:09 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Sticky tags): Further cleanups.  Fix thinko
	(s/subsequent cvs update/& commands/).  Remove "vi driver.c" and
	commit from example (totally vestigial).  Reword start of
	paragraph on non-branch sticky tags, so that it better alludes
 	to branch sticky tags.  When introducing sticky tags, make it
	clear that even people who aren't trying to use sticky tags
	may need to know how to avoid them.  Restore comment about
	CVS/Tag files.
	(Accessing branches): Don't xref to merging here; that is a much
	more advanced topic and the "but see" wording didn't tell us what
	to see the xref about.

Tue Dec 23 14:39:08 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon

	* cvs.texinfo (Creating a branch): Rewritten.  Introduce with

 	rewrites to follow).
	Don't use "-v" in "cvs status" example.

			  and Jim Kingdon

	Cleanups related to recent separation of revisions from

	rewrite it and move it to "Branching and merging".
	(Branching and merging): Also rewrite merging intro.
	(Revision numbers): Don't go into detail about branch revision
	numbers here, just mention that they happen and refer to new
	node "Branches and revisions".

	inherits text from "Revision numbers".
	(Creating a branch): Refer to "Branches and revisions" now, not
	"Revision numbers".
	(Binary why): Rewrite sentence which refers to merging, so that
	it isn't specific to branch merging.
	(Branches motivation): Fix typo (select -> elect).  Add comment
	about what this node is accomplishing, in general.

Sun Dec 21 20:57:24 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon

	This is just moving text; related cleanups to follow.

	keep it all separate from revisions:
 	(Revisions): Renamed from "Revisions and branches".
	(Branching and merging): Renamed from "Merging".
	(Branches motivation, Creating a branch, Sticky tags, Magic branch
	numbers): these subnodes moved to "Branching and merging" from
	"Revisions".
	everywhere: Adjusted cross-references to cope with above.

Sun Dec 21 20:36:39 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon

	Note that this is just moving text, not changing it:

	* cvs.texinfo (GSSAPI authenticated, Kerberos authenticated):

Wed Oct 29 11:52:05 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	while ago.  Cleanups suggested by Stephen Gildea (CVSROOT/passwd
	has 2 or 3 fields; /user -> /usr; noone -> no one; in used -> in
	use).  Add comment about making compilers happy about rcsids.

	dead newphrase.  Add item about what it means if "expand" is omitted.

	* cvs.texinfo (Magic branch numbers): Change example branch number
	from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4; CVS assigns even branch numbers and I don't
	think vendor branches are very relevant to this example.

Wed Sep 17 17:21:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (admin options): Add comment about "cvs admin -b"

	* cvs.texinfo (Binary files): Reword the section on what you need

	syntax.

	* cvsclient.texi (Response intro): Add discussing of file updating
	responses and file update modifying responses.
	(Responses): Refer to this description rather than trying to
	describe it in each place.  The descriptions in each place were

	permissions on $CVSROOT also applies to its parent and so on up to

	* cvs.texinfo (Keyword substitution): Where it refers to RCS
	having a certain behavior, rewrite to not pass the buck like

	concept.  A few other minor edits.

	* RCSFILES: Add list of known newphrase extensions.

	The previous text documented a behavior which CVS no longer

	writing triggers and particularly performance issues.

	* cvs.texinfo (rtag options, tag options): Don't discuss what old

	* cvs.texinfo (Compatibility): Add comment about "D" lines in
	Entries.

	* cvs.texinfo (CVS commands, diff): Change "run diffs" to "show
	differences"; the former is jargon.
	(CVS commands): Don't refer to "rlog" in describing what log does.

	* Makefile.in (cvsclient.dvi cvsclient.aux): Run texi2dvi rather
	than (poorly) emulating it ourself.

	Fix overfull and underfull hboxes:
	* cvs.texinfo (What is CVS?): Add words "the newsgroup" before
	"comp.sources.unix".
	(Credits): Put list of people in @display.
	(Repository files): Put /usr/local/cvsroot in @example.
	(Connecting via rsh): Change "anklet" to "toe" in example.
	(Kerberos authenticated, Password authentication client, Password
	authentication server): Change "brickyard" to "yard" in example.
	(Read-only access): Use @example and refer to files with a shorter
	pathname.
	(Server temporary directory): Use @example for pathname.
	(Watches Compatibility): Add phony line break.
	(Revision numbers): Remove revision 1.2.2.2 and tighten up the
	spacing for "the main trunk".
	(Tags, Creating a branch): Change /usr/local/cvsroot to /u/cvsroot.
	(Merging more than once): Tighten up spacing for "the main trunk".
	(Recursive behavior): Put long command in @example.

	(Example): Change line breaks in example log message.
	(Example): Change /home/kingdon/testing/cvsroot to /u/cvsroot.

	* cvs.texinfo (Credits): Don't refer to appendix A and B, they
	have been renumbered.  Reword so that it works whether the text in
	question has since been rewritten or not.

	* cvs.texinfo (BUGS): Rewrite to reflect the many different ways
	that one might want to handle bugs.  Move information on Signum
	and Cyclic from Preface to here.  Remove information on known
	deficiencies in the manual (some of them I'm not sure were really
	things in need of improvement; others were too general to be
	useful).  For the most part FIXME comments are probably better for
	this.  Remove "Linkoping, October 1993, Per Cederqvist"--many
	parts of the manual are now from other people, dates, and places.
	(What is CVS): For the most part, just refer to BUGS concerning
	bug-cvs.  Also tell people how to subscribe to bug-cvs.
	(Credits): Say that list is not comprehensive and refer to
	ChangeLog.

Mon Apr 28 11:12:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Removing files): Use "*.c" not "?.c" in example;
	the former should be good for both unix and DOS-like operating
	systems.  Document -f option.  Refer to Invoking CVS for a full
	list of options.  Add a few comments.

	* cvs.texinfo (Invoking CVS): For checkout and update, call them
	"sticky options" not "sticky kopts".

	vs. checkout.

Sun Apr 27 16:17:06 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	is force and -F file gets the message from a log file).  We had
	partly made this change on 9 Feb 1997, but some places got missed.

	* RCSFILES: Add discussion of the common concern regarding
	applying deltas to get to a branch head.

	* DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG: New file.

	update" is another way to display file status.
	(update examples): Removed; it had contained the "cvs -n -q
	update" material.
	(Invoking CVS): xref to "File status" and "Tags", not "status" and
	"status options".
	(status, status options): Removed.

	with Entries.Log in more detail.

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): Say "CVS 1.9 and earlier" rather
	than "pre version 1.10".  The latter increases confusion by
	referring to a version which doesn't exist yet.

Mon Apr 21 01:02:53 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): Document Rcs-diff.  Indicate that

	* cvs.texinfo (Working directory storage): Add note about format
	of timestamp and the "Result of merge" concept.

Sat Apr 19 13:42:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): It is OK for Copy-file to implement
	a rename instead of a copy.

Fri Apr 18 12:05:48 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Assigning revisions): Say that -r implies -f.

Thu Apr 17 16:34:14 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (From other version control systems): Add comment
	about CMZ and PATCHY.

	notifications right away.

	future expansion situations.  Specify the format of the time.

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Clarify that arguments to co, rdiff,
	and rtag are module names (and how that differs from file/directory
	names).

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): Say that servers need to create
	directories one at a time.

Sat Apr 12 09:32:58 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Committing your changes): Say that editor default
	is notepad (not vi) for Windows NT/95.  Be more clear about what

	Add xrefs to that node.

Thu Apr 10 15:48:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	merges.

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Add discussion of when to send
	Is-modified.

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Sending Is-modified is enough to
	prevent the file from being considered "lost".

Sun Mar 30 00:31:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Add Is-modified request.  Clarify
	order of Entry relative to Unchanged or Is-modified (might as well
	specify the same thing vis-a-vis Modified while we are at it).

Sat Mar 29 12:32:40 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi: Change "newline" to "linefeed".  Most of the
	document already reads "linefeed" and that is what is intended.

	(Goals, Filenames, File transmissions, new node Strings): Add
	discussion of character sets and what we expect from the transport

Fri Mar 28 13:59:59 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Make it clear that there is no
	guarantee that one will get Clear-sticky instead of another
	response.  Also clarify that clients will tend to store the
	repository in a long-term way.

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Further clarify Directory example.

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Add example and further explanation
	of what expand-modules is for.

	* cvs.texinfo (history database): Add comment about various
	problems with the history file.

	Assigning revisions not commit options.

	* cvs.texinfo (Outside): Comment out sentence which incorrectly
	stated that "cvs add" can operate on "foo/bar.c".

	entry.
	(BUGS): Very briefly mention reporting bugs in CVS.

	example.

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): Discuss meaning of tagspec and

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): Revise meaning of "Case" per change
	to CVS.

Tue Mar 18 15:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	The following reorganization hopefully presents numeric revisions
	in a slightly more coherent fashion.  The only new material is the
	paragraph about assigning revisions for added files.
	* cvs.texinfo (A sample session): Bring in a sentence from Basic
	concepts node, defining a repository.
	(Revisions and branches): Renamed from Branches (it has always
	covered non-branch tags too).  Bring in nodes "Revision numbers" and
	"Versions revisions releases" from Basic concepts, the former in
	particular was way too detailed for an intro section.
	(A sample session): Add comment about how we need an introduction
	and what might go into one.  Also bring in the paragraph from
	Basic concepts introducing modules, but comment it out.
	(Viewing differences): Add comment about 
	(Basic concepts): Removed; its content has been farmed out as
	described above, and as the comment said, it was fundamentally
	flawed.
	(Assigning revisions): New node.  Incorporates the "New major
	release number" subsubsec which was in "commit examples".  Add
	paragraph concerning how CVS assigns revisions on added files.
	(commit options): Refer to that node under -r.
	(Invoking CVS): Add comment about text for -r.

Tue Mar 18 13:04:30 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: (install-info): Depend on installdirs.

Sun Mar 16 12:37:12 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (File permissions): CVSUMASK now works for RCS
	files; but it is (still) awkward for client/server CVS.

Sat Mar 15 17:41:12 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Magic branch numbers): Add comment about where this
	should go.

Thu Mar 13 09:11:36 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Credits): Fix grammatical mistake ("manual about"
	-> "manual is about").  Reported by Philippe De Muyter.

Sun Mar  9 09:06:40 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (File permissions): Add comment about val-tags and
	CVSUMASK.

Sun Mar  2 12:33:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (From scratch): Add comment about creating
	directories with add rather than import.

	* cvs.texinfo (Creating a repository): Add comment about how this
	somewhat duplicates Server requirements.

	* cvs.texinfo (Connecting via rsh): Add comment about rsh
	vs. remsh.  Also wording fix ("incorrect" -> "inapplicable").

	* cvs.texinfo (Outside): Add comment about renames and annotate.

	* cvs.texinfo (Server requirements): New node.

Thu Feb 27 15:20:49 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Multiple developers): Reword section on "cvs admin
	-l".  As nearly as I can tell based on when it came up on info-cvs
	and other contexts, people who are into reserved checkouts
	generally find that cvs admin -l is OK.  Add a bunch more notes
	(inside @ignore) about reserved checkout implementation ideas.

Sun Feb 23 16:12:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Add various additional comments
	about date formats.

	* RCSFILES: Remove diff for Id and explain it in words instead.
	The previous values for Id had been clobbered by keyword expansion
	on the RCSFILES file itself.

Sat Feb 22 14:16:28 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Fix typo (missing backslash).

Fri Feb 21 23:08:38 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* RCSFILES: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add RCSFILES.

20 Feb 1997  Lenny Foner  <foner@media.mit.edu>

	* cvs.texinfo (Checklist): Fix typo ("keword" -> "keyword").

Thu Feb 20 21:57:05 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Keeping a checked out copy): Add "web" to index.

Wed Feb 12 18:44:16 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Password authentication client, Invoking CVS):
	Document "cvs logout" command.

Tue Feb 11 20:42:45 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (commit options): Document that the -f option to
	commit disables recursion.

Sun Feb  9 13:58:59 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (diff options): Document all the options we pass
	through to diff.  Remove paragraph about -D sometimes meaning
	--ifdef since that is no longer true.

	* cvs.texinfo (Multiple developers): Add lengthy comment about
	reserved checkout design issues.

	* cvs.texinfo (Wrappers): Add paragraph about timestamps.

	* cvs.texinfo (commit options): Don't try to document what CVS 1.3
	does with -f and how recent versions differ: 1.3 is pretty old
	anyway, we generally only try to document the current version, and
	the way it was described here was pretty confusing.
	(Environment variables): Likewise for CVSEDITOR.

	* cvs.texinfo (import output): Add index entries for symbolic
	links.  Add brief mention of whether behavior should be
	different.  Add comments on other symbolic link issues.

Wed Feb  5 13:02:37 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Concurrency): Add comment about commit/commit
	atomicity.

Mon Feb  3 10:55:41 1997  joel boutros <nihilis@moral.addiction.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Connecting via rsh): Fix typo (programs -> problems).

Fri Jan 31 12:18:47 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Connection and Authentication): Correct typo
	(``sent'' for ``send''), and rewrite sentence for clarity.

Fri Jan 24 10:31:57 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (File status): Change "Unresolved Conflict" to "File
	had conflicts on merge" per change to CVS.

Sun Jan 19 16:21:17 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (admin): Add comments about "group" and "compiled in
	value".  At least one info-cvs poster was confused by this.

Thu Jan 16 17:54:51 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Wrappers): It is just -t/-f which doesn't work
	client/server.  -k *does* (well, except for the problem with
	import noted in BUGS).  -m I don't know and I doubt anyone cares.

Mon Jan 13 15:41:02 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

	* cvs.texinfo (Read-only access): rephrase to imply that there may
        be other administrative files, besides history and locks, which
        read-only users can also affect (in the future, for example, the
        `passwd' file).

Wed Jan  8 14:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove CVSid; we decided to get rid
	of these some time ago.

Wed Jan  8 09:08:36 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Connection and Authentication): Document
	restriction that cvs root sent in the cvs protocol and in the
	pserver authentication protocol must be identical.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, cvs.texinfo: Remove "675" paragraph;
	see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Thu Jan  2 09:34:51 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

        * cvs.texinfo (Read-only access): new node.
        (Repository): new menu item for above new node.
        (Password authentication server): document the user-aliasing
        feature.  Why was this undocumented before?

Wed Jan  1 18:12:11 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Conflicts example): Use @asis in example to prevent
	starting a line with a conflict marker.  This means that when
	maintaining the file with CVS itself, CVS will not think there is
	a conflict merely because of the conflict marker in the example.
	IMHO, this is totally bogus and CVS needs a better way of figuring
	out whether a conflict is resolved (see comments elsewhere in this
	node), but until then....  Credit to Fred Fish for reporting the
	problem.

	* cvs.texinfo (cvsignore): Add paragraph about how .cvsignore
	files in the sources being imported by "cvs import" override
	"-I !".  Credit goes to Fred Fish for pointing out this problem.

Thu Dec 19 12:36:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Credits): Update Roland Pesch email address per his
	request.

Tue Dec 17 12:57:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (verifymsg): In example, remove text "and reedit if
	necessary"; it was copied from editinfo and doesn't apply here.
	Fix syntax of if statement; remove unnecessary attempt at loop;
	don't use -n with echo.  Add @appendixsec at start of node.
	Add note about how verifymsg cannot change log message.
	(editinfo): In paragraph saying editinfo is obsolete, fix various
	typos and formatting glitches.  Mention -e as well as EDITOR.
	(editinfo): In saying that editinfo doesn't get consulted with -m,
	-F or client/server, recommend verifymsg.  Remove comment which
	says, in effect, "we need a feature like verifymsg".
	(editinfo example): Change "verifymsg" back to "editinfo" here;
	the example is of editinfo not verifymsg.

Tue Dec 17 12:45:32 1996  Abe Feldman  <feldman@cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (verifymsg): New node.
	various places: Say that editinfo is obsolete, or refer to
	verifymsg instead of editinfo

Wed Dec 11 08:55:26 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Compatibility): Add comment about 1.3 and file death.

	* cvs.texinfo (update output, release output): Document "P" as
	well as "U".

Tue Dec 10 16:23:40 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Builds): Change "make" to "implement" and "build";
	in this context "make" is ambiguous.
	(Builds): Add new URL of mk web page.

Mon Dec  9 11:03:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Password authentication client, Environment
	variables): Remove mention of CVS_PASSWORD.

Sun Dec  8 22:38:34 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Repository files): Mention differences between RCS
	files in RCS and in CVS.
	(Tags): Tag names must start with a letter.

Fri Dec  6 09:08:18 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (syntax): Expand discussion of regular expression
	syntax.

Fri Nov 29 09:06:41 1996  fnf@ninemoons.com (Fred Fish)
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo, cvsclient.texi: Make sure @ref and friends are
	followed by "," or "." as described in the texinfo manual.  This
	is a dubious practice as texi2html and texinfo.tex don't require
	it, and makeinfo could insert them as needed, but since makeinfo
	doesn't do that yet, cope.

	* cvs.texinfo (From files): Suggest "diff -r" rather than "ls -R"
	as the way to see that the sources seem to have been imported
	correctly.
	(Common options): -k is also available with import.
	(admin options): Fix typo ("interrested" -> "interested").

Mon Nov 25 10:03:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Add comments about two digit
	years, year 2000, and ambiguous/nonexistent dates.

Sun Nov 24 17:27:24 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (First import): Don't say what the wdiff program we
	are using as an example does--that is confusing.  Also don't show
	untarring it--people might be familiar with cpio, ZIP, VMS BACKUP,
	etc., instead of tar.

	* cvs.texinfo (Adding files): Update comment about "cvs add -m".

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Remove -H; -H is not a command
	option.
	(Global options): Also list --help and --version.  Don't say that
	-H gives a list of commands; it doesn't any more (directly).

	* cvs.texinfo: Add comment pointing to paper size web page.

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Rewrite section on date formats.
	Executive summary is that RFC822 and ISO8601 are now preferred.

Wed Nov 20 08:39:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Getting Notified): Add paragraph clarifying that
	watches happen per user, not per working directory.

Tue Nov 19 09:39:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Tags): Suggest that future special tag names might
	start with ".".  Fix typo.

	* cvs.texinfo (Removing directories): -P is also available with
	export.
	(Moving directories): Rewrite first paragraph; now says that you
	must use -P for the directory to disappear from working
	directories.  Thanks to Martin Lorentzon
	<Martin.Lorentzson@emw.ericsson.se> for reporting this bug.
	(various): Where we mention -P, point to Removing directories
	node.

Sat Nov 16 18:03:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Example): Rewrite to actually be based on a real
	live example (and therefore reflect the way the protocol currently
	works).  Add comment about formatting of the document itself.

Thu Nov 14 10:22:58 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Introduction): Use @ref, not @xref, after "see".
	(Goals): Rewrite items about locking, about uploading in big
	chunks, and about atomicity to be focused more on the protocol
	than the current implementation.
	(Notes): Remove this node.  The attempt to describe the basic
	model has pretty much been replaced by the Introduction.  
	The material about how to start the client is incomplete and
	better left to cvs.texinfo.  And the item about the lack of
	SERVER_FLOWCONTROL is obsolete now that SERVER_FLOWCONTROL is the
	default.
	(Protocol Notes): Add comment about multisite features.
	(Requirements): Use @code for requests and responses.

	* cvs.texinfo (Remote repositories): Add a few sentences defining
	"client" and "server"; before we had been using the terms without
	defining them.

	* cvs.texinfo (What is CVS?): Add paragraph about reporting bugs.
	Reword and expand comp.software.config-mgmt description (and add
	comments about other newsgroup facts).  Point people at GNU list
	of FTP sites rather than directly at prep.ai.mit.edu.

Wed Nov  6 09:45:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Tracking sources): Add comment regarding added and
	removed files.

Tue Nov  5 14:00:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo: Rename node "Invoking CVS" to "CVS commands".
	Rewrite the intro and comments to reflect addition of the new
	Invoking CVS.
	(Invoking CVS): New node, a quick summary of each command.
	(annotate): Don't list the options; refer to Invoking CVS and
	Common options instead.

Sun Nov  3 21:22:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Compatibility): New node, moved from ../README.

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Add comment about how tar manual
	contains documentation for getdate date formats.

Fri Nov  1 14:00:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (commit examples): Rewrite "New major release
	number" section to tighten up the wording, better motivate the
	discussion, and replace the term "rcs revision number" with
	"numeric revision".

Fri Oct 25 07:49:21 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (loginfo): Don't say "a la printf"; the syntax is
	only vaguely similar to printf.

	* cvs.texinfo (loginfo): To get just the repository name, suggest
	%{} instead of % "standing alone"; the latter is now an error.

Tue Oct 22 13:08:54 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* cvs.texinfo (loginfo): add information on the new loginfo format
 	string specification.

Mon Oct 21 17:33:44 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Builds): New node.
	(What is CVS?): Refer to it.

Sat Oct 19 14:32:21 1996  Jim Meyering <meyering@asic.sc.ti.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Choosing a model): Wording/grammar fix.

Sat Oct 19 14:32:21 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsclient.texi (Obsolete): New node.
	(Requests): Remove Repository and Lost and adjust Directory,
	UseUnchanged, and other places accordingly.
	(Required): Directory and Unchanged are now required.

	* cvs.texinfo (Removing files): Don't talk about modules; they are
	not relevant in this context.
	(Removing directories): New node.
	(Common options): Refer to it instead of duplicating information.

Fri Oct 18 11:05:06 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (First import, import): Add paragraph about the fact
	that import doesn't modify the directory which it imports from.

	* cvs.texinfo (Creating a repository): Add paragraph about
	resource requirements.

	* cvs.texinfo (Copying): Replace empty node with a copy of the GPL.

Thu Oct 17 12:10:55 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Adding files): Revise comment to more accurately
	reflect the functioning/nonfunctioning status of cvs add -m.

	* cvs.texinfo (Reverting local changes): New node, somewhat based
	on the version of this node from 30 Sep 96 change.
	(admin options): Refer to it.

	* cvs.texinfo: Reinstate 30 Sep 96 change from A4 to US letter.

	* cvs.texinfo (Concurrency): When telling people how to clean up
	locks, tell them to make sure the locks are owned by the person
	who has the stale locks.
	(update output, release output): Remove text about how CVS doesn't
	print "? foo" for directories; CVS has since been changed (see
	conflicts-130 in sanity.sh).

Wed Oct 16 15:01:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (history options): Mention new option -x E.

Mon Oct 14 15:21:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Tags): Add paragraph on choosing a convention for
	naming tags.

Thu Oct 10 16:05:26 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (modules): Describe what & does.

Mon Oct  7 17:20:11 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Removing files): Correct apparent cut and paste
	error: refer to the removed file, not the added file.

Tue Oct  1 14:15:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo: Revert all recent changes (the last unscathed one
	is the CVSUMASK one from Sunday).  For the most part said changes
	are for new features which are not appropriate at this stage of
	the release process.  None of the changes being reverted need to
	go into 1.9, that is for sure.

Mon Sep 30 18:17:34 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Credits): add comment asking if we should update.
	Add more detail about printing Letter on A4.
	Add some comments about internal comments.
	(From files): describe "cvs import -b 1" for importing existing
	projects onto the main branch.
	(First import): add a couple of helpful hints about naming vendor
	and release tags, etc., and regularize the examples with this.
	(Tracking sources): noted some reasons why you might use vendor
	branches with "cvs import".
	(Update imports): mention using "update" in place of "checkout" if
	you have an existing working directory.
	(Binary files in imports): add sub-menu separator comment.
	(Tracking sources): new menu entry "Reverting to vendor release".
	(Reverting to vendor release): new node to describe reverting
	local changes and optionally using patch(1) to move local changes
	forward.
	(Global options): describe -D and -g, as well as DIFFBIN and
	GREPBIN.
	(export examples): add one.
	(import options): describe the effect of '-b 1'.
	
Mon Sep 30 08:09:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo: Adjust comments concerning A4 vs. US letter,
	referring to ../README.

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Add comment about dates which CVS
	uses in output.

Sun Sep 29 11:14:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Keyword list): Don't mention Name twice.

	* cvs.texinfo (File permissions): Expand CVSUMASK stuff a bit.
	(Setting a watch, Environment variables, Global options): Update
	index entries for "read-only files, and ...".

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): State that Gzip-stream is preferred
	to gzip-file-contents.  Cite RFC1952/1951 rather than just "gzip".
	Say that RFC1950/1951 compression is also known as "zlib".

Sat Sep 28 09:31:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Repository): Move all information about the
	internal structure of the repository to User modules node.  Rename
	it to "Repository storage" ("User modules" wasn't particularly
	clear).  Mention CVSUMASK.  Much clarification and
	reorganization.
	(Basic concepts): Remove material which duplicates what is now in
	Repository.  Rewrite paragraph introducing modules.

	* cvs.texinfo (Starting a new project): In discussing difficulty
	in renaming files, don't refer to "cvs 1.x"--there is no
	non-vaporous "cvs 2.x".  Reword to reflect that part of the reason
	to avoid renames (where possible) is not because of CVS at all, and
	to try to give a general impression of how bad CVS issues involved in
	renaming are.

Fri Sep 27 04:23:44 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Adding files): Talk about directories, not modules,
	since that is what is meant.  Suggest using -kb option to add
	rather than running cvs admin after the fact and xref to Binary
	files not admin examples.  Incorporate information which had been
	in "add" node (there was a lot of duplication).  Don't document
	use of "add" on a directory to take the place of "cvs update -d";
	the latter is simpler and more logical.
	(add, add options, add examples): Removed.
	(release output, release options): Update xrefs accordingly.
	(Adding files, Removing files): Mention the fact that adds and
	removes are branch-specific.
	(Merging adds and removals): New node.

	* cvs.texinfo (Concurrency): When mentioning RCS locks, use the
	term reserved checkouts and xref to the place where we discuss
	them in more depth.

Thu Sep 26 08:26:01 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (log): Add comments about timezones.
	(log, Common options): Add index entries for timezone and zone, time.

Wed Sep 25 11:05:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (log options): Add xref to where we describe the
	date formats that -d accepts.
	(Common options): Don't refer to date formats accepted by co(1);
	CVS's rules have never been the same.  Add long whiny comment
	about what a mess date formats are.

Tue Sep 24 11:49:02 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (From other version control systems): The RCS file
	must not be locked when you copy it to the CVS repository.

	* cvs.texinfo (Editing files): Also discuss how to revert in the
	non-watch case.  Add some index entries.

	* cvs.texinfo (update output): Add comment about how we *should*
	be handling .# files.  Mention fact that it is different under
	VMS.  Add .# to index.

Fri Sep 20 13:08:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Multiple developers): Revise text on reserved
	versus unreserved checkouts extensively.  Move index entries for
	"reserved checkouts" and "RCS-style locking" to here.  Add
	cross-reference to cvs admin -l.  Add new section "Choosing a
	model".
