This directory contains the virgin CVS source on the vendor branch.  Do
not under any circumstances commit new versions onto the mainline, new
versions or official-patch versions must be imported.

To prepare a new cvs dist for import, extract it into a fresh directory;

The following generated files were deleted:
doc/*.ps
doc/*.info*
doc/*.aux*
doc/CVSvn.texi
lib/getdate.c
cvsnt.*
cvs.spec
build.com
*/*.com
*/*.dsp
.cvsignore
*/.cvsignore
README.VMS

The following non-freebsd-specific directories were deleted:
os2
emx
windows-NT
vms
zlib

It is imported from it's top level directory something like this:
  cvs -n import src/contrib/cvs CYCLIC v<version>

The -n option is "dont do anything" so you can see what is about to happen
first.  Remove it when it looks ok.

The initial import was done with:
  cvs import src/contrib/cvs CYCLIC v1_8_1

When new versions are imported, cvs will give instructions on how to merge
the local and vendor changes when/if conflicts arise..

The developers can be reached at:  <devel-cvs@cyclic.com>.  Local changes
that are suitable for public consumption should be submitted for inclusion
in future releases.

Current local changes:
  - CVS_LOCAL_BRANCH_NUM environment variable support for choosing the
    magic branch number.  (for CVSup local-commit support)
  - CVSREADONLYFS environment variable and global option -R to enable
    no-locking readonly mode (eg: cvs repo is a cdrom or mirror)
  - the verify message script can edit the submitted log message.
  - CVSROOT/options file
  - Variable keyword expansion controls including custom keywords.
  - $ CVSHeader$ keyword - like Header, but with $CVSROOT stripped off.
