.Sh NAME
.Nm editrc
.Nd configuration file for editline library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file defines various settings to be used by the
.Xr editline 3
library.
.Pp
The format of each line is:
.Pp
.D1 Oo Ar prog Ns Ic \&: Oc Ns Ar command Oo Ar arg ... Oc
.Pp
.Ar command
is one of the
.Xr editline 3
builtin commands.
Refer to
.Sx BUILTIN COMMANDS
for more information.
.Pp
.Ar prog
is the program name string that a program defines when it calls
.Xr el_init 3
to set up
.Xr editline 3 ,
which is usually
.Va argv Ns Li [0] .
.Ar command
will be executed for any program which matches
.Ar prog .
.Pp
.Ar prog
may also be a
.Xr regex 3
style
regular expression, in which case
.Ar command
will be executed for any program that matches the regular expression.
.Pp
If
.Ar prog
is absent,
.Ar command
is executed for all programs.
.Sh BUILTIN COMMANDS
The
.Nm editline
library has some builtin commands, which affect the way
that the line editing and history functions operate.
These are based on similar named builtins present in the
.Xr tcsh 1
shell.
.Pp
The following builtin commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ic bind Oo Fl aeklrsv Oc Op Ar key Op Ar command
Without options and arguments, list all bound keys and macros, and
the editor command or input string to which each one is bound.
If only
.Ar key
is supplied, show the binding for that key or macro.
If
.Ar key command
is supplied, bind the editor
.Ar command
to that key or macro.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl a
List or change key bindings in the
.Xr vi 1
mode alternate (command mode) key map.
.It Fl e
Bind all keys to the standard
.Tn GNU
Emacs-like bindings.
.It Fl k
.Ar key
is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be one of
.Ic up ,
.Ic down ,
.Ic left
or
.Ic right .
.It Fl l
List all editor commands and a short description of each.
.It Fl r
Remove the binding of the key or macro
.Ar key .
.It Fl s
Define a keyboard macro rather than a key binding or command macro:
.Ar command
is taken as a literal string and appended to the input queue whenever
.Ar key
is typed.
Bound keys and macros in
.Ar command
are themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels of
interpretation.
.It Fl v
Bind all keys to the standard
.Xr vi 1 Ns -like
bindings.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr editline 7
manual documents all editor commands and contains more information
about macros and the input queue.
.Pp
.Ar key
and
.Ar command
can contain control characters of the form
.Sq Ic ^ Ns Ar character
.Po
e.g.\&
.Ql ^A
.Pc ,
and the following backslashed escape sequences:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width Ic
.It Ic \ea
Bell
.It Ic \eb
Backspace
.It Ic \ee
Escape
.It Ic \ef
Formfeed
.It Ic \en
Newline
.It Ic \er
Carriage return
.It Ic \et
Horizontal tab
.It Ic \ev
Vertical tab
.Sm off
.It Ic \e Ar nnn
.Sm on
The
.Tn ASCII
character corresponding to the octal number
.Ar nnn .
.El
.Pp
.Ql \e
nullifies the special meaning of the following character,
if it has any, notably
.Ql \e
and
.Ql ^ .
.It Ic echotc Oo Fl sv Oc Ar arg Ar ...
Exercise terminal capabilities given in
.Ar arg .
If
.Ar arg
is
.Ql baud ,
.Ql cols ,
.Ql lines ,
.Ql rows ,
.Ql meta ,
or
.Ql tabs ,
the value of that capability is printed, with
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
indicating that the terminal does or does not have that capability.
.Pp
.Fl s
returns an empty string for non-existent capabilities, rather than
causing an error.
.Fl v
causes messages to be verbose.
.It Ic edit Op Li on No | Li off
Enable or disable the
.Nm editline
functionality in a program.
.It Ic history Li list No | Li size Ar n No | Li unique Ar n
The
.Ql list
command lists all entries in the history.
The
.Ql size
command sets the history size to
.Ar n
entries.
The
.Ql unique
command controls if history should keep duplicate entries.
If
.Ar n
is non zero, only keep unique history entries.
If
.Ar n
is zero, then keep all entries (the default).
.It Ic settc Ar cap Ar val
Set the terminal capability
.Ar cap
to
.Ar val ,
as defined in
.Xr termcap 5 .
No sanity checking is done.
.It Ic setty Oo Fl a Oc Oo Fl d Oc Oo Fl q Oc Oo Fl x Oc Oo Ic \&+ Ns Ar mode Oc \
Oo Fl Ar mode Oc Oo Ar mode Oc Oo Ar char\| Ns Ic = Ns Ar c Oc
Control which tty modes that
.Nm
won't allow the user to change.
.Fl d ,
.Fl q
or
.Fl x
tells
.Ic setty
to act on the
.Sq edit ,
.Sq quote
or
.Sq execute
set of tty modes respectively; defaulting to
.Fl x .
.Pp
Without other arguments,
.Ic setty
lists the modes in the chosen set which are fixed on
.Po
.Ic + Ns Ar mode
.Pc
or off
.Po
.Fl Ns Ar mode
.Pc .
.Fl a
lists all tty modes in the chosen set regardless of the setting.
With
.Ic + Ns Ar mode ,
.Fl Ns Ar mode
or
.Ar mode ,
fixes
.Ar mode
on or off or removes control of
.Ar mode
in the chosen set.
.Pp
.Ic Setty
can also be used to set tty characters to particular values using
.Ar char\| Ns Ic = Ns Ar value .
If
.Ar value
is empty
then the character is set to
.Dv _POSIX_VDISABLE .
.It Ic telltc
List the values of all the terminal capabilities (see
.Xr termcap 5 ) .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ev
.It Ev EDITRC

.Xr editline 3
library.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa ~/.editrc
Last resort user configuration file for the
.Xr editline 3
library if no other file is specified.
