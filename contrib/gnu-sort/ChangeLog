2004-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.1.

	Sometimes, when source and destination partition are different,
	mv mistakenly fails to preserve a hard link.  Reported by IIDA Yosiaki.

	* src/copy.c: When moving a set of N hard-linked files between
	partitions, via two or more command line arguments where the
	command line argument containing the Nth link contains no other
	link to that same file, mv would mistakenly copy the file, rather
	than hard-linking it to the other(s).  That happens because when the
	final link is processed, its link count has been reduced to 1 since
	the other links have been `copied' to the destination partition
	and the source links have been removed.
	(copy_internal): When in move mode, use the source dev/inode
	pair to look up destination name even when st_nlink == 1.
	* src/cp-hash.c (src_to_dest_lookup): New function.
	* src/cp-hash.h (src_to_dest_lookup): Add prototype.
	* tests/mv/part-hardlink: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add part-hardlink.

	* announce-gen: Sync with autoconf.

	* tests/ls/time-1: Exit 77 (not 1) if we can't set up for the test.
	This was triggered on a Linux-2.2.19 system using a file system
	NFS-mounted from some sort of Sun.

2004-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

2004-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/deref-args: Also convert sizes in the 70-79 kB range,
	so that this test works with SELinux-enabled systems.
	Based on a patch from Tim Waugh.

	`join -1 x' would give a misleading diagnostic
	* src/join.c (string_to_join_field): Report that a non-numeric field
	number is invalid, rather than `so large that it is not representable'.
	* tests/join/Test.pm (invalid-j): New partial test for the above fix.

2004-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cp --sparse=always sparse-image-file.img /dev/hda1 could
	produce an invalid copy on the destination device.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Even with --sparse=always, try to
	make `holes' only if the destination is a regular file.
	Reported by Szakacsits Szabolcs.

2004-03-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't invoke set_cloexec_flag with
	a file descriptor of -1.

2004-03-02  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/nohup.c: Include "cloexec.h".
	(main): Set the copy of stderr to close on exec.

2004-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.ac: Include <signal.h> when checking for strsignal,
	sys_siglist, and friends.  Problem reported by Tony Leneis in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-02/msg00136.html>.

2004-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/deref-args, tests/du/exclude, tests/du/slash:
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Run envvar-check in case BLOCK_SIZE
	etc. are set.

2004-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Document how chown's USER.GROUP argument is now parsed.

2004-02-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/seq.c (usage): Remove stray space after \n in --help output.

2004-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (usage): Separate -H and --si.  Say that the meaning
	of -H will soon change to that of --dereference-args (-D).

2004-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/comm.c (usage): Tell what comm does when there are no options.
	Reword in terms of FILE1 and FILE2 rather than `left file' and
	`right file'.  Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2004-02-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-conformance bugs in expr.

	* NEWS: document the following changes to src/expr.c.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (expr invocation): Likewise.
	Document what forms integers may take, and say "integer"
	consistently instead of "number".  Warn about operands
	that "expr" can misinterpret, and how to work around the
	problem.
	* src/expr.c (eval, eval7, eval6, eval5, eval4, eval3, eval2, eval1):
	Accept a bool argument specifying whether to evaluate the
	expression.  This is to allow short-circuit evaluation.  All
	callers changed.
	(null): Report that a string is zero even if it has
	a form like "-0" or "00".
	(eval1, eval): Use short-circuit evaluation for | and &.
	(eval): Return 0 if both arguments are null or zero, instead
	of returning the first argument.
	* tests/expr/basic: Add some tests for the above.

2004-02-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.0.

	`make check' from a build inside a chroot environment would fail
	* tests/help-version: Specify an argument (`/') for df, in the
	unusual event that there is no valid entry in /etc/mtab.
	Likewise for id: add the -u option, so we don't get spurious
	failures when there are no user or group names.
	Patch by Tim Waugh.

	* src/sort.c (usage) [-u]: Add punctuation so that the description in
	the help2man-generated (line-joined) man page is more readable.
	Reported by Tim Waugh.
	[-T]: Add a semicolon, for the same reason.

2004-02-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Qualify target with $(srcdir)/ prefix.

2004-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am.in ($(srcdir)/Makefile.am): Use more portable
	$(srcdir)/../Makefile.am.in, rather than $<.
	Suggestion from Michael Elizabeth Chastain.

2004-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* config/install-sh: Make this script executable.
	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): New target, to ensure that config/install-sh
	is executable.  Otherwise, on systems that lack a suitable install
	binary, `make install' would fail, because of the way this script
	is invoked (without `$SHELL ' prefix).
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

2004-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.3.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Avoid triggering a bug in OSF/Tru64's sed
	that would cause an unwarranted test failure.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

2004-02-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove xstat function pointer member.  The way it was used was not
	portable, since some systems (OSF V5.1, Solaris 2.5.1) provide static
	inline `stat' and `lstat' functions, thus making the tests of
	`xstat == lstat' in copy.c always fail.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [xstat]: Remove member.
	(XSTAT): New macro.
	* src/copy.c (copy_dir): Set `.dereference' member, not .xstat.
	(copy_internal): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of `*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	Use `x->dereference == DEREF_NEVER' in place of `x->xstat == lstat'.
	(valid_options): Remove now-obsolete FIXME comments.

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of
	`*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	(do_copy): Declare/use local xstat rather than x->xstat.
	(main): Remove code that set x.xstat.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Don't initialize xstat member.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_ftp_host-alpha, etc.): Un-factor .gnu.org suffix,
	so that emit_upload_commands can use these variables, too.

2004-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Remove `du' stack space test.
	Apparently, `ulimit -s N' isn't portable enough.
	This test will be restored (with a guard against losing ulimit)
	in its own file later.

	* tests/rm/deep-1 (deep): Remove progress-style diagnostics,
	since this test doesn't take long enough to merit them.
	Run du on $tmp (the containing dir), not $deep, the full path to leaf.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Remove definition.
	Now, automake's gnupload handles this.
	(%.sig: %): Remove now-unused rule.
	(rel-files): Use automake's $(DIST_ARCHIVES), rather than
	`$(distdir).tar.bz2 $(distdir).tar.gz'.
	(emit-upload-commands): Adjust to use gnupload.

2004-02-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (ST_TIME_CMP_NS, ST_TIME_CMP): Remove definitions.
	(ATIME_CMP, CTIME_CMP, MTIME_CMP, TIMESPEC_NS): Likewise.
	Now, those are all defined in timespec.h.
	Include timespec.h.

	* src/date.c: Don't include timespec.h, now that system.h does it.

2004-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't dump core if localtime returns NULL (possible on
	hosts with 64-bit time_t and 32-bit int).
	* src/date.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(batch_convert, main):
	If time conversion fails, exit with nonzero status.
	(show_date): Return int to report conversion failure.
	Print the time as an int if localtime fails.
	* src/uptime.c: Print "??" if the current clock can't
	be converted by localtime.  This won't happen until the year
	2*31 + 1900, but we don't want to dump core even if the current
	clock has the wrong value.

	* src/stat.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(human_time): Print the date/time as a number of seconds since the
	epoch if it can't be converted by localtime.  This is better than
	just saying "invalid", and is consistent with what "ls" does.
	Don't dump core if the year has more than 48 digits; this isn't
	possible on any contemporary host, but we might as well do it right.

2004-01-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/stat.c (human_time): Accept time rather than
	pointer-to-const-time parameter, for clarity.  All callers changed.

2004-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): Remove extra trailing newline from
	default formats.  Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	Print actual fractional seconds in time stamps, not just `.00000000'.
	* src/stat.c (human_time): Add and use new parameter, t_ns.
	(print_stat): Update callers.
	* src/ls.c (TIMESPEC_NS): Remove definition.
	* src/system.h (TIMESPEC_NS): Define here, instead, now that stat.c
	also uses this macro.
	Nelson H. F. Beebe noticed that ls --full-time printed nonzero
	fractional seconds for files on an XFS file system, but that stat's
	fractional seconds were always zero.

2004-01-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Use 'double' for loop index, not
	'int', to avoid problems with integer overflow.  On almost all
	machines 'double' works in every case where 'int' works, and
	it works on other cases besides.

2004-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/seq.c (usage): Mention that if INCREMENT is omitted,
	it defaults to 1, even when FIRST is larger than LAST.
	Reword so as not to exclude the possibility that INCREMENT be zero.

2004-01-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.2.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Comment out definition.

2004-01-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (header_regexp): Add exitfail.

	* man/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add help2man.
	Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Prefix help2man invocation with `$(PERL) --'
	so it works on systems with Perl installed somewhere other than in
	/usr/bin.

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Declare local, chr, to be of type
	`int', not `char', since it must hold EOF.  This bug would make
	paste infloop on some systems.  Test failures reported by
	Nelson H. F. Beebe and Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rmdir/fail-perm: New file.  Test for just-fixed rmdir bug.
	* tests/rmdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-perm.

	* man/help2man: Fix it so using --info-page='coreutils PROG' works.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Invoke our own (tweaked) copy of help2man.
	Use --info-page='coreutils PROG' option.
	Now, readlink.1 refers the user to `info coreutils readlink'
	rather than to `info readlink'.  Reported by Matt Swift.

2004-01-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Exit status cleanup.

	* src/basename.c (usage): Use EXIT_SUCCESS, not 0, for clarity.
	* src/cat.c, src/chgrp.c, src/chmod.c, src/chown.c, src/chroot.c,
	* src/cksum.c, src/comm.c, src/cp.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c,

	* src/users.c, src/wc.c, src/who.c, src/whoami.c, src/yes.c: Likewise.

	* src/cat.c (usage): Don't bother normalizing exit status
	since the arg is already the correct exit status now.
	* src/cksum.c, src/comm.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c,
	* src/dircolors.c, src/expand.c, src/fmt.c, src/fold.c, src/head.c,
	* src/join.c, src/md5sum.c, src/nl.c, src/od.c, src/paste.c,
	* src/pr.c, src/split.c, src/sum.c, src/tac.c, src/tail.c, src/tr.c,
	* src/tsort.c, unexpand.c, src/src/uniq.c, src/src/wc.c: Likewise.

	* src/chown.c (main): Removed unused local 'fail'.

	* src/chroot.c (CHROOT_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, CHROOT_FAILURE):
	Remove.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Initialize exit_failure to EXIT_FAIL.
	* src/env.c, src/nice.c, src/su.c: Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main): Likewise, to NOHUP_FAILURE.
	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Likewise, to SETUIDGID_FAILURE.
	* src/expr.c (main): Use initialize_exit_failure rather than
	setting exit_failure directly; this optimizes away redundant
	assignments.
	* src/printenv.c, src/sort.c, src/test.c, src/tty.c: Likewise.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Exit with status 1 rather than 127
	if chroot itself fails, as per documentation.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Use EXIT_ENOENT and EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE
	rather than roll-your-own symbols or integers.
	* src/env.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/su.c (run_shell): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (exit_status): Remove static var....
	(main): Making it local here instead.  Use =, not |=, to set it.

	* src/cut.c (FATAL_ERROR, main): Exit with status EXIT_FAILURE,
	not 2, on errors.
	* src/date.c (batch_convert, main): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (dd_copy): Likewise.
	* src/pr.c (first_last_page, main, getoptarg): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (main): Don't assume EXIT_FAILURE == 1, as
	POSIX doesn't require it.
	* src/dd.c (write_output, skip, dd_copy): Likewise.
	* src/df.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/id.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (main): Likewise.

	by env proper.
	* src/hostname.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/nl.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/stty.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/expr.c (EXPR_FAILURE): Renamed from EXPR_ERROR, for
	consistency with the other programs' naming conventions.
	All uses changed.

	* src/factor.c (main): Do not report a usage error simply
	because stdin has bad numbers.

	* src/id.c (problems): Now a boolean int, not a counter,
	so that we don't have to worry about int overflow.  All uses changed.
	* src/touch.c (err): Likewise.

	* src/md5sum.c (main): Use int, not size_t, to store boolean int.

	* src/mkfifo.c (main): Exit with status 1, not 4, if not implemented.
	* src/mknod.c: Likewise.

	* src/nice.c (main): Exit with status EXIT_FAIL, not EXIT_FAILURE,
	on error; this is in case EXIT_FAILURE is unusual.
	* src/su.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE): Remove; all uses
	changed to EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE.

	* src/printenv.c (PRINTENV_FAILURE): New constant.
	(main): Exit with status PRINTENV_FAILURE, not EXIT_FAILURE, on
	command-line syntax problems.

	* src/rmdir.c (remove_parents): Don't set 'fail' to a negative number.
	(main): Avoid integer overflow when seeing whether errors occurred.

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Now returns void, not (zero) int.
	All callers changed.
	(main): Remove unused local variable 'errs'.  Always exit successfully
	if we reach the end.

	* src/setuidgid.c (SETUIDGID_FAILURE): Renamed from FAIL_STATUS,
	for consistency with other programs here.  All uses changed.
	(main): Use 'error' to exit rather than invoking 'exit' here.

	* src/sort.c: Don't include <assert.h>.
	(SORT_OUT_OF_ORDER,  SORT_FAILURE): Now enums, not macros.
	(usage): Don't use 'assert'.
	(main): Remove redundant assignment to exit_failure.

	* src/system.h (EXIT_FAIL, EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE, EXIT_ENOENT):
	New enum values.
	(initialize_exit_failure): New inline function.
	Include exitfail.h here, since we refer to exit_failure.
	All callers changed to not include exitfail.h.

	* src/tty.c (TTY_FAILURE, TTY_WRITE_ERROR): New enum values;
	substitute them for the corresponding integer constants.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_date): Remove, as
	'date' is now normal.
	(expected_failure_status_nohup): New var.

2004-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/relative: Remove `command' syntax.
	Thanks to Nelson H. F. Beebe and Paul Eggert.

	* tests/touch/relative: Test only year/month/day, not hours/min/sec,
	so as to avoid problems with systems using TAI clocks.
	Although it's no longer necessary, set TZ=UTC0 also for the
	initial touch command.  Reported by Paul Jarc here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/1504

2004-01-20  Diego Biurrun  <diego@biurrun.de>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add .mov to the list of media files.

2004-01-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/touch/relative: Use TZ=UTC0, not TZ=utc (which isn't
	portable).  Problem reported by Christian Krackowizer.  Also, use
	+0000 rather than +0 to specify a time zone, as the documentation
	requires four digits.

2004-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/hard-4: Run envvar-check in case SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX is set.
	* tests/mv/backup-is-src: Likewise.
	Problem reported by Peter Horst

2004-01-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Use .sig suffix, not .asc.

	* Version 5.1.1.

2003-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: touch -r and -d can now both be specified,
	with -r specifying the origin for -d.
	* src/touch.c (flexible_date): Remove static var.
	(get_reldate): New function.
	(main): Use it, to implement this new behavior.

2004-01-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/relative: New test for the above.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add relative.

2004-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Include contents of sys2.h.
	* src/sys2.h: Remove file.
	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Remove sys2.h.

	* Use automake-1.8.2.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* Update to gettext-0.13.1.
	* configure.ac: Use gettext-0.13.1.
	* .x-sc_space_tab: Add m4/po.m4 to the list of exceptions.

2004-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (%.sig): Use .sig suffix rather than .asc.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Ensure that cvsu works before using it.
	Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

	* src/tail.c (main): Warn about following stdin only when it's a tty.

	* configure.ac: Use gl_DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION.

2004-01-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/stat-fmt: Use backticks, not `$()' notation.

2004-01-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Quote underquoted `jm_DUMMY_1' to avoid new warning.

2004-01-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Use %lx, not %x format for `unsigned long'.
	From Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove `/vg' (prerelease test
	remnant) from PATH component.  That would cause tests in this directory
	not to run the just-built binaries, but rather whatever happened
	to be in one's PATH.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (new_control_record): Use x2nrealloc
	rather than xrealloc.

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Use ASSIGN_STRDUPA rather than
	alloca and strcpy.
	(make_path_private): Likewise.

2004-01-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c: Use `bool' (not int) as the type for a few
	global variables.
	(collapse_escapes): Rewrite to set globals rather than modifying
	its parameter.
	Use size_t (not int) for all counters and related index variables.
	(paste_parallel): Remove needless complexity of
	using xrealloc in the loop;  just allocate the buffers up front.
	Free the two temporary buffers.
	Move declarations of locals `down' into scope where used.
	(paste_serial): Remove `register' attributes.

	chroot failure, or chdir failure.
	Give a better diagnostic upon execvp failure.

	* src/du.c (usage): Mention that, with its current meaning,
	-H is deprecated.

	* src/tail.c (main): Warn about following stdin when it's a tty.

2003-12-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/join.c (add_field_list): Don't use alloca with unbounded

	Various other minor cleanups, mostly to avoid the need for casts.

	(extract_field): Renamed from ADD_FIELD, as it's now a function.

	(struct field.beg): Now char *, not unsigned char const *.  All

	on the join fields.  Suggestion from Bruce Robertson.

2003-11-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`od -c -w9999999' could segfault
	* src/od.c (dump): Use xnmalloc/free, not alloca.

2003-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use autoconf-2.59.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/du/hard-link: Minor tweak: use mkdir -p.

	Fix read-from-free'd-buffer error detected by valgrind.
	* src/csplit.c (remove_line): Don't return a pointer to data in
	a freed buffer.  Instead, arrange to free the buffer on the
	subsequent call.

2003-11-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (extract_dirs_from_files): Avoid useless copy operations.

	Use size_t, not unsigned, for field and byte counts.
	(hash_int): Use uintptr_t, not unsigned, for pointers converted
	to integers.  This squeezes more info out of them.
	(set_fields, cut_bytes, cut_fields, main):
	Use bool, not int, for booleans.
	(set_fields): Allocate zeroed byte array with xzalloc, not xcalloc.

2003-11-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* man/Makefile.am (check-programs-vs-x):
	Work even if $(programs) contains '$'.
	Work even if 'missing=1' in environment.
	Don't report an error simply because $(programs) outputs nothing.

2003-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chmod now uses fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is

2003-10-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chown and chgrp now accept POSIX-mandated -H, -L, -P options and
	use fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is specified.
	Before, they operated on full path names, and as such would
	encounter the PATH_MAX (often 4096) limit.
	They are more efficient.  For example, before, chgrp -R would
	take almost 5 seconds to change about 2000 directories and fail
	(with `File name too long'), while now it succeeds on a hierarchy
	of depth 20,000 in 1/10 the time.

	* src/chown.c: Include "userspec.h" and "fts_.h".

	Rewrite to iterate through hierarchies using fts rather than

	[struct Chown_option] (recurse, force_silent): Change type to `bool'.
	[struct Chown_option] (dereference): Remove member with ambiguous name.
	[struct Chown_option] (affect_symlink_referent): New member.
	(chown_files): New prototype.

	* tests/chgrp/recurse: Update tests accordingly.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: New tests for the above.
	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add posix-H.

	* src/ln.c (usage): Clarify that --directory, -d, -F probably won't
	work even for superuser.  Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2003-10-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some number-parsing bugs, e.g., "head -n 100k@" wasn't
	properly diagnosed.
	* lib/human.c, lib/xstrtoimax.c, lib/xstrtol.c, lib/xstrtol.h,
	lib/xstrtoul.c, lib/xstrtoumax.c: Sync with gnulib.
	* src/sort.c (parse_field_count): Handle the case where overflow
	and invalid suffix char are both reported.

2003-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches) [TIOCGWINSZ]: Comment out the
	warning-inducing test, ws.ws_col <= SIZE_MAX, since it was always
	true on Linux.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix to avoid a denial-of-service attack if the display width is
	enormous.  Also, clean up the code a bit by removing duplicate code.

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Remove forward decl; no longer needed.
	(calculate_columns): New function, that contains code that used
	to be common to print_many_per_line and print_horizontal.
	(print_many_per_line, print_horizontal): Use it.
	(decode_switches): Set max_idx here, not in calculate_columns.
	(print_current_files): Don't call init_column_info; calculate_columns
	now does that.
	(init_column_info): Don't allocate a lot more space than is needed
	to represent the current set of files.  Allocate all the new
	size_t cells in one call to xnmalloc, rather than a row at a time.

2003-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Add another FIXME comment.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix address-arithmetic bug in 'ls', reported by Georgi Guninski.
	Remove several arbitrary limits on hosts where int cannot represent
	all size_t values.

	* src/ls.c (struct bin_str.len, length_of_file_name_and_frills, indent,
	nfiles, files_index, tabsize, line_length, struct column_info.line_len,
	struct column_info.col_arr[0], max_idx):
	Now size_t, not int.
	(get_funky_string): Return bool indicating success, instead of
	a negative count to indicate failure.  Store number of columns
	through new parameter OUTPUT_COUNT; that way, they can never
	go negative.  Change equals_end from int to bool.  All uses
	changed.
	(struct column_info.valid_len): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(dired_dump_obstack, get_funky_string, clear_files,
	extract_dirs_from_files, print_current_files,
	print_many_per_line, print_horizontal, init_column_info,
	put_indicator, length_of_file_name_and_frills,
	print_with_commas): Use size_t, not int, for local variables
	that count sizes.
	(decode_switches): Decode sizes using xstrtoul, not xstrtol.
	Check for TIOCGWINSZ returing negative values (or values greater
	than SIZE_MAX!).
	(visit_dir, main, parse_ls_color, queue_directory, add_ignore_pattern,
	init_column_info):
	Use xmalloc and xnmalloc, not XMALLOC.
	(gobble_file): Use xnrealloc, not XREALLOC.
	(print_color_indicator): Remove now-unnecessary cast to size_t.

2003-10-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/no-x: Change wording of diagnostic to match latest du.c.
	* tests/sort/sort-tests: Remove from CVS; assume that people
	brave enough to check coreutils out from CVS can rebuild it.

2003-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	New options: --preserve-root and --no-preserve-root.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Honor new option.
	(change_file_mode): Strip trailing slashes on directory
	argument passed to change_dir_mode.
	(get_root_dev_ino): New function.
	(main): Initialize global, root_dev_ino.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't #ifdef-out simple uses of
	S_ISLNK or S_ISSOCK.  The S_IS* macros are guaranteed to be defined
	via system.h.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Likewise.

2003-10-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (main): Remove obsolete FIXME.

2003-10-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.8.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	csplit cleanup.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (csplit invocation):
	The regexp offset need not have a sign; POSIX requires support
	for signless offets.

	Be more careful about int widths.  For example, remove some
	arbitrary limits by replacing 'unsigned' with 'size_t',
	'uintmax_t', etc.  Use standard bool rather than a homegrown type.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add xstrtoimax.c.
	* src/csplit.c (FALSE, TRUE, boolean): Remove.  All uses changed
	to <stdbool.h> usage.
	(struct control): offset is now intmax_t, not int.
	repeat_forever is now bool, not int.
	(struct cstring): len is now size_t, not unsigned int.
	(struct buffer_record): bytes_alloc, bytes_used, num_lines are now
	size_t, not unsigned.  start_line, first_available are now
	uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(hold_count, control_used): Now size_t, not unsigned.
	(last_line_number, current_line, bytes_written):
	Now uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(save_to_hold_area, red_input, keep_new_line, record_line_starts,
	create_new_buffer, get_new_buffer, load_buffer, find_line,
	process_regexp, split_file, new_control_record, extract_regexp,
	get_format_width, get_format_prec, max_out):
	size args, locals, and returned values are now size_t, not unsigned
	or int.
	(get_first_line_in_buffer, find_line, write_to_file,
	handle_line_error, process_line_count, regexp_error, process_regexp,
	split_file):
	File line, byte, and repetition counts are now uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(check_for_offset): Don't require a sign before the offset.
	Use xstrtoimax to do the real work.
	(extract_regexp): Remove harmful cast of size to unsigned.
	256 -> 1<<CHAR_BIT, for clarity.
	(get_format_flags): Return at most 3, to avoid worries about overflow.

	(bytes_to_octal_digits): Remove.

	(cleanup): Don't check whether output_stream is NULL, since
	close_output_file does that for us.

	(new_line_control, create_new_buffer): Use "foo *p = xmalloc
	(sizeof *p);" instead of the more long-winded alternatives.

	(get_new_buffer): Use O(1) algorithm for resizing a buffer
	to a much larger size, instead of an O(N) algorithm.

	(process_regexp): Use plain NULL rather than casted 0.

	(make_filename): Use %u, not %d, to format unsigned file number.

	(new_control_record): Use xrealloc exclusively, since it handles
	NULL reliably.

	(extract_regexp): Change misspelled word in diagnostic.

	(get_format_width): Even if a minimum field width is specified,
	allow room for enough octal digits to represent the value of
	the maximum representible integer.  This fixes a potential
	buffer overrun.  Calculate this room at compile-time, not
	at run-time; this removes the need for bytes_to_octal_digits.
	Check for overflow; this removes a FIXME.

	(get_format_prec): Don't allow precision to be signed; it's
	not ANSI.  Check for overflow.  Remove hardcoded "11" as
	default precision; this fixes a potential buffer overrun
	on hosts with wider size_t.

	(get_format_conv_type): Change local variable to be of type
	unsigned char, not int; this removes a potential subscript
	violation on hosts where char is signed.

	(max_out): Replace "for (;*p;)" with more-standard "while (*p)".
	Allow "%%" in format.  Don't overflow when
	counting lots of percents.

	(usage): Default sprintf format is %02u, not %d.

2003-10-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Remove set-but-not-used local.

	Give better diagnostics for failed fts_open.

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Remove now-unused definition.

	Deprecate existing use of -H (aka --si).
	* src/du.c (enum) [HUMAN_SI_OPTION]: New member.
	[long_options]: Use HUMAN_SI_OPTION, not 'H'.
	(main): Warn that the meaning of -H will soon change to be
	POSIX compliant.

2003-10-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c: Accept --no-dereference (-P).

2003-10-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Adjust for slightly different output.

	Rewrite du.c to use fts.
	* src/du.c: Include "fts_.h", not ftw.h.
	(opt_dereference_arguments, arg_length, suffix_length): Remove globals.
	(IS_FTW_DIR_TYPE): Remove definition.
	(IS_DIR_TYPE): Define.
	(is_symlink_to_dir): Remove now-unnecessary function.
	(process_file, du_files): Rewrite to use fts.

	* tests/du/inaccessible-cwd: Ensure that even when run from an
	inaccessible directory, du can still operate on accessible
	directories elsewhere.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inaccessible-cwd.

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Ensure that du can process a hierarchy
	of depth 400 while using no more than 50KB of stack space.

2003-10-01  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* announce-gen (print_news_deltas): New function, extracted from main.
	(main): Make `news_file' an array.
	Use '...=s' => \@var for --news and --url-directory specs.
	Before there were a couple of portability problems.

2003-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_cast_of_alloca_return_value): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/copy.c: Remove unnecessary cast of alloca, since now it's
	guaranteed to be (void *).
	* src/cp.c: Likewise.
	* src/join.c: Likewise.
	* src/ln.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.
	* src/od.c: Likewise.
	* src/sys2.h (ASSIGN_STRDUPA): Likewise.

2003-09-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't exhaust virtual memory when processing large inputs.
	Fix this by removing csplit's internal free-list management;
	instead rely on malloc for that.

	* src/csplit.c (free_list): Remove global.
	(clear_all_line_control): Remove function.
	(get_new_buffer): Always use create_new_buffer to obtain a
	new buffer, rather than searching free_list.
	(free_buffer): Just call free.
	Reported by Nikola Milutinovic.

2003-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/rm.x: Also list `chattr' in SEE ALSO section.
	Suggestion from Mark Hubbart.

2003-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Don't invoke AC_AIX or AC_MINIX explicitly, now
	that we use gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS, since it AC_REQUIREs them.

	* Use autoconf-2.57d.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Minor efficiency tweak.
	* src/ln.c (PATH_BASENAME_CONCAT): Use memcpy rather than strcpy.
	(do_link): Likewise.

2003-09-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c (paste_serial): Save errno after input error,
	to report proper errno value.
	Based on a patch from Paul Eggert.

	* src/tee.c (tee): Adjust fwrite arguments so that the return
	value is the number of bytes written.

2003-09-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't assume ferror sets errno.  Bug reported by Bruno Haible.

	* src/comm.c (compare_files): Save errno after input error,
	to report proper errno value.
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (check_and_close, skip, read_char, read_block): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (unexpand): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (close_output_file): Don't report bogus errno value
	after ferror discovers an output error.  We don't know the proper
	errno value, since it might have been caused by any of a whole
	bunch of calls, and it might have been trashed in the meantime.
	Fixing this problem will require much more extensive changes;
	in the meantime just say "write error".
	* src/od.c (check_and_close, dump, dump_strings): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/join.c (get_line): Report error right away if I/O fails,
	so that the proper errno value is used.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable, tac_file, save_stdin): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (tee): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (skip): If a read fails, don't retry it later, so
	that we report the proper errno.

	* src/tac.c (tac_mem): Don't return a value; nobody uses it.

	* src/tee.c (tee): Once a write failure has occurred, don't bother
	writing anything more to that stream.

	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Check for ferror (stdout) even if
	ostream == stdout.

	* src/yes.c (UNROLL): Remove.
	(main): Exit immediately when write failure is detected.
	Simplify code by assigning to argv when argc == 1.

2003-09-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Switch encoding from Latin-1 to UTF-8.
	(WRITTEN_BY): Change "Franc,ois" (actually using
	c-with-cedilla in Latin-1) to "F.", so that it's ASCII, as
	xgettext requires.

2003-09-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`du -D symlink-to-dir' would mistakenly omit the slash in
	lines like this: 24	symlink-to-dir/subdir
	* src/du.c (process_file): Fix offset calculation.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #211591;
	http://bugs.debian.org/205251

	* tests/du/deref-args: New file/test for the above.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add deref-args.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Remove useless disjunct.

	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Rename parameter, Authors,
	to Written_by.
	* nearly all src/*.c files (WRITTEN_BY): Rename from AUTHORS.
	Begin each WRITTEN_BY string with `Written by ' and end it with `.'.
	Mark each WRITTEN_BY string as translatable.

	* basename.c, cat.c, chroot.c, cksum.c, comm.c, cp.c, csplit.c, cut.c:
	* dd.c, df.c, dirname.c, du.c, echo.c, env.c, expr.c, factor.c, head.c:

	* touch.c, tsort.c, uniq.c, unlink.c, uptime.c, users.c, wc.c:
	* who.c, whoami.c, yes.c: Revert yesterday's changes.
	Instead, a subsequent change will embed `Written by ' in
	each string along with the author names.

	* src/true.c: Revert yesterday's changes.
	* src/sys2.h: Likewise.

2003-09-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* touch.c, tsort.c, uniq.c, unlink.c, uptime.c, users.c, wc.c:
	* who.c, whoami.c, yes.c: Update AUTHORS definition to be a
	comma-separated list of strings and/or update the call to
	parse_long_options so that `AUTHORS, NULL' are the last parameters.
	* src/true.c (main): Append NULL to version_etc argument list.
	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Likewise.

	* src/sort.c (numcompare): Rename local, logb, to log_b to avoid
	shadowing the math function name.  Also rename loga to log_a.

2003-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/factor.c (print_factors): Give a separate diagnostic
	for numbers that are too large, but otherwise valid.
	Reported by Dniel Varga.

2003-09-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.7.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Use ../src/tr -s ' ' '\n' in place
	of `fmt -1'.  Using the just-built tr is a little cleaner.
	Christian Krackowizer reported that HPUX 10.20 doesn't have fmt.
	* man/Makefile.am (programs, check-x-vs-1): Likewise.

2003-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c: Alphabetize includes.
	Remove duplicate inclusion of "same.h".

2003-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Remove --rsyncable.
	Didn't give enough of a benefit, mainly because it's not yet
	in wide enough use.

	* Version 5.0.91.

	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Use ../src, not $(srcdir)/../src.
	(check-programs-vs-x): Fail if $(programs) is empty.

	* src/remove.c: Add a comment.

2003-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (D_INO, ENABLE_CYCLE_CHECK) [D_INO_IN_DIRENT]:
	Don't define.  These symbols are no longer used.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Write ^D as \cD.
	Complete the change of 2003-08-02.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Use cvsu, so that a temporary source
	file in lib/ or src/ doesn't induce an unwarranted failure.
	Add a kludge to filter out the sole generated source file that
	also has translatable messages: src/false.c.

2003-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (enum): Add ALLOW_MISSING_OPTION.
	(parse_options): Give a diagnostic for (but still accept) the
	deprecated --allow-missing option.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't ignore -S if input is a pipe.  Bug report by Michael McFarland in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00008.html>.

	* src/sort.c (sort_buffer_size): Omit SIZE_BOUND arg.  Compute the
	size_bound ourselves. if an input file is a pipe and the user
	specified a size, use that size instead of trying to guess the
	pipe size.  This has the beneficial side effect of avoiding the
	overhead of default_sort_size in that case.  All callers changed.
	(sort): Remove static var size; now done by sort_buffer_size.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.6b and autoconf-2.57b.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: Wait .5 seconds for backgrounded process
	to start, rather than just .1.  Upon failure, print unexpected state.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Don't assign 0 or
	SAFE_READ_ERROR to tmp->nbytes.
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines, pipe_bytes): Likewise.

	* src/head.c (struct linebuffer): Change nbytes and nlines
	from unsigned int to size_t.  unsigned int is safe (after the
	2003-09-03 patch) but size_t is cleaner.
	* src/tail.c (struct linebuffer, struct charbuffer): Likewise.
	(pipe_bytes): Likewise for local variable 'i', which was 'int'.

	Standardize on BUFSIZ as opposed to other macro names and values.
	* src/head.c (BUFSIZE): Remove.  All uses changed to BUFSIZ.
	* src/tail.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Remove.
	stdio.h has always defined it,
	and other code already assumes it's defined.
	* src/tr.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Likewise.
	(IO_BUF_SIZE): Remove; replace all uses with sizeof io_buf.
	(io_buf): IO_BUF_SIZE -> BUFSIZ.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (step): Default to 1.
	(print_numbers): Allow the output to be empty.
	(main): The default step is 1, even if LAST < FIRST;
	as per documentation.
	* tests/seq/basic (onearg-2): Output should be empty.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Temporarily disable, until master
	versions are restored to ftp.gnu.org.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Specify automake-1.7.6.

	Make seq's --width (-w) option work properly even when the
	endpoint requiring the larger width is negative and smaller than
	the other endpoint.
	* src/seq.c (get_width_format): Include `-' in the set of bytes
	allowed in a `simple' number (no decimal point, no exponent).
	Reported by Patrick Mauritz.

2003-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: sort -t '\0' now uses a NUL tab.
	sort option order no longer matters, unless POSIX requires it.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Say "blanks" instead of "whitespace",
	Similar fixes for many comments.
	(TAB_DEFAULT): New constant, so that we can support NUL as
	the field separator.
	(tab): Now int, not char.  Initialize to TAB_DEFAULT.
	(specify_sort_size): If multiple sizes are specified, use the largest.
	(begfield, limfield): Support NUL tab char.
	(set_ordering): Do not let -i override -d.
	(main): Report an error if incompatible -o or -t options are given.
	Report an error for "-t ''".  Allow "-t '\0'" to specify a NUL tab.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sort/Test.pm [o2, nul-tab]: New tests for the above.

2003-09-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	Bug report and patch here:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00009.html>
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines): Don't truncate return value from safe_read.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Likewise.

2003-09-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (AUTHORS): Remove Larry McVoy's name, since the relatively
	small amount of code from him was first moved to lib/human.c, and was
	subsequently rewritten entirely.
	* src/df.c (AUTHORS): Likewise.

2003-08-22  Lawrence Teo  <lcteo@uncc.edu>

	* src/md5sum.c (split_3): Accept the BSD format for generic
	message digest modes.  Currently works with BSD's MD5 and SHA1
	formats since these are the two algorithms presently used in
	coreutils.  Updated comments to reflect this change.
	(bsd_split_3): Updated comments.

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: New test to make sure that
	`md5sum --check' doesn't accept the BSD SHA1 format (adapted
	from `check-bsd' test in tests/sha1sum/basic-1).

	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1 (check-bsd2, check-bsd3): New tests for
	--check exit status and BSD SHA1 format (adapted from tests
	in tests/md5sum/basic-1).

2003-08-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Use SAME_INODE rather than open-coding it.

	When source and destination arguments refer to the same file, reside
	on a partition (e.g. VFAT) on which distinct names may refer to the
	same directory entry (often due to variations in case), and when the
	link count for the file is 1, mv no longer unlinks the file.  Instead,
	it gives the expected diagnostic that the source and destination are
	the same.  WARNING: this is an incomplete fix.  If the file happens
	to have a link count of 2 or greater, such an erroneous mv command
	will still unlink it.
	Although that is not possible on vfat or umsdos, it is possible on
	other file system types, e.g., ntfs, and hpfs.
	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Invoke same_name (which might still
	return false for names that refer to the same directory entry)
	only if the link count is 2 or more.
	* tests/mv/vfat: Show how to demonstrate the above problem.
	This test is not run.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add vfat.

2003-08-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c: Change meaning of -l from --lookup to --login, per POSIX.
	who's -l option has been eliciting an unconditional warning about
	this impending change since sh-utils-2.0.12 (April 2002).

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Don't output `EOF' (aka -1) as a `char'.
	This would happen for nonempty files not ending with a newline.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/misc/paste-no-nl: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add paste-no-nl.

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Avoid buffer overrun that would
	occur when the user-specified format string ends with `%'.
	Patch by Tommi Kyntola.
	* tests/misc/stat-fmt: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-fmt.

2003-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Apply changes from bison.
	* GNUmakefile (SHELL): Define to `sh', if necessary.
	Add copyright.
	* Makefile.maint (WGETFLAGS): Define to `-C off'.
	Update all uses of $(WGET).

2003-08-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): New.
	* Makefile.maint (local-check): Rename as...
	(local-checks-available): this.
	(local-check): New.

2003-08-26  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Neutralize "<#" as
	"<\#" to avoid magic from Gnus when posting parts of this script.

2003-08-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (main): Warn about use of deprecated `-l' option.

2003-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): For link count at end of line, use %h format,
	instead of %-5h.  The latter would make stat emit trailing spaces.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2003-08-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_space_tab .x-sc_sun_os_names

2003-08-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Include stdlib.h unconditionally,
	as we're now assuming that part of hosted C89.

2003-08-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (textdomain, bindtextdomain) [! ENABLE_NLS]: Define away,
	to avoid warnings from gcc.

2003-08-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary and sometimes time-consuming hostname lookups.
	* src/who.c (print_user): Use strchr, not strrchr.
	* src/pinky.c (print_entry): Likewise.
	Patch by Michael Stone.
	This fixes a typo I introduced in who-users.c on 1996-02-23.

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): Add 0-9 to the range of characters
	disallowed between `@...@'.

2003-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.ac (fu_cv_sys_truncating_statfs): Remove; now
	done by gnulib .m4 files.
	(jm_DUMMY_1): Require gl_READUTMP, not jm_PREREQ_READUTMP.
	* src/sys2.h (strtoull): Remove unused declaration.

2003-08-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Ensure that generated PROGRAM.1 files
	are read-only.

	* src/tail.c (tail_lines): Fix a potential (but very hard to exercise)
	race condition bug.  The bug would be triggered when tailing a file
	with file pointer not at beginning of file, and where the file was
	truncated to have a length of less than the initial offset at just
	the right moment (between the two lseek calls in this function).

	An invalid initial value for *read_pos would result in
	`tail -n0 -f FILE' and `tail -c0 -f FILE' doing what amounted to a
	busy-wait rather than sleeping between iterations.  The bug manifests
	itself only when tailing regular files that are initially nonempty.
	* src/tail.c (tail_bytes): Set *read_pos to new file offset after
	each xlseek call.
	(tail_lines): Likewise, after lseek calls.
	Reported by Nick Estes.  See http://bugs.debian.org/205251 for details.
	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: New file.  Test for above fix.
	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add tail-n0f.

2003-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_space_tab): Use exclusion list in separate file.
	(sc_sun_os_names): Likewise.
	* .x-sc_space_tab, .x-sc_sun_os_names: New files.

	* man/help2man: Remove some SPACEs before TAB.

2003-08-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.maint (LC_ALL): Set to C.
	* man/Makefile.am (ASSORT): New var.
	(check-x-vs-1, programs): Use it.
	* src/Makefile.am (ASSORT, check-README, ../AUTHORS): Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (ASSORT, all_programs): Likewise.

2003-08-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	fold -s -wN would infloop for N < 8 with TABs in the input.
	E.g., this would not terminate: printf 'a\tb' | fold -w2 -s
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Move contents of `else'-block
	out of conditional so it's used also for --spaces (-s).
	* tests/misc/fold: Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fold.

2003-08-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <sys/resource.h> after
	system.h so the types from time.h and sys/time.h are available.
	It appears that this is necessary for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
	Darwin 6.5 (MacOS 10.2.5).  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add support for setting file timestamps to microsecond
	resolution, on hosts that support this.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/install.c, src/touch.c: Include utimens.h.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal):
	Set file timestamps with utimens, not utime.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (newtime, touch, main): Likewise.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_sun_os_names): New rule based on a regexp
	from Paul Eggert.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/tail.c (main): Tweak Solaris OS version number in comment.
	* src/wc.c (wc): Likewise
	* tests/tail-2/fflush: Likewise.

	* src/tail.c: Add new undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	(pipe_lines): Use memchr to skip lines, rather than an explicit loop.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use new gnulib 'extensions' module.
	* configure.ac: Invoke gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead of
	AC_GNU_SOURCE.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/basic: Ensure that a/b/F has at least 65 bytes too.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Reflect that `split -a 0' is now accepted.
	For tests of obsolete behavior, don't presume that unsetting
	_POSIX2_VERSION is equivalent to _POSIX2_VERSION=199209.

2003-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (split invocation):
	Add -d or --numeric-suffixes option to 'split'.
	From a suggestion by Jesse Kornblum.
	* src/split.c (suffix_alphabet): New var.
	(longopts, usage, next_file_name, main): Support -d.
	(next_file_name, main): Allow -a0, as POSIX requires.
	(next_file_name): Don't assume ASCII-like encoding;
	'a' through 'z' are not contiguous in EBCDIC.

2003-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge getline from gnulib.
	* lib/getline.h, lib/getline.c, m4/getline.m4: Merge from gnulib.
	* lib/getndelim2.h, lib/getndelim2.c, m4/getndelim2.m4, m4/ssize_t.m4:
	New files, from gnulib.
	* lib/getdelim2.c, lib/getdelim2.h: Remove.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Change getdelim2.c and
	getdelim2.h to getndelim2.c and getndelim2.h.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_MACROS): Use gl_GETNDELIM2 rather than
	checking for getdelim.
	(jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES): Use gt_TYPE_SSIZE_T for ssize_t rather
	than rolling our own.
	* src/cut.c: Include getndelim2.h rather than getdelim2.h.
	(cut_fields): Invoke getndelim2 rather than getdelim2.

2003-08-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (main): Use unsigned int instead of int for `nsigs'
	and for the indices to iterate through nsigs.

2003-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Minor code cleanups, mostly to use more accurate
	types and to remove unnecessary casts.
	(min, max): Remove.  All uses changed to MIN and MAX.
	(hard_lc_collate, hard_LC_TIME, struct buffer.eof, struct
	keyfield.skipsblanks, struct keyfield.skipeblanks, struct
	keyfield.numeric, struct keyfield.general_numeric, struct
	keyfield.month, struct keyfield.reverse, reverse, unique,
	have_read_stdin): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(eolchar): Now char, not int.
	(struct keyfield.ignore): Now bool const *, not int *.
	(struct keyfield.translate): Now char const *, not char *.
	(struct month.name): Likewise.
	(blanks, nonprinting, nondictionary): Now bool[], not int[].
	(cleanup, inittables, keycompare, check, mergefps, first_same_file,
	check, sort, main): Use const * pointers when possible.
	(month_cmp): Rewrite to avoid casts.
	(inittables): Initialize tables unconditionally, to avoid branches.
	(fillbuf): Return bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(fillbuf, keycompare, new_key, main):
	Use SIZE_MAX rather than (size_t) -1.
	(trailing_blanks): Renamed from trim_trailing_blanks.
	Return the number of blanks to trim.  All uses changed.
	(getmonth): Use trailing_blanks rather than open code.
	(keycompare): Do not cast char * to unsigned char *; not needed.
	CMP_WITH_IGNORE converts args to UCHAR, so no need to convert it
	ourselves.
	(compare, main): Use | rather than || to avoid jumps.
	Replace "diff = NONZERO (alen)" with "diff = 1", since alen must
	be nonzero there.
	(check, first_same_file, sort, main):
	Use bool instead of int local vars when possible.
	(check): Merge the old 'checkfp' and 'check' into a single function,
	that returns a boolean (true if the file was ordered).
	All uses changed.
	(main): Use int instead of unsigned for iterating through nsigs.
	Rename local var "posix_pedantic" to "posixly_correct".

2003-08-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <time.h> before <sys/resource.h>
	to avoid compilation error on Ultrix. Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Don't read again after encountering an
	initial EOF.  E.g., `cut -f2' would do so.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Add a test for the above fix.

	* src/sort.c (sortlines): Add description and references.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set PATH so that
	the tests in help-version will use the just-built binaries.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add --rfc-2822 option to GNU date.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Time directives, Options for date, Examples
	of date): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (long_options, usage, main): Likewise.
	* doc/getdate.texi (General date syntax): Likewise.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Options for date): Fix a typo in format:
	it's now %d not %_d.  Add URLs.

2003-08-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/shred/remove: Ensure that $? is 0 for the final `exit 0'.
	Otherwise, with at least the /bin/sh from HPUX 10.20,
	the trap code would end up converting that to exit 1 and thus an
	unexpected test failure.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Do not include bumpalloc.h.
	(WORD_TABLE): New member alloc.
	(ALLOC_NEW_WORD): Remove.
	(occurs_alloc): New var.
	(digest_word_file, find_occurs_in_text): Check for arithmetic
	overflow when computing table size.  Use xrealloc rather than
	bumpalloc primitives.

2003-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.90.

	* README: When running tests as root, suggest using
	sudo with NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Makefile is in ../src, not
	$(srcdir)/../src.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Try Debian/gzip's new --rsyncable option.

2003-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/stdbool.hin (_Bool): Make it signed char, instead of
	an enum type, so that it's guaranteed to promote to int.
	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Undo previous change.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Declare local `swap' to be `int', not
	`bool'.  Otherwise, at least one buggy compiler (alpha gcc-2.95.4)
	would cause lines[-1 - swap] (with swap = false) to evaluate to
	lines[4294967295].

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/priv-check (my_uid): Use `!', not `^' in case pattern `[!0-9]',
	since /bin/sh of at least NetBSD 1.6 and OpenBSD 3.2 don't accept `^'.

	* src/remove.c (prompt) [! recursive]: Don't prompt about unwritable
	directories, as required by POSIX.   Reported by Karl Berry.
	* tests/rm/dir-no-w: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-no-w.

	* tests/mk-script: Emit `$xx', not its expansion.

2003-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	This change was inspired by a similar proposal by Stepan Kasal.
	* src/sort.c (mergelines, sortlines_temp): New functions.
	(sortlines): Use them, to reduce the number of times that
	we need to copy 'struct line' values.  This improved CPU
	performance by about 30% on one 18 MB test.
	(sort): Don't invoke sortlines unless we have 2 or more lines.

2003-07-26  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* src/sort.c (sort): Don't require two `struct line's per text line,
	the new sort algorithm requires just 1.5.

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %lu, not %ld.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/cut.c (is_printable_field): Simplify bit arithmetic.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Put `volatile' in the right place.
	From Paul Eggert.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use only one bit per field/offset in array, not one `int'.
	* src/cut.c (printable_field): Change type to `unsigned char'.
	(mark_printable_field, is_printable_field): New functions.
	Use them in place of all direct accesses of `printable_field'.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tabstops): Detect overflow properly.
	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Likewise.

	* src/rm.c: Include "dirname.h".
	(usage): Use base_name (program_name) in body of --help output.
	This lets me...
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): ...back out the kludge of 2003-07-22.
	Idea from Brendan O'Dea, who suggested using
	`program_name = basename (argv[0]);' everywhere --
	can't do that, but using base_name works just fine here.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Exempt test.

2003-07-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-compliance problems with 'test'.  This makes
	'test' more compatible with Bash.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document the following.
	* src/test.c: Include exitfail.h.
	(TEST_FAILURE): New constant, used for exit status if 'test' fails.
	(test-syntax_error): Use it.
	(binary_operator): Now takes bool arg specifying whether left operand
	is -l ARG, so that caller determines this rather than us.
	All uses changed.
	(term): Use posixtest to evaluate parenthesized subexpressions.
	(unary_operator, one_argument): Remove support for -t without operand.
	(one_argument): Take argument from argv[pos].
	(one_argument, two_arguments, three_arguments): Advance pos.
	All callers changed.
	(three_arguments): Look for binary ops before "!".  Then look
	for parenthesized one_argument expressions, instead of trusting
	expr () to do the right thing.
	(posixtest): Now takes number of args.  All callers changed.
	Treat "( A B )" like "A B".
	(main): Set exit_failure to TEST_FAILURE.  Don't depend on
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, as we now conform to POSIX by default.
	(main) [!LBRACKET]: Do not recognize "--help" or "--verbose" unless.
	* tests/test/Test.pm (test_vector): Add several tests to check
	the above.  Syntax errors now exit with status 2, not 1.
	* man/Makefile.am (mapped_name): Use `../src/[' binary to create test.1.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Adjust for above change in test behavior:
	`[' exits with 2, not 1, and test doesn't accept --help or --version.

	* Makefile.maint (ME): Don't use trick suggested in Make manual.
	It doesn't work for make-3.79.1.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_system_h_headers): Another syntax check.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Cast strlen value to `unsigned long'
	so it matches `%ld' format even on 32-bit systems.

	* src/fmt.c (flush_paragraph): Cast field width to `int' to
	avoid warning on 64-bit systems.

	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Make `func' volatile, so it can't be
	clobbered by a `longjmp' into this function.

2003-07-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %ld format (not %d) for size_t
	value.

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Disable the --line-bytes=$_4gb test,
	because it'd evoke spurious failure on 64-bit systems.

2003-07-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (usage): Document the fact that SIGUSR1 makes dd
	output its current record counts.  Reported by Jurriaan.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm (test_vector): Disable the `PIPE' tests when running
	`wc' with no options.  This goes along with the change of 2003-07-20.

2003-07-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2003-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (wc): Fix typo in computation of file from file_x,
	which caused the former to be used uninitialized if file_x was
	nonzero.

2003-07-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Use xcalloc in place of xmalloc+memset.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Substitute 's,$t/$*,$*,' on output of
	help2man, to avoid having `rm.td/rm' appear in rm.1.  Reported by
	Thomas Luzat.  See http://bugs.debian.org/202413 for details.

	* src/cut.c (main) [lint]: Initialize spec_list_string to avoid warning.

	* src/hostid.c: Don't include <unistd.h>.  system.h already does that.

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Mark all selected indices before trying to
	determine range endpoints.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: New test for the above fix.

	Begin to address this comment: What if someone wants to
	extract the 1,000,000-th field of some huge input file?
	The first step is to rearrange things so that the values
	in the printable_field array are all 0/1 rather than 0/1/2.
	* src/cut.c (RANGE_START_SENTINEL): Remove.
	Store range-start indices in a hash table, rather than
	overloading the `printable_field' array.
	(range_start_ht): New global.
	(hash_int, hash_compare_ints, is_range_start_index): New functions.
	(print_kth): Use is_range_start_index; don't test printable_field.
	(set_fields): Detect overflow.
	(set_fields): Insert each range-start index into range_start_ht.
	(main): Call set_fields only once, and only after
	output_delimiter_specified and (if required) range_start_ht have
	been defined.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (get_input_fstatus): Fix typo: `stat' was being
	invoked with a null pointer when there were no file arguments.

2003-07-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_changelog): Add another nit-picky check.

	* src/wc.c (write_counts): Add a comment.
	(wc): Rename `file' parameter.
	Set new local, `file', to be the file name, or (when it's NULL)
	_("standard output") so that all uses of `file' use the proper value.
	Use STREQ, not strcmp.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	wc count field widths now are heuristically adjusted depending
	on the input size, if known.  If only one count is printed, it
	is guaranteed to be printed without leading spaces.

	Previously, wc did not align the count fields if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT was set, but POSIX did not actually require
	this undesirable behavior, so it has been removed.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (wc invocation): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c (number_width): New var.
	(posixly_correct): Remove.
	(struct fstatus): New struct.
	(write_counts): Output fields of width number_width.
	Do not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	Use null file, not empty-string file, to denote stdin,
	since "" is a valid file name on some hosts.
	(wc, wc_file): New arg fstatus.  Use it to avoid invoking fstat
	if possible.
	(wc):  Avoid problems if end_pos - current_pos overflows.
	Do not print odd message if stdin has a read error.
	(get_input_fstatus, compute_number_width): New functions.
	(main): Use them to implement the new behavior.
	Ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm: Adjust to the new output widths.

2003-07-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Don't create temporary directory --
	we don't use it.

	* tests/shred/remove: Don't open-code test for UID != 0.
	Use priv-check's require-non-root instead.
	Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_expr): Record that
	expr exits with status of 3 for e.g., a write error.

	* tests/priv-check: Use `id -u' to see if we're running as root,
	rather than trying go write to an write-protected file.
	When running as root, ensure $NON_ROOT_USERNAME is valid.
	When running as root with `require-non-root', ensure that `.'
	is writable by $NON_ROOT_USERNAME, then reinvoke $0 set-user-ID
	to $NON_ROOT_USERNAME.  If `.' is not writable, then skip the test.

	* src/printenv.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure rather than calling close_stdout_set_status.
	* src/date.c: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/tty.c: Likewise.

2003-07-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/not-owner: Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, create a temporary
	directory, and remove Perl-coded `you may not run as root' test.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, rather than
	hard-coding something not quite equivalent.
	Paul Jarc reported the inconsistent diagnostics.

	* src/sort.c (main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `sort --version' and `sort --help' fail, as they should
	when their output is redirected to /dev/full.

	* src/su.c (usage): Don't call close_stdout here.
	(main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `su --version > /dev/full' fails, as it should.
	Somehow, the change of 2000-05-07 that purports to fix this
	was not checked in.

	* tests/help-version (--help/--version vs. /dev/full): Special-case
	`[' to protect it from expected_failure_status-`eval'.

	* src/uniq.c (writeline): Use a SPACE, not a TAB between the
	count and the corresponding line, as required by POSIX.
	Reported by Clement Wang.
	* tests/uniq/Test.pm (101, 102): Update tests of -c accordingly.

	* tests/expr/basic: Add tests for when exit status is 2.

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, NOHUP_FAILURE):
	Use an anonymous `enum', rather than #define.

2003-07-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/expr.c: Include "exitfail.h", "quotearg.h".
	(EXPR_INVALID, EXPR_ERROR): New constants.
	(nomoreargs, null, toarith, nextarg): Return bool, not int.
	(syntax_error): New function, exiting with status 2.  Use it
	insteading of printing "syntax error" ourselves.
	(main): Initialize exit_failure to EXPR_ERROR.
	Exit with EXPR_INVALID on syntax error (too few arguments).
	(nextarg): Use strcmp, not strcoll; strcoll might return
	an undesirable 0, or might fail.
	(docolon, eval4, eval3): Exit with status 3 on invalid argument type
	or other such error.
	(eval2): Report an error if strcoll fails in a string comparison.
	* src/sort.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure, not xalloc_exit_failure and
	xmemcoll_exit_failure.
	* tests/expr/basic: Invalid value exits with status 3, not 2.

2003-07-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Use 5.0.90 as the version, rather than 5.0.2,
	per GNU maintainer guidelines.  The next non-beta release will be 5.1.

	This script would have caught at least two recent bugs:
	those in [ and kill.
	* tests/help-version: Revive this script.
	It wasn't doing anything useful, since $all_programs wasn't being
	defined by the invoking Makefile.am.
	Reflect that nohup is no longer a script, so don't exclude it.
	Add framework to handle the programs added since it was last run:
	kill, stat, unlink, [, link, readlink.
	Fix path-related problems deriving from the move of this script
	from src/ to its present location.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Define.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Use it.

	* src/kill.c (main): Fix bug introduced on 2003-05-10 (for 5.0.1)
	whereby kill would always attempt to operate on argv[0] and fail.

	* src/test.c (integer_expected_error): Improve diagnostic -- now,
	it also matches the one from bash's builtin test.
	(binary_operator): Add \n at end of diagnostic.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Remove setuidgid-related code.  Move it to ...
	* tests/priv-check: Move setuidgid-related and
	NON_ROOT_USERNAME-checking code to this file.

	* README: Update section on testing as `root'.
	Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/test.c (AUTHORS): Replace 3-letter usernames with the actual
	names of authors that I just found in bash's builtins/test.def.

	Running `[' with no arguments would evoke a segfault.
	* src/test.c (main) [LBRACKET]: Move initialization of argv to
	precede potential use via test_syntax_error.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Rename from `INCLUDES', to avoid
	warning from automake -Wall.

2003-07-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.1.

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Remove target first, so gpg doesn't
	prompt us about it.

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Relax tests for matching
	version-number line in NEWS.
	Change the .sig suffix to .asc here, too.

2003-07-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Renamed from %.sig.
	Generate and use ascii-armored signatures.
	Use gpg's -o option.

2003-07-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FAILURE, NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE): Define.
	(main): Use them.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Move each individual check into
	its own target.
	(syntax-check-rules): This is the list of syntax-check targets.
	(sc_unmarked_diagnostics, sc_cast_of_argument_to_free):
	(sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value, sc_space_tab):
	(sc_error_exit_success, sc_xalloc_h_in_src):  New targets.

2003-07-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Remove uses of OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS and last
	traces of the nohup script.

	* src/Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): Remove use of just-removed
	$(OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS).

	* src/Makefile.am (localedir.h): Put the `2>&1' after the redirect
	target, not before the `>'.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd,
	now that that function no longer calls `error'.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Emit a diagnostic for each
	failed syscall, rather than relying on caller to do that.
	The caller couldn't do a good job, anyhow -- too many different
	ways to fail (each with a different referent).
	Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd, now that that function
	no longer calls `error'.
	(show_point): Don't diagnose find_mount_point's errors, now that
	it handles them itself.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Don't let free clobber errno upon
	failed chdir.

	* src/sys2.h: Remove alloca-related block.
	* src/system.h: Include <alloca.h> here, instead.

	It appears that the `#pragma alloca' included via "system.h" is
	adequate, since join.c uses alloca, yet lacked an in-file #pragma.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/df.c, src/install.c, src/ln.c:
	* src/ls.c, src/mv.c, src/remove.c: Remove `#pragma alloca'.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Do not restore any special
	permission bits (e.g., set-user-ID, set-group-ID) that are reset
	by chown(2) on some systems.  Suggestion and insistence :-) from
	Michael Stone.

	* tests/input-tty: Also check `test -t 1'.
	This is necessary on linux-2.4.21.  Otherwise, the stty/basic-1
	test would block when run in the background.

2003-07-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sample-test: Also fail if cat-to-create-expected-output
	fails.  Otherwise, if both `exp' and `out' were to end up empty
	because of e.g., a full disk, they would mistakenly compare equal.

	* src/nohup.c: New file.  Rewrite of nohup.sh in C.
	This solves a portability problem: on at least Solaris systems,
	when nohup.sh used the vendor /bin/sh, it would exit with status
	of `1' rather than the required 126 or 127 upon failure to exec
	the specified program.

	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_SCRIPTS): Remove definition.
	(bin_PROGRAMS): Add nohup.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Remove nohup.sh.
	(all_programs): Remove use of $(EXTRA_SCRIPTS).
	* src/nohup.sh: Remove file.
	* man/Makefile.am (nohup.1): Depend on nohup.c, rather than nohup.sh.

	* tests/misc/nohup: Tests for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nohup.

	* src/head.c (diagnose_copy_fd_failure): New function, renamed from
	the macro, COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE.
	(diagnose_copy_fd_failure): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	(head_file): Likewise.

	* src/date.c: Include "quote.h".
	(batch_convert): Use the quote function rather than using literal `...'
	in a diagnostic.

	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	* src/fmt.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable): Likewise.
	* src/yes.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_attributes): Likewise.

2003-07-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (usage): Use 1024*1024 in place of 1048576.
	* src/tail.c (usage): Likewise.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Now that we have setuidgid, use it in
	place of the kludge in this test.  Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Define to setuidgid.
	* src/setuidgid.c: New program, solely for testing (not installed).

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Don't leak file descriptors
	when dereferencing symlinks.

2003-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/slash: New file/test for today's lib/ftw.c fix.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add slash

	* src/tail.c (xlseek): Avoid warning about ``return without value
	from function returning non-void''.

2003-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/help2man: Update to version 1.29.

	* man/help2man: Add END handler to close STDOUT and check for errors.

2003-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for a "[" that conforms to the GNU coding standards,
	i.e., that does not depend on its name.
	* src/lbracket.c: New file.
	* README: Add "[".
	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Ignore "[", since it doesn't have
	a separate man page.
	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add "[".
	(__SOURCES): New var.
	* src/test.c (LBRACKET): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(main): Use LBRACKET rather than argv[0].

	* src/test.c (one_argument): Do not check for -t if POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	Reported by Paul Jarc and Dan Jacobson.

	* src/test.c (main): Do not recognize --help or --version if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, when invoked as "test".  Handle "[ ]" correctly.
	Do not bother testing that margv[margc] is non-null.

2003-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_line): Rewrite to use asprintf, in order to be
	able to avoid emitting trailing spaces.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: Add tests of head's new --lines=-N
	option, and perform the +1600 invocations of head IFF the envvar
	RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS is set.

2003-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Give a better diagnostic when failing due
	to nonexistent destination directory.  Reported by Dmitry Rutsky.
	See http://bugs.debian.org/199730 for details.

2003-06-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	split's --verbose option did nothing [broken in 4.5.10 and 5.0]
	* src/split.c (longopts): Use `1', not `0' as the value for
	for &verbose.  Reported by Keith Thompson.

	Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/split-a: Also use --verbose and compare stderr
	output with what we'd expect.

2003-06-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	Use `error_t' (rather than int) as type for local `err'.
	From Alfred M. Szmidt.

2003-06-19  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	Fix author preservation code.

2003-06-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (ENABLE_HARD_LINK_TO_SYMLINK_WARNING): Define to 0.
	(do_link): Don't warn about hard link to symlink.

2003-06-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c: Include "getdelim2.h", not "getstr.h".
	Reflect renaming: getstr -> getdelim2.

	* src/comm.c, src/join.c, src/nl.c, src/uniq.c: Reflect renaming:
	readline -> readlinebuffer.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	* src/readlink.c: Include <sys/types.h> before system.h (because
	the latter includes <sys/stat.h>).  Required on Ultrix 4.3.

2003-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (initialize_main): Define.
	Use it in every `main'.  Applied via this:
	p='initialize_main (&argc, &argv);'
	perl -ni -e '/program_name.=.argv.0/ and print "  '"$p"'\n"; print' \
	  $(grep -l program_name.=.argv.0 *.c)
	test.c uses margc/margv, so I made the change manually for that file.
	Based on a patch from Bernard Giroud.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Fix for build failure on Ultrix 4.3.
	* src/stat.c: Include sys/statvfs.h in preference to sys/vfs.h.
	Include sys/param.h and sys/mount.h on ultrix.

2003-06-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_NOCTTY, EISDIR): Remove
	definitions.
	* src/system.h (O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_NOCTTY, EISDIR): Define
	them here instead, but with one change: define EISDIR to -1, not 0.

	* src/cat.c (cat): Remove `#ifndef ENOSYS', now that it's
	guaranteed to be defined.
	* src/system.h (ENOSYS, ENOTSUP): Define to -1 if not defined.

	* README: Mention the CVS repository.
	Encourage addition of test cases.

2003-06-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Call close only if necessary.
	From Bruno Haible.

	* src/wc.c (usage): Correct wording: wc prints counts in the order
	`newline, word, byte'.  Reported by Keith M. Briggs.
	* man/wc.x: Fix it here, too.  And change `lines' to `newlines'.

2003-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date/Test.pm: Add a test for the new format, e.g., May-23-2003.

2003-06-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Add commented-out (over-aggressive)
	rule.

2003-06-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/extract-magic (main): Avoid newer 3-arg form of open,
	so this script works also with e.g., perl5.005_03.
	Patch by John David Anglin.

2003-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/system.h: Include <stdbool.h> unconditionally.

2003-06-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (check-programs-vs-x): Rename target
	from check-programs-vs-1.  Adjust rule to check for the
	primary (.x) file, not the generated one (.1).

2003-06-03  Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu>

	* man/kill.x: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add kill.1.
	(kill.1): New rule.

2003-06-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Ensure that the .x file for a new program is never forgotten again.
	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Define.
	(check-programs-vs-1): New phony target.
	(check-local): Depend on it.

2003-06-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary copying of environment.
	* src/env.c (main): Rather than clearing the environment and --
	unless told to ignore environment -- copying all settings from
	the saved, original environment, clear the environment only when
	that is requested.  Suggested by Jens Elkner.

2003-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Always include <string.h>, since we assume C89.
	Include <limits.h> without checking for HAVE_LIMITS_H.

	* src/test.c [!TEST_STANDALONE]: Remove #if-0'd block.
	(STREQ, S_IXUGO): Remove redundant (in system.h) definitions.

2003-06-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a race condition in `tail -f' described by Ken Raeburn in
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-textutils/2003-05/msg00007.html
	* src/tail.c (file_lines): Add new parameter, *read_pos, and set it.
	(pipe_lines, pipe_bytes, start_bytes, start_lines): Likewise.
	(tail_bytes, tail_lines, tail): Likewise.
	(tail_file): Use the new `read_pos' value as the size,
	rather than stats.st_size from the fstat call.

2003-05-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/extract-magic: Allow expansion of `$file' in the here-
	document corresponding to the comment at the top of fs.h.

2003-05-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Fix portability problem on FreeBSD5.0: don't include
	<sys/statvfs.h> on systems without HAVE_STRUCT_STATVFS_F_BASETYPE.
	Use #if/#elif/... cascade so we get only one set of include files.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-05-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (split_3): Accept the BSD format only when in MD5 mode.
	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1: Make sure `sha1sum --check' doesn't
	accept the BSD format.

2003-03-28  Joe Orton  <jorton@redhat.com>

	* src/md5sum.c (bsd_split_3): New function.
	(split_3): Detect checksums from BSD 'md5' command and handle them
	using bsd_split_3.

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: New tests for --check exit status, and for
	BSD-style checksum files.

2003-05-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Fix a thinko.
	This sort of thing is why it'd be *Really Good* to factor
	out the common code used here and in tail.c.

2003-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (usage): Document new feature: --bytes=-N and --lines=-N.

	* tests/du/slink: Skip this test if `.' is on an XFS file system.

	* tests/du/fd-leak: New file.  Test for the bug in du that
	was fixed by the 2003-05-12 change to lib/ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fd-leak.

	* src/head.c (AUTHORS): Enclose string in N_(...), now that it
	includes a translatable word, `and'.

	* src/dd.c (usage): Don't use `,' as the thousands separator
	in e.g. 1,000,000 and 1,048,576.  Instead, do this:
	`SIZE may be ..., MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024 and so on...'
	* src/df.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/du.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (usage): Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Add another check.

	Fix uniq to conform to POSIX, which requires that "uniq -d -u"
	must output nothing.  Problem reported by Josh Hyman.

	* src/uniq.c (enum output_mode, mode): Remove, replacing with:
	(output_unique, output_first_repeated, output_later_repeated):
	New vars.  All uses of "mode" changed to use these variables,
	which are not mutually exclusive as "mode" was.
	(writeline): New arg "match", used to control whether to
	obey output_first_repeated or output_later_repeated.
	All callers changed.
	(check_file, main): Adjust to above changes.

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Test that 'uniq -d -u' outputs nothing.

2003-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/rm3: Use tr's \n notation rather than \012.
	This package can afford to do that, since its tests are guaranteed use
	GNU tr, which has accepted the more modern notation for 10 years.
	* tests/rm/rm5: Likewise.

	from just `%s' to e.g., `error reading %s'.
	(pipe_lines): Change type of parameter, n_lines, to uintmax_t.
	Rewrite newline-counting loop to use memchr.

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Use `if', not assert.
	Now that assert is no longer used, don't include <assert.h>.

2003-05-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c: Include <assert.h>.
	(AUTHORS): Add my name.
	(elide_tail_lines_pipe): New function.

2003-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Check for `error (EXIT_SUCCESS,'.

	* src/readlink.c (main): Set program_name before first use.
	Remove that (redundant) first use.
	Don't exit successfully just because --verbose was specified.
	Pass 0, not EXIT_SUCCESS, as first argument to error; when that
	parameter is 0, error does not exit.

	* src/uname.c (main): When failing due to too many arguments, also say
	that, rather than just "Try `uname --help' for more information.".
	* src/comm.c (main): Likewise, but for too few arguments.
	* src/logname.c: Include error.h.
	(main): Say why we're failing.

	* src/uniq.c (main): Don't segfault when argc < optind.
	* src/who.c (main): Handle argc < optind.

	of consistency.

	* src/rm.c (main): Don't overrun array bound if argc is 0.

2003-05-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (main): Don't overrun array bound if argc is 0.
	That would happen when invoked via: execl ("/usr/bin/sort", NULL);
	Reported by Wartan Hachaturow.

2003-05-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Implement support so that `head --lines=-N' works on seekable files.
	* src/head.c (enum Copy_fd_status): Define.
	(COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE): New macro.
	(elide_tail_lines_seekable): New funtion.
	(elide_tail_lines_file): Call it here.

2003-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (CHAR_BIT): Remove duplicate definition.

2003-05-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/head/Test.pm: Remove tests of --bytes=-N; using that framework
	caused the addition of thousands of small files to the tar archive.
	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: New file.  Add them here instead.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add head-elide-tail.

2003-05-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/remove.c (HAVE_WORKING_READDIR): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Remove.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Rewrite to avoid IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR,
	which was a bit weird because it couldn't be emulated by a function.

2003-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Extend head to accept --lines=-N (--bytes=-N) and to print all
	but the N lines (bytes) at the end of the file.
	* src/head.c: Include full-write.h, full-read.h, inttostr.h, quote.h.
	Use quote() in diagnostics, rather than literal `' marks.
	(copy_fd, elide_tail_bytes_pipe, elide_tail_bytes_file):
	New functions.
	(elide_tail_lines_pipe, elide_tail_lines_file): New functions.
	(head_file): Reorganize so as to call head from only one place.
	(main): Likewise, for head_file.
	Handle new, undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	Handle negative line and byte counts.
	* tests/head/Test.pm: Add lots of tests to exercise --bytes=-N.

	* tests/du/8gb: Skip test if the file system of `.' doesn't support
	sparse files -- otherwise it'd create a file of size 8GB.

2003-05-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c (usage): Don't mention obsolescent -WIDTH option.
	Instead explain about `-' and standard input.
	(main): Give a proper diagnostic for e.g., `fmt -c -72'.
	Reported by Keith Thompson.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	* src/fmt.c: Include "quote.h".
	Use quote() in diagnostics, rather than literal `' marks.
	(main): Exit nonzero when unable to open an input file.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	* src/fmt.c (main): Diagnose invalid suffix on obsolescent width
	specifications like `-72x'.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	Work around nasty readdir bug on Darwin6.5.
	* src/remove.c (IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Define.
	[! HAVE_WORKING_READDIR] (remove_cwd_entries): If readdir has just
	returned NULL and there has been at least one successful unlink or
	rmdir call since the opendir or previous rewinddir, then call
	rewinddir and reiterate the loop.

	Factor out common code.
	* src/remove.c (readdir_ignoring_dotdirs): New function.
	(is_empty_dir): Use it here.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Use it here.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/r-3: Create 500 rather than just 300 files.
	There's a bug in Darwin6.5's readdir that shows up only with
	338 or more files.
	Fix a bug in this test: `cd $pwd' (not to `..'), now that $tmp
	has two components.

	* src/tail.c:
	Change type of n_units, n_bytes, n_lines to be `uintmax_t'.
	(dump_remainder): Move two declarations `down' into the scope
	where they are used.
	(xlseek): Return the resulting offset.
	(file_lines): Rename parameter, file_length, to end_pos.
	(pipe_lines): Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int'.
	Adapt tests accordingly.
	(pipe_bytes) [struct charbuffer] (nbytes): Change type from `int'
	to `unsigned int'.
	Change type of `total_bytes' from `int' to `size_t',
	since the former wouldn't always be wide enough.
	Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int',
	and adapt tests accordingly.
	Now that testing for a read error no longer involves
	using `tmp', handle that case *after* freeing `tmp'.
	(start_bytes): Clean up.
	(tail_bytes): Now that `n_bytes' may be larger than
	OFF_T_MAX, test for that condition and, if it's true, don't
	use lseek optimizations.
	(parse_options): Don't fail just because N_UNITS is larger than
	the maximum size of a file -- tail may be applied to an input
	stream (e.g., a pipe) with more data than that.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Rename from alloc-check.
	Also check for SPACE-TAB sequences.
	Also check for malloc/calloc/realloc casts.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (start_lines): Rewrite to use memchr.  Clean up.

2003-04-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Send two tokens, not just one, so we don't
	make the now-more-picky tsort fail.

2003-04-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Remove unnecessary test of have_read_stdin.
	(main): Minor syntactic clean-up.

	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Fail if the input contains an odd number of
	tokens.  Reported by junkio@cox.net.

	* tests/tsort/basic-1: Test for the above fix.

2003-04-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the printf fixes below.

	* Makefile.cfg (cvs_files): Add $(srcdir)/config/depcomp to the list.

2003-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix printf POSIX compatibility bug reported by Ben Harris in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-04/msg00070.html>.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (printf invocation): It's \NNN in the format,
	\0NNN in the %b operand.
	* src/printf.c (usage): Likewise.
	(print_esc): New arg OCTAL0 to specify whether \0NNN or \NNN
	is desired.  All uses changed.  Behave like Bash printf if %b
	operand uses \NNN where the initial N is not 0.

2003-04-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stty.c: Remove uses of PROTOTYPE macro.

2003-04-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint: Remove (or replace-with-TAB(s) to retain alignment)
	each sequence of spaces before a TAB character.

2003-04-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't closedir (NULL).

2003-04-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Giving nl an invalid STYLE argument (in --header-numbering=STYLE (-h),
	--body-numbering=STYLE (-b), or --footer-numbering=STYLE (-f)) or
	FORMAT (--number-format=FORMAT (-n)) would not give a useful diagnostic.
	* src/nl.c (main): Fix those problems and remove literal quote marks
	(e.g., "`%s'") from format string; instead use "%s" in each format
	string and `quote (optarg)' as the corresponding argument.
	Also, diagnose all invalid command line options before failing.

	* src/nl.c (proc_text): Fix a bug that would make nl output extra
	newlines in some cases.  Details here: http://bugs.debian.org/177256.
	This bug was introduced on 2001-11-10 for textutils-2.0.17.
	* tests/misc/nl: Add test for the above-fixed bug.

	* tests/misc/readlink: New file.  Test the --canonicalize option.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add readlink.

2003-04-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Clean up.
	* src/chown.c, src/cp.c, src/dircolors.hin, src/du.c, src/ln.c:
	* src/mkfifo.c, src/ptx.c, src/spline.c, src/stty.c, src/tail.c:
	* src/test.c, src/unexpand.c: Remove (or replace-with-TAB(s) to
	retain alignment) each sequence of spaces before a TAB character.

	* src/ls.c: Include <stdlib.h> unconditionally.

	* Makefile.maint (xalloc-check): Rename from header-check.

	* src/yes.c: Include error.h after system.h, not before.

	Clean up.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp-hash.c, src/cp.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c:
	* src/date.c, src/df.c, src/du.c, src/expand.c, src/expr.c, src/id.c:
	* src/join.c, src/md5sum.c, src/nl.c, src/od.c, src/paste.c, src/pr.c:
	* src/ptx.c, src/sort.c, src/split.c, src/su.c, src/tail.c, src/tee.c:
	* src/tr.c: * src/unexpand.c, src/users.c:
	Remove anachronistic casts of xmalloc, xrealloc, and xcalloc
	return values and of xrealloc's first argument.
	Fix the former with this:
	perl -pi -e 's/\([^(]*?\*\) *(x(m|c|re)alloc)\b/$1/'

2003-04-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stty.c (wrapf): Declare with format attribute.

	The S_MAGIC_... names shouldn't be maintained in two places (prior
	to this change, one would have to keep stat.c and fs.h in sync).
	This change makes it so those names and the corresponding
	hexadecimal constants all reside in stat.c.  fs.h is now generated.
	* src/Makefile.am (fs.h): New rule to generate fs.h from stat.c.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Add fs.h, now that it's generated.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add extract-magic.
	* src/extract-magic: New script to extract fs.h definitions from stat.c.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype) [__linux__]: Append each hex constant from
	fs.h in a comment after the corresponding `case S_MAGIC_...:' statement.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Skip this test (don't fail) if creating a
	file with nominal length > 4GB fails.  Reported by Michael Deutschmann.

	* man/unexpand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to expand.
	* man/expand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to unexpand.
	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2003-04-10  Maciej W. Rozycki  <macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl>

	* src/fs.h (S_MAGIC_DEVPTS): New magic for Linux's devpts.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Handle Linux's devpts.

2003-04-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/split.c (line_bytes_split): Arg is of type size_t, since
	that's all that is supported for now.
	(main): Check for overflow in obsolescent line count option.

2003-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Add a new test for the above fix.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Use size_t temporary (rather than
	uintmax_t original) in remaining computations.  From Paul Eggert.

	Handle command line option arguments larger than 2^31.
	This allows e.g., splitting into files of size 2GB and larger,
	and running split --lines=N with N=2^31 or more.
	But for --line-bytes=N, the restriction that N <= SIZE_MAX
	remains (for now), due to the way it is implemented.

	* src/split.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split, main):
	Use uintmax_t, not size_t, for file sizes.
	(main): Give a better diagnostic for option arguments == 0.
	Use umaxtostr to print file sizes.
	Reported by Luke Hassell.

2003-04-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rm.c (usage): Mention that --directory (-d) works only
	on some systems.  Suggestion from Samuel Tardieu.

	* tests/basename/basic: Run $PERL to see if it is available,
	rather than testing its value.
	* tests/sum/sysv, tests/tsort/basic-1, tests/unexpand/basic-1:
	* tests/basename/basic, tests/dd/skip-seek, tests/dircolors/simple:
	* tests/expr/basic, tests/factor/basic, tests/fmt/basic:
	* tests/ls-2/tests, tests/md5sum/basic-1, tests/md5sum/newline-1:
	* tests/misc/sort, tests/misc/tty-eof, tests/mv/i-1:
	* tests/rm/empty-name, tests/rm/fail-eperm, tests/rm/unreadable:
	* tests/seq/basic, tests/sha1sum/basic-1, tests/sha1sum/sample-vec:
	* tests/sum/basic-1, tests/seq/basic: Likewise.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add split-fail.
	* tests/misc/split-fail: New file.

	* src/split.c: Rename local variables: nchars -> n_bytes.
	(lines_split): Rename local, nlines -> n_lines.
	(main): Rename local variable: s/accum/n_units/.
	(main): Use STDIN_FILENO, not literal `0'.

2003-04-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Add #include directives for Ultrix 4.4.
	Based on a suggested change from Bert Deknuydt.

2003-04-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): New rule.
	(local-check): Add it.

2003-04-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (nearly all of them):
	Use $(VAR) rather than @VAR@, now that we can rely on automake to
	emit a definition for each substituted variable.
	* tests/Makefile.am.in: Likewise.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Add a comment explaining why this test fails when
	using Tru64's broken sed.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

	Make `kill -t' output signal descriptions (not `?') on Tru64.
	* src/kill.c (sys_siglist): Also check for __sys_siglist.
	Patch by Tony Leneis.
	* configure.ac: Also check for declaration of __sys_siglist.
	Required for Tru64 4.0D, 4.0F, and 5.1.
	Reported by Tony Leneis.

2003-04-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove unnecessary definition.

	Because of inappropriate (but POSIX-mandated) behavior of rename,
	`mv a b' would not remove `a' in some unusual cases.  Work around
	this by unlinking `a' when necessary.

	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Add an output parameter.
	Set it in the offending case.
	(copy_internal): When necessary, unlink SRC_PATH and inform caller.
	Reported by Ed Avis.
	* tests/mv/hard-4: New test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-4.

	Clean up rules for automatically generated sources:
	* src/Makefile.am (dircolors.h, wheel-size.h, wheel.h, false.c):
	Make each generated file be read-only.
	Add each file name to BUILT_SOURCES separately.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Set to $(BUILT_SOURCES).

	Put LOCALEDIR macro definition in new file: localedir.h.
	* src/Makefile.am (DEFS): Remove definition.
	(localedir.h): New rule.
	(BUILT_SOURCES, DISTCLEANFILES): Add localedir.h.
	* src/system.h: Include "localedir.h".

2003-04-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add false.

	* Makefile.maint (TMPDIR): Make sure it's defined.
	(my-distcheck): Build in $(TMPDIR), not `.'.

	* src/Makefile.am (false.c): Change all occurrences of
	`(EXIT_SUCCESS)' to `(EXIT_FAILURE)' so that false exits
	unsuccessfully also with --help.  Reported by Paul Jarc,
	* tests/misc/false: New test for the above.

2003-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Note the location of older NEWS files.

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't let a failing closedir
	clobber errno.  Spotted by Arnold Robbins.

	* src/env.c: Fix typo in comment.  From Arnold Robbins.

2003-03-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.12.

	* README: Note to expect build problems for stat.c on Ultrix 4.3.
	Note that there are some harmless test failures when running
	`make check' as root on some systems.

2003-03-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Skip this test if stty can't get window size.
	This happens when connecting to sparc-solaris5.7 via ssh from within
	emacs.  Reported by Karl Berry.

	* tests/du/basic: Use seq, not `yes' to generate 4KB of data.
	Otherwise, on systems (DJGPP) that emulate pipes using files,
	this test would never complete, waiting for `yes' to terminate.
	* tests/du/slink: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate link target.
	* tests/rm/hash: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate dir name.
	Reported by Rich Dawe.

2003-03-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/id.c: Remove Arnold Robbins' obsolete e-mail address
	from `written by...' comment, at his request.

2003-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix buffer overrun problem reported by TAKAI Kousuke, along
	with some other POSIX incompatibilities.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Do not treat \x specially if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.  Avoid buffer overrun if the format ends
	in backslash.  Treat incomplete escape sequences as strings
	of characters, as POSIX requires.
	(print_formatted): Allow multiple flags.  Avoid buffer overrun
	if the format is incomplete.

2003-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the above fixes and changes.

2003-03-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): Add a comment.

2003-03-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Describe problem with 64-bit mode on HPUX 11.x,
	with patch for /usr/include/inttypes.h.
	* TODO: Plan to add an autoconf test to work around the bug.

2003-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Don't include <sys/sysmacros.h>.
	That is already done via system.h.  Otherwise, the multiple
	inclusion would evoke redefinition warnings from Cray's /bin/cc,
	aka Cray Standard C Version 4.0.3  (057126) Mar 22 2003  22:02:28.
	(human_fstype): Factor some directives `up', out of this function.
	Cast away `const' to avoid error from Cray's /bin/cc.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Ensure that a newline
	precedes each row of `*'s.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.11.

	* src/seq.c (valid_format): Also accept ` ' and `'' as valid
	format flag characters.
	Do not require that a field width be specified.
	Do not fail when given a field width of `0'.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/seq/basic: Add new tests for the above-fixed bug.

	* src/Makefile.am (all-local): Append $(EXEEXT) to use of `su'
	(install-root): Likewise.
	(install-exec-local): Likewise.
	Based on a patch from Richard Dawe.

2003-03-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Use $(LN_S) instead of 'ln -s',
	because the DJGPP 2.03 port of 'ln -s' doesn't work.
	Include $(EXEEXT) in program names.
	Since $(LN_S) may degenerate to `cp -p', be careful
	to invoke it from the destination directory.
	Mostly from Richard Dawe.
	* configure.ac: Use AC_PROG_LN_S.

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c [struct Word] (paren, period, punct, final): Change the
	type of each member from bool <MEMBER>:1 to unsigned int <MEMBER>:1.
	AIX 5.1's xlc could not compile the former.
	Patch by Petter Reinholdtsen.  Also reported by Mike Jetzer.

2003-03-17  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Include $(EXEEXT) in OPTIONAL_BIN_PROGS'
	program names, since automake only adds $(EXEEXT) to programs
	in its *_PROGRAMS.

2003-03-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Put two local variables in static storage,
	so they can't be clobbered by the potential longjmp.

2003-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_rel_host): Fix code to match the comment
	so that a version number with a two-digit component can still count
	as an alpha release.  Reported by Richard A Downing.
	(gnu_rel_host): Define in terms of $(RELEASE_TYPE) instead.

2003-03-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ansi2knr.c: Remove no-longer-used file.
	* src/ansi2knr.1: Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (prev_version_file): Don't use ?= for this particular
	assignment, since it causes trouble with old versions of GNU make
	(e.g. 3.76.1).  The other uses of `?=' are inoffensive.  Details here.
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-03/msg00028.html
	Patch from Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

	* Use patched automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate Makefile.in files in
	subdirectories so that each includes a definition of ACLOCAL_M4.

	* announce-gen (main): Label the compressed source URLs.

	* Version 4.5.10.

	* tests/du/slink: Relax the test for the `local'ness of a file system,
	so that now it works also for tmpfs.

	* tests/du/hard-link: Transform output from first du, so that this
	test doesn't fail on file systems like tmpfs that order directory
	entries differently.

2003-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/8gb: Work around what appears to be an NFS failure that
	would make this test fail on some systems.

2003-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file exactly 4k bytes long.

	* src/split.c (longopts): Don't hard-code `2' here.
	Instead, just specify `&verbose', and ...
	(main): ... remove the `case 2:' block for --verbose.

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file larger than 64 bytes, so that
	we don't immediately disqualify file systems (e.g., NetApp) on which
	smaller files take up zero disk blocks.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

2003-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't segfault for a negative field width or precision in format string.
	Note that this is just a stopgap fix.  The longer term solution may
	involve adapting bash's builtins/printf.def.

	* src/printf.c: (UNSPECIFIED): Define.
	(print_direc): Use the special value, UNSPECIFIED, to indicate
	that field_width or precision has not been specified.
	(print_formatted): Fail if field_width or precision is the
	special value, UNSPECIFIED.
	Reported by Oliver Kiddle <okiddle@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/sys2.h (INT_MIN): Define, if necessary.
	* tests/misc/printf: Add a test for the above-fixed bug.

2003-03-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_stack_pop): Cast sizeof... to int before
	changing its sign.  This avoids a warning from gcc on 64-bit systems.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.
	(pop_dir): Reverse order of sign change and cast, to be consistent
	with the above.

2003-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (evar-check): Check for POSIXLY_CORRECT not as a
	shell variable, but only in the environment.  With /bin/sh->bash, the
	shell variable is set to `y', and that would cause a spurious warning.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Remove touch/fifo.
	It doesn't appear to have to be run as root.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Rather than simply using the first non-root
	user name, make sure that the selected user name has a usable shell.
	Reported by Paul Jarc.

	Before, when using shred on a device, one had to specify --exact,
	or be careful to choose a size that would not be rounded up and
	exceed the maximum value;  that could result in a failure of
	the final write.
	* src/shred.c (do_wipefd): --exact is now the default for non-regular
	files.  Suggestion from Ben Elliston.
	(usage): Say it.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Require at least version 1.11 of Expect.pm.
	Old versions of Expect.pm (e.g., 1.07) lack the log_user function.
	Patch by Bob Proulx.

	* src/Makefile.am (check-misc): Check for use of `defined' in
	#define directives.
	Change to $(srcdir) before running grep.

	* src/sleep.c: Remove now-unused #include and #define directives.

	* src/du.c (process_file): If a file's size is not being counted
	e.g., because it's a hard link to a file we've already counted,
	then don't print a line for it.

	* tests/du/hard-link: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-link.

	`du -S' didn't work
	* src/du.c: Revert most of the `reorganization' change of 2003-02-20,
	and make the two-array approach work.

	* tests/du/basic: Correct/add tests for the above fix.
	Set LC_ALL, etc., now that we use sort.
	Check the block/size of a small file, too.
	Correct expected results for simple dir1/dir2/file case.
	Add another test of du -S.

2003-03-07  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Avoid build failure with gcc on hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20 (see GCC PR
	middle-end/9986).  As one of GCC's optimizations, it transforms a
	fputs_unlocked call to a fputc_unlocked call when the string is
	one character long.  However, hpux doesn't have fputc_unlocked.

	* expr.c (usage): Use putchar, not fputs, to output a single character.
	* ls.c (dired_dump_obstack): Likewise.
	* ptx.c (output_one_tex_line, output_one_dumb_line): Likewise.
	* stat.c (print_it): Likewise.

2003-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the two changes of 2003-02-21.
	* src/du.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the change of 2003-02-19.

2003-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.9.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Remove pointless comparison of unsigned
	integer with zero, to avoid a warning from Intel's ecc.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Sizes must all be of type uintmax_t.
	Otherwise, for files or totals that are too big, numbers would
	be truncated.  Patch mostly by Michael Stone.
	Reported by Ingo Saitz as Debian bug #183210.

	* tests/du/8gb: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add 8gb.

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Use 3 * UTILS_OPEN_MAX / 4
	rather than UTILS_OPEN_MAX - 10.

2003-03-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Refer new feature discussion to bug-coreutils@gnu.org,
	rather than bug-gnu-utils, now that the former is better known.
	Suggestion from Gran Uddeborg.

	* src/stat.c (usage): Capitalize consistently.
	Reported by Gran Uddeborg.

	* Makefile.maint (rel-files): Include $(signatures), so that
	those files are also copied into $(release_archive_dir).

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Call error here, now that restore_cwd
	no longer does it.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Likewise.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Add fail-2eperm.

2003-03-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Include the full filename of
	the offending file, not just the basename.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Set $ME properly.

	* Makefile.maint (THIS_VERSION_REGEXP, PREV_VERSION_REGEXP):
	Remove now-unused variables.
	(tag-prev-version, prev-cvs-tag): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries) [!ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS]: Give an
	accurate diagnostic when failing to remove a file owned by some other
	user.  Reported by Ivo Timmermans via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian bug# 178471.

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-2eperm.
	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a report from Ivo Timmermans.

2003-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [un_backup]: When recovering from a
	failure to create a hard link, do not remove the entry associating
	the source dev/ino with the destination file name.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-3.
	* tests/mv/hard-3: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Inspired by a report from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-03-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/df.c (print_header): Don't embed spaces in a separate `Type'
	header string.  Instead, put `Filesystem' and `Type' headers in the
	same string, so translators can use horizontal space as needed.
	Reported by Jean Charles Delepine.

2003-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When link fails because of an
	existing destination file, unlink that file and try again.
	Reported by Iida Yosiaki.

	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-2.
	* tests/mv/hard-2: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a test case from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-02-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Don't test du's -b option here.  Directory byte
	counts are smaller (512 rather than 4096) on at least OSF/1 5.1
	and IBM AIX 4.2.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-02-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that ChangeLog entries
	are output by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): New function.
	(main): Use it.

2003-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: New option: --release-type=TYPE
	* Makefile.maint (beta, major): New targets.  Remove `release'.
	Put them all together on a line.
	Pass the release type (via RELEASE_TYPE envvar) to the MAKE
	invocation of `announcement'.
	(announcement): Invoke announce-gen with --release-type=$RELEASE_TYPE.

	* announce-gen: New option: --news=NEWS_FILE.
	Extract NEWS entries here, not via rules in Makefile.maint.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that NEWS entries are
	extracted by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	(news-r1, news-r2): Remove now-unused definitions.

2003-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.8.

	Merge in changes from autoconf's version of this file.
	* Makefile.maint (www-gnu): Define.
	(standards.texi-url_prefix): Use $(www-gnu).
	(make-stds.texi-url_prefix): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(main): Invoke `run' through a macro that (when possible) runs it
	with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/cp.c (run): New function, preparing for the above.
	Exit from this function, not from main
	(main): Call run.

	* src/du.c: New option: --apparent-size.
	(enum) [APPARENT_SIZE_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add it.
	(usage): Describe it.
	(main): Handle it.
	['b']: Set apparent_size.
	David Eisner reported that the behavior of --bytes had changed.
	Paul Eggert proposed the use of a new option, --apparent-size.

	* src/du.c (apparent_size): New global.
	(print_only_size): Reflect the fact that we're printing byte counts,
	not ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte-block counts.
	(print_size): Call print_only_size rather than duplicating its code.
	(process_file): Accumulate byte counts, rather than block counts.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Always reset size_to_propagate_to_parent
	for --separate-dirs (-S).

2003-02-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): New format: %B (to print ST_NBLOCKSIZE).
	This makes %b (number of ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte blocks) more useful.
	(usage) [%B]: Describe it.
	[%b]: Refer to %B.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Reorganize the code to use only
	one `sum' array, and change how -S works back to the way it was
	before 2003-01-31.  Patch by Bruno Haible.

	* tests/du/basic: New test.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add basic.

	* tests/envvar-check: Add checks for the following:
	BLOCK_SIZE, DU_BLOCK_SIZE, DF_BLOCK_SIZE, LS_BLOCK_SIZE.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Rename phony target envvar-check to evar-check
	so as not to conflict with the distributed file by the same name.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Set info->skip before any possible return.

	Report correct usage for directories, not 0.
	* src/du.c (process_file): Return for `file_type == FTW_DPRE'
	_before_ recording the dev/ino of a directory.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	Now, df always displays the device file name corresponding to the
	listed mount point under `Filesystem'.  Before, for an unmounted
	block- or character-special file argument, it would display the
	command-line argument instead.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Return a value indicating whether
	there was a match.  Don't try to find a mount point here.
	(show_entry): If show_disk doesn't find a match, call show_point.

2003-02-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(du_files): Add prototype with ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN.
	Exit from this function, not from...
	(main): ...here.
	Instead, if possible, invoke du_files through a macro that
	runs it with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/join.c (usage): Change wording in --help output:
	use FILENUM instead of `SIDE' and say what FILENUM means.
	Reported by Bernhard Gabler.

	* src/df.c (print_header): Rather than using a hard-coded literal
	string of spaces matching the length of the English `...Type' header,
	output the right number of spaces to match the selected translation.
	Reported by Yann Dirson and Jean Charles Delepine as Debian bug 131113.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Remove unnecessary `else' after break.
	(lines_split): Likewise.  and correct misleading indentation.

	* src/split.c: Include "full-read.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split): Use full_read,
	not safe_read.   The way split was using the latter, a short read
	could cause split to terminate before EOF.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Test all programs that can read stdin,
	requiring no arguments and that write to standard output.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: New file.  Renamed from ...
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Remove file.  Rename to tty-eof.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

2003-02-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cksum would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Exit the loop upon EOF, too.
	Patch by Michael Bacarella.

	Test for the bug fixed today in cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum.
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Generalize, clean-up, and test for
	cat, cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum all in the same loop.

2003-02-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c: Include "euidaccess.h".
	Remove declaration of euidaccess.

2003-02-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (portable_chars_only): Remove unnecessary `const'
	in cast to avoid warning from icc.  Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

2003-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c: Don't include group-member.h.
	Include euidaccess.h.
	(eaccess): Rewrite function to set the real uid and gid temporarily
	to the effective uid and gid, then invoke 'access', and then set the
	real uid and gid back.  On systems that lack setreuid or setregid,
	fall back on the kludges in euidaccess.  Before, it would not work
	for e.g., files with ACLs, files that were marked immutable,
	or on file systems mounted read-only.  Nelson Beebe raised the issue.
	Paul Eggert suggested the new implementation.

2003-02-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (test_stat): Remove function.  It's job is done (only
	when necessary) by the wrapper in lib/stat.c.  Adjust all uses.

2003-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.7.

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Don't assume that the file owner username
	length is less than 9 in ls output: instead, omit that field
	altogether.  Reported by, and suggested fix from, Ferdinand.

	* tests/du/restore-wd: New test for just-fixed bug in ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add restore-wd.

	* src/rm.c: Correct now-invalid comment about cycle-detection.

2003-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Add entries from old/*/NEWS
	from fileutils-4.1 through 4.1.11 and
	from sh-utils-2.0 through 2.0.15.  Suggestion from Karl Berry.

	* Version 4.5.6.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't return early for excluded files
	or for files whose dev/inode we've already seen.

2003-02-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/exclude: New file.

	* src/who.c (print_boottime, print_deadprocs, print_runlevel):
	Fix memory allocation arithmetic.

2003-02-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`df /dev/block-or-char-device-file--not-mounted' now reports
	the name of the file system on which the file resides, usually `/'.
	Before, it would leave the `Mounted on' field blank.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Move function to precede find_mount_point.
	(show_disk): Add parameter: STATP.
	If we don't find a matching device name, then resort to calling
	find_mount_point.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

2003-02-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* tests/rm/cycle: Require non-root.
	* tests/rm/isatty: Likewise.

2003-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.5.

	* man/Makefile.am (check-x-vs-1): Use @PATH_SEPARATOR@, not `:'.

	Ensure that there are no offending uses of `:'.
	* Makefile.maint (makefile_path_separator_check): New rule.
	(local-check): Add it to the list.

2003-02-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Define.

	* src/stat.c (G_fail): New global.
	(human_time): Diagnose failed localtime, not failed nstrftime.
	(main): Fail if G_fail is set.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* tests/basename/Makefile.am: Use @PATH_SEPARATOR@ instead of
	hard-coding the path-separator.  Also double-quote the new PATH,
	to avoid problems when the path-separator is a semi-colon or when
	`pwd` contains e.g. a space.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Include "file-type.h"
	(print_human_type): Remove function.
	(human_access): Rename from print_human_access.  Return a string.
	(human_time): Rename from print_human_time.  Return a string.
	(print_stat): Arrange so that field width and an alignment specifier
	are honored for the %A, %F, %x, %y, and %z formats.
	[%F]: Use file_type; this gives slightly different file type strings,
	e.g., `directory' instead of `Directory' and `regular file' or
	`regular empty file' instead of `Regular file'.
	Prompted by a report from Richard Dawe that the uses of
	S_IFSOCK and S_IFIFO in print_human_time were not portable
	to systems using e.g., DJGPP.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Use S_ISLNK rather than an explicit
	test using S_IFMT and S_IFLNK.  S_IFLNK may not be defined.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Upon processing an invalid option or an invalid
	--exclude-from or --max-depth option argument, don't exit right away,
	in case there are others.  Rather record the failure and exit after
	processing other options.

	* GNUmakefile (TAR_OPTIONS): Set and export, in order to make
	tar archive easier to reproduce.

	Rewrite to perform directory traversal using nftw.

	* src/du.c: Include "dirname.h", "ftw.h", and "quotearg.h".
	(AUTHORS): Add self.
	(opt_one_file_system): Move global into `main'.

2003-01-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Ensure that du/ftw follows a command-line
	symlink-to-directory with -L, even without the trailing slash.

2003-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (check-misc): Check for st_blocks, too.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Use ST_NBLOCKS rather than `->st_blocks'.
	Reported by Richard Dawe.

2003-01-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Add fourth parameter, width, into which to
	store the screen columns, and return the number of bytes instead.
	(print_dir): Pass NULL as fourth parameter of quote_name.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Likewise.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Get the width from the fourth
	parameter of quote_name instead of return value.

2003-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): If `dired' is set without
	`format == long_format', then silently reset dired.  This doesn't
	change the behavior of ls (all prior uses of dired were protected
	by `&& format == long_format'), and lets us...
	(DIRED_INDENT): ... remove the `format == long_format' conjunct.
	(PUSH_CURRENT_DIRED_POS): Likewise.
	(main): Likewise.

2003-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/no-x: New test, for functionality added to lib/ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-x.

2003-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry) [ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS
	&& HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: If a file has d_type == DT_UNKNOWN
	it may still be a directory -- or not (e.g., with FreeBSD on an
	NFS-mounted file system), so resort to calling lstat to find out.
	Based on a patch by Michael van Elst.

	* tests/cp/same-file: Don't assume that the file owner username
	length is less than 9 in ls output: instead, omit that field
	altogether.  Reported by, and suggested fix from, Ferdinand.

2003-01-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date/Test.pm (wide-fmt): New test to demonstrate that
	large format widths no longer cause strftime to infloop.

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Remove now-unused definition.

2003-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/readlink.c: Include "canonicalize.h".

2003-01-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (Dereference_symlink) [DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR]:
	New member.
	(enum) [DEREFERENCE_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add option --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(main): Make DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR be the default,
	rather than DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS, when none of the
	-d, -F, -l options is specified.
	(decode_switches): Handle --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(gobble_file): Honor DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR.
	Change --dereference-command-line (-H) to dereference *all*
	command line arguments, including broken symlinks.

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Change ls -H back to the way it was yesterday, since this is
	compatible with FreeBSD and the POSIX spec is confusing
	and somewhat contradictory.

	* src/ls.c (DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS): Change name back
	from DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR, updating all uses.
	(long_options): Change the long option name back.
	(usage): Change the usage back.
	(gobble_file): When -H is specified, dereference a top-level
	arg even if it points to a non-directory.

2003-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fall back on using lstat when required:
	when --dereference (-L) is not specified, and
	- when operating on a dangling symlink
	- when operating on command-line-symlink-to-directories
	This fixes numerous problems.  Here are examples:
	- `ls dangling-symlink' would fail with `no such file...'
	Now it prints `dangling-symlink'.
	- `ls -i symlink' would mistakenly print the inode of the referent.
	Now it prints the inode of the symlink.  Likewise for --size (-s).
	Based on a patch from Michael Stone.
	Reported by Deepak Goel as Debian bug #173793.

	Rename ls's --dereference-command-line (-H)
	option to   --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	* src/ls.c [enum Dereference_symlink]
	(DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR): Rename from
	DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS.  Update all uses.
	(long_options): Rename the long option.
	(usage): Say that --dereference-... changes how ls treats
	only symlinks to directories specified on the command line.

	Patch by Michael Stone.  Reported by Stephen Depooter as
	Debian bug 175135.

2002-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove definition (to ansi2knr)

	* ls.c (gobble_file): Remove the block of code that caused
	`ls --color -F symlink-to-dir' to list the files in
	`symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now, it prints `symlink-to-dir@', (just
	like `ls -F symlink-to-dir') but with the addition of highlighting.
	Similarly, `ls --color -dF symlink-to-dir' would print
	`symlink-to-dir/';  now it prints `symlink-to-dir@'.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #168203.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (sl-F-color, sl-dF-color): New tests for the above.

	ls is now more efficient: with certain options, it no longer needs

	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Add DT_LNK and DT_REG.
	(main): Make --recursive set format_needs_type, not format_needs_stat.

	the empty string.
	(count_entry): When appending a file name component,

	Franois Pinard reported that `du symlink-to-dir/' was not
	equivalent to `du symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now it is.
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: New file/test, for the above fix.

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Make optional.
	(announcement): Use the new variable.

	* Makefile.maint: Sync with Bison, i.e.:
	(po-check): Scan .l and .y files instead of the
	.c and the .h files that they generate.  This fixes the bug
	reported by Tim Van Holder in:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bison-patches/2002-November/001352.html>
	Look for N_ as well as for _.  Try to avoid matching #define for

	at most two hex. digits, not three.  Reported by Padraig Brady.
	(usage): Update description.
	* tests/misc/printf-hex: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-10-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for locale-specific size indications (e.g.,
	thousands-separators) and for explicit size suffixes on output.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Block size): Say that:
	This affects display format as well as block size.
	Fractional block counts are rounded up.
	ls file size blocksize defaults to 1.
	A block size spec preceded by ' generates thousands separators.
	A suffix without a preceding integer generates suffixes.
	(tail invocation): 32k -> 32 KiB.
	(What information is listed): ls -h is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=human, and ls -H is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=si.  Displayed file size is now always affected by
	--block-size.

	* lib/inttostr.c, lib/inttostr.h, lib/imaxtostr.c, lib/offtostr.c,
	lib/umaxtostr.c: New files, taken from GNU tar.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add imaxtostr.c, offtostr.c,
	umaxtostr.c.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add inttostr.c.

	* lib/human.c, lib/human.h: Rewrite to support locale-specific
	notations like thousands separators.
	Specify what includer of include.h must include beforehand.
	(human_group_digits, human_suppress_point_zero, human_autoscale,
	human_base_1024, human_SI, human_B): New enum values.
	(human_readable): Rename from human_readable_inexact; put the
	options before the sizes.  All uses changed.  The old human_readable
	function has been removed; use inttostr.h instead.
	(human_options): Renamed from human_block_size, with new signature
	that allows block sizes up to UINTMAX_MAX.  All callers changed.

	* m4/prereq.m4 (jm_PREREQ_HUMAN): Check for locale.h, localeconv,
	AC_HEADER_STDBOOL.  No need to check for limits.h since it's in
	freestanding C89.  No need to check for stdlib.h or string.h since
	autoconf does this now.

	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Use primitives from inttostr.h, not
	human.h, to print large numbers simply.
	* src/csplit.c (handle_line_error, parse_patterns): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (print_stats, main): Likewise.
	* src/df.c (print_header): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c (write_counts, wc): Likewise.

	* src/df.c (human_output_opts): New var.
	(output_block_size): Now uintmax_t, not int, to handle larger
	block sizes.  All uses changed.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.

	* src/df.c (print_header): In the header line, prefer SI to human
	representation if it's shorter; if neither is shorter, try to
	intuit what the user would prefer.

	* src/expr.c (inttostr): Remove; use new imaxtostr library
	function instead.

	* src/ls.c (file_output_block_size): New var, to distinguish
	file sizes from other sizes.
	(decode_switches): Set it.

	* src/shred.c (OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE): remove.
	(dopass): When printing progress, use floor for what has been done
	so far (since we should be conservative there), and ceiling for
	what needs to be done (since that's what other programs use).

2002-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pinky.c (print_heading): Align TTY and Name headings.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

2002-10-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use safe_read, not stdread.
	(main): Add some FIXME comments to remind me to remove casts.

	* src/system.h (ST_BLKSIZE): Correct comment describing how to
	reproduce HPUX-11 cat failure.  From Petter Reinholdtsen.

2002-10-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a problem that could make e.g., `cat' misbehave on systems which
	give invalid (unreasonably large) values for stat.st_blksize.
	* src/system.h (ST_BLKSIZE): Ensure that the result is in [1..4MB].
	Reported by Petter Reinholdtsen.

2002-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Specifying a printf conversion specifer as nl's separator string
	could cause nl to segfault.
	* src/nl.c (build_print_fmt): Don't include separator string
	in the printf format; it might contain `%'.
	Use a better bound on the length of the print_fmt buffer.
	(print_lineno): Print the separator here instead.

	Reported by Michal Svec.  Based on a patch by Andreas Schwab.

	* src/Makefile.am (../AUTHORS): New target/rule.

2002-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Declare local, `delims_saved', to be
	of type size_t, since that's the way it's used and avoids a warning.

	* src/csplit.c (struct cstring) [len]: Declare to be unsigned int,
	since that's how it's always used and avoids a new warning from gcc.
	(read_input): Adapt to new safe_read ABI.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Add a temporary size_t variable, n_bytes,
	to avoid warnings.

	* src/pinky.c (print_long_entry): fread returns size_t.
	Declare local `bytes' accordingly, to avoid warning.

	tail -c +N would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	[this change is analogous (bytes vs. lines) to the one of 2002-01-27]
	* src/tail.c (start_bytes): Detect EOF, inform caller.
	(tail_bytes): Upon EOF in start_bytes, return immediately.
	(file_lines): Reorganize to use memrchr rather than an explicit loop.

	* tests/cp/backup-is-src: Ensure that certain environment variables
	are not set (e.g., SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX).  Reported by Duncan Roe.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Mark this as an expensive test; it would
	consume 4GB of disk space on systems without support for sparse files.
	Fix a logic error that'd make it `cat err' even though dd didn't fail.

	* src/dircolors.hin (.jar): Fix typo: s/;3$/;31/.
	Patch by steven@magelico.net, forwarded by Michael Stone.

	* tests/ls/dired: Ensure that ls produces English messages.

	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add slink.
	* tests/du/slink: New test for system.h change of 2002-08-31.

	In move mode, always first try to rename.  Before, upon failure to
	rename a directory, this code would never attempt to rename any
	other file in that directory, but would thenceforth always copy.
	On some systems (e.g., NetApp's OnTap-6.4), renaming a directory
	may fail with EXDEV, yet renaming files within that directory to
	a newly-created destination directory succeeds.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Remove local, move_mode;
	use x->move_mode instead.  Based on a patch from Tom Haynes.

2002-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/split.c (FAIL_ONLY_ONE_WAY): New macro.

	compiler warnings.
	(fillbuf, keycompare): Cast literal `-1' to size_t in comparisons,
	to avoid compiler warnings.

	* src/shred.c (dopass): Use a uintmax_t temporary to avoid bogus
	compiler warnings.

	Fix things so `mkdir -p' can create very deep directories, e.g.,
	mkdir -p $(perl -e 'print "a/" x 40000') now works.
	* src/mkdir.c (main): For --parents (-p), call make_path with the
	entire directory name, so we don't ever require that file operations
	like stat or chmod be performed on the entire command line argument.
	* makepath.c (make_path): Restore umask *before* creating the final
	component.

2002-09-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/rmdir.c: Include "dirname.h", for declaration of
	strip_trailing_slashes.

	since it's already included from sys2.h via system.h.

	* Use automake-1.6f.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove duplicate definition.

	fmt's -s, -t, -c options didn't work properly for long lines.
	Since get_line may end up calling put_paragraph (for long lines),
	be sure to set global, `other_indent', before it is used there.

	* src/fmt.c (set_other_indent): New function, factored out of...
	(get_paragraph): ... here.  Call it.
	(get_line): Call set_other_indent before calling flush_paragraph,
	which calls fmt_paragraph, which in turn calls put_paragraph,
	which uses other_indent.

	* tests/fmt/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add long-line.
	* tests/fmt/long-line: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-09-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Likewise for the o8 and u8 formats.
	* src/od.c (ISPEC_TO_FORMAT): Define macro.
	(decode_one_format): Use PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, etc. for LONG_LONG.
	Reported by Arun Sharma.

2002-09-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, PRIuMAX, PRIxMAX): Define if necessary.

	* src/md5sum.c: Change type of global, digest_hex_bytes, to size_t
	to avoid warnings about `comparison between signed and unsigned'.
	(split_3): Change parameter names to be readable and add comment.
	Clean up the test for whether a line may be ignored.

2002-09-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/printf.c (main): Handle leading command line argument of `--'.

	This reverts the change of 2000-01-30.
	Based on a report and patch from Neil Brown via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian Bug#156358.

	* Most files: Change `exit (0)' to `exit (EXIT_SUCCESS)',
	`exit (1)' to `exit (EXIT_FAILURE)', and

	Fix some minor time-related bugs with POSIX time arguments.
	Some valid time stamps were being rejected (notably -1, and
	time stamps before 1900 on 64-bit hosts).  And some invalid
	time stamps were being accepted, e.g. September 31.

	* src/date.c (main): Adjust to posixtime signature change.
	* src/touch.c (main): Likewise.  Remove unnecessary initialization.
	Use localtime, not posixtm, to warn about obsolete "touch".

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nice and pathchk1.

2002-08-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (check-README): New target/rule.
	(check): Depend on it.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add old/Makefile and old/*/Makefile.

2002-08-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add old.
	* old/: New directory, containing legacy ChangeLog* and NEWS files
	from the fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Set to false.

2002-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: uniq now obeys LC_COLLATE.

	* src/uniq.c: Include hard-locale.h, xmemcoll.h.
	(hard_LC_COLLATE): New var.
	(different): Args are now char *, not const char *.
	Use xmemcoll instead of memcmp to compare lines, so that
	LC_COLLATE has effect.  However, use memcmp if it is an
	easy locale.
	(check_file): Do not include newline in comparison, so that
	xmemcoll has a byte to stomp on temporarily.
	(main): Set hard_LC_COLLATE.

2002-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove djgpp, for now.

2002-07-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (false.c): Convert only the final EXIT_SUCCESS
	into EXIT_FAILURE.  Otherwise, false --help and false --version
	would fail.

2002-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (uninstall-local): Search for @GNU_PACKAGE@,
	rather than the hard-coded `sh-utils'.

2002-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Merge the three files from fileutils,
	textutils, and sh-utils.
	* Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* src/Makefile.am: Likewise.
