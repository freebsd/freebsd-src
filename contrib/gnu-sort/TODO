Tasks for GNU textutils (listed in no particular order):

  write texinfo documentation for sha1sum

  Something that I would really appreciate is if someone would run the
  Open Group's VSC-lite test suite against the fileutils and textutils
  and report the failures.

    http://www.opengroup.org/testing/downloads/vsclite.html

  I've been meaning to do it myself for months, but haven't found the time.
  There's a bit of set-up required, some of which requires root access, e.g.,
  to create a few test user accounts and some test groups.
  ------------------

  uniq: remove support for obsolescent +N syntax

  add tests for od
  add some endian-aware tests for od

  tac: Set DONT_UNLINK_WHILE_OPEN when necessary.

  tail: add an option so that using -f on N files doesn't monopolize
    N file descriptors

  tac: add options to help handle boundary cases
     E.g., options to distinguish DELIM_STRING is
        - starter    (see existing --before option)
        - terminator (this is what most people expect wrt NEWLINE
        - separator  (this would make `echo -n a:b:c|tac -s:' print `c:b:a')

  tail: support -r option by librarifying tac and using that

  cut: maybe add an option to say `fields are separated by whitespace'.
     Of course, that isn't really necessary because you can preprocess
     cut's input with tr to get the same effect:

        echo 'a     b     c' |tr -s '[:blank:]' | cut -d ' ' -f 2

  Another feature that I would sometimes find useful: change -c so that
  it will report up to N instances of disorder before bailing out, where
  N defaults to 1 but can be set to infinity or to some finite value by
  another option.  (An "instance of disorder" is two adjacent lines that
  are malsorted; this does not imply that swapping them or removing one
  or both would cause the list to be sorted.  (1 3 5 7 9 0 2 4 6 8) has
  just one instance of disorder.)

  Subject: small project suggestion

  Someone should rewrite the "sum" utility to give a choice of
  different checksum algorithms (it's poorly organized for that now).
  An experienced programmer could probably do it in a day or so,
  or it might be a good, self-contained project for someone who is
  just getting started.

  Algorithms that it should include are:
    -- the POSIX algorithm
    -- the BSD algorithm
    -- CRC32 algorithm (used by pkzip)
    -- CRC16 (used in TCP/IP)
    -- possibly other CRC's (like the different CCITT polynomials)
    -- SHA-1 and MD5 cryptographic hashes (replacing "md5sum").
  and possibly:
    -- DSA digital signature based on secret key generated from
       a passphrase (prompt the user, or read an environment variable).


---------------------

comm: add an option-enable check for sortedness of input files

---------------------

uniq: add a more flexible key selection mechanism

---------------------

Charles Randall <crandall@matchlogic.com>
is working on making sort more suitable and efficient for very
large sets of input data.
