.SH DESCRIPTION
The command
.I ee
is a simple screen oriented text editor.
It is always in text insertion mode unless there is a prompt at the bottom
of the terminal, or a menu present (in a box in the middle of the terminal).
The command
.I ree
is the same as
.I ee,
but restricted to editing the named file (no file operations, or shell escapes
are allowed).
.PP
An editor with similar user-friendly qualities but more features is available
and is called
.I aee.
.PP
For
.I ee
to work properly, the environment variable
.SM TERM
must be set to indicate the type of terminal being used.
For example, for an
.SM HP 700/92
terminal, the
.SM TERM
variable should be set to "70092".
See your System Administrator if you need more information.

.SS Options
The following options are available from the command line:
.PP
.TP 4
.B -e
Turns off expansion of tab character to spaces.
.TP
.B -i
Turns off display of information window at top of terminal.
.TP
.B -h
Turns off highlighting of borders of windows and menus (improves performance on
some terminals).
.TP
.B +#
Moves the cursor to line '#' at startup.

.\"
.\"     control keys
.\"
.SS "Control keys"
To do anything other than insert text, the user must use the control keys (the
.B Control
key, represented by a "^",  pressed in conjunction with an
alphabetic key, e.g., ^a) and function keys available on the keyboard
(such as
.BR "Next Page" ", " "Prev Page" ,
arrow keys, etc.).
.PP
Since not all terminals have function keys,
.I ee
has the basic cursor movement functions assigned to control keys as well as more
intuitive keys on the keyboard when available.
For instance, to move the cursor up, the user can use the up arrow key, or
.BR ^u .

.SS "EMACS keys mode"
.PP
Since many shells provide an Emacs mode (for cursor movement and other editing
operations), some bindings that may be more useful for people familiar with those
bindings have been provided.
These are accessible via the
.B settings
menu, or via the initialization file (see below).
The mappings are as follows:
.RS

.SS "Menu Operations"
.PP
Pop-up menus can be obtained by pressing the
.B escape
key (or
.B ^[
if no
.B escape
key is present).
When in the menu, the escape key can be used to leave the menu without performing
any operations.
Use the up and down arrow keys, or
.B ^u
for moving up and
.B ^d
for moving down to move to the desired items in the menu, then press
.B return
to perform the indicated task.
.PP
To the left of each menu item is a letter, which if the corresponding letter is pressed
on the keyboard selects that menu entry.
.PP
The main menu in \fIee\fR is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBleave editor\fR"
If changes have been made, the user will get a menu prompting whether or not the
changes should be saved.
.IP "\fBhelp\fR"
Displays a help screen, with all of the keyboard operations and commands.
.IP "\fBfile operations\fR"
Pops up a menu for selecting whether to read a file, write to a file, or
save the current contents of the editor, as well as send the contents of
the editor to a print command (see the section \fBInitializing ee from a
file\fR).
.IP "\fBredraw screen\fR"
Provides a means to repaint the screen if the screen has been corrupted.
.IP "\fBsettings\fR"
Shows the current values of the operating modes, and right margin.  By
pressing return when the cursor is on a particular item, the value can be
changed.
To leave this menu, press the \fBescape\fR key.  (See \fBModes\fR below.)
.IP "\fBsearch\fR"
.br
Pops up a menu in which the user may choose to enter a string to search
for, or search for a string already entered.
.IP "\fBmiscellaneous\fR"
Pops up a menu that allows the user to format the current paragraph,
execute a shell command, or check the spelling of the text in the editor.
.RE
.\"
.\"     paragraph formatting
.\"
.SS "Paragraph Formatting"
.PP
Paragraphs are defined for \fIee\fR by a block of text bounded by:
.sp 
.RS 8
.IP \(bu
Begin or end of file.
.IP \(bu
Line with no characters, or only spaces and/or tabs.
.IP \(bu
Line starting with a period ('.') or right angle bracket ('>').
.RE
.PP
A paragraph may be formatted two ways:  explicitly by choosing the
\fBformat paragraph\fR menu item, or by setting \fIee\fR to automatically
format paragraphs.  The automatic mode may be set via a menu, or via the
initialization file.
.PP
There are three states for text operation in \fIee\fR: free-form, margins,
and automatic formatting.
.PP
"Free-form" is best used for things like programming.  There are no
restrictions on the length of lines, and no formatting takes place.
.PP
"Margins" allows the user to type in text without having to worry about going
beyond the right margin (the right margin may be set in the \fBsettings\fR
menu, the default is for the margin to be the right edge of the terminal).
This is the mode that allows the \fBformat paragraph\fR menu item to work.
.PP
"Automatic formatting" provides word-processor-like behavior.
The user may type in text, while \fIee\fR will make sure the entire paragraph fits
within the width of the terminal every time the user inserts a space after
typing or deleting text.
Margin observation must also be enabled in order for automatic formatting to occur.
.\"
.\"     modes
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
Although ee is a 'modeless' editor (it is in text insertion mode all the
time), there are modes in some of the things it does.
These include:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBtab expansion\fR"
Tabs may be inserted as a single tab character, or replaced with spaces.
.IP "\fBcase sensitivity\fR"
The search operation can be sensitive to whether characters are upper- or
lower-case, or ignore case completely.
.IP "\fBmargins observed\fR"
Lines can either be truncated at the right margin, or extend on forever.
.IP "\fBauto paragraph formatting\fR"
While typing in text, the editor can try to keep it looking reasonably well
within the width of the screen.
.IP "\fBeightbit characters\fR"
Toggles whether eight bit characters are displayed as their value in angle
brackets (e.g. "<220>") or as a character.
.IP "\fBinfo window\fR"
A window showing the keyboard operations that can be performed can be
displayed or not.
.IP "\fBemacs keys\fR"
Control keys may be given bindings similar to emacs, or not.
.IP "\fB16 bit characters\fR"
Toggles whether sixteen bit characters are handled as one 16-bit quantity or
two 8-bit quantities.  This works primarily with the Chinese Big 5 code set.
.RE
.PP
You may set these modes via the initialization file (see below), or with a
menu (see above).
.\"
.\"     spell checking
.\"
.SS "Spell Checking"
.PP
There are two ways to have the spelling in the text checked from \fIee\fR.
One is by the traditional \fIspell\fR(1) command, the other is with the
optional \fIispell\fR(1) command.
.PP
Using \fIspell\fR, the words that are not recognized will be placed at the top
of the file.  For the \fIispell\fR option, the file is written to disk,
then \fIispell\fR run on the file, and the file read back in once
\fIispell\fR has completed making changes to the file.
.\"
.\"     printing
.\"
.SS "Printing the contents of the editor"
.PP
The user may select a menu item which prints the contents of the editor.
.I ee
pipes the text in the editor to the command specified by the initialization
command
.B printcommand
(see the section
.B Initializing ee from a file below).
The default is to send the contents to "lp".
.PP
Whatever the user assigns to
.B printcommand
must take input from standard input.
See your system administrator for more details.
.\"
.\"     shell operations
.\"
.SS "Shell operations"
.PP
Shell commands can be executed from within
.I ee
by selecting the
.B shell command
item in the
.B miscellaneous
menu, or by placing an exclamation mark ("!") before the command to
execute at the
.B command:
prompt.
Additionally, the user may direct the contents of the edit buffer out to
a shell operation (via a pipe) by using the left angle bracket
(">"), followed by a "!" and the shell command to execute.
The output of a shell operation can also be directed into the
edit buffer by using a right angle bracket ("<") before the exclamation mark.
These can even be used together to send output to a shell operation and
read back the results into the editor.
So, if the editor contained a list of words to be sorted, they could be
sorted by typing the following at the command prompt:
.RS 4
.sp
><!sort
.sp
.RE
This would send the contents of the editor to be piped into the
.I sort
utility and the result would be placed into the edit buffer at the current
cursor location.
The old information would have to be deleted by the user.

.\"     initializing ee from a file
.\"
.SS "Initializing ee from a file"
.PP
Since different users have different preferences, \fIee\fR allows some
slight configurability.
There are three possible locations for an initialization file for ee:
the file \fI/usr/share/misc/init.ee\fR, the file \fI.init.ee\fR in the
user's home directory, or the file \fI.init.ee\fR in the current directory
(if different from the home directory).
This allows system administrators to set some preferences for the users on a
system-wide basis (for example, the \fBprint\fR command), and the user to customize
settings for particular directories (like one for correspondence, and a
different directory for programming).
.PP
The file \fI\/usr/share/misc/init.ee\fR is read first, then
\fI$HOME/.init.ee\fR, then \fI.init.ee\fR, with the settings specified by the most
recent file read taking precedence.
.PP
The following items may be entered in the initialization file:
.RS 4
.IP \fBcase\fR
Sets searches to be case sensitive.
.IP \fBnocase\fR
Sets searches to be insensitive to case (default).
.IP \fBexpand\fR
Causes \fIee\fR to expand tabs to spaces (default).
.IP \fBnoexpand\fR
Causes \fIee\fR to insert tabs as a single character.
.IP \fBinfo\fR
A small information window is displayed at the top of the terminal (default).
.IP \fBnoinfo\fR
Turns off the display of the information window.
.IP \fBmargins\fR
Causes \fIee\fR to truncate lines at the right margin when the cursor passes
beyond the right margin as set by the user while text is being inserted (default).
.IP \fBnomargins\fR
Allows lines to extend beyond the right margin.
.IP \fBautoformat\fR
Causes \fIee\fR to automatically try to format the current paragraph while
text insertion is occurring.
.IP \fBnoautoformat\fR
Turns off automatic paragraph formatting (default).
.IP \fBprintcommand\fR
Allows the setting of the print command (default: "lp").
.IP \fBrightmargin\fR
The user can select a value for the right margin (the first column on the screen is zero).
.IP \fBhighlight\fR
Turns on highlighting border of information window and menus (default).
.IP \fBnohighlight\fR
Turns off highlighting of border of information window and menus.
.IP \fBeightbit\fR
Turns on display of eight bit characters.
.IP \fBnoeightbit\fR
Turns off display of eight bit characters (they are displayed as their decimal
value inside angle brackets, e.g., "<220>").
.IP \fB16bit\fR
Turns on handling of 16-bit characters.
.IP \fBno16bit\fR
Turns off handling of 16-bit characters.
.IP \fBemacs\fR
Turns on emacs key bindings.
.IP \fBnoemacs\fR
Turns off emacs key bindings.
