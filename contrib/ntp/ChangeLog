	I indulged an old agenda to polish up some programs originally
	written for a DSP evaluation board. The result is a really hot
	audio driver for the NIST WWV/WWVH time/frequency station plus a
	makeover for the CHU audio driver. Currently, they and their IRIG
	audio driver buddy use the SunOS/Solaris audio interface, which is
	clean and simple. I hook the line in jack to a shortwave radio and
	these drivers (driver 7 for CHU and driver 36 for WWV) and the
	drivers do the rest. The WWV/H driver is really hot - I am
	currently watching the ionosphere move from the doppler that shows
	up on the tick modulation tracked by the program. During midday
	when the F2 layer settles down, the program closes in on a few
	tens of microseconds of spare jitter and wander.  This watch on
	whichever 15/20 MHz signal sounds the best. At night on 5/10 MHz
	and even 2.5 HMz where the multipath, interference and noise are
	much worse, the driver bangs around somewhat more.

	The CHU driver makeover discovered a few broken bones after all
	these years, but its majority decoder is back in business. For
	various reasons to icky to reveal here, its 103-modem demodulator
	is not quite as good as the chip, but it comes close and hey,
	2025/2125 FSK is just not a good idea for HF radio. This driver is
	not nearly as sophisitcated as the WWV/H driver, but here a few
	hundred miles south of Ottawa, it does a passably good job.

	I tell you this in the hopes of getting somebody interested in
	porting the audio interface to other machines, in particular
	Linux, FreeBSD and anything else with a sound card. When the
	ionosphere stays cool, the WWV/H driver is as good as anything
	else around here and with much less jitter than a serial port. The
	only downside is all the audio drivers chew up a modest fraction
	of cycles for the DSP routines - a few percent on the newer
	silicon, up to half the cycles on an old Sparc IPC. Whattheheck,
	these old machines aren't doing anything else around here except
	serving time, and even when sucking cycles for DSP they still mind
	the PPS microseconds.

	The audio driver documentation had a makeover, too.

	* configure.in :  changequote for osf[45] test.
	Reported by: Tom Smith <smith@cag.lkg.dec.com>

	* ntp_update: Ignore stuff in any A.* directory.

1999-11-15  Harlan Stenn  <stenn@whimsy.udel.edu>

	* configure.in: Clean up header checks for sys/syssgi.h and
	sys/select.h .  Originally, we did not check for sys/select.h
	under some versions of SCO (see xntp3-5).  Somewhere in ntp4 we
	dropped the SCO check and added the check for sys/syssgi.h,
	exclusive of checking for sys/select.h.  Marc Brett can't think of
	a reason why we should not be checking for sys/select.h, so let's
	look for it now.

1999-11-13  Harlan Stenn  <stenn@whimsy.udel.edu>

	* ntpdate/ntpdate.c: Add the ability for ntpdate to query a
	multicast address.  We use the response to the multicast address
	to learn new servers which we then add to the peer list and query.
	In changing this I made the list of peers a linked list.

	To be complete I should detect a broadcast address and make it
	behave the same way.  But that requires a scan of the interface
	list which is more complicated that I want to deal with...

	Fix a bug, allowing ntpdate to compile if SLEWALWAYS and STEP_SLEW
	are both defined.
