.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility program is used to query NTP servers to monitor NTP operations
and performance, requesting
information about current state and/or changes in that state.
The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using
command line arguments.
Requests to read and write arbitrary
variables can be assembled, with raw and pretty\-printed output
options being available.
The
.Nm
utility can also obtain and print a
list of peers in a common format by sending multiple queries to the
server.
.Pp
If one or more request options is included on the command line
when
.Nm
is executed, each of the requests will be sent
to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command
line arguments, or on localhost by default.
If no request options
are given,
.Nm
will attempt to read commands from the
standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the
first host given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost
when no other host is specified.
The
.Nm
utility will prompt for
commands if the standard input is a terminal device.
.Pp
.Nm
uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the
NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatible server on
the network which permits it.
Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over
large distances in terms of network topology.
The
.Nm
utility makes
one attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if
the remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout
time.
.Pp
Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a
.Fl 4
qualifier preceding the host name forces resolution to the IPv4
namespace, while a
.Fl 6
qualifier forces resolution to the IPv6 namespace.
For examples and usage, see the
.Dq NTP Debugging Techniques
page.
.Pp
Specifying a
command line option other than
.Fl i
or
.Fl n
will
cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated
host(s) immediately.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will attempt to read
interactive format commands from the standard input.
.Ss "Internal Commands"
.Pp
Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero
to four arguments.
Only enough characters of the full keyword to
uniquely identify the command need be typed.
.Pp
A
number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within
the
.Nm
utility itself and do not result in NTP
requests being sent to a server.
These are described following.
.Bl -tag -width "help [command]" -compact -offset indent
.It Ic ? Op Ar command
.It Ic help Op Ar command
A
.Ql \&?
by itself will print a list of all the commands
known to
.Nm .
A
.Ql \&?
followed by a command name will print function and usage
information about the command.
.It Ic addvars Ar name Ns Oo \&= Ns Ar value Oc Ns Op ,...
.It Ic rmvars Ar name Ns Op ,...
.It Ic clearvars
.It Ic showvars
The arguments to this command consist of a list of
items of the form
.Ar name Ns Op \&= Ns Ar value ,
where the
.No \&= Ns Ar value
is ignored, and can be omitted,
in requests to the server to read variables.
The
.Nm
utility maintains an internal list in which data to be included in
messages can be assembled, and displayed or set using the
.Ic readlist
and
.Ic writelist
commands described below.
The
.Ic addvars
command allows variables and their optional values to be added to
the list.
If more than one variable is to be added, the list should
be comma\-separated and not contain white space.
The
.Ic rmvars
command can be used to remove individual variables from the list,
while the
.Ic clearvars
command removes all variables from the
list.
The
.Ic showvars
command displays the current list of optional variables.
.It Ic authenticate Op Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
Normally
.Nm
does not authenticate requests unless
they are write requests.
The command
.Ic authenticate Cm yes
causes
.Nm
to send authentication with all requests it
makes.
Authenticated requests causes some servers to handle
requests slightly differently.
The command
.Ic authenticate
causes
.Nm
to display whether or not
it is currently authenticating requests.
.It Ic cooked
Causes output from query commands to be "cooked", so that
variables which are recognized by
.Nm
will have their
values reformatted for human consumption.
Variables which
.Nm
could not decode completely are
marked with a trailing
.Ql \&? .
.It Ic debug Op Cm more Ns | Ns Cm less Ns | Ns Cm off
With no argument, displays the current debug level.
Otherwise, the debugging level is changed as indicated.
.It Ic delay Op Ar milliseconds
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication.
This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths
or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized.
Actually the
server does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests,
so this command may be obsolete.
Without any arguments, displays the current delay.
.It Ic drefid Op Cm hash Ns | Ns Cm ipv4
Display refids as IPv4 or hash.
Without any arguments, displays whether refids are shown as IPv4
addresses or hashes.
.It Ic exit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Ic host Op Ar name
Set the host to which future queries will be sent.
The
.Ar name
may be either a host name or a numeric address.
Without any arguments, displays the current host.
.It Ic hostnames Op Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
If
.Cm yes
is specified, host names are printed in
information displays.
If
.Cm no
is specified, numeric
addresses are printed instead.
The default is
.Cm yes ,
unless
modified using the command line
.Fl n
switch.
Without any arguments, displays whether host names or numeric addresses
are shown.
.It Ic keyid Op Ar keyid
This command allows the specification of a key number to be
used to authenticate configuration requests.
This must correspond
to the
.Cm controlkey
key number the server has been configured to use for this
purpose.
Without any arguments, displays the current
.Ar keyid .
.It Ic keytype Op Ar digest
Specify the digest algorithm to use for authenticating requests, with default
.Cm MD5 .
If
.Nm
was built with OpenSSL support, and OpenSSL is installed,
.Ar digest
can be any message digest algorithm supported by OpenSSL.
If no argument is given, the current
.Ic keytype Ar digest
algorithm used is displayed.
.It Ic ntpversion Op Cm 1 Ns | Ns Cm 2 Ns | Ns Cm 3 Ns | Ns Cm 4
Sets the NTP version number which
.Nm
claims in
packets.
Defaults to 3, and note that mode 6 control messages (and
modes, for that matter) didn't exist in NTP version 1.
There appear
to be no servers left which demand version 1.
With no argument, displays the current NTP version that will be used
when communicating with servers.
.It Ic passwd
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not
be echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration
requests.
The password must correspond to the key configured for
use by the NTP server for this purpose if such requests are to be
successful.
.It Ic poll Oo Ar n Oc Op Cm verbose
Poll an NTP server in client mode
.Ar n
times.
Poll not implemented yet.
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Ic raw
Causes all output from query commands is printed as received
from the remote server.
The only formating/interpretation done on
the data is to transform nonascii data into a printable (but barely
understandable) form.
.It Ic timeout Op Ar milliseconds
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries.
The
default is about 5000 milliseconds.
Without any arguments, displays the current timeout period.
Note that since
.Nm
retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for
a timeout will be twice the timeout value set.
.It Ic version
Display the version of the
.Nm
program.
.El
.Ss "Control Message Commands"
Association ids are used to identify system, peer and clock variables.
System variables are assigned an association id of zero and system name
space, while each association is assigned a nonzero association id and
peer namespace.
Most control commands send a single message to the server and expect a
single response message.
The exceptions are the
.Ic peers
command, which sends a series of messages,
and the
.Ic mreadlist
and
.Ic mreadvar
commands, which iterate over a range of associations.
.Bl -tag -width "something" -compact -offset indent
.It Ic apeers
Display a list of peers in the form:
.Dl [tally]remote refid assid st t when pool reach delay offset jitter
where the output is just like the

.Xc
Display traffic counts of the most recently seen source addresses
collected and maintained by the monitor facility.
With the exception of
.Cm sort Ns \&= Ns Oo \&\- Oc Ns Ar sortorder ,
the options filter the list returned by
.Xr ntpd 8 .
The
.Cm limited
and
.Cm kod
options return only entries representing client addresses from which the
last packet received triggered either discarding or a KoD response.
The
.Cm mincount Ns = Ns Ar count
option filters entries representing less than
.Ar count
packets.
The

filter entries containing none or less than all, respectively, of the bits in
.Ar hexmask ,
which must begin with
.Cm 0x .
The
.Ar sortorder
defaults to
.Cm lstint
and may be 
.Cm addr ,
.Cm avgint ,
.Cm count ,
.Cm lstint ,
or any of those preceded by
.Ql \&\-
to reverse the sort order.
The output columns are:
.Bl -tag -width "something" -compact -offset indent

If no
.Ar name
is included, all operative variables in the name space are displayed.
In this case only, if the
.Ar associd
is omitted, it is assumed to be zero.
Multiple names are specified with comma separators and without whitespace.
Note that time values are represented in milliseconds
and frequency values in parts\-per\-million (PPM).
Some NTP timestamps are represented in the format
.Ar YYYY Ns Ar MM Ar DD Ar TTTT ,

name space.
The
.Ar associd
is required, as the same name can occur in both spaces.
Authentication is required.
.El
.Ss Status Words and Kiss Codes
The current state of the operating program is shown
in a set of status words
maintained by the system.
Status information is also available on a per\-association basis.
These words are displayed by the
.Ic readlist
and
.Ic associations
commands both in hexadecimal and in decoded short tip strings.
The codes, tips and short explanations are documented on the
.Lk decode.html "Event Messages and Status Words"
page.
The page also includes a list of system and peer messages,
the code for the latest of which is included in the status word.
.Pp
Information resulting from protocol machine state transitions
is displayed using an informal set of ASCII strings called
.Lk decode.html#kiss "kiss codes" .
The original purpose was for kiss\-o'\-death (KoD) packets
sent by the server to advise the client of an unusual condition.
They are now displayed, when appropriate,
in the reference identifier field in various billboards.
.Ss System Variables
The following system variables appear in the
.Ic readlist
billboard.

Increase debug verbosity level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
.It  Fl D Ar number , Fl \-set\-debug\-level Ns = Ns Ar number 
Set the debug verbosity level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
.It  Fl i , Fl \-interactive 
Force ntpq to operate in interactive mode.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command, peers.
.sp
Force \fBntpq\fP to operate in interactive mode.
Prompts will be written to the standard output and
commands read from the standard input.
.It  Fl n , Fl \-numeric 
numeric host addresses.
.sp
Output all host addresses in dotted\-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names.
.It  Fl \-old\-rv 
Always output status line with readvar.
.sp
By default, \fBntpq\fP now suppresses the \fBassocid=...\fP
line that precedes the output of \fBreadvar\fP
(alias \fBrv\fP) when a single variable is requested, such as
\fBntpq \-c "rv 0 offset"\fP.
This option causes \fBntpq\fP to include both lines of output
for a single\-variable \fBreadvar\fP.
Using an environment variable to
preset this option in a script will enable both older and
newer \fBntpq\fP to behave identically in this regard.
.It  Fl p , Fl \-peers 
Print a list of the peers.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
interactive.
.sp
Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state. This is equivalent to the 'peers' interactive command.
.It  Fl r Ar keyword , Fl \-refid Ns = Ns Ar keyword 
Set default display type for S2+ refids.
This option takes a keyword as its argument.  The argument sets an enumeration value that can
be tested by comparing them against the option value macro.
The available keywords are:
.in +4
.nf
.na
hash ipv4
.fi
or their numeric equivalent.
.in -4
.sp
The default
.Ar keyword
for this option is:
.ti +4
 ipv4
.sp
Set the default display format for S2+ refids.
.It  Fl u , Fl \-unconnected 
Use unconnected UDP to communicate with ntpd (default on Windows).
.sp
Open an unconnected UDP association to ntpd (the default
on Windows).
.It  Fl w , Fl \-wide 
Display the full 'remote' value.
.sp
Display the full value of the 'remote' value.  If this requires
more than 15 characters, display the full value, emit a newline,
and continue the data display properly indented on the next line.
.It Fl \&? , Fl \-help
Display usage information and exit.
.It Fl \&! , Fl \-more\-help
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.It Fl > Oo Ar cfgfile Oc , Fl \-save\-opts Oo Ns = Ns Ar cfgfile Oc
Save the option state to \fIcfgfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
The command will exit after updating the config file.
.It Fl < Ar cfgfile , Fl \-load\-opts Ns = Ns Ar cfgfile , Fl \-no\-load\-opts
Load options from \fIcfgfile\fP.
The \fIno\-load\-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier config/rc/ini files.  \fI\-\-no\-load\-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.It Fl \-version Op Brq Ar v|c|n
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.El
.Sh "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTPQ_<option\-name>\fP or \fBNTPQ\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
.Sh "ENVIRONMENT"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration environment variables.
.Sh "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.Sh "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.Bl -tag
.It 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.It 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.It 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
.It 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen\-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
