The
@code{ntpq}
utility program is used to query NTP servers to monitor NTP operations
and performance, requesting
information about current state and/or changes in that state.
The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using
command line arguments.
Requests to read and write arbitrary
variables can be assembled, with raw and pretty-printed output
options being available.
The
@code{ntpq}
utility can also obtain and print a
list of peers in a common format by sending multiple queries to the
server.

If one or more request options is included on the command line
when
@code{ntpq}
is executed, each of the requests will be sent
to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command
line arguments, or on localhost by default.
If no request options
are given,
@code{ntpq}
will attempt to read commands from the
standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the
first host given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost
when no other host is specified.
The
@code{ntpq}
utility will prompt for
commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

@code{ntpq}
uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the
NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatible server on
the network which permits it.
Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over
large distances in terms of network topology.
The
@code{ntpq}
utility makes
one attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if
the remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout
time.

Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a
@code{-4}
qualifier preceding the host name forces resolution to the IPv4
namespace, while a
@code{-6}
qualifier forces resolution to the IPv6 namespace.
For examples and usage, see the
@quotedblleft{}NTP Debugging Techniques@quotedblright{}
page.

Specifying a
command line option other than
@code{-i}
or
@code{-n}
will
cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated
host(s) immediately.
Otherwise,
@code{ntpq}
will attempt to read
interactive format commands from the standard input.

@subsubsection Internal Commands

Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero
to four arguments.
Only enough characters of the full keyword to
uniquely identify the command need be typed.

A
number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within
the
@code{ntpq}
utility itself and do not result in NTP
requests being sent to a server.
These are described following.
@table @asis
@item @code{?} @code{[@kbd{command}]}
@item @code{help} @code{[@kbd{command}]}
A
@quoteleft{}?@quoteright{}
by itself will print a list of all the commands
known to
@code{ntpq}
A
@quoteleft{}?@quoteright{}
followed by a command name will print function and usage
information about the command.
@item @code{addvars} @kbd{name}@code{[=@kbd{value}]}@code{[,...]}
@item @code{rmvars} @kbd{name}@code{[,...]}
@item @code{clearvars}
@item @code{showvars}
The arguments to this command consist of a list of
items of the form
@kbd{name}@code{[=@kbd{value}]},
where the
.No = Ns Ar value
is ignored, and can be omitted,
in requests to the server to read variables.
The
@code{ntpq}
utility maintains an internal list in which data to be included in
messages can be assembled, and displayed or set using the
@code{readlist}
and
@code{writelist}
commands described below.
The
@code{addvars}
command allows variables and their optional values to be added to
the list.
If more than one variable is to be added, the list should
be comma-separated and not contain white space.
The
@code{rmvars}
command can be used to remove individual variables from the list,
while the
@code{clearvars}
command removes all variables from the
list.
The
@code{showvars}
command displays the current list of optional variables.
@item @code{authenticate} @code{[@code{yes}|@code{no}]}
Normally
@code{ntpq}
does not authenticate requests unless
they are write requests.
The command
@code{authenticate} @code{yes}
causes
@code{ntpq}
to send authentication with all requests it
makes.
Authenticated requests causes some servers to handle
requests slightly differently.
The command
@code{authenticate}
causes
@code{ntpq}
to display whether or not
it is currently authenticating requests.
@item @code{cooked}
Causes output from query commands to be "cooked", so that
variables which are recognized by
@code{ntpq}
will have their
values reformatted for human consumption.
Variables which
@code{ntpq}
could not decode completely are
marked with a trailing
@quoteleft{}?@quoteright{}.
@item @code{debug} @code{[@code{more}|@code{less}|@code{off}]}
With no argument, displays the current debug level.
Otherwise, the debugging level is changed as indicated.
@item @code{delay} @code{[@kbd{milliseconds}]}
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication.
This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths
or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized.
Actually the
server does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests,
so this command may be obsolete.
Without any arguments, displays the current delay.
@item @code{drefid} @code{[@code{hash}|@code{ipv4}]}
Display refids as IPv4 or hash.
Without any arguments, displays whether refids are shown as IPv4
addresses or hashes.
@item @code{exit}
Exit
@code{ntpq}
@item @code{host} @code{[@kbd{name}]}
Set the host to which future queries will be sent.
The
@kbd{name}
may be either a host name or a numeric address.
Without any arguments, displays the current host.
@item @code{hostnames} @code{[@code{yes}|@code{no}]}
If
@code{yes}
is specified, host names are printed in
information displays.
If
@code{no}
is specified, numeric
addresses are printed instead.
The default is
@code{yes},
unless
modified using the command line
@code{-n}
switch.
Without any arguments, displays whether host names or numeric addresses
are shown.
@item @code{keyid} @code{[@kbd{keyid}]}
This command allows the specification of a key number to be
used to authenticate configuration requests.
This must correspond
to the
@code{controlkey}
key number the server has been configured to use for this
purpose.
Without any arguments, displays the current
@kbd{keyid}.
@item @code{keytype} @code{[@kbd{digest}]}
Specify the digest algorithm to use for authenticating requests, with default
@code{MD5}.
If
@code{ntpq}
was built with OpenSSL support, and OpenSSL is installed,
@kbd{digest}
can be any message digest algorithm supported by OpenSSL.
If no argument is given, the current
@code{keytype} @kbd{digest}
algorithm used is displayed.
@item @code{ntpversion} @code{[@code{1}|@code{2}|@code{3}|@code{4}]}
Sets the NTP version number which
@code{ntpq}
claims in
packets.
Defaults to 3, and note that mode 6 control messages (and
modes, for that matter) didn't exist in NTP version 1.
There appear
to be no servers left which demand version 1.
With no argument, displays the current NTP version that will be used
when communicating with servers.
@item @code{passwd}
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not
be echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration
requests.
The password must correspond to the key configured for
use by the NTP server for this purpose if such requests are to be
successful.
@item @code{poll} @code{[@kbd{n}]} @code{[@code{verbose}]}
Poll an NTP server in client mode
@kbd{n}
times.
Poll not implemented yet.
@item @code{quit}
Exit
@code{ntpq}
@item @code{raw}
Causes all output from query commands is printed as received
from the remote server.
The only formating/interpretation done on
the data is to transform nonascii data into a printable (but barely
understandable) form.
@item @code{timeout} @code{[@kbd{milliseconds}]}
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries.
The
default is about 5000 milliseconds.
Without any arguments, displays the current timeout period.
Note that since
@code{ntpq}
retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for
a timeout will be twice the timeout value set.
@item @code{version}
Display the version of the
@code{ntpq}
program.
@end table

@subsubsection Control Message Commands
Association ids are used to identify system, peer and clock variables.
System variables are assigned an association id of zero and system name
space, while each association is assigned a nonzero association id and
peer namespace.
Most control commands send a single message to the server and expect a
single response message.
The exceptions are the
@code{peers}
command, which sends a series of messages,
and the
@code{mreadlist}
and
@code{mreadvar}
commands, which iterate over a range of associations.
@table @asis
@item @code{apeers}
Display a list of peers in the form:
@example
[tally]remote refid assid st t when pool reach delay offset jitter
@end example
where the output is just like the
@code{peers}
command except that the
@code{refid}
is displayed in hex format and the association number is also displayed.
@item @code{associations}
Display a list of mobilized associations in the form:
@example
ind assid status conf reach auth condition last_event cnt

Display a list of clock variables for those associations supporting a
reference clock.
@item @code{:config} @kbd{configuration command line}
Send the remainder of the command line, including whitespace, to the
server as a run-time configuration command in the same format as a line
in the configuration file.
This command is experimental until further notice and clarification.
Authentication is of course required.
@item @code{config-from-file} @kbd{filename}

Display traffic counts of the most recently seen source addresses
collected and maintained by the monitor facility.
With the exception of
@code{sort}=@code{[-]}@kbd{sortorder},
the options filter the list returned by
@code{ntpd(8)}.
The
@code{limited}
and
@code{kod}
options return only entries representing client addresses from which the
last packet received triggered either discarding or a KoD response.
The
@code{mincount}=@kbd{count}
option filters entries representing less than
@kbd{count}
packets.
The
@code{laddr}=@kbd{localaddr}
option filters entries for packets received on any local address other than
@kbd{localaddr}.
@code{resany}=@kbd{hexmask}
and
@code{resall}=@kbd{hexmask}
filter entries containing none or less than all, respectively, of the bits in
@kbd{hexmask},
which must begin with
@code{0x}.
The
@kbd{sortorder}
defaults to
@code{lstint}
and may be 
@code{addr},
@code{avgint},
@code{count},
@code{lstint},
or any of those preceded by
@quoteleft{}-@quoteright{}
to reverse the sort order.
The output columns are:

If no
@kbd{name}
is included, all operative variables in the name space are displayed.
In this case only, if the
@kbd{associd}
is omitted, it is assumed to be zero.
Multiple names are specified with comma separators and without whitespace.
Note that time values are represented in milliseconds
and frequency values in parts-per-million (PPM).
Some NTP timestamps are represented in the format

Authentication is required.
@end table

@subsubsection Status Words and Kiss Codes
The current state of the operating program is shown
in a set of status words
maintained by the system.
Status information is also available on a per-association basis.
These words are displayed by the
@code{readlist}
and
@code{associations}
commands both in hexadecimal and in decoded short tip strings.
The codes, tips and short explanations are documented on the
.Lk decode.html "Event Messages and Status Words"
page.
The page also includes a list of system and peer messages,
the code for the latest of which is included in the status word.

Information resulting from protocol machine state transitions
is displayed using an informal set of ASCII strings called
.Lk decode.html#kiss "kiss codes" .
The original purpose was for kiss-o'-death (KoD) packets
sent by the server to advise the client of an unusual condition.
They are now displayed, when appropriate,
in the reference identifier field in various billboards.

@subsubsection System Variables
The following system variables appear in the
@code{readlist}

@node ntpq usage
@subsection ntpq help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntpq help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntpq.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

@node ntpq ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex ntpq-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 name resolution'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv6.
@end itemize

Force resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.
@node ntpq ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex ntpq-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 name resolution'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv4.
@end itemize

Force resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.
@node ntpq command
@subsection command option (-c)
@cindex ntpq-command

This is the ``run a command and exit'' option.
This option takes a string argument @file{cmd}.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
host(s).
@node ntpq interactive
@subsection interactive option (-i)
@cindex ntpq-interactive

This is the ``force ntpq to operate in interactive mode'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command, peers.
@end itemize

Force @code{ntpq} to operate in interactive mode.
Prompts will be written to the standard output and
commands read from the standard input.
@node ntpq numeric
@subsection numeric option (-n)
@cindex ntpq-numeric

This is the ``numeric host addresses'' option.
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names.
@node ntpq old-rv
@subsection old-rv option
@cindex ntpq-old-rv

This is the ``always output status line with readvar'' option.
By default, @code{ntpq} now suppresses the @code{associd=...}
line that precedes the output of @code{readvar}
(alias @code{rv}) when a single variable is requested, such as
@code{ntpq -c "rv 0 offset"}.
This option causes @code{ntpq} to include both lines of output
for a single-variable @code{readvar}.
Using an environment variable to
preset this option in a script will enable both older and
newer @code{ntpq} to behave identically in this regard.
@node ntpq peers
@subsection peers option (-p)
@cindex ntpq-peers

This is the ``print a list of the peers'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
interactive.
@end itemize

Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state. This is equivalent to the 'peers' interactive command.
@node ntpq refid
@subsection refid option (-r)
@cindex ntpq-refid

This is the ``set default display type for s2+ refids'' option.
This option takes a keyword argument.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
This option takes a keyword as its argument.
The argument sets an enumeration value that can be tested by comparing the option value macro (OPT_VALUE_REFID).
The available keywords are:
@example
    hash ipv4
@end example

or their numeric equivalent.
@end itemize

Set the default display format for S2+ refids.
@node ntpq unconnected
@subsection unconnected option (-u)
@cindex ntpq-unconnected

This is the ``use unconnected udp to communicate with ntpd (default on windows)'' option.
Open an unconnected UDP association to ntpd (the default
on Windows).
@node ntpq wide
@subsection wide option (-w)
@cindex ntpq-wide

This is the ``display the full 'remote' value'' option.
Display the full value of the 'remote' value.  If this requires
more than 15 characters, display the full value, emit a newline,
and continue the data display properly indented on the next line.


@node ntpq config
@subsection presetting/configuring ntpq

Any option that is not marked as @i{not presettable} may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values from environment variables named @code{NTPQ} and @code{NTPQ_<OPTION_NAME>}.  @code{<OPTION_NAME>} must be one of
the options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores.
The @code{NTPQ} variable will be tokenized and parsed like
the command line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.


@noindent
@code{libopts} will search in 2 places for configuration files:
@itemize @bullet
@item
$HOME
@item
$PWD
@end itemize
The environment variables @code{HOME}, and @code{PWD}
are expanded and replaced when @file{ntpq} runs.
For any of these that are plain files, they are simply processed.
For any that are directories, then a file named @file{.ntprc} is searched for
within that directory and processed.

Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.
The basic format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the
same line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon,
equal sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
@example
[NTPQ]
@end example
@noindent
or by
@example
<?program ntpq>
@end example
@noindent
Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
@example
<option-name>
   <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
</option-name>
@end example
@noindent
yielding an @code{option-name.sub-opt} string value of
@example
"...<...>..."
@end example
@code{AutoOpts} does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  @code{AutoOpts} does provide a means for searching
the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help are:

@subsubheading version (-)

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much licensing
detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.  The licensing information may be selected with an option argument.
Only the first letter of the argument is examined:

@table @samp
@item version
Only print the version.  This is the default.
@item copyright
Name the copyright usage licensing terms.
@item verbose
Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.
@end table

@node ntpq exit status
@subsection ntpq exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@item 66 (EX_NOINPUT)
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
@item 70 (EX_SOFTWARE)
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
