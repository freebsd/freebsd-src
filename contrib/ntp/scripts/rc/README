This directory contains some example rc scripts for ntpd.

In general, ntpd should be started as soon as possible in the boot process. If
any services require stable system clock, the ntpwait script should be run
before them as late as possible.

The rc.d contains scripts for systems using rc.d init system (originated in
NetBSD). If a service requires stable system time, indicate it with TIMESYNC
dependency and set ntpwait_enable to YES.

For SysV init systems, you'll have to create links as /etc/rc2.d/S20ntpd and
/etc/rc2.d/S80ntpwait yourself. (The numbers are just examples, try to give
ntpd as much time as possible to synchronize before running ntpwait).
