.Sh NAME
.Nm ntp-wait
.Nd Wait for ntpd to stabilize the system clock
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.Op Fl flags
.Op Fl flag Op Ar value
.Op Fl \-option\-name Ns Oo Oo Ns "=| " Oc Ns Ar value Oc
.Pp
All arguments must be options.
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will send at most
.Ar num\-tries
queries to
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
sleeping for
.Ar secs\-between\-tries
after each status return that says
.Xr ntpd 8
has not yet produced a synchronized and stable system clock.
.Pp
.Nm
will do this quietly, unless the
.Fl v
flag is provided.
This can be useful at boot time, to delay the boot sequence until after
.Ar ntpd \-g 
has set the time.
