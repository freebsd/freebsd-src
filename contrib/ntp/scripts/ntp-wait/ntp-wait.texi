@node Top, ntp-wait Description, (dir), (dir)

This document describes the use of the NTP Project's @code{ntp-wait} program.

If there are time-sensitive applications,
the proper sequence of events is to
run @code{ntpd -g} as early as possible,
then invoke all of the non-time-sensitive process,
run @code{ntp-wait} to block
until the system's time has stabilized and synchronized,
and only then start any applicaitons (like database servers) that require
accurate and stable time.

This document applies to version @value{VERSION} of @code{ntp-wait}.
