.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \fBcalc_tickadj\fP script uses provided ntp drift file to generate optimal
tick value. Generally, ntpd can do better job if the drift value is the
smallest possible number. 
.sp
The example output of 
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ./calc_tickadj
81.699 (drift)
9999 usec; 9999779 nsec
$ cat /etc/ntp/drift
-23.159
.Ed
.sp
means the following. If tick on that box is 10,000, by making the value 9999
we'll shift the box from its current drift of \-23.159 to a drift of 81.699, and
in doing so we'll speed the clock up a little every second instead of slowing
the clock down a little.
.sp
If 'tick' on that box is 10,000,000 then by setting it to 9999779 the drift
value will be somewhere around 0.0.
.sp
\fBcalc_tickadj\fP tries to determine the the tick value by using
\fBtickadj\fP program from ntp package. If this doesn't work you can specify
current tick manually on command line.
.Sh "OPTIONS"
.Bl -tag
.It  Fl d Ar string , Fl \-drift\-file Ns = Ns Ar string 
Ntp drift file to use.
The default
.Ar string
for this option is:
.ti +4
 /etc/ntp/drift
.sp
Use the specified drift file for calculations
.It  Fl t Ar number , Fl \-tick Ns = Ns Ar number 
Tick value of this host.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
The current tick which to adjustment will be calculated
.It Fl \&? , Fl \-help

.It Fl \&! , Fl \-more\-help
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
