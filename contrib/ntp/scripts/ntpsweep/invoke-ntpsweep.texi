version, the operating system and the processor. Optionally recursing through
all peers.

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},

@node ntpsweep usage
@subsection ntpsweep help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntpsweep help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntpsweep.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.
