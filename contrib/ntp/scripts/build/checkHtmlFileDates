# This script is invoked in html directory when any html/*.html file
# is newer than html/.datecheck to update the last modified time
# within the HTML.  Each file is compared against the checked-in
# version is compared to any uncommitted edits and if there are
# any, scripts/build/updateBEDate is used to update the embedded
# timestamp.  html/.datecheck is not distributed in releases so
# this will be invoked once building a newly-extracted tarball.
# 'bk diff' is used to check for modifications so if bk is not
# on the path there's no need to invoke this repeatedly.
# Therefore touch .datecheck unconditionally right away.
