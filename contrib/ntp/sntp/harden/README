If you look at the files here you should be able to figure out what is
being done.

../scripts/genHardFlags handles the parsing of these files.

If no "more specific" file has been found and cvo.sh says the OS is
redhat* or fedora*, we will look for loc/redhat .

If no "mode specific" file has been found and the "uname" command returns
"Linux", we will look for loc/linux .
