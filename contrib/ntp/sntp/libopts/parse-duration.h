  Readers and users of this function are referred to the ISO-8601
  specification, with particular attention to "Durations".

  At the time of writing, this worked:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations

  The string must start with a 'P', 'T' or a digit.

  ==== if it is a digit

  the string may contain:  NNN Y NNN M NNN W NNN d NNN h NNN m NNN s
  This represents NNN years, NNN months, NNN weeks, NNN days, NNN hours,
    NNN minutes and NNN seconds.
  The embedded white space is optional.
  These terms must appear in this order.
  Case is significant:  'M' is months and 'm' is minutes.
  The final "s" is optional.
  All of the terms ("NNN" plus designator) are optional.
  Minutes and seconds may optionally be represented as NNN:NNN.
  Also, hours, minute and seconds may be represented as NNN:NNN:NNN.
  There is no limitation on the value of any of the terms, except
  that the final result must fit in a time_t value.

  ==== if it is a 'P' or 'T', please see ISO-8601 for a rigorous definition.

  The 'P' term may be followed by any of three formats:
    yyyymmdd
    yy-mm-dd
    yy Y mm M ww W dd D

  or it may be empty and followed by a 'T'.  The "yyyymmdd" must be eight
  digits long.

  NOTE!  Months are always 30 days and years are always 365 days long.
  5 years is always 1825 days, not 1826 or 1827 depending on leap year
  considerations.  3 months is always 90 days.  There is no consideration
  for how many days are in the current, next or previous months.

  For the final format:
  *  Embedded white space is allowed, but it is optional.
  *  All of the terms are optional.  Any or all-but-one may be omitted.
  *  The meanings are yy years, mm months, ww weeks and dd days.
  *  The terms must appear in this order.

  ==== The 'T' term may be followed by any of these formats:

    hhmmss
    hh:mm:ss
    hh H mm M ss S

  For the final format:
  *  Embedded white space is allowed, but it is optional.
  *  All of the terms are optional.  Any or all-but-one may be omitted.
  *  The terms must appear in this order.
