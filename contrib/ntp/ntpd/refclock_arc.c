THIS CODE IS SUPPLIED AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  USE AT
YOUR OWN RISK.

Orginally developed and used with ntp3-5.85 by Derek Mulcahy.

Built against ntp3-5.90 on Solaris 2.5 using gcc 2.7.2.

This code may be freely copied and used and incorporated in other
systems providing the disclaimer and notice of authorship are
reproduced.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nigel's notes:

1) Called tcgetattr() before modifying, so that fields correctly initialised
   for all operating systems

2) Altered parsing of timestamp line so that it copes with fields which are
   not always ASCII digits (e.g. status field when battery low)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE V1.2 
========================
 1) Applied patch by Andrey Bray <abuse@madhouse.demon.co.uk>
    2001-02-17 comp.protocols.time.ntp

 2) Added WWVB support via clock mode command, localtime/UTC time configured
    via flag1=(0=UTC, 1=localtime)

 3) Added ignore resync request via flag2=(0=resync, 1=ignore resync)

 4) Added simplified conversion from localtime to UTC with dst/bst translation

 5) Added average signal quality poll

 6) Fixed a badformat error when no code is available due to stripping 
    \n & \r's 

 7) Fixed a badformat error when clearing lencode & memset a_lastcode in poll
    routine

 8) Lots of code cleanup, including standardized DEBUG macros and removal 
    of unused code 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author's original note:

I enclose my ntp driver for the Galleon Systems Arc MSF receiver.

It works (after a fashion) on both Solaris-1 and Solaris-2.

I am currently using ntp3-5.85.  I have been running the code for
about 7 months without any problems.  Even coped with the change to BST!

I had to do some funky things to read from the clock because it uses the
power from the receive lines to drive the transmit lines.  This makes the
code look a bit stupid but it works.  I also had to put in some delays to
allow for the turnaround time from receive to transmit.  These delays
are between characters when requesting a time stamp so that shouldn't affect
the results too drastically.

...

The bottom line is that it works but could easily be improved.  You are
free to do what you will with the code.  I haven't been able to determine
how good the clock is.  I think that this requires a known good clock
to compare it against.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damon's notes for adjustments:

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE V1.0
========================
 1) Removal of pollcnt variable that made the clock go permanently
    off-line once two time polls failed to gain responses.

 2) Avoiding (at least on Solaris-2) terminal becoming the controlling
    terminal of the process when we do a low-level open().

 3) Additional logic (conditional on ARCRON_LEAPSECOND_KEEN being
    defined) to try to resync quickly after a potential leap-second
    insertion or deletion.

 4) Code significantly slimmer at run-time than V1.0.


GENERAL
=======

 1) The C preprocessor symbol to have the clock built has been changed
    from ARC to ARCRON_MSF to CLOCK_ARCRON_MSF to minimise the
    possiblity of clashes with other symbols in the future.

 2) PRECISION should be -4/-5 (63ms/31ms) for the following reasons:

     a) The ARC documentation claims the internal clock is (only)
	accurate to about 20ms relative to Rugby (plus there must be
	noticable drift and delay in the ms range due to transmission
	delays and changing atmospheric effects).  This clock is not
	designed for ms accuracy as NTP has spoilt us all to expect.

     b) The clock oscillator looks like a simple uncompensated quartz
	crystal of the sort used in digital watches (ie 32768Hz) which
	can have large temperature coefficients and drifts; it is not
	clear if this oscillator is properly disciplined to the MSF
	transmission, but as the default is to resync only once per
	*day*, we can imagine that it is not, and is free-running.  We
	can minimise drift by resyncing more often (at the cost of
	reduced battery life), but drift/wander may still be
	significant.

     c) Note that the bit time of 3.3ms adds to the potential error in
	the the clock timestamp, since the bit clock of the serial link
	may effectively be free-running with respect to the host clock
	and the MSF clock.  Actually, the error is probably 1/16th of
	the above, since the input data is probably sampled at at least
	16x the bit rate.

    By keeping the clock marked as not very precise, it will have a
    fairly large dispersion, and thus will tend to be used as a
    `backup' time source and sanity checker, which this clock is
    probably ideal for.  For an isolated network without other time
    sources, this clock can probably be expected to provide *much*
    better than 1s accuracy, which will be fine.

    By default, PRECISION is set to -4, but experience, especially at a
    particular geographic location with a particular clock, may allow
    this to be altered to -5.  (Note that skews of +/- 10ms are to be
    expected from the clock from time-to-time.)  This improvement of
    reported precision can be instigated by setting flag3 to 1, though
    the PRECISION will revert to the normal value while the clock
    signal quality is unknown whatever the flag3 setting.

    IN ANY CASE, BE SURE TO SET AN APPROPRIATE FUDGE FACTOR TO REMOVE
    ANY RESIDUAL SKEW, eg:

	server 127.127.27.0 # ARCRON MSF radio clock unit 0.
	# Fudge timestamps by about 20ms.
	fudge 127.127.27.0 time1 0.020

    You will need to observe your system's behaviour, assuming you have
    some other NTP source to compare it with, to work out what the
    fudge factor should be.  For my Sun SS1 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 with
    my MSF clock with my distance from the MSF transmitter, +20ms
    seemed about right, after some observation.

 3) REFID has been made "MSFa" to reflect the MSF time source and the
    ARCRON receiver.

 4) DEFAULT_RESYNC_TIME is the time in seconds (by default) before
    forcing a resync since the last attempt.  This is picked to give a
    little less than an hour between resyncs and to try to avoid
    clashing with any regular event at a regular time-past-the-hour
    which might cause systematic errors.

    The INITIAL_RESYNC_DELAY is to avoid bothering the clock and
    running down its batteries unnecesarily if ntpd is going to crash
    or be killed or reconfigured quickly.  If ARCRON_KEEN is defined
    then this period is long enough for (with normal polling rates)
    enough time samples to have been taken to allow ntpd to sync to
    the clock before the interruption for the clock to resync to MSF.
    This avoids ntpd syncing to another peer first and then
    almost immediately hopping to the MSF clock.

    The RETRY_RESYNC_TIME is used before rescheduling a resync after a
    resync failed to reveal a statisfatory signal quality (too low or
    unknown).

 5) The clock seems quite jittery, so I have increased the
    median-filter size from the typical (previous) value of 3.  I
    discard up to half the results in the filter.  It looks like maybe
    1 sample in 10 or so (maybe less) is a spike, so allow the median
    filter to discard at least 10% of its entries or 1 entry, whichever
    is greater.

 6) Sleeping *before* each character sent to the unit to allow required
    inter-character time but without introducting jitter and delay in
    handling the response if possible.

 7) If the flag ARCRON_KEEN is defined, take time samples whenever
    possible, even while resyncing, etc.  We rely, in this case, on the
    clock always giving us a reasonable time or else telling us in the
    status byte at the end of the timestamp that it failed to sync to
    MSF---thus we should never end up syncing to completely the wrong
    time.

 8) If the flag ARCRON_OWN_FILTER is defined, use own versions of
    refclock median-filter routines to get round small bug in 3-5.90
    code which does not return the median offset. XXX Removed this
    bit due NTP Version 4 upgrade - dlm.

 9) We would appear to have a year-2000 problem with this clock since
    it returns only the two least-significant digits of the year.  But
    ntpd ignores the year and uses the local-system year instead, so
    this is in fact not a problem.  Nevertheless, we attempt to do a
    sensible thing with the dates, wrapping them into a 100-year
    window.

 10)Logs stats information that can be used by Derek's Tcl/Tk utility
    to show the status of the clock.

 11)The clock documentation insists that the number of bits per
    character to be sent to the clock, and sent by it, is 11, including
    one start bit and two stop bits.  The data format is either 7+even
    or 8+none.


TO-DO LIST
==========

  * Eliminate use of scanf(), and maybe sprintf().

  * Allow user setting of resync interval to trade battery life for
    accuracy; maybe could be done via fudge factor or unit number.

  * Possibly note the time since the last resync of the MSF clock to
    MSF as the age of the last reference timestamp, ie trust the
    clock's oscillator not very much...

  * Add very slow auto-adjustment up to a value of +/- time2 to correct
    for long-term errors in the clock value (time2 defaults to 0 so the
    correction would be disabled by default).

  * Consider trying to use the tty_clk/ppsclock support.

  * Possibly use average or maximum signal quality reported during
    resync, rather than just the last one, which may be atypical.
