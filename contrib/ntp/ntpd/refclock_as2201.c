/*
 * This driver supports the Austron 2200A/2201A GPS Receiver with
 * Buffered RS-232-C Interface Module. Note that the original 2200/2201
 * receivers will not work reliably with this driver, since the older
 * design cannot accept input commands at any reasonable data rate.
 *
 * The program sends a "*toc\r" to the radio and expects a response of
 * the form "yy:ddd:hh:mm:ss.mmm\r" where yy = year of century, ddd =
 * day of year, hh:mm:ss = second of day and mmm = millisecond of
 * second. Then, it sends statistics commands to the radio and expects
 * a multi-line reply showing the corresponding statistics or other
 * selected data. Statistics commands are sent in order as determined by
 * a vector of commands; these might have to be changed with different
 * radio options. If flag4 of the fudge configuration command is set to
 * 1, the statistics data are written to the clockstats file for later
 * processing.
 *
 * In order for this code to work, the radio must be placed in non-
 * interactive mode using the "off" command and with a single <cr>
 * response using the "term cr" command. The setting of the "echo"
 * and "df" commands does not matter. The radio should select UTC
 * timescale using the "ts utc" command.
 *
 * There are two modes of operation for this driver. The first with
 * default configuration is used with stock kernels and serial-line
 * drivers and works with almost any machine. In this mode the driver
 * assumes the radio captures a timestamp upon receipt of the "*" that
 * begins the driver query. Accuracies in this mode are in the order of
 * a millisecond or two and the receiver can be connected to only one
 * host.
 *
 * The second mode of operation can be used for SunOS kernels that have
 * been modified with the ppsclock streams module included in this
 * distribution. The mode is enabled if flag3 of the fudge configuration
 * command has been set to 1. In this mode a precise timestamp is
 * available using a gadget box and 1-pps signal from the receiver. This
 * improves the accuracy to the order of a few tens of microseconds. In
 * addition, the serial output and 1-pps signal can be bussed to more
 * than one hosts, but only one of them should be connected to the
 * radio input data line.

 * Radio commands to extract statitistics

 * A command consists of an ASCII string terminated by a <cr> (\r). The
 * command list consist of a sequence of commands terminated by a null
 * string ("\0"). One command from the list is sent immediately
 * following each received timecode (*toc\r command) and the ASCII
 * strings received from the radio are saved along with the timecode in
 * the clockstats file. Subsequent commands are sent at each timecode,
 * with the last one in the list followed by the first one. The data
 * received from the radio consist of ASCII strings, each terminated by
 * a <cr> (\r) character. The number of strings for each command is
 * specified as the first line of output as an ASCII-encode number. Note
 * that the ETF command requires the Input Buffer Module and the LORAN
 * commands require the LORAN Assist Module. However, if these modules
 * are not installed, the radio and this driver will continue to operate
 * successfuly, but no data will be captured for these commands.
