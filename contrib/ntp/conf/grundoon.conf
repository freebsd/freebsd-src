# Spectracom 8170/Netclock-2 WWVB receiver. This receiver is equipped
# with a 1-pps and IRIG outputs. The 1-pps signal is connected via the
# ppsclock streams module and the carrier detect line of the CHU
# receiver below (ttyb). The IRIG signal is connected via an attenuator
# to the audio port (/dev/audio). The propagation delay computed from
# geographical coordinates is 8.8 ms, while the receiver delay
# calibrated at the factory is 17.3 ms, for a total delay of 26.1 ms.
# This is confirmed within 0.1 ms at the 1-pps signal output using a
# portable cesium clock. We add a fudge time1 of 3.5 ms so the driver
# time agrees with the 1-pps signal to within 1 ms. The fudge flag4 is
# set to cause the receiver to dump the quality table once each day to
# the clockstats file.

#
# IRIG Audio Decoder. The IRGI signal of the Spectracom WWVB receiver is
# connected to the audio codec via a resistor attenuator. We add a fudge
# time1 of 3.5 ms so the driver agrees with the calibrated 1-pps signal
# to within 0.1 ms. We also specify a reference ID of WWVB to indicate
# the signal origin. Note the prefer keyword in the server line, which
# favors this driver over all others that survive the clock selection
# algorithm. See README.refclock for further insight on this feature.

# PST/Traconex 1020 WWV/WWVH Receier. The internal DIPswitches are set
# as near as possible to the delays to WWV (8.8 ms) and WWVH (28.1 ms),
# as computed from geographical coordinates. We add a fudge time1 of 5.9
# ms so the driver time agrees with the 1-pps signal to within 1 ms for
# WWV. We also set the stratum to 1, so this receiver will not normally
# be selected, unless the primary WWVB receiver comes unstuck.

#
# Scratchbuilt CHU Receiver. The audio signal from a computer controlled
# CHU receiver is connected to a gadget box, which contains a 103A modem
# chip and level converter operating at 300 bps. The propagation delay
# computed from geographical coordinates is 3.0 ms, which is the value
# of the fudge time1 parameter. We add a fudge time2 of 9.9 ms so that
# the driver time agrees with the 1-pps signal to within a few ms,
# ordinarily the best possible with this receiver. The fudge flag3 is
# set because the 1-pps signal happens to be connected vit the carrier
# detect line on this port (ttyb). We also set the stratum to 1, so this
# receiver will not normally be selected, unless the primary WWVB
# receiver comes unstuck.

#
# NIST Automated Computer Time Service. This driver calls a special
# telephone number in Boulder, CO, to fetch the time directly from the
# NIST cesium farm. The details of the complicated calling program are
# in the README.refclock file. The Practical Peripherals 9600SA modem
# does not work correctly with the ACTS echo-delay scheme for
# automatically calculating the propagation delay, so the fudge flag2 is
# set to disable the feature. Instead, we add a fudge time1 of 65.0 ms
# so that the driver time agrees with th e1-pps signal to within 1 ms.
# The phone command specifies three alternate telephone numbers,
# including AT modem command prefix, which will be tried one after the
# other at each measurement attempt. In this case, a cron job is used to
# set fudge flag1, causing a measurement attempt, every six hours.

# Heath GC-1000 Most Accurate Clock. This is a WWV receiver with a
# claimed accuracy better than 100 ms under "hi spec" conditions, but
# such conditions are not frequent. The propagation delay DIPswitchs are
# set to 9 ms, as close as possible to the 8.8 ms computed from
# geographical coordinates. We add a fudge time2 of 40.0 ms so that the
# driver time agrees with the 1-pps signal to within 50 ms, ordinarily
# the best possible with this receiver. We also set the stratum to 1, so
# this receiver will not normally be selected, unless the primary WWVB
# receiver comes unstuck.

# Undisciplined Local Clock. This is a fake driver intended for backup
# and when no outside source of synchronized time is available. The
# default stratum is usually 3, but in this case we elect to use stratum
# 0. Since the server line does not have the prefer keyword, this driver
# is never used for synchronization, unless no other other
# synchronization source is available. In case the local host is
# controlled by some external source, such as an external oscillator or
# another protocol, the prefer keyword would cause the local host to
# disregard all other synchronization sources, unless the kernel
# modifications are in use and declare an unsynchronized condition.

# PPS Clock. This driver is used to capture a 1-pps signal when the PPS
# kernel modifications are not in use. It can be configured for the
# tty_clk or ppsclock streams module or no module at all, assuming the
# RS232 connector is properly wired. Normally, the 1-pps signal is
# generated by a radio clock, in this cast the Spectracom clock
# 127.127.4.1 also configured for this host. When used this way, the
# associated radio clock normally has the prefer keyword in the serve
# command line. The PPS driver then will be selected only if the prefer
# peer is operating within nominal error bounds. See the README.refclock
# file for further details.
