README file for directory ./clockstuff of the NTP Version 4 distribution

This directory contains the sources for utility programs designed to
support radio clocks.  chutest.c is desgined to test the depredated
chu_clk line discipline or STREAMS module and can also test a CHU
modem in raw mode.

You can make things in here by typing one or more of:

	make propdelay (or `make')
	make chutest

Propdelay computes high frequency propagation delays, given the
longitude and latitude of the transmitter and receiver.  Use
this for WWV/H and CHU.  Don't use it for WWVB (the computation
is easier for that).

Chutest can be used to input and process data from a CHU modem
attached to a serial port.  It will use the CHU line discipline
(if installed), or raw mode otherwise.  This was used to test
out the initial reduction algorithms, and may not be up to date.
