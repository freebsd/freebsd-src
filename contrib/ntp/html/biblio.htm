<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of
a computer client or server to another server or reference time source,
such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies
typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds
on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a
Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example.

<p>Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and
diverse network paths, in order to achieve high accuracy and
reliability. Some configurations include cryptographic authentication to
prevent accidental or malicious protocol attacks. Information on the NTP
architecture, protocol and algorithms can be found in the following
articles and reports, which are available online. General issues of the
concepts and facilities assumed by NTP are discussed in tne <a
href=exec.htm>Executive Summary - Computer Network Time
Synchronization</a> page, while issues related to the NTP timescale and
pending century are discussed in the <A HREF=y2k.htm> Network Time
Protocol Year 2000 Conformance Statement</A> page, both of which are
included in this document.

<p>Note that network timekeeping technology continues to advance and may
obsolete some of the following documents. For a current list of all
papers, reports, briefings and other documents relevant to the NTP
community, see the <a href=http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills>David L.
Mills</a> web page.

<P>The NTP architecture, protocol and algorithm models are described in

The NTP specification and implementation has evolved over the last two
decades to the current Version 4 of the protocol. This version includes
significant enhancements in accuracy and reliability, as determined by
experience in an estimated total of well over 100,000 clients and
servers in the Internet, while retaining backward compatibility with
previous versions.

<P>This software distribution contains an implementation of the NTP
Version 4 architecture, protocol and algorithms. While a formal
specification of this version is not yet available, this version is
fully compliant with the previous NTP Version 3 specification and
implementation defined in

The NTP Version 4 implementation adds a number of extensions and
refinements to the previous version, including an autonomous
configuration and authentication capability, improved clock discipline
algorithms capable of submicrosecond accuracy and many other
refinements. Specific changes since the Version 3 specification was
issued include:
