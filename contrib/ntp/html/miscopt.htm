<DT>
<TT>broadcastdelay <I>seconds</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
The broadcast and multicast modes require a special calibration to determine
the network delay between the local and remote servers. Ordinarily, this
is done automatically by the initial protocol exchanges between the local
and remote servers. In some cases, the calibration procedure may fail due
to network or server access controls, for example. This command specifies
the default delay to be used under these circumstances. Typically (for
Ethernet), a number between 0.003 and 0.007 seconds is appropriate. The
default when this command is not used is 0.004 seconds.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>trap <I>host_address</I> [port <I>port_number</I>] [interface <I>interface_address</I>]</TT></DT>

<DD>
This command configures a trap receiver at the given host address and port
number for sending messages with the specified local interface address.
If the port number is unspecified. a value of 18447 is used. If the interface
address is not specified, the message is sent with a source address of
the local interface the message is sent through. Note that on a multihomed
host the interface used may vary from time to time with routing changes.</DD>

<DD>
The trap receiver will generally log event messages and other information
from the server in a log file. While such monitor programs may also request
their own trap dynamically, configuring a trap receiver will ensure that
no messages are lost when the server is started.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>setvar <I>variable</I> [default]</TT></DT>

<DD>
This command adds an additional system variable. These variables can be
used to distribute additional information such as the access policy. If
the variable of the form <TT><I>name</I> = <I>value</I></TT> is followed
by the <TT>default</TT> keyword, the variable will be listed as part of
the default system variables (<TT>ntpq rv</TT> command). These additional
variables serve informational purposes only. They are not related to the
protocol other that they can be listed. The known protocol variables will
always override any variables defined via the <TT>setvar</TT> mechanism.
There are three special variables that contain the names of all variable
of the same group. The <TT>sys_var_list</TT> holds the names of all system
variables. The <TT>peer_var_list</TT> holds the names of all peer variables
and the <TT>clock_var_list</TT> holds the names of the reference clock
variables.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>logfile <I>logfile</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
This command specifies the location of an alternate log file to be used
instead of the default system <TT>syslog</TT> facility.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>logconfig <I>configkeyword</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
This command controls the amount and type of output written to the system
<TT>syslog</TT> facility or the alternate <TT>logfile</TT> log file. By
default, all output is turned on. All <I><TT>configkeyword</TT></I> keywords
can be prefixed with <TT>=</TT>, <TT>+</TT> and <TT>-</TT>, where <TT>=</TT>
sets the <TT>syslogmask</TT>, <TT>+</TT> adds and <TT>-</TT> removes messages.
<TT>syslog messages</TT> can be controlled in four classes (, <TT>peer</TT>,
<TT>sys</TT> and <TT>sync</TT>). Within these classes four types of messages
can be controlled.</DD>

<DD>
Informational messages (<TT>info</TT>) control configuration information.
Event messages (<TT>events</TT>) control logging of events (reachability,
synchronization, alarm conditions). Statistical output is controlled with
the <TT>statistics</TT> keyword. The final message group is the status
messages. This describes mainly the synchronizations status. Configuration
keywords are formed by concatenating the message class with the event class.
The <TT>allprefix</TT> can be used instead of a message class. A message
class may also be followed by the <TT>all</TT> keyword to enable/disable
all messages of the respective message class.</DD>

<DD>
Thus, a minimal log configuration could look like this:</DD>

<DD>
<TT>logconfig = syncstatus +sysevents</TT></DD>

<DD>
This would just list the synchronizations state of <TT>ntpd</TT> and the
major system events. For a simple reference server, the following minimum
message configuration could be useful:</DD>

<DD>
<TT>logconfig = syncall +clockall</TT></DD>

<DD>
This configuration will list all clock information and synchronization
information. All other events and messages about peers, system events and
so on is suppressed.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>
Variables</H4>
Most variables used by the NTP protocol can be examined with the <TT>ntpdc</TT>
(mode 7 messages) and the <TT>ntpq</TT> (mode 6 messages). Currently, very
few variables can be modified via mode 6 messages. These variables are
either created with the <TT>setvar</TT> directive or the leap warning bits.
The leap warning bits can be set in the <TT>leapwarning</TT> variable up
to one month ahead. Both the <TT>leapwarning</TT> and <TT>leapindication</TT>
variables have a slightly different encoding than the usual leap bits interpretation:
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>00</TT></DT>

<DD>
The daemon passes the leap bits of its synchronization source (usual mode
of operation).</DD>

<DT>
<TT>01/10</TT></DT>

<DD>
A leap second is added/deleted (operator forced leap second).</DD>

<DT>
<TT>11</TT></DT>

<DD>
Leap information from the synchronizations source is ignored (thus <TT>LEAP_NOWARNING</TT>
is passed on).</DD>
</DL>
