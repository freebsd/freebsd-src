Notes on CPU clock oscillator tolerance with SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.3

A bug in SunOS 4.1.1 results in the kernel time losing 1 microsecond
per tick of the system clock. The bug was fixed (bugid 1094383) for
SunOS 4.1.1 and corrected in SunOS 4.1.3. The easiest way to fix this
is to replace the 4.1.1 binary clock.o with the corresponding 4.1.3
binary. Without this change it is necessary to use the tickadj program
included in this distribution with the -t 9999 option.

The tickadj option will work in all cases except when the kernel has
been modified to correct the CPU clock oscillator frequency using a
1-pps signal from a precision source. The bugfix must be installed for
this wrinkle to work properly.
