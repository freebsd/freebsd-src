Some major changes were necessary to make xntp v3 run on the DEC Alpha
hardware running DEC OSF/1.  All "long" and "u_long" declarations and
casts in the code were changed to "LONG" and "U_LONG" and a new header
file (include/ntp_types.h) was added.  The new header file defines
LONG as int and U_LONG as u_int for the Alpha hardware and as long
and u_long for anything else.  A couple of #ifs where changed in
ntpq and xntpdc to get the result of a signal defined correctly.  The
Config.decosf1 file built the programs here with no problems.

I don't have a radio clock here, so none of that code has been tested.
I have run xntpd, xntpdc, xntpres, ntpq, ntpdate, and tickadj under
DEC OSF/1 v1.2-2 (BL10).

Support for NTP Version 2 is included with the current OSF/1 release. If
you are upgrading to NTP Version 3 with this distribution, you should not
use the xntpd or ntpq programs that come with the OSF/1 release. The
older programs should be replaced by the newer programs of the same name,
either in situ or via a link to a tranquil spot like /usr/local/bin. The
make install script in the this distribution don't work due to a silly
install program incompatibility, so you will need to copy the programs by
hand.

Don't use the setup utility to install or configure the xntpd installation,
as it will cheerfully clobber your painstakingly crafted ntp.conf program.
However, assuming you put this file in /etc/ntp.conf, you can use the
/sbin/init.d/xntpd script to start and stop the daemon.

This distribution compiles with nominal mumur with the stock cc compiler
that comes with OSF/1.
