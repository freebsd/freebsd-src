Included in this distribution of XNTP is a configuration file suitable
for use with BSDI's BSD/OS 1.1 (formerly BSD/386 1.1).  On this system,
the "cc" command is GCC 1.4x rather than PCC or GCC 2.x.  It is imperative
that "cc" be used since it predefines the symbol __bsdi__; if you want to
use another compiler you will need to add -D__bsdi__ to catch the various
#ifdef's required for this system.

The Kinemetrics/Truetime GPS-TM/TMD driver is known to work on this system.
The GPS-805 and GOES should also work fine.  Hell, they should all work fine
but it's hard to test very many locally.

Due to BNR2's strict interpretation of POSIX and XNTP's use of SIGIO, BSD/OS
can only handle one refclock per daemon.  We're working this out with the
system architects.

The config file is machine/bsdi, and the following steps should be all that
are required to install and use the bits.

Note that you will need GNU sed; the version supplied with BSD/OS 1.1 loops
endlessly during "make refconf".  Likewise you should get GNU make, which
the instructions below assume that you have put in /usr/local/bin/gnumake.

To build the software:

	rm -f Config.local
	gnumake refconf
	gnumake MAKE=gnumake

To install the software:

	gnumake install

	This will place all of the executables in /usr/local/etc.  The config
	file is expected to be /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf and the key file for
	the optional authentication is /etc/ntp.keys.

	Craft a config file and a key file, and put them in the right places.
	There is information on how to do this elsewhere in the documentation,
	the only thing I'll mention is that I put the drift file in 
	/var/log/ntp.drift, and the authdelay on my 486DX/50 system is 
	0.000064.  Your mileage will vary, learn to use the authspeed tools
	if you're going to authenticate.
	
	In the file /etc/rc.local, make sure that the invocation of ntpd is
	commented out, and add an invocation of xntpd.  Here's what I'm using:

		echo -n 'starting local daemons:'

		if [ -f /etc/ntp.keys -a -f /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf ]; then
		    echo -n ' xntpd';           /usr/local/etc/xntpd
		fi

		#XXX# echo -n ' ntpd';          /usr/libexec/ntpd -t

At this point, you should be good to go.  Try running /usr/local/etc/xntpd and
using ntpq or xntpdc to see if things are working, then pay attention the next
time you reboot to make sure that xntpd is being invoked, and use ntpq or
xntpdc again to make sure all is well.  

Enjoy!
