<H4>Reference Clock Support</H4>

The NTP Version 4 daemon supports many different radio, satellite and
modem reference clocks plus a special pseudo-clock used for backup or
when no other clock source is available. Detailed descriptions of
individual device drivers and options can be found in the <A
HREF="refclock.htm">Reference Clock Drivers </A>page. Additional
information can be found in the pages referenced there, including the <A
HREF="rdebug.htm">Debugging Hints for Reference Clock Drivers</A> and <A
HREF="howto.html">How To Write a Reference Clock Driver</A> pages. In
many drivers, support for a PPS signal is available as described in <A
HREF="pps.htm">Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal Interfacing</A> page. Many
drivers support special line discipline/streams modules which can
significantly improve the accuracy using the driver. These are described
in the <A HREF="ldisc.htm">Line Disciplines and Streams Drivers</A>
page.

<P>A reference clock will generally (though not always) be a radio
timecode receiver which is synchronized to a source of standard time
such as the services offered by the NRC in Canada and NIST and USNO in
the U.S. The interface between the computer and the timecode receiver is
device dependent, but is usually a serial port. A device driver specific
to each reference clock must be selected and compiled in the
distribution; however, most common radio, satellite and modem clocks are
included by default. Note that an attempt to configure a reference clock
when the driver has not been included or the hardware port has not been
appropriately configured results in a scalding remark to the system log
file, but is otherwise non hazardous.

<P>For the purposes of configuration, <TT>ntpd</TT> treats reference
clocks in a manner analogous to normal NTP peers as much as possible.
Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically correct but invalid
IP address, in order to distinguish them from normal NTP peers.
Reference clock addresses are of the form <TT>127.127.<I>t.u</I></TT>,
where <I><TT>t</TT></I> is an integer denoting the clock type and
<I><TT>u</TT></I> indicates the unit number. While it may seem overkill,
it is in fact sometimes useful to configure multiple reference clocks of
the same type, in which case the unit numbers&nbsp; must be unique.

<P>The <TT>server</TT> command is used to configure a reference clock,
where the <I><TT>address</TT></I> argument in that command is the clock
address. The <TT>key</TT>, <TT>version</TT> and <TT>ttl</TT> options are
not used for reference clock support. The <TT>mode</TT> option is added
for reference clock support, as described below. The <TT>prefer</TT>
option can be useful to persuade the server to cherish a reference clock
with somewhat more enthusiasm than other reference clocks or peers.
Further information on this option can be found in the <A
HREF="prefer.htm">Mitigation Rules and the <TT>prefer</TT> Keyword
</A>page. The <TT>minpoll</TT> and <TT>maxpoll</TT> options have meaning
only for selected clock drivers. See the individual clock driver
document pages for additional information.

<P>The stratum number of a reference clock is by default zero. Since the
<TT>ntpd</TT> daemon adds one to the stratum of each peer, a primary
server ordinarily displays stratum one. In order to provide engineered
backups, it is often useful to specify the reference clock stratum as
greater than zero. The <TT>stratum</TT> option is used for this purpose.
Also, in cases involving both a reference clock and a pulse-per-second
(PPS) discipline signal, it is useful to specify the reference clock
identifier as other than the default, depending on the driver. The
<TT>refid</TT> option is used for this purpose. Except where noted,
these options apply to all clock drivers.

<H4>Reference Clock Commands</H4>

<DL><DT><TT>server 127.127.<I>t.u</I> [prefer] [mode <I>int</I>]
[minpoll <I>int</I>] [maxpoll <I>int</I>]</TT></DT>
<DD>This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
ways. The options are interpreted as follows:</DD>

<DL><DT><TT>prefer</TT></DT>
<DD>Marks the reference clock as preferred. All other things being
equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization among a set of
correctly operating hosts. See the <A HREF="prefer.htm">Mitigation Rules
and the <TT>prefer</TT> Keyword </A>page for further information.</DD>

<DT><TT>mode <I>int</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in a device-specific
fashion. For instance, it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS driver
and a device subtype in the <TT>parse</TT> drivers.</DD>

<DT><TT>minpoll <I>int</I></TT></DT>
<DT><TT>maxpoll<I> int</I></TT></DT>
<DD>These options specify the minimum and maximum polling interval for
reference clock messages, in seconds to the power of two. For most
directly connected reference clocks, both <TT>minpoll</TT> and
<TT>maxpoll</TT> default to 6 (64 s). For modem reference clocks,
<TT>minpoll</TT> defaults to 10 (17.1 m) and <TT>maxpoll</TT> defaults
to 14 (4.5 h). The allowable range is 4 (16 s) to 17 (36.4 h)
inclusive.</DD>

</DL>

<DT><TT>fudge 127.127.<I>t.u</I> [time1 <I>sec</I>] [time2 <I>sec</I>]
[stratum <I>int</I>] [refid <I>string</I>] [mode <I>int</I>] [flag1 0|1]
[flag2 0|1] [flag3 0|1] [flag4 0|1]</TT></DT>
<DD>This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
ways. It must immediately follow the <TT>server</TT> command which
configures the driver. Note that the same capability is possible at run
time using the <TT><A HREF="ntpdc.htm">ntpdc</A></TT> program. The
options are interpreted as follows:</DD>

<DL>

<DT><TT>time1 <I>sec</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies a constant to be added to the time offset produced by the
driver, a fixed-point decimal number in seconds. This is used as a
calibration constant to adjust the nominal time offset of a particular
clock to agree with an external standard, such as a precision PPS
signal. It also provides a way to correct a systematic error or bias due
to serial port latencies, different cable lengths or receiver internal
delay. The specified offset is in addition to the propagation delay
provided by other means, such as internal DIPswitches. Where a
calibration for an individual system and driver is available, an
approximate correction is noted in the driver documentation pages.</DD>

<DT><TT>time2 <I>secs</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies a fixed-point decimal number in seconds, which is
interpreted in a driver-dependent way. See the descriptions of specific
drivers in the <A HREF="refclock.htm">reference clock drivers</A>
page.</DD>

<DT><TT>stratum <I>int</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies the stratum number assigned to the driver, an integer
between 0 and 15. This number overrides the default stratum number
ordinarily assigned by the driver itself, usually zero.</DD>

<DT><TT>refid <I>string</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies an ASCII string of from one to four characters which
defines the reference identifier used by the driver. This string
overrides the default identifier ordinarily assigned by the driver
itself.</DD>

<DT><TT>mode <I>int</I></TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in a device-specific
fashion. For instance, it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS driver
and a device subtype in the <TT>parse</TT> drivers.</DD>

<DT><TT>flag1</TT> <TT>flag2</TT> <TT>flag3</TT> <TT>flag4</TT></DT>
<DD>These four flags are used for customizing the clock driver. The
interpretation of these values, and whether they are used at all, is a
function of the particular clock driver. However, by convention
<TT>flag4</TT> is used to enable recording monitoring data to the
<TT>clockstats</TT> file configured with the <TT>filegen</TT> command.
When a PPS signal is available, a special automatic calibration facility
is provided. If the <tt>flag1</tt> switch is set and the PPS signal is
actively disciplining the system time, the calibration value is
automatically adjusted to maintain a residual offset of zero. Further
information on the <TT>filegen</TT> command can be found in the <A
HREF="monopt.htm">Monitoring Options </A>page.</DD>

</DL>

<DT><TT>pps <I>device</I> [assert|clear] [hardpps]</TT></DT>
<DD>Specifies the name and options for the serial port device to which
the PPS signal is connected. Note, this command replaces use of
<TT>fudge flag3</TT>, which was used for the same purpose in NTPv3. Note
that this command should preceed the <TT>server</TT> and <TT>fudge</TT>
command for the same device. Note also that the <TT>assert</TT>,
<TT>clear</TT> and <TT>hardpps</TT> options are only available if the
<tt>ppsapi</tt> standard PPS interface is available.</DD>

<DL>

<DT><TT>device</TT></DT>
<DD>Specify the device name associated with the PPS signal. The name
must match exactly the link name specified in the driver documentation
page.</DD>

<DT><TT>assert</TT></DT>
<DT><TT>clear</TT></DT>
<DD>Using <TT>assert</TT> or <TT>clear</TT> specifies if the high going
or low going edge of the signal must be used. The default is
<TT>assert</TT>.</DD>

<DT><TT>hardpps</TT></DT>
<DD>This flag is used to tell the kernel that the signal from this
device must be used to drive hardpps().</DD>

<DD>The <TT>assert</TT>, <TT>clear</TT> and <TT>hardpps</TT> options
are only available if the PPSAPI is used.</DD>
