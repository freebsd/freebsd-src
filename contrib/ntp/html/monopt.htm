Monitoring Support</H4>
<TT>ntpd</TT> includes a comprehensive monitoring facility suitable for
continuous, long term recording of server and client timekeeping performance.
See the <TT>statistics</TT> command below for a listing and example of
each type of statistics currently supported. Statistic files are managed
using file generation sets and scripts in the ./scripts directory of this
distribution. Using these facilities and Unix <TT>cron</TT> jobs, the data
can be automatically summarized and archived for retrospective analysis.
<H4>
Monitoring Commands</H4>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>statistics <I>name</I> [...]</TT></DT>

<DD>
Enables writing of statistics records. Currently, four kinds of <I><TT>name</TT></I>
statistics are supported.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>loopstats</TT></DT>

<DD>
Enables recording of loop filter statistics information. Each update of
the local clock outputs a line of the following form to the file generation
set named <TT>loopstats</TT>:</DD>

<PRE>50935 75440.031 0.000006019 13.778190 0.000351733 0.013380 6</PRE>

<DD>
The first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds
and fraction past UTC midnight). The next five fields show time offset
(seconds), frequency offset (parts per million - PPM), RMS jitter (seconds),
Allan deviation (PPM) and clock discipline time constant.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>peerstats</TT></DT>

<DD>
Enables recording of peer statistics information. This includes statistics
records of all peers of a NTP server and of special signals, where present
and configured. Each valid update appends a line of the following form
to the current element of a file generation set named <TT>peerstats</TT>:</DD>

<PRE>48773 10847.650 127.127.4.1 9714 -0.001605 0.00000 0.00142</PRE>

<DD>
The first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds
and fraction past UTC midnight). The next two fields show the peer address
in dotted-quad notation and status, respectively. The status field is encoded
in hex in the format described in Appendix A of the NTP specification RFC
1305. The final three fields show the offset, delay and RMS jitter, all
in seconds.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>clockstats</TT></DT>

<DD>
Enables recording of clock driver statistics information. Each update received
from a clock driver appends a line of the following form to the file generation
set named <TT>clockstats</TT>:</DD>

<PRE>49213 525.624 127.127.4.1 93 226 00:08:29.606 D</PRE>

<DD>
The first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds
and fraction past UTC midnight). The next field shows the clock address
in dotted-quad notation, The final field shows the last timecode received
from the clock in decoded ASCII format, where meaningful. In some clock
drivers a good deal of additional information can be gathered and displayed
as well. See information specific to each clock for further details.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>rawstats</TT></DT>

<DD>
Enables recording of raw-timestamp statistics information. This includes
statistics records of all peers of a NTP server and of special signals,
where present and configured. Each NTP message received from a peer or
clock driver appends a line of the following form to the file generation
set named <TT>rawstats</TT>:</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DD>
<TT>50928 2132.543 128.4.1.1 128.4.1.20 3102453281.584327000 3102453281.58622800031
02453332.540806000 3102453332.541458000</TT></DD>

<DD>
<TT>&nbsp;</TT></DD>

<DD>
The first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds
and fraction past UTC midnight). The next field shows the peer or clock
address in dotted-quad notation, The final four fields show the originate,
receive, transmit and final NTP timestamps in order. The timestamp values
are as received and before processing by the various data smoothing and
mitigation algorithms.</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>statsdir <I>directory_path</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Indicates the full path of a directory where statistics files should be
created (see below). This keyword allows the (otherwise constant) <TT>filegen</TT>
filename prefix to be modified for file generation sets, which is useful
for handling statistics logs.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>filegen <I>name</I> [file <I>filename</I>] [type <I>typename</I>] [link
| nolink] [enable | disable]</TT></DT>

<DT>
<TT>&nbsp;</TT></DT>

<DD>
Configures setting of generation file set <I>name</I>. Generation file
sets provide a means for handling files that are continuously growing during
the lifetime of a server. Server statistics are a typical example for such
files. Generation file sets provide access to a set of files used to store
the actual data. At any time at most one element of the set is being written
to. The type given specifies when and how data will be directed to a new
element of the set. This way, information stored in elements of a file
set that are currently unused are available for administrational operations
without the risk of disturbing the operation of <TT>ntpd</TT>. (Most important:
they can be removed to free space for new data produced.)</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DD>
Note that this command can be sent from the <TT>ntpdc</TT> program running
at a remote location.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<I><TT>name</TT></I></DT>

<DD>
This is the type of the statistics records, as shown in the <TT>statististics</TT>
command.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>file <I>filename</I></TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
This is the file name for the statistics records. Filenames of set members
are built from three elements:</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
prefix</DT>

<DD>
This is a constant filename path. It is not subject to modifications via
the <TT>filegen</TT> option. It is defined by the server, usually specified
as a compile-time constant. It may, however, be configurable for individual
file generation sets via other commands. For example, the prefix used with
<TT>loopstats</TT> and <TT>peerstats</TT> generation can be configured
using the <TT>statsdir</TT> option explained above.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<I><TT>filename</TT></I></DT>

<DD>
This string is directly concatenated to the prefix mentioned above (no
intervening <TT>/</TT> (slash)). This can be modified using the <TT>file</TT>
argument to the <TT>filegen</TT> statement. No <TT>..</TT> elements are
allowed in this component to prevent filenames referring to parts outside
the filesystem hierarchy denoted by <TT>prefix</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
suffix</DT>

<DD>
This part is reflects individual elements of a file set. It is generated
according to the type of a file set.</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>type <I>typename</I></TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
A file generation set is characterized by its type. The following types
are supported:</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>none</TT></DT>

<DD>
The file set is actually a single plain file.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>pid</TT></DT>

<DD>
One element of file set is used per incarnation of a <TT>ntpd</TT> server.
This type does not perform any changes to file set members during runtime,
however it provides an easy way of separating files belonging to different
<TT>ntpd</TT> server incarnations. The set member filename is built by
appending a <TT>.</TT> (dot) to concatenated <I>prefix</I> and <I>filename</I>
strings, and appending the decimal representation of the process ID of
the <TT>ntpd</TT> server process.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>day</TT></DT>

<DD>
One file generation set element is created per day. A day is defined as
the period between 00:00 and 24:00 UTC. The file set member suffix consists
of a <TT>.</TT> (dot) and a day specification in the form <TT>YYYYMMDD.
YYYY</TT> is a 4-digit year number (e.g., 1992). <TT>MM</TT> is a two digit
month number. <TT>DD</TT> is a two digit day number. Thus, all information
written at 10 December 1992 would end up in a file named <TT><I>prefix
filename</I>.19921210</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>week</TT></DT>

<DD>
Any file set member contains data related to a certain week of a year.
The term week is defined by computing day-of-year modulo 7. Elements of
such a file generation set are distinguished by appending the following
suffix to the file set filename base: A dot, a 4-digit year number, the
letter <TT>W</TT>, and a 2-digit week number. For example, information
from January, 10th 1992 would end up in a file with suffix <TT>.1992W1</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>month</TT></DT>

<DD>
One generation file set element is generated per month. The file name suffix
consists of a dot, a 4-digit year number, and a 2-digit month.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>year</TT></DT>

<DD>
One generation file element is generated per year. The filename suffix
consists of a dot and a 4 digit year number.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>age</TT></DT>

<DD>
This type of file generation sets changes to a new element of the file
set every 24 hours of server operation. The filename suffix consists of
a dot, the letter <TT>a</TT>, and an 8-digit number. This number is taken
to be the number of seconds the server is running at the start of the corresponding
24-hour period. Information is only written to a file generation by specifying
<TT>enabl</TT>; output is prevented by specifying <TT>disable</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>link | nolink</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
It is convenient to be able to access the current element of a file generation
set by a fixed name. This feature is enabled by specifying <TT>link</TT>
and disabled using <TT>nolink</TT>. If <TT>link</TT> is specified, a hard
link from the current file set element to a file without suffix is created.
When there is already a file with this name and the number of links of
this file is one, it is renamed appending a dot, the letter <TT>C</TT>,
and the pid of the <TT>ntpd</TT> server process. When the number of links
is greater than one, the file is unlinked. This allows the current file
to be accessed by a constant name.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>enable | disable</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
Enables or disables the recording function.</DD>
</DL>
