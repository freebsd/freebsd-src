<h4>Configuration Support</h4>

<p>Following is a description of the configuration commands in
NTPv4. These commands have the same basic functions as in NTPv3
and in some cases new functions and new operands. The various
modes are determined by the command keyword and the type of the
required IP address. Addresses are classed by type as (s) a
remote server or peer (IP class A, B and C), (b) the broadcast
address of a local interface, (m) a multicast address (IP class
D), or (r) a reference clock address (127.127.x.x). Note that,
while autokey and burst modes are supported by these commands,
their effect in some weird mode combinations can be meaningless
or even destructive.</p>

    <dd>These four commands specify the time server name or
        address to be used and the mode in which to operate. The <i><tt>address</tt></i><tt>
        </tt>can be either a DNS name or a IP address in
        dotted-quad notation. Additional information on
        association behavior can be found in the <a
        href="assoc.htm">Association Management</a> page.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd><dl>
            <dt><tt>server</tt></dt>
            <dd>For type s and r addresses, this operates as the
                NTPv3 server command, which mobilizes a
                persistent client mode association. The <tt>server</tt>
                command specifies that the local server is to
                operate in client mode with the specified remote
                server. In this mode, the local server can be
                synchronized to the remote server, but the remote
                server can never be synchronized to the local
                server.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>peer</tt></dt>
            <dd>For type s addresses (only), this operates as the
                current <tt>peer </tt>command, which mobilizes a
                persistent symmetric-active mode association,
                except that additional modes are available. This
                command should NOT be used for type b, m or r
                addresses.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dd>The <tt>peer</tt> command specifies that the
                local server is to operate in symmetric active
                mode with the remote server. In this mode, the
                local server can be synchronized to the remote
                server and, in addition, the remote server can be
                synchronized by the local server. This is useful
                in a network of servers where, depending on
                various failure scenarios, either the local or
                remote server may be the better source of time.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>broadcast</tt></dt>
            <dd>For type b and m addresses (only), this is
                operates as the current NTPv3 <tt>broadcast </tt>command,
                which mobilizes a persistent broadcast mode
                association, except that additional modes are
                available. Multiple commands can be used to
                specify multiple local broadcast interfaces
                (subnets) and/or multiple multicast groups. Note
                that local broadcast messages go only to the
                interface associated with the subnet specified,
                but multicast messages go to all interfaces. In
                the current implementation, the source address
                used for these messages is the Unix host default
                address.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dd>In broadcast mode, the local server sends
                periodic broadcast messages to a client
                population at the <i><tt>address </tt></i>specified,
                which is usually the broadcast address on (one
                of) the local network(s) or a multicast address
                assigned to NTP. The IANA has assigned the
                multicast group address 224.0.1.1 exclusively to
                NTP, but other nonconflicting addresses can be
                used to contain the messages within
                administrative boundaries.. Ordinarily, this
                specification applies only to the local server
                operating as a sender; for operation as a
                broadcast client, see the <tt>broadcastclient</tt>
                or <tt>multicastclient</tt> commands below.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>manycastclient</tt> </dt>
            <dd>For type m addresses (only), this mobilizes a
                manycast client-mode association for the
                multicast address specified. In this case a
                specific address must be supplied which matches
                the address used on the <tt>manycastserver </tt>command
                for the designated manycast servers. The NTP
                multicast address 224.0.1.1 assigned by the IANA
                should NOT be used, unless specific means are
                taken to avoid spraying large areas of the
                Internet with these messages and causing a
                possibly massive implosion of replies at the
                sender. </dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dd>The <tt>manycast </tt>command specifies that the
                local server is to operate in client mode with
                the remote server that are discovered as the
                result of broadcast/multicast messages. The
                client broadcasts a request message to the group
                address associated with the specified <i><tt>address
                </tt></i>and specifically enabled servers respond
                to these messages. The client selects the servers
                providing the best time and continues as with the
                <tt>server </tt>command. The remaining servers
                are discarded as if never heard.</dd>

                authentication fields encrypted using the
                specified <i>key</i> identifier, which is an
                unsigned 32-bit integer less than 65536. The
                default is to include no encryption field.</dd>

            <dt><tt>version </tt><i><tt>version</tt></i></dt>
            <dd>Specifies the version number to be used for
                outgoing NTP packets. Versions 1-4 are the
                choices, with version 4 the default.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>prefer</tt></dt>
            <dd>Marks the server as preferred. All other things
                being equal, this host will be chosen for
                synchronization among a set of correctly
                operating hosts. See the <a href="prefer.htm">Mitigation
                Rules and the <tt>prefer</tt> Keyword </a>page

            <dt><tt>ttl </tt><i><tt>ttl</tt></i></dt>
            <dd>This option is used only with broadcast mode. It
                specifies the time-to-live <i><tt>ttl</tt></i> to
                use on multicast packets. Selection of the proper
                value, which defaults to 127, is something of a
                black art and must be coordinated with the
                network administrator.</dd>

            <dt><tt>maxpoll </tt><i><tt>maxpoll</tt></i></dt>
            <dd>These options specify the minimum and maximum
                polling intervals for NTP messages, in seconds to
                the power of two. The default range is 6 (64 s)
                to 10 (1,024 s).The allowable range is 4 (16 s)
                to 17 (36.4 h) inclusive.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt><tt>broadcastclient</tt></dt>
    <dd>This command directs the local server to listen for and
        respond to broadcast messages received on any local
        interface. Upon hearing a broadcast message for the first
        time, the local server measures the nominal network delay
        using a brief client/server exchange with the remote
        server, then enters the broadcastclient mode, in which it
        listens for and synchronizes to succeeding broadcast
        messages. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or
        malicious disruption in this mode, both the local and
        remote servers should operate using authentication and
        the same trusted key and key identifier.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>multicastclient [</tt><i><tt>address</tt></i><tt>]
        [...]</tt></dt>
    <dd>This command directs the local server to listen for
        multicast messages at the group address(es) of the global
        network. The default address is that assigned by the
        Numbers Czar to NTP (224.0.1.1). This command operates in
        the same way as the <tt>broadcastclient</tt> command, but
        uses IP multicasting. Support for this command requires a
        multicast kernel.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>driftfile </tt><i><tt>driftfile</tt></i></dt>
    <dd>This command specifies the name of the file used to
        record the frequency offset of the local clock
        oscillator. If the file exists, it is read at startup in
        order to set the initial frequency offset and then
        updated once per hour with the current frequency offset
        computed by the daemon. If the file does not exist or
        this command is not given, the initial frequency offset
        is assumed zero. In this case, it may take some hours for
        the frequency to stabilize and the residual timing errors
        to subside.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd>The file format consists of a single line containing a
        single floating point number, which records the frequency
        offset measured in parts-per-million (PPM). The file is
        updated by first writing the current drift value into a
        temporary file and then renaming this file to replace the
        old version. This implies that <tt>ntpd</tt> must have
        write permission for the directory the drift file is
        located in, and that file system links, symbolic or
        otherwise, should be avoided.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>manycastserver </tt><i><tt>address </tt></i><tt>[...]</tt></dt>
    <dd>This command directs the local server to listen for and
        respond to broadcast messages received on any local
        interface, and in addition enables the server to respond
        to client mode messages to the multicast group
        address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address is
        required, but The NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1
        assigned by the IANA should NOT be used, unless specific
        means are taken to limit the span of the reply and avoid
        a possibly massive implosion at the original sender.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>revoke [</tt><i><tt>logsec</tt></i><tt>]</tt> </dt>
    <dd>Specifies the interval between recomputations of the
        private value used with the autokey feature, which
        ordinarily requires an expensive public- key computation.
        The default value is 12 (65,536 s or about 18 hours). For
        poll intervals above the specified interval, a new
        private value will be recomputed for every message sent.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>autokey [</tt><i><tt>logsec</tt></i><tt>]</tt> </dt>
    <dd>Specifies the interval between regenerations of the
        session key list used with the autokey feature. Note that
        the size of the key list for each association depends on
        this interval and the current poll interval. The default
        value is 12 (4096 s or about 1.1 hours). For poll
        intervals above the specified interval, a session key
        list with a single entry will be regenerated for every
        message sent.</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><tt>enable [auth | bclient | kernel | monitor | ntp |

        stats</tt><font face="Courier New">] </font></dt>
    <dd>Provides a way to enable or disable various server
        options. Flags not mentioned are unaffected. Note that
        all of these flags can be controlled remotely using the <a

            <dd>Enables the server to synchronize with
                unconfigured peers only if the peer has been
                correctly authenticated using a trusted key and
                key identifier. The default for this flag is

            <dt><tt>kernel</tt></dt>
            <dd>Enables the precision-time kernel support for the
                <tt>ntp_adjtime()</tt> system call, if
                implemented. Ordinarily, support for this routine
                is detected automatically when the NTP daemon is
                compiled, so it is not necessary for the user to
                worry about this flag. It flag is provided
                primarily so that this support can be disabled
                during kernel development.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>monitor</tt></dt>
            <dd>Enables the monitoring facility. See the <tt>ntpdc</tt>
                program and the <tt>monlist</tt> command or
                further information. The default for this flag is
                enable.</dd>
            <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
            <dt><tt>ntp</tt></dt>
            <dd>Enables the server to adjust its local clock by
                means of NTP. If disabled, the local clock
                free-runs at its intrinsic time and frequency
                offset. This flag is useful in case the local
                clock is controlled by some other device or
                protocol and NTP is used only to provide
                synchronization to other clients. In this case,
                the local clock driver can be used to provide
                this function and also certain time variables for
                error estimates and leap-indicators. See the <a
                href="refclock.htm">Reference Clock Drivers </a>page
                for further information. The default for this
