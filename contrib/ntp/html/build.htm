<H4>Building and Installing the Distribution</H4>

As a practical matter, every computer architecture and operating system
version seems to be different than any other. The device drivers may be
different, the input/output system may bew idiosyncratic and the
libraries may have different semantics. It is not possible in a software
distribution such as this one to support every individual sysdtem with a
common set of binaries, even with the same system but different
versions. Therefore, it is necessary to configure each system
individually for each system and version, both at compile time and at
run time. In almost all cases, these procedures are completely automatic
and all the newbie user need do is type "make" and the autoconfigure
system does the rest. There are some exceptions, as noted below.

<p>The autoconfigure system inspects the hardware and software
environment and tests for the presence of system header files and the
contents of these files to determine if certain features are available.
When one or more of these features are present, the code is compiled to
use them; if not, no special code is compiled. However, even if the code
is compiled to use these features, the code does a special test at run
time to see if one or more are actually present and avoids using them if
not present. In such cases a warning message is sent to the system log,
but the daemon should still work properly.

Some programs included in this distribution use cryptographic algorithms
to verify server authenticity and credentials. As required by the
International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR), now called the Defense
Trade Regulations (DTR), certain cryptographic products and media,
including the Data Encryption Standard (DES), cannot be exported without
per-instance license. For this reason, the DES encryption routine has
been removed from the the current version, even though it is used only
to compute a message digest. Current DTR regulations allow export of the
the MD5 message digest routine, which is in fact the preferred
algorithm, and this is included in the current
version.

<P>The NTP authentication routines conform to the interface used by RSA
Laboratories in the <TT>rsaref20.zip</TT> package, which is downloadable
from <TT>ftp.rsa.com</TT> or via the web at <TT>www.rsa.com</TT>.
Outside the U.S. and Canada, the functionally identical
<TT>rsaeuro.zip</TT> package is available from J.S.A. Kapp and other
sources. The recommended way to integrate the DES routines in either
package with the NTP build procedures is to copy the <TT>desc.c</TT>
file from the <TT>./source</TT> directory in the package to the
<TT>./libntp</TT> directory in the distribution. Then copy the header
files <TT>rsaref.h</TT>, <TT>des.h</TT> and <TT>md2.h</TT> in the
<TT>./source</TT> directory to the <TT>./include</TT> directory. Do not
copy the <TT>global.h</TT> header file; the one in the distribution has
been modified. These steps must be completed before the configuration
process described below.

<H4>Building and Installing under Unix</H4>

Make sure that you have all necessary tools for building executables.
These tools include <TT>cc/gcc, make, awk, sed, tr, sh, grep, egrep</TT>
and a few others. Not all of these tools exist in the standard
distribution of modern Unix versions (compilers are likely to be an
add-on product - consider using the GNU tools and <TT>gcc</TT>
compiler in this case). For a successful build, all of these tools
should be accessible via the current path.

<H4>Configuration</H4>

Use the <TT>./configure</TT> command to perform an automatic
configuration procedure. This procedure normally includes the debugging
code, which can be useful in diagnosing problems found in initial test,
and all reference clock drivers known to work with each machine and
operating system. Unless memory space is at a premium, this is a
sensible strategy and saves lots of messy fiddling. If you need to
delete either the debugging code or one or more or all reference clock
drivers to save space, see the <A HREF="config.htm">Configuration
Options</A> page.

<P>If your site supports multiple architectures and uses NFS to share
files, you can use a single source tree to compile executables for all
architectures. While running on a target architecture machine and with
the distribution base directory active, create a subdirectory using a
command like <TT>mkdir A.`config.guess`</TT>, which will create an
architecture-specific directory with name peculiar to the architecture
and operating system. Then change to this directory and configure with
the <TT>../configure</TT> command. The remaining steps are the same
whether building in the base directory or in the subdirectory.

<H4>Compilation</H4>

Peruse the operating-system-specific information for your architecture
under <A HREF="hints.htm">Hints and Kinks</A>.

<P>Use the <TT>make</TT> command to compile all source modules,
construct the libraries and link the distribution. Expect few or no
warnings using <TT>cc</TT> and a moderate level of warnings using
<TT>gcc</TT>. Note: On some Unix platforms the use of <TT>gcc</TT> can
result in quite a few complaints about system header files and type
inconsistencies, especially about pointer variables. This is usually the
case when the system header files are not up to ANSI standards or
<TT>gcc</TT>-isms, when gcc is not installed properly, or when operating
system updates and patches are applied and gcc is not reinstalled. While
the autoconfigure process is quite thorough, the Unix programming
cultures of the various workstation makers still remain idiosyncratic.

<H4>Installation</H4>

As root, use the <TT>make install</TT> command to install the binaries
in the destination directory. You must of course have write permission
on the install destination directory. This includes the programs <TT><A
HREF="ntpd.htm">ntpd</A></TT> (the daemon), <TT><A
HREF="ntpdc.htm">ntpdc</A></TT> (an <TT>ntpd</TT>-dependent query
program), <TT><A HREF="ntpq.htm">ntpq</A></TT> (a standard query
program), <TT><A HREF="ntpdate.htm">ntpdate</A></TT> (an <TT>rdate</TT>
replacement for boot time date setting and sloppy time keeping) and
<TT><A HREF="ntptrace.htm">ntptrace</A></TT> (a utility useful to find
the primary (stratum-1) servers). In some systems, the <TT><A
HREF="tickadj.htm">tickadj</A></TT> (a utility useful to adjust kernel
variables) is installed. If the precision time kernel modifications are
present, the <TT><A HREF="ntptime.htm">ntptime</A></TT> (a utility
useful to debug kernel time functions) is installed.

<P>You are now ready to configure the daemon and start it. You will need
to create a NTP configuration file <TT>ntp.conf</TT> and possibly a
cryptographic key file <TT>ntp.keys</TT>. Directions for doing that are
in the <A HREF="notes.htm">Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up a NTP
Subnet</A>. The behavior when the daemon starts for the first time can
be counterintuitive. To reduce the level of angst, see the <a
href=quick.htm>Quick Start</a> page. A tutorial on debugging technique
is in <A HREF="debug.htm">NTP Debugging Technique</A>.

<P>If problems peculiar to the particular hardware and software
environment (e.g. operating system -specific issues) are suspected,
browse the <A HREF="hints.htm">Hints and Kinks</A> page.

<P>Bug reports of a general nature can be sent to David Mills <A
HREF="mailto: mills@udel.edu">&lt;mills@udel.edu></A>. Bug reports of a
specific nature on features implemented by the programmer corps
mentioned in the <A HREF="copyright.htm">Copyright</A> page should be
sent directly to the implementor listed in that page, with copy to
mills@udel.edu.

<P><B>Please include the version of the source distribution (e.g., ntp-
4.0.70a) in your bug report.</B>

<P><B>Please include the <B>output</B> of <TT>config.guess</TT> in your
bug report.</B>

<P><B>It will look something like: <TT>pdp11-dec-fuzzos3.4</TT></B>

<P>Additional <TT>make</TT> commands

<DL>

<DT><TT>make clean</TT></DT>

<DD>Cleans out object files, programs and temporary files.</DD>

<DT><TT>make distclean</TT></DT>

<DD>Does the work of <TT>clean</TT>, but cleans out all directories in
preparation for a new distribution release.</DD>

<DT><TT>make dist</TT></DT>

<DD>
Does the work of <TT>make distclean</TT>, but constructs compressed tar
files for distribution. You must have GNU automake to perform this
function.</DD>
