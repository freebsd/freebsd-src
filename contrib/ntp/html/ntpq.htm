<TT>pq</TT> - standard NTP query program</H3>

<HR>
<H4>
Synopsis</H4>
<TT>ntpq [-inp] [-c <I>command</I>] [<I>host</I>] [...]</TT>
<H4>
Description</H4>
<TT>ntpq</TT> is used to query NTP servers which implement the recommended
NTP mode 6 control message format about current state and to request changes
in that state. The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled
using command line arguments. Requests to read and write arbitrary variables
can be assembled, with raw and pretty-printed output options being available.
<TT>ntpq</TT> can also obtain and print a list of peers in a common format
by sending multiple queries to the server.

<P>If one or more request options is included on the command line when
<TT>ntpq</TT> is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP
servers running on each of the hosts given as command line arguments, or
on localhost by default. If no request options are given, <TT>ntpq</TT>
will attempt to read commands from the standard input and execute these
on the NTP server running on the first host given on the command line,
again defaulting to localhost when no other host is specified. <TT>ntpq</TT>
will prompt for commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

<P><TT>ntpq</TT> uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the NTP server,
and hence can be used to query any compatable server on the network which
permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this communication will
be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of network
topology. <TT>ntpq</TT> makes one attempt to retransmit requests, and will
time requests out if the remote host is not heard from within a suitable
timeout time.

<P>Command line options are described following. Specifying a command line
option other than -i or -n will cause the specified query (queries) to
be sent to the indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise, <TT>ntpq</TT>
will attempt to read interactive format commands from the standard input.
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>-c</TT></DT>

<DD>
The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified host(s).
Multiple -c options may be given.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>-i</TT></DT>

<DD>
Force <TT>ntpq</TT> to operate in interactive mode. Prompts will be written
to the standard output and commands read from the standard input.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>-n</TT></DT>

<DD>
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting
to the canonical host names.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>-p</TT></DT>

<DD>
Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of their
state. This is equivalent to the <TT>peers</TT> interactive command.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>
Internal Commands</H4>
Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to four
arguments. Only enough characters of the full keyword to uniquely identify
the command need be typed. The output of a command is normally sent to
the standard output, but optionally the output of individual commands may
be sent to a file by appending a "&lt;", followed by a file name, to the
command line. A number of interactive format commands are executed entirely
within the <TT>ntpq</TT> program itself and do not result in NTP mode 6
requests being sent to a server. These are described following.
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>? [<I>command_keyword</I>]</TT></DT>

<BR><TT>helpl [ <I>command_keyword</I> ]</TT>
<DD>
A <TT>"?"</TT> by itself will print a list of all the command keywords
known to this incarnation of <TT>ntpq</TT>. A <TT>"?"</TT> followed by
a command keyword will print funcation and usage information about the
command. This command is probably a better source of information about
<TT>ntpq</TT> than this manual page.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>addvars <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I>] [...]</TT></DT>

<BR><TT>rmvars <I>variable_name</I> [...]</TT>
<BR><TT>clearvars</TT>
<DD>
The data carried by NTP mode 6 messages consists of a list of items of
the form <TT><I>variable_name</I> = <I>value</I></TT>, where the <TT>"
= <I>value</I>"</TT> is ignored, and can be omitted, in requests to the
server to read variables. <TT>ntpq</TT> maintains an internal list in which
data to be included in control messages can be assembled, and sent using
the readlist and writelist commands described below. The addvars command
allows variables and their optional values to be added to the list. If
more than one variable is to be added, the list should be comma-separated
and not contain white space. The rmvars command can be used to remove individual
variables from the list, while the clearlist command removes all variables
from the list.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>authenticate yes | no</TT></DT>

<DD>
Normally <TT>ntpq</TT> does not authenticate requests unless they are write
requests. The command authenticate yes causes <TT>ntpq</TT> to send authentication
with all requests it makes. Authenticated requests causes some servers
to handle requests slightly differently, and can occasionally melt the
CPU in fuzzballs if you turn authentication on before doing a peer display.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>cooked</TT></DT>

<DD>
Causes output from query commands to be <TT>"cooked"</TT>. Variables which
are recognized by the server will have their values reformatted for human
consumption. Variables which <TT>ntpq</TT> thinks should have a decodeable
value but didn't are marked with a trailing <TT>"?"</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>debug more | less | off</TT></DT>

<DD>
Turns internal query program debugging on and off.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>delay <I>milliseconds</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in requests
which require authentication. This is used to enable (unreliable) server
reconfiguration over long delay network paths or between machines whose
clocks are unsynchronized. Actually the server does not now require timestamps
in authenticated requests, so this command may be obsolete.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>host <I>hostname</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Set the host to which future queries will be sent. Hostname may be either
a host name or a numeric address.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>hostnames [yes | no]</TT></DT>

<DD>
If <TT>"yes"</TT> is specified, host names are printed in information displays.
If <TT>"no"</TT> is specified, numeric addresses are printed instead. The
default is <TT>"yes"</TT>, unless modified using the command line <TT>-n</TT>
switch.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>keyid <I>keyid</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to authenticate
configuration requests. This must correspond to a key number the server
has been configured to use for this purpose.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>ntpversion 1 | 2 | 3 | 4</TT></DT>

<DD>
Sets the NTP version number which <TT>ntpq</TT> claims in packets. Defaults
to 3, Note that mode 6 control messages (and modes, for that matter) didn't
exist in NTP version 1. There appear to be no servers left which demand
version 1.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>quit</TT></DT>

<DD>
Exit <TT>ntpq</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>passwd</TT></DT>

<DD>
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be echoed)
which will be used to authenticate configuration requests. The password
must correspond to the key configured for use by the NTP server for this
purpose if such requests are to be successful.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>raw</TT></DT>

<DD>
Causes all output from query commands is printed as received from the remote
server. The only formating/intepretation done on the data is to transform
nonascii data into a printable (but barely understandable) form.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>timeout <I>millseconds</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries. The default is
about 5000 milliseconds. Note that since <TT>ntpq</TT> retries each query
once after a timeout, the total waiting time for a timeout will be twice
the timeout value set.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>
Control Message Commands</H4>
Each peer known to an NTP server has a 16 bit integer association identifier
assigned to it. NTP control messages which carry peer variables must identify
the peer the values correspond to by including its association ID. An association
ID of 0 is special, and indicates the variables are system variables, whose
names are drawn from a separate name space.

<P>Control message commands result in one or more NTP mode 6 messages being
sent to the server, and cause the data returned to be printed in some format.
Most commands currently implemented send a single message and expect a
single response. The current exceptions are the peers command, which will
send a preprogrammed series of messages to obtain the data it needs, and
the mreadlist and mreadvar commands, which will iterate over a range of
associations.
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>associations</TT></DT>

<DD>
Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer statuses
for in-spec peers of the server being queried. The list is printed in columns.
The first of these is an index numbering the associations from 1 for internal
use, the second the actual association identifier returned by the server
and the third the status word for the peer. This is followed by a number
of columns containing data decoded from the status word See the peers command
for a decode of the <TT>condition</TT> field. Note that the data returned
by the <TT>"associations"</TT> command is cached internally in <TT>ntpq</TT>.
The index is then of use when dealing with stupid servers which use association
identifiers which are hard for humans to type, in that for any subsequent
commands which require an association identifier as an argument, the form
and index may be used as an alternative.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>clockvar [<I>assocID</I>] [<I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I> [...]
] [...]</TT></DT>

<DT>
<TT>cv [<I>assocID</I>] [<I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I> [...] ]
[...]</TT></DT>

<DD>
Requests that a list of the server's clock variables be sent. Servers which
have a radio clock or other external synchronization will respond positively
to this. If the association identifier is omitted or zero the request is
for the variables of the <TT>"system clock"</TT> and will generally get
a positive response from all servers with a clock. If the server treats
clocks as pseudo-peers, and hence can possibly have more than one clock
connected at once, referencing the appropriate peer association ID will
show the variables of a particular clock. Omitting the variable list will
cause the server to return a default variable display.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>lassocations</TT></DT>

<DD>
Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer statuses
for all associations for which the server is maintaining state. This command
differs from the <TT>"associations"</TT> command only for servers which
retain state for out-of-spec client associations (i.e., fuzzballs). Such
associations are normally omitted from the display when the <TT>"associations"</TT>
command is used, but are included in the output of <TT>"lassociations"</TT>.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>lpassociations</TT></DT>

<DD>
Print data for all associations, including out-of-spec client associations,
from the internally cached list of associations. This command differs from
<TT>"passociations"</TT> only when dealing with fuzzballs.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>lpeers</TT></DT>

<DD>
Like R peers, except a summary of all associations for which the server
is maintaining state is printed. This can produce a much longer list of
peers from fuzzball servers.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>mreadlist <I>assocID</I> <I>assocID</I></TT></DT>

<BR><TT>mrl <I>assocID</I> <I>assocID</I></TT>
<DD>
Like the <TT>readlist</TT> command, except the query is done for each of
a range of (nonzero) association IDs. This range is determined from the
association list cached by the most recent <TT>associations</TT> command.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>mreadvar <I>assocID</I> <I>assocID</I> [ <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I>
[ ... ]</TT></DT>

<BR><TT>mrv <I>assocID</I> <I>assocID</I> [ <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I>
[ ... ]</TT>
<DD>
Like the <TT>readvar</TT> command, except the query is done for each of
a range of (nonzero) association IDs. This range is determined from the
association list cached by the most recent <TT>associations</TT> command.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>opeers</TT></DT>

<DD>
An old form of the <TT>peers</TT> command with the reference ID replaced
by the local interface address.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>passociations</TT></DT>

<DD>
Prints association data concerning in-spec peers from the internally cached
list of associations. This command performs identically to the <TT>"associations"</TT>
except that it displays the internally stored data rather than making a
new query.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>peers</TT></DT>

<DD>
Obtains a current list peers of the server, along with a summary of each
peer's state. Summary information includes the address of the remote peer,
the reference ID (0.0.0.0 if this is unknown), the stratum of the remote
peer, the type of the peer (local, unicast, multicast or broadcast), when
the last packet was received, the polling interval, in seconds, the reachability
register, in octal, and the current estimated delay, offset and dispersion
of the peer, all in milliseconds.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DD>
The character in the left margin indicates the fate of this peer in the
clock selection process. Folowing is a list of these characters, the pidgeon
used in the <TT>rv</TT> command, and a short explanation of the condition
revealed.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DD>
<TT>space reject</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer is discarded as unreachable, synchronized to this server (synch
loop) or outrageous synchronization distance.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falsetick</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer is discarded by the intersection algorithm as a falseticker.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excess</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer is discarded as not among the first ten peers sorted by synchronization
distance and so is probably a poor candidate for further consideration.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outlyer</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer is discarded by the clustering algorithm as an outlyer.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; candidat</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer is a survivor and a candidate for the combining algorithm.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selected</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>

&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
<TT>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.peer</TT></DD>

<TT>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pps.peer</TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>
The peer has been declared the system peer and lends its variables to the
system variables. However, the actual system synchronization is derived
from a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal, either indirectly via the PPS reference
clock driver or directly via kernel interface.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DD>
The <TT>flash</TT> variable is not defined in the NTP specification, but
is included as a valuable debugging aid. It displays the results of the
packet sanity checks defined in the NTP specification <TT>TEST1</TT> through
<TT>TEST9</TT>. The bits for each test read in increasing sequency from
the least significant bit and are defined as follows.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DD>
The following <TT>TEST1</TT> through <TT>TEST4</TT> enumerate procedure

page.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>pstatus <I>assocID</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
Sends a read status request to the server for the given association. The
names and values of the peer variables returned will be printed. Note that
the status word from the header is displayed preceding the variables, both
in hexidecimal and in pidgeon English.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>readlist [ <I>assocID</I> ]</TT></DT>

<BR><TT>rl [ <I>assocID</I> ]</TT>
<DD>
Requests that the values of the variables in the internal variable list
be returned by the server. If the association ID is omitted or is 0 the
variables are assumed to be system variables. Otherwise they are treated
as peer variables. If the internal variable list is empty a request is
sent without data, which should induce the remote server to return a default
display.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>readvar <I>assocID</I> <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I> ] [ ...
]</TT></DT>

<BR><TT>rv <I>assocID</I> [ <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I> ] [ ...
]</TT>
<DD>
Requests that the values of the specified variables be returned by the
server by sending a read variables request. If the association ID is omitted
or is given as zero the variables are system variables, otherwise they
are peer variables and the values returned will be those of the corresponding
peer. Omitting the variable list will send a request with no data which
should induce the server to return a default display.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>writevar <I>assocID</I> <I>variable_name</I> [ = <I>value</I> [ ...
]</TT></DT>

<DD>
Like the readvar request, except the specified variables are written instead
of read.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>writelist [ <I>assocID</I> ]</TT></DT>

<DD>
Like the readlist request, except the internal list variables are written
instead of read.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>
Bugs</H4>
The peers command is non-atomic and may occasionally result in spurious
error messages about invalid associations occurring and terminating the
command. The timeout time is a fixed constant, which means you wait a long
time for timeouts since it assumes sort of a worst case. The program should
improve the timeout estimate as it sends queries to a particular host,
but doesn't.&nbsp;
