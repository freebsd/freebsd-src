@code{ntpdc}
is deprecated.
Please use
@code{ntpq(1ntpqmdoc)} instead - it can do everything
@code{ntpdc}
used to do, and it does so using a much more sane interface.

@code{ntpdc}
is a utility program used to query
@code{ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)}
about its
current state and to request changes in that state.
It uses NTP mode 7 control message formats described in the source code.
The program may
be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
arguments.
Extensive state and statistics information is available
through the
@code{ntpdc}
interface.
In addition, nearly all the
configuration options which can be specified at startup using
ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
@code{ntpdc}

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
using the @code{agtexi-cmd} template and the option descriptions for the @code{ntpdc} program.
This software is released under the NTP license, <http://ntp.org/license>.

@node ntpdc usage
@subsection ntpdc help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntpdc help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntpdc.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

@node ntpdc ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex ntpdc-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv6.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.
@node ntpdc ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex ntpdc-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.
@node ntpdc command
@subsection command option (-c)
@cindex ntpdc-command

This is the ``run a command and exit'' option.
This option takes a string argument @file{cmd}.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
host(s).
@node ntpdc interactive
@subsection interactive option (-i)
@cindex ntpdc-interactive

This is the ``force ntpq to operate in interactive mode'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command, listpeers, peers, showpeers.
@end itemize

Force ntpq to operate in interactive mode.  Prompts will be written
to the standard output and commands read from the standard input.
@node ntpdc listpeers
@subsection listpeers option (-l)
@cindex ntpdc-listpeers

This is the ``print a list of the peers'' option.

@noindent

@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command.
@end itemize

Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of
their state. This is equivalent to the 'listpeers' interactive command.
@node ntpdc numeric
@subsection numeric option (-n)
@cindex ntpdc-numeric

This is the ``numeric host addresses'' option.
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names. 
@node ntpdc peers
@subsection peers option (-p)
@cindex ntpdc-peers

This is the ``print a list of the peers'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command.
@end itemize

Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state. This is equivalent to the 'peers' interactive command.
@node ntpdc showpeers
@subsection showpeers option (-s)
@cindex ntpdc-showpeers

This is the ``show a list of the peers'' option.

@noindent
This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
command.
@end itemize

Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state. This is equivalent to the 'dmpeers' interactive command.
@node ntpdc unconnected
@subsection unconnected option (-u)
@cindex ntpdc-unconnected

This is the ``use unconnected udp to communicate with ntpd (default on windows)'' option.
Open an unconnected UDP association to ntpd (the default
on Windows).


@node ntpdc config
@subsection presetting/configuring ntpdc

Any option that is not marked as @i{not presettable} may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values from environment variables named @code{NTPDC} and @code{NTPDC_<OPTION_NAME>}.  @code{<OPTION_NAME>} must be one of
the options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores.
The @code{NTPDC} variable will be tokenized and parsed like
the command line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.


@noindent
@code{libopts} will search in 2 places for configuration files:
@itemize @bullet
@item
$HOME
@item
$PWD
@end itemize
The environment variables @code{HOME}, and @code{PWD}
are expanded and replaced when @file{ntpdc} runs.
For any of these that are plain files, they are simply processed.
For any that are directories, then a file named @file{.ntprc} is searched for
within that directory and processed.

Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats.
The basic format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the
same line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon,
equal sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file.
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
@example
[NTPDC]
@end example
@noindent
or by
@example
<?program ntpdc>
@end example
@noindent
Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
@example
<option-name>
   <sub-opt>...&lt;...&gt;...</sub-opt>
</option-name>
@end example
@noindent
yielding an @code{option-name.sub-opt} string value of
@example
"...<...>..."
@end example
@code{AutoOpts} does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  @code{AutoOpts} does provide a means for searching
the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help are:

@subsubheading version (-)

Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much licensing
detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.  The licensing information may be selected with an option argument.
Only the first letter of the argument is examined:

@table @samp
@item version
Only print the version.  This is the default.
@item copyright
Name the copyright usage licensing terms.
@item verbose
Print the full copyright usage licensing terms.
@end table

@node ntpdc exit status
@subsection ntpdc exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@item 66 (EX_NOINPUT)
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
@item 70 (EX_SOFTWARE)
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
