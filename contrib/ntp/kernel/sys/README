README file for directory ./kernel/sys of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains system header files used by the clock discipline
and STREAMS modules in the .. (./kernel) directory.

If the precision-time kernel (KERNEL_PLL define) is configured, the
installation process requires the header file /usr/include/sys/timex.h
for the particular architecture to be in place. The file timex.h included
in this distribution is for Suns; the files for other systems can be
found in the kernel distributions available from the manufacturer's
representatives.
