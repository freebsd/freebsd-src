This directory contains some DCF77 related programs.
They have not yet fully been ported to architectures other than Sun with
SunOS 4.x.  So if you want to try them you are on your own - a little
porting may be necessary.

parsetest:	simple parse streams module test
		Works only under SunOS with parse Streams Module loaded
		and Meinberg-Clocks

testdcf:	simple DCF77 raw impulse test program via 50Baud RS232

dcfd:		simple DCF77 raw impulse receiver with NTP loopfilter
		mechanics for synchronisation (allows DCF77 synchronisation
		without network code in a nutshell)
