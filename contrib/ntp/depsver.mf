#
# depsver.mf	included in Makefile.am for directories with .deps
#
# When building in the same directory with sources that change over
# time, such as when tracking using bk, the .deps files can become
# stale with respect to moved, deleted, or superceded headers.  Most
# commonly, this would exhibit as make reporting a failure to make a
# header file which is no longer in the location given.  To address
# this issue, we use a deps-ver file which is updated with each change
# that breaks old .deps files.  A copy of deps-ver is made into
# $(DEPDIR) if not already present.  If $(DEPDIR)/deps-ver is present
# with different contents than deps-ver, we make clean to ensure all
# .o files built before the incompatible change are rebuilt along with
# their updated .deps files, then remove $(DEPDIR) and recreate it as
# empty stubs.
#
# It is normal when configured with --disable-dependency-tracking for
# the DEPDIR to not have been created.  For this reason, we use the
# intermediate target .deps-ver, which invokes make recursively if
# DEPDIR exists.
#
# If you modify depsver.mf, please make the changes to the master
# copy, the one in sntp is copied by the bootstrap script from it.
#
# This comment block follows rather than leads the related rules so that
# it stays with it in the generated Makefile.in and Makefile.
