NTP 4.0.99b
	originals can be found on ftp://louie.udel.edu/pub/ntp/testing

For the import of NTP the following files were removed:

	ports/*				NT files
	html/pic/*			GIF files

The stripped down version was created using FREEBSD-Xlist during extraction:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -xvzf ntp-4.0.99b.tar.gz
	mv ntp-4.0.99b ntp

Imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Virgin import of ntpd 4.0.99b' \
		src/contrib/ntp DMILLS v4_0_99b

config.h was generated by running configure and excluding almost all clock
drivers (what is included is DCF77 -- what I use -- and local clocks).

The file is then edited to edit the value of "NO_PARENB_IGNPAR" because we
need to set no parity on the serial port (needed for DCF77). All clock
drivers are then disabled (some of them are included by default by ntpd).

Note that there are two #ifdef to support both alpha and i386 from the same
sources. They'll need to be redone for each upgrade to the vendor branch to
keep config.h in sync.

Documentation in /usr/share/doc/ntp is generated from the HTML files with
lynx (without the GIF files of course).
