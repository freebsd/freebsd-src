Installing DMA:
===============

On most systems (with a development environment installed) you should be able to compile DMA with:
    make

Once it have compiled it successfully, you can install it with:
    make install sendmail-link mailq-link install-spool-dirs install-etc

Troubleshooting:
----------------
On systems that do not default to a compatible "make" version, try using "gmake" or "pmake" instead of "make". Some known examples of this:
* Solaris 9
* Solaris 10

Check that you have the following commands installed:
* cc - gcc is known to work
* lex - flex is known to work
* yacc - bison is kjnown to work
* make - BSD make and GNU make is knwon to work
* sh - Need to be POSIX compliant, dash, bash known to work
* install - GNU and BSD versions known to work
* openssl - Add the header location to C_INCLUDE_PATH if you get errors about "err.h"

If you have all of these tools installed, set the CC, YACC, INSTALL, LEX and SH variable to point to the relevant location and command.

Example:
    make CC=gcc YACC=bison LEX=/usr/bin/flex SH=/bin/bash INSTALL=/usr/bin/install
