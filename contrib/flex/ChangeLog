	* NEWS: version 2.6.4 * NEWS: Record release date.

2017-05-06  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* .prev-version: note previous version

2017-05-06  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: doc: update NEWS for upcoming release

2017-05-04  viktor.shepel <shepelvictor@bigmir.net>

	* doc/flex.texi: doc: Correct typo in C code sample in manual

2017-05-04  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: scanner: Mention %# comments are removed when
	building skel.c

2017-05-02  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Honor user definitions of yy_* macros The user may have defined the yy_* macros themselves.  In that case,
	don't clobber them.

2017-05-02  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl, src/main.c: Don't leak macro definitions into header
	files This allowed unnamespaced definitions to leak into header files,
	breaking client code.  Fixes #142

2017-05-03  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/scan.l: scanner: Check for 0 bracecount when EOL ends quoted
	literal.  This can happen in the case of // comments (which Flex doesn't
	handle specially).

2017-05-03  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/scan.l: scanner: when bracelevel is negative, treat as zero.  This really should never happen, but this at least fixes the
	breakage on Verilator.

2017-04-02  Jeff Smith <whydoubt@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/tableopts.am, tests/tableopts.sh: test:
	enable more silent building of tests.  When running 'make V=0 check', some compile and link steps are made
	less verbose and some are not.  This cleans up most steps that are
	not.  These have no effect if V=0 is not specified.

2017-05-03  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/misc.c, src/mkskel.sh: build: Delete comments
	from skeleton file.  Since the comments in flex.skl are, by hypothesis, not needed in
	skel.c, we remove them. THis reduces the size of the resulting
	executable somewhat.

2017-05-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am: build: do not generate
	lib/Makefile.in.  Files in lib/ are picked up and built using makefile directives in
	src/Makefile.am. Remove the need to generate lib/Makefile.in and the
	stub lib/Makefile.am.

2017-05-02  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: gettext: revert listing generated .c files

2017-04-10  Jeff Smith <whydoubt@gmail.com>

	* src/filter.c: FLEX_EXIT() is the preferred way to exit flex

2017-04-11  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/misc.c: Fix myesc() 'sptr' conditionals * Don't call isascii() here. It's deprecated in POSIX and not needed   for myesc's case.  * The check of the character class and range here should match
	  what's defined as {ESCSEQ} in scan.l, so for [[:xdigit:]] we use
	  isxdigit(); for [0-7] we check '0' <= c <= '7' (not isdigit(c)
	  because isdigit is locale-dependant in standard's sense) * Add missing length limit for "\x<hex>" (<hex> is at most 2 digits)

2017-04-11  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c: Obsolete htoui() and otoui(); use
	strtoul().  No sense to keep these two function when libc's strtoul() can do the
	same job, but better.

2017-04-12  Todd C. Miller <Todd.Miller@courtesan.com>

	* src/flex.skl: scanner: update yy_buf_size after yyrealloc()

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* configure.ac: build: use lowest versions for gettext, automake.

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* po/Makevars, po/Rules-getpo, po/update_linguas.sh: gettext: more
	recent makevars; new script to update po files.  Previously, "make dist" and similar commands would cause the po
	files to be updated, which is incorrect. The more recent version now
	used should not do this.  Replaced Rules-getpo by extra script to manually update and rebuild
	all po files.

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* po/POTFILES.in: gettext: list generated files instead of flex,
	bison sources in POTFILES.in.  Listing the flex and bison sources -- as the gettext manual suggests
	-- causes warnings. Listing the generated C files for the lexer and
	parser removes the warnings. Since both files contain line
	directives, any translator who needs to refer back to those files
	should be able to find the context in which strings are needed.

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* autogen.sh: build: only touch ChangeLog if it does not exist

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: build: list earliest useable
	versions for automake

2017-05-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@web.de>

	* autogen.sh: build: check for how to call libtoolize.  Previously, we would call libtoolize and if that failed, we would
	call glibtoolize since some platforms have the libtoolize program
	under that name.  Instead, we check to see if the environment variable LIBTOOLIZE is
	set and use that if so. Otherwise, we try to find a program
	"libtoolize" on the path and failing that glibtoolize. We alert the
	user if no suitable program can be found.

2017-01-06  Alastair Hughes <hobbitalastair@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, m4/ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4, src/Makefile.am: build:
	support cross compiling.  Check for cross compiling. If cross compiling, build stage1flex
	using a custom link command.  We also override LDADD since that adds
	the replacement implementations that are cross compiled, and instead
	always use the replacement library implementations.  We don't use BUILD_OBJEXT and BUILD_EXEEXT since it seems that
	automake does not support these.  Fixes #78.

2017-02-17  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, src/flexdef.h: build: Include <strings.h>; add
	strcasecmp() check to configure.  strings.h (not string.h) is the standard-defined include header for
	strcasecmp(). Include <strings.h> for portability (even though glibc
	exposes strcasecmp() declaration also in <string.h> by default).

2017-02-17  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, src/flexdef.h: build: Let configure error if missing
	required functions, headers..  `configure` will now error if a required header or function is not
	found on the system.  Also add comments on optional functions checks.  Add sys/stats.h and sys/wait.h to list of required headers in
	configure.  This fixes issue #180.

2017-02-12  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/dfa.c, src/flexdef.h: scanner: compute powers of two faster.  Replace the naive "for" loop in determining power of two with a
	clever bitwise solution. This code is around the Internet already
	and is in Public Domain.

2017-02-07  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, tests/Makefile.am, tests/pthread.l: test: skip
	pthread test when needed files missing.  "Unlisting" the pthread test when libpthread is not available is
	never a good idea. Should let it compile into a stub program that
	returns the "skip" status.  configure.ac and tests/Makefile.am are edited so that pthread test
	can be built anyway, but only works (not as the stub) when both
	pthread.h and libpthread are detected on the system.  Also fix a small typo in tests/pthread.l comments.

2017-02-16  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: mv scan.c when building dist.  Revert change to copy scan.c when building the distribution archive.
	Move it instead. This satisfies automake's notions of what should be
	clean and ensures that the distribution archive contains a
	just-built copy of scan.c.  Fixes #186

2017-02-06  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: don't assume distdir/scan.c is writeable

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: Add dist-hook to force remake scan.c.  This will ensure the flex scanner included in release tarball being
	generated by exactly the flex version to be released.  Here's one catch after this change: You may not run "make dist" or
	"make distdir" if you configure the flex source to be
	cross-compiled.

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: respect '--localedir' from configure.  Makefile shouldn't overwrite the 'localedir' variable, because
	that's what '--localedir' option in 'configure' is for.

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: Remove "-I$(top_srcdir)/intl" from
	CPPFLAGS.  Revert commit e02c3d27eeb6b53ec82532ab080c23ce26813fd4 ("include the intl/ subdirectory when searching for include files") Flex doesn't come with libintl source code, so inclusion of
	$(top_srcdir)/intl subdirectory during compiling is unnecessary.  This flag seems to be left after "remove intl from dist" (commit
	8f45da06adbd7dbcdfdbdd5c20ff4c47fc504f35) without someone cleaning
	this up.  Users who need to build with gettext functionality from libintl
	would use the '--with-libintl-prefix' configure option.

2017-02-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/regex.c: scanner: fix regcomp's error reporting, double
	malloc.  Fix unneeded double malloc - let regerror(). Write its message after
	our "regcomp for (regex) failed: " string.  Also, errbuf cannot be free()'d because of flexfatal containing a
	longjmp.

2017-01-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/no_bison_stub.c: test: Skip bison tests
	if bison is not available

2017-01-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: build: remove repeated bison detection from
	configure.  AC_PROG_YACC already detects the bison program. We can just use it,
	and make notice if [ $YACC != 'bison -y' ] Remove unused AC_SUBST([BISON], ...).  Add AM_CONDITIONAL([HAVE_BISON], ...) so that we can skip bison
	tests in testsuite when bison is absent.  We don't make any attempt to detect other yacc implementations since
	flex is developed with bison. While it would be possible, the need
	isn't there right now. It would be possible to add a --with-parser
	option that defaulted to bison if such a need cropped up.

2017-01-01  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: fix Makefile parse.h dependency clauses.  The current clauses stating "main.c: parse.h" and "yylex.c: parse.h"
	do not work as expected. Make did not try to build parse.h upon
	building flex-main.o as it would think main.c exist already and
	ignore the clause. Fix this by explicitly stating that the .o files
	depend on parse.h instead.  This dependency bug only happens if user builds flex from a
	checked-out repository.

2017-01-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: test: Remake *_scanner.c if *_scanner.h is
	missing.  If a ${foo}_scanner.c exists but the respective ${foo}_scanner.h is
	missing, then 'make' can halt. Fix this by deleting the
	${foo}_scanner.c file and then remake it. This rule is the same as
	the automake-generated rule for .c files that require LEX or YACC
	(except automake will use ylwrap).

2016-12-31  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: test: remove BUILT_SOURCES; add missing
	dependencies.  Without BUILT_SOURCES in Makefile, no test sources in tests/ will be
	built when using the default "make all" target. This is desireable
	for people who are just building flex but who do not want to run,
	and therefore, build any part of the test suite.  Also fix missing sources dependencies:     bison_nr_scanner.$(OBJEXT): bison_nr_parser.h     bison_yylloc_scanner.$(OBJEXT): bison_yylloc_parser.h     bison_yylval_scanner.$(OBJEXT): bison_yylval_parser.h

2017-01-19  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, lib/reallocarray.c, src/flexint.h, src/misc.c: 
	build: detect overflow for [re]allocate_array.  Use reallocarray() when we have it (i.e. in OpenBSD system). When we
	don't, use equivalent overflow detection for our allocate_array and
	reallocate_array functions.  Remove lib/reallocarray.c from our LIBOBJS as we no longer need it.  Provide a fallback SIZE_MAX macro definition in flexint.h (not
	preprocessor friendly, but enough for our reallocate_array use
	case).

2017-01-23  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: doc: v2.6.4

2017-01-23  Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: more BSD make and vpath build fixes.  BSD make doesn't like $< with more than one source specified.
	Additionally, make sure to specify srcdir when referring to source
	files since vpath builds depend on this.

2017-01-22  Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: Fix skel.c generation with BSD make

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Add more defines in the non-reentrant part.  Fix the reentrant part; don't "#define yyfoo yyfoo" because it
	breaks code that does #ifndef yywrap ..

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/flexdef.h: scanner: Add yyparse prototype

2017-01-22  Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>

	* src/flex.skl: scanner: move comment for consistency

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/misc.c: scanner: Use array instead of pointer

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/main.c: scanner: manage path to m4 better.  Avoid alloca() for SSP; it is better anyway; since we don't need to
	strdup the path.

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/gen.c: scanner: Avoid creating unused label

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/buf.c: Cast argument to avoid arithmetic on void *.

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/scan.l: scanner: Use strncpy

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/main.c: scanner: Use prefix when defining yywrap to avoid
	redefinition.  Fixes regression introduced in v2.6.3.

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c: scanner: Include stdarg.h for va_list

2017-01-22  Christos Zoulas <christos@zoulas.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/main.c, src/parse.y: scanner: Rename warn to
	lwarn.  This avoids a naming conflict in NetBSD's  libc.

2017-01-01  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/README: test: document automake convention for skipped exit
	status.

2017-01-03  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: test: let testwrapper scripts be run by
	${SHELL}.  This allows user to use a different shell if /bin/sh has problems.
	The use of $SHELL (variable) to run scripts is already an Automake
	convention. All shell scripts in build-aux are run by $SHELL.

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/options.cn, tests/tableopts.sh,
	tests/testwrapper-direct.sh, tests/testwrapper.sh: test: Remove test
	scripts bashisms.  They now all work under a POSIX compliant sh. Specifically, 'dash'
	can now be used for running "make check" tests.  Note that none of these scripts has ever been using a pipe, so `set
	-o pipefail` is unnecessary and removed.

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* tests/testwrapper.sh: test: exit on '-1' test non-zero status.  If a '-1' test program returns a non-zero status, don't go further
	and compare it's (numeric) output values. This allows a '-1' test to
	indicate a "skip" status or an otherwise error. (Currently no such
	'-1' test would skip like this, though.) Shell syntax note: `set -e` will not exit with the syntax like this
	`test $(false) = $(false);`. The exit statuses of `false` in the
	example will be ignored instead. But putting the output in a
	variable, such as `VAR=$(false)`, DOES exit.

2017-01-02  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: build: Fix 'make indent' target This 'make indent' target has not been working since the directories
	reorganization in flex 2.6.0. Now make it work again.  Note that the current indent profile breaks many styles of existing
	code. The indent target should not be used until the .indent.pro
	options are reviewed for desireability.

2017-01-01  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: build: Simplify indent program detection

2017-01-12  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/filter.c: filter: Don't emit #line if %option noline set One place emitting a #line directive to the generated header was
	missed in commit 647a92b9f4 when resolving #55. Fix it to respect
	gen_line_dirs as well.

2017-01-12  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	po/vi.po, po/zh_CN.po, po/zh_TW.po: translation: refresh po files
	from translation project

2017-01-10  Harald van Dijk <harald@gigawatt.nl>

	* src/flex.skl: c++: Fix yyrestart(NULL) SEGV.  Binding a reference to a dereferenced null pointer is invalid and
	compilers optimise away the &file == 0 check. We need a real stream.  yyin is available already, and yyrestart(NULL) is only supported
	when yyin will not be used, so there is no harm in just passing in
	that.  Since we now always have a valid stream, we can skip the null
	check too.  Fixes #98.

2017-01-09  luistung <dongliang1986@gmail.com>

	* src/scan.l: scanner: join symbol list.  Removed a newline that caused a problem building the scanner in some
	circumstances. Specifically: 'bad character' error  when executing /bin/sh ../build-aux/ylwrap scan.l lex.yy.c scan.c -- flex

2017-01-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: scanner: remove void cast before fprintf

2016-12-30  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: doc: update NEWS for 2.6.3 release

2016-11-26  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: build: New configure option
	'--disable-bootstrap'.  If configure is run with '--disable-bootstrap', then stage1flex
	won't be built and stage1scan.c will be generated by sed'ing scan.c.  This option is intended to workaround bootstrap bugs rather than to
	fix the bootstrapping issues which are proving subtler and harder to
	fix than anyone would like.

2016-11-26  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: build: "make clean" deletes stage1scan.c,
	stage1flex

2016-11-26  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: build: allow building libfl even
	with --disable-libfl.  For various reasons, we may wish to build libfl explicitly even when
	configure has been run with the --disable-libfl option. This is
	possible, now, via 'make -C src libfl.la'.

2016-12-19  Alexis La Goutte <alexis.lagoutte@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: scanner: remove trailing whitespace in skeleton

2016-12-01  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/buf.c, src/main.c, src/parse.y: scanner: Disallow, overquote
	'[' and ']' in prefix

2016-12-29  Samuel Thibault <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	* src/main.c: scanner: allocate correct buffer size for m4 path.  Flex did not check the length of the m4 path which could lead to a
	buffer overflow in some cases. Additionally, not all platforms
	believe in PATH_MAX, so stop relying on it.  Fixes #138

2016-11-24  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: doc: note no more libcompat in NEWS

2016-11-24  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: build: warn about cross compiling with *alloc

2016-11-19  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/lib.c, src/Makefile.am: build:
	Link $(LIBOBJS) from src/ dir, remove libcompat.la.  The libcompat.la library was small and less friendly to
	bootstrapping and cross compilation. Now, we will simply link
	individual object files as needed, which is simpler.

2016-11-16  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

2016-10-31  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: build: Add --disable-libfl

2016-11-09  Demi Obenour <demiobenour@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl, tests/array_r.l: fix backwards incompatible changes
	in 2.6.2.  This patch addscompatibility `#defines` for all macros affected by
	`%prefix`.  Fixes #113.

2016-11-08  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/scan.l, tests/Makefile.am, tests/quote_in_comment.l,
	tests/quote_in_comment.txt: Fixes a major bug in Flex's own lexing
	of literals.  My changes caused Flex to mishandle string and character literals in

2016-11-06  Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac: build: fix false negatives for help2man and texi2dvi HELP2MAN and TEXI2DVI (or the corresponding ac_prog variables) will
	never be zero length as they fall back to the missing script; check
	for the fall back and warn on that instead of always warning.

2016-10-28  Explorer09 <explorer09@gmail.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am: doc: Don't delete flex.1 during "make distclean".  flex.1 is pre-generated in release tarball. If we delete it, the

	help2man unnecessarily.

2016-10-27  Alastair Hughes <hobbitalastair@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, doc/Makefile.am: Only regenerate the man page when required.  Make the flex binary an order-only prerequisite, and add back the
	prerequisites from before 7cfb440. This prevents rebuilding the man
	page whenever the flex binary is rebuilt, which causes problems if
	help2man is not installed and will never work when cross compiling.  Fixes #108.

2016-10-26  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, src/Makefile.am: build: no longer build PIC version of
	libfl.  The PIC version of libfl was not being built correctly. From the
	lack of bug reports around this problem, we conclude that the PIC
	version of libfl is not used and so we drop it from the build build
	targets for flex.

	tests/include_by_push.direct.l: Improved M4 quotation This fixes M4 quotation of certain strings beginning with `yy` (in
	section 3 of the input file only) and character literals.  The new
	quotation method is also less brittle and faster.  Tests that relied on the old behavior were fixed.  Also, `yyconst` is no longer defined; use `const` (which it
	unconditionally was defined to) instead.

	escape sequences and character constants.  Tests were added to verify the behavior in section 3 with respect to
	quoting. Both escaping of quotes and quoting of potential
	macro-start characters are tested. Existing tests were also fixed to
	account for the new -- and now correct -- behavior. Many tests
	relied on the old behavior of expanding M4 macros in section 3.
	They needed to be updated for the new behavior.

	* src/scanflags.c: Avoid realloc on every call of sf_push() Currently, every call to sf_push() realloc()'s _sf_stack, even if
	the maximum size _sf_max wasn't changed. As the indentation beneath
	the "if" clause already indicates, the realloc() should only be
	executed if _sf_max was increased.  Found by compiling flex with the -Wmisleading-indentation flags of
	gcc, which leads to the following warning: scanflags.c: In function â€˜sf_pushâ€™: scanflags.c:42:5: warning:
	     this â€˜ifâ€™ clause does not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation] if

2016-02-26  Robert Larice <Robert.Larice@t-online.de>

	* src/flex.skl, src/gen.c: Removed some type conversion warnings

2016-02-26  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Changed another buffer size to int; resolves gh#61

2016-02-24  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Changed type of yy_n_chars to int; gh#53, sf#160.  The variable yy_n_chars had been of type yy_size_t which is
	incorrect given its use in read(). While it might be adviseable to
	look at defining a yy_ssize_t, there might be some issues doing this
	and so, for now, at least, we'll punt back to int.

2016-02-24  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/buf.c: Fixed size of bufferallocation, resolved gh#54.  The value of n_alloc was a count, not a size. Multiplying the value
	by the element size was incorrect. That multiplication was already
	being done and having it done twice was incorrect.

2016-02-23  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/scan.l: Allow '%option noline' in flex input file, resolves
	gh#56.  Allow specifying '%option noline' in the input file, leading to the
	same effect as calling flex with the command line option --noline.  Signed-off-by: Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

2016-02-23  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/buf.c, src/main.c: Emit no #line directives if gen_line_dirs
	is false, resolves igh#55.  There are two instances in the code which will print a #line
	directive to the resulting lexer, regardless of the value of
	gen_line_dirs. Fix them, so they also respect gen_line_dirs.  Signed-off-by: Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

2016-02-16  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* lib/lib.c, src/gen.c, src/misc.c, src/scan.l: Converted K&R style
	function definitions to ANSI C style Consistently make use of the ANSI C function definition style
	instead of the K&R style.

2016-01-29  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/flex.skl: Used NULL constant instead of plain integer for NULL
	pointer.  The sparse static checker warns about using plain integer 0 as NULL
	pointers in the generated lexer code. Fix this by using NULL
	consistently for pointers.

2016-01-29  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/flex.skl: Marked declaration and definition of yy_fatal_error
	as noreturn.  Only the declaration of yy_fatal_error is marked with
	__attribute__((__noreturn__)) in case GCC >= 3 is used, but not the
	definition. This leads to the sparse static checker to complain
	about function declaration mismatch.  Fix it by defining a macro yynoreturn and using it for both the
	declaration and the definition of yy_fatal_error.

2016-01-27  Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>

	* src/flex.skl: Fixed declaration mismatch in yy_fatal_error.  The prototype declares yy_fatal_error parameter as "const char
	msg[]" while the definition uses "const char* msg" (introduced by
	commit e9d5fc713f61b) which causes the sparse static checkers to
	produce an error.  Fix this by adjusting the definition to use "const char* msg" as
	well.  Also change the C++ version accordingly so it matches the
	declaration in FlexLexer.hpp.

	* configure.ac, src/flexdef.h: Removed no longer needed header
	checks

2015-12-27  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Checked for reallocarray() with AC_REPLACE_FUNCS

2015-12-27  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/main.c: include libgen.h from flexdef.h, not
	main.c

2015-12-25  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/main.c: Replace basename2() with basename(3).  Given the following program: 	\#include <libgen.h> 	\#include <stdio.h> 	/* extracts basename from path, optionally stripping the extension
		 "\.*" * (same concept as /bin/sh `basename`, but different handling
		of extension). */ static char *basename2 (char *path) 	{ 		char   *b; 		for (b = path; *path; path++) 			if (*path == '/') 				b = path + 1; 		return b; 	} 	static void basename_compare(char *path) 	{ 		printf("basename: %s\n", basename(path)); 		printf("basename2: %s\n\n", basename2(path)); 	} 	int main (int argc, char *argv[]) 	{ 		// From http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ 		// ``Sample Input and Output Strings'' 		basename_compare("/usr/lib"); 		basename_compare("/usr/"); 		basename_compare("/"); 		basename_compare("///"); 		basename_compare("//usr//lib//"); 		return 0; 	} ... and the program's output: 	basename: lib 	basename2: lib 	basename: usr 	basename2: 	basename: / 	basename2: 	basename: / 	basename2: 	basename: lib 	basename2: ... we can see that basename2() behaves the same as basename(3) in
	the average use case, but messes up pretty severely in others.
	Besides that, basename(3) is mandated by POSIX so should be present
	on modern Unix-like systems, so we shouldn't define it ourselves.  Some notes: - it doesn't appear to be mentioned in POSIX, but OpenBSD's
	  basename(3) returns NULL if the returned path componenet is >
	  PATH_MAX, so add a check for that - basename(3) shouldn't return an empty string, so remove the   program_name[0] != '\0' check

2015-12-25  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/main.c: Simplify basename2().  It's only call site does not activate the `strip_ext` code path, so
	the function can be simplified a lot.  While here, remove a double
	assignment.

2015-12-25  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/flex.skl, src/misc.c: Cleaned up __STDC__ #ifdefs.  Assuming a compiler conforming to the ISO C standard is used, i.e.,
	__STDC__ is defined to 1, YY_USE_CONST is always defined and can be
	eliminated.

2015-12-25  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/main.c, src/scanopt.c, src/scanopt.h,
	src/sym.c: Remove remaining use of PROTO

2015-12-15  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/main.c, src/scanopt.c, src/sym.c, src/tblcmp.c: Remove more
	instances of PROTO

2015-12-15  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* src/main.c: Removed prototype for main().  It's not called anywhere else so the prototype is not needed.  See
	the C99 standard [1], section 5.1.2.2.1 for more info.  [1]: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf

	* src/dfa.c, src/gen.c, src/nfa.c, to.do/unicode/main.c,
	to.do/unicode/tblcmp.c: Removed more instances of PROTO, ansifying.

	* README: Noted github for issue tracking and pull requests

2015-12-13  Michael McConville <mmcco@mykolab.com>

	* README: Reformatted README; removed sf bug tracking link.

2015-12-13  Michael McConville <mmcco@mykolab.com>

	* src/gen.c, to.do/unicode/gen.c: Removed macros for indentation
	level.  Just increment or decrement the indentation counter. That's less to
	remember and makes the code more readable.  w# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting

2015-12-12  Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/testwrapper.sh: tests: fixed paths to
	input files.  The current test wrapper works only when the inputs are specified
	using relative paths.  If they're specified with absolute paths, the
	driver fails to detect the inputs because it always prepends the
	input dir name which itself is a relative path: $ cd tests $
	./testwrapper.sh -d . -i $PWD/reject.txt -t ./reject_ver.table
	<fails to open inputs> This normally doesn't show up because people run `./configure` or,
	for out of tree builds, `../configure`.  But if you happen to run
	configure with an absolute path, then automake tends to generate
	absolute paths as well leading to test failures.  Fix all of this by dropping the implicit input directory prepending.  - INPUT_NAME is often a list of files, not just a single one - the input directory is used to find the testname tables which are   usually generated, so it's impossible to use files from both
	  source and build directories - most of the time, the full/correct path is already specified

2015-12-12  Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: configure: fixed realloc test.  The [] characters are used for quoting in m4, so the attempt to use
	them in place of `test` fails yielding the warning at build time: .../flex/configure: line 20222: no: command not found

2015-12-12  Michael McConville <mmcco@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h: Started removal of PROTO macro.  The PROTO macro is no longer needed. Additionally, its usage is
	inconsistent, so we began removing it.

2015-12-12  Michael Reed <m.reed@mykolab.com>

	* Makefile.am, src/main.c: Removed SHORT_FILE_NAMES preprocessor
	symbol.  As a relic of MS-DOS, we don't need this.  It's never defined; see 13b5b214f53d1c3354a7ab910bd160c126df1331.  Removed additional MSDOS ifdef.

2015-12-11  Michael McConville <mmcco@mykolab.com>

	* configure.ac, lib/reallocarray.c, src/flexdef.h: Added new
	function reallocarray.  This is taken from OpenSSH Portable, which in turn takes it from
	OpenBSD.  reallocarray wraps the stdlib's realloc function. It takes two size
	arguments and checks for overflow, like calloc, but doesn't zero the
	memory. Therefore, it allows us to do overflow-safe array
	reallocations and overflow-safe unzeroed array allocations, which
	the stdlib allocation functions don't.  We have a bunch of specific array allocation macros, none of which
	check for overflow. reallocarray should be able to replace them.

2015-12-11  Michael McConville <mmcco@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h: Removed MS-DOS, VMS macros.  Given the age of the MS-DOS and VMS platforms, it's likely that no
	one is building flex on them any more. Additionally, the preferred
	approach is to test for particular platform features rather than to
	test for particular platforms.

2015-12-12  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/main.c: Made search for m4 more explicit.

2015-12-12  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Returned 0 from yywrap() instead of EOF

2015-12-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/libmain.c: Changed end of main() in libmain to exit(0)

2015-12-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Mentioned v2.6.1; documented some changes
	since v2.6.0

2015-12-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* README: Updated build documentation; finished sf#155.  Removed version numbers for build tools. Noted that version
	requirements for build tools will be noted in configure.ac. Expanded
	documentation of building texinfo based docs.

2015-12-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am: Removed flex.pdf from distribution; partially
	fixed sf#155

2015-12-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Commented in C style in skeleton; fixed sf#195

2015-12-10  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* .gitignore: Ignored autoscan files

2015-12-09  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Checked for ranlib and strdup() at configure time

2015-12-09  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c, src/tblcmp.c, to.do/unicode/flexdef.h,
	to.do/unicode/misc.c, to.do/unicode/tblcmp.c: Replace zero_out()
	with stdlib's memset.

2015-12-09  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flex.skl: Removed memory allocation casts.

2015-12-09  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h: Removed alloca() configuration.  Since alloca() is dangerous, depricated, we remove it.

2015-12-09  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h: Removed implementation of isascii().  POSIX defines isascii(), so it's likely present on anything
	weactually build flex on these days.

2015-12-09  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/main.c, src/scanopt.c, src/tables.c: Removed NULL-checks
	before free()

2015-12-08  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/buf.c, src/dfa.c, src/flexdef.h, src/gen.c, src/scan.l,
	to.do/unicode/flexdef.h, to.do/unicode/scan.l: Removed flex_free()i,
	corrected buf_destroy logic.  As with flex_alloc(), replace with direct calls to free().  The function buf_destroy is now null safe and the logic was
	corrected to free() correctly.

2015-12-08  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/filter.c, src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c, src/scan.l,
	src/scanflags.c, to.do/unicode/flexdef.h, to.do/unicode/misc.c,
	to.do/unicode/scan.l: Removed flex_realloc().  As with flex_alloc(), replace calls to flex_realloc(), which was
	just a wrapper around realloc().

2015-12-08  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/buf.c, src/filter.c, src/flexdef.h, src/main.c, src/misc.c,
	src/regex.c, src/scan.l, src/scanflags.c, src/sym.c,
	to.do/unicode/flexdef.h, to.do/unicode/misc.c, to.do/unicode/scan.l: 
	Removed flex_alloc; cleaned up style.  The function flex_alloc() was just a wrapper around malloc(). Since
	this only added unclarity, and the flex_alloc() function is likely a
	legacy of olden times, remove it in favor of calls to malloc()
	directly.  Style elements cleaned up:  * superfluous spacing around parentheses  * non-constant initialization in variable declarations  * needless casts  * almost all uses of assignments as subexpressions

2015-12-07  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/dfa.c, src/flexdef.h, src/gen.c, src/main.c, src/scan.l,
	src/scanopt.c, tests/bison_nr_scanner.l,
	tests/bison_yylloc_scanner.l, tests/bison_yylval_scanner.l,
	tests/mem_nr.l, tests/mem_r.l, tests/pthread.l, tests/string_nr.l,
	tests/string_r.l, tests/yyextra.l, to.do/unicode/scan.l: Remove
	allocation casts

2015-12-07  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/.gitignore, src/Makefile.am: Built flex with itself.  Changes in scan.l need to be built into flex with the same version
	of flex in some cases. Since this build requirement is minimal, we
	simply bootstrap flex unconditionally.  We intentionally exclude from version control the bootstrap
	artifacts as the extra copy of the lexer, the intermediate scanner
	and the bootstrap executable are not of interest.

2015-12-05  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/buf.c, src/dfa.c, src/main.c, src/nfa.c, src/parse.y,
	src/scan.l, src/scanopt.c, src/sym.c, to.do/unicode/main.c,
	to.do/unicode/scan.l: Use NULL rather than (type *) 0.

2015-12-05  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c, src/sym.c, to.do/unicode/flexdef.h,
	to.do/unicode/misc.c: Replace copy_unsigned_string() with xstrdup().  Like copy_string(), copy_unsigned_string() is just a clone of the
	stlib's strdup(). We only use it twice. I'm pretty confident that
	char signedness is irrelevant in this case.

2015-12-04  Akim Demaille <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* src/FlexLexer.h: Cleaned up white space.

2015-12-04  Akim Demaille <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* src/FlexLexer.h: Removed struct keyword before yy_buffer_state

2015-12-04  Akim Demaille <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* examples/testxxLexer.l, src/FlexLexer.h, src/flex.skl, src/main.c: 
	Replaced FLEX_STD macro with std::.  The std:: construct exists as of C++98, so we can simply assume it
	is supported.

2015-12-04  Akim Demaille <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* src/Makefile.am: Generated skel.c explicitly in srcdir.  Rewrote the target for skel.c to explicitly mention the srcdir. This
	should help when building flex from a directory outside the flex
	tree. Spread the rule out over several lines to enhance readability.

2015-12-04  Akim Demaille <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	* autogen.sh: Called glibtoolize if libtoolize run fails.  On Mac OS X, libtoolize is known as glibtoolize. In cases where
	libtoolize is not present, then calling glibtoolize when
	bootstrapping the build system gives more folks a shot at getting
	flex built from the ground up.

2015-12-02  Mightyjo <mightyjo@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Checked for (g)texi2dvi. Better bison, help2man
	checks.  Added test for presence of (g)texi2dvi program. Gave notice if
	texi2dvi is unavailable and set TEXI2DVI=: to avoid giving users
	headaches.  Enhanced tests for bison and help2man with notices when the programs
	aren't found.  Set their program variables to use the missing script
	in build-aux since it's compatible with them.

2015-12-02  Michael McConville <mmcconville@mykolab.com>

	* src/flexdef.h, src/misc.c, src/parse.y, src/scan.l, src/sym.c,
	src/tables.c, to.do/unicode/flexdef.h, to.do/unicode/misc.c,
	to.do/unicode/scan.l: Made string copying more standard.  copy_string() was a clone of the stdlib's strdup(). For safety,
	simplicity, and speed, we should use that instead. We introduce
	xstrdup() which wraps strdup() in a failure upon memory allocation
	errors.

2015-11-30  Serguey Parkhomovsky <sergueyparkhomovsky@gmail.com>

	* src/scan.l: Error on unbalanced parentheses in rules section.

2015-11-29  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Cleaned up BUILT_SOURCES list.  Removed reference to skel.c as a built source since other make rules
	cover this case.

2015-11-29  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Sorted file names in flex_SOURCES

2015-11-27  Mightyjo <mightyjo@gmail.com>

	* src/ecs.c, src/flexdef.h, src/main.c, src/misc.c, src/scan.l,
	src/scanopt.c, src/sym.c, src/tblcmp.c: Replaced CHAR macro with
	unsigned char type.  Thanks to Michael McConville for pointing out that the old Char
	macro causes problems with static analysis.  The macro has been
	removed and replaced with 'unsigned char' throughout the flex
	sources. The macro is not needed at best and was confusing at worst.
	It was not used in any of the example files nor was it mentioned in
	the manual at all.

2015-11-21  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: updated syntax of AC_INIT call as per autoupdate

2015-11-21  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	src/main.c, src/misc.c, src/nfa.c, src/parse.y, src/scan.l,
	src/scanopt.c, src/sym.c, src/tblcmp.c: Switch function definitions
	from mixed K&R to consistent ANSI C.  flex was using K&R function definitions for some functions and ANSI
	C style in others, sometimes even in the same file. Change the code
	to consistently use ANSI C.  Signed-off-by: Stefan Reinauer <stefan.reinauer@coreboot.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Used in-tree header file for c++ tests.

2015-11-17  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Declared version 2.6.0

2015-11-17  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS: Dated, described flex release 2.6.0

2015-11-13  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Declared version 2.6.0rc1

2015-11-13  lukeallardyce <lukeallardyce@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: Supplied versioning information in flex
	libraries.  Resolves sourceforge bug #182. On OSX, and possibly other platforms,
	building the libfl libraries without versioning information caused a
	build failures.

2015-11-12  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Cleaned up more precisely after make check.  BUILT_SOURCES is now just the list of headers built as per the
	automake manual. We provide the list of files to clean to make
	rebuilding the test suite programs easier. We then use the
	CLEANFILES list in a dist-hook to clean up the distribution that
	automake gathers since not distributing flex generated files is
	foreign to automake's mindset, but we need exactly that.  Additionally, we locate inputs to the tables-related tests more
	precisely. Some files are in srcdir and some are in builddir, which
	the arguments to the log compiler are now made aware of.

2015-11-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Pulled out scripts in tests/Makefile.am

	* tests/Makefile.am: Added srcdir to tableopts.am include

2015-11-11  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* doc/Makefile.am: Changed man page dependencies.  The man page is just the --help output as reformatted by help2man.
	The --help option is most likely to change when the flex skeleton
	changes or one of the option parsing files changes or the
	configure.ac script itself changes. The dependencies reflect this
	now.  It is still necessary, under some circumstances, to rebuild flex
	explicitly before building the man page. In theory, it's possible to
	have automake arrange to do this all the time, but doing so works
	out to be fragile, given the rest of the build system.

	* autogen.sh: Called libtoolize directly because autoreconf fails to
	pick up LT_INIT properly

2015-11-10  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Added tableopts.sh to EXTRA_DIST

2015-11-08  Mightyjo <mightyjo@gmail.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Made tests depend on the built flex binary.

	* doc/flex.texi: Updated documentation to reflect the revisions to
	FlexLexer.h

2015-10-26  Mightyjo <mightyjo@gmail.com>

	* src/FlexLexer.h, src/flex.skl: Changed several pointers to istream
	(and ostream) to references in c++-only sections of the skeleton.  Patched up a variety of expected errors caused by changing istream*
	to istream&.  Added a stray 'make' at line 545.  Oops.  Changed the buffer_state struct to store std::streambuf* instead of
	std::istream* for C++ mode.  Changed interfaces in FlexLexer.h to
	take std::istream& instead of *.  Backward compatibility temporarily
	broken.  Patched up backward compatibility with reasonable behavior in the
	presence of null pointers.  Re-added backward-compatible versions of the yyFlexLexer methods
	that take iostream pointers.  All tests passing.

2014-11-14  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* .gitignore, doc/.gitignore: Ignore directories build-aux/, m4/ Since build-aux/ now contains a number of files previously at the
	top level, we ignore build-aux/. Therefore, it's not necessary to
	list any files that are now kept in it. Also, explicitly mark m4/ as
	a directory to ignore.

2014-11-14  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: added back call to AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR.  In an effort to reduce top level directory clutter, reintroduced the
	call to AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR. Moved the call to LT_INIT to after that
	call so configure will be able to find its files.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/testwrapper.sh: make tests/testwrapper.sh
	more verbose; find input in srcdir Since output is redirected by the automake parallel test suite
	driver, turn on both -v and -x in bash for the testwrapper.sh shell
	script. This helps a ton in debugging problems with the test harness
	itself.  In general, the input files are in automake's srcdir and the name of
	the test includes the relative path to it (even though that's
	supposed to be ./). Therefore, pass srcdir in AM_LOG_FLAGS and
	prepend that to the test name as part of constructing the input
	file's name.

	* src/flex.skl: Adjust buffer sizes on ia64.  From the debian change entry: > Finish fixing the ia64 buffer issue. Previous commits increased
	YY_READ_BUF_SIZE (where __ia64__ is defined) but left YY_BUF_SIZE
	unchanged, so that didn't fix the problem in the end. In the general
	case, the latter is twice the former. Therefore set it to the same
	ratio in the ia64 case.  In general, this sort of architecture specific fix is not the path
	we want to take, but the cleanup should be done in a more organized
	way in the future and getting it working would be preferrable now.

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: move m4 make variable to

	still be created, thus causing make to think skel.c was up to date.

	* configure.ac: add dist-xz to automake options; resolves #3561837

2012-08-26  Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* autogen.sh, configure.ac: require gettext 0.18; force autoreconf
	in autogen.sh; resolves #3561759 Autoconf had trouble finding the shared libraries for gettext. Using
	gettext 0.18 fixes that.  When updating the gettext version number, autoreconf could fail to
	update files, since autopoint would assume the gettext-related files
	had been locally modified. Passing --force prevents that from
	happening.

	Fix two tests to pass under bison 2.6 Given that bison is moving forward with the %parse-param instead of
	YYPARSE_PARAM syntax, it makes sense to switch over to using the new
	style declaration. In particular, this means that flex scanners that
	use bison features will now require bison 2.6 or higher.  Signed-off-by: Will Estes <westes575@gmail.com>

	* examples/.cvsignore, examples/fastwc/.cvsignore,

2012-07-22  Will Estes <wlestes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .gitignore: add *.o and *.a to top level .gitignore The cvs tree did not need these additions because cvs assumed a lot
	of C-style defaults for .cvsignore files. flex builds *.o object
	files in the course of compilation and *.a files are built as a part
	of the libraries that flex compiles in the build process.

2012-07-22  Will Estes <wlestes@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, .gitignore, doc/.cvsignore, doc/.gitignore,
	m4/.cvsignore, m4/.gitignore, po/.cvsignore, po/.gitignore: rename
	.cvsignore files to .gitignore The .cvsignore files from the legacy cvs repository tracked what
	files got autogenerated during various stages of the flex build.
	Renaming the .cvsignore files to .gitignore lets git do the same
	thing. git is better about letting higher level .gitignore files
	not-track files in lower level directories. As I work my way through
	the test directories, we may add additional .gitignore files from
	the old .cvsignore files.  The po/ directory has a lot of special files used by gettext, so the
	patterns in po/.gitignore look very different.  The doc/.gitignore file accounts for what texinfo/makeinfo do, and
	so it also has special patterns.  The m4 directory is mainly present for autoconf's benefit, but we
	have to account for it so make can do the right thing. Hence,
	m4/.gitignore says to ignore *.m4, as counterintuitive as that may
	seem.
