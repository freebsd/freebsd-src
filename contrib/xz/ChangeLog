    Show both elapsed time and estimated remaining time in xz -v.
    
    The extra space for showing both has been taken from the
    sizes field. If the sizes grow big, bigger units than MiB
    will be used. It makes it slightly difficult to see that
    progress is still happening with huge files, but it should
    be OK in practice.
    
    Thanks to Trent W. Buck for <http://bugs.debian.org/574583>
    and Jonathan Nieder for suggestions how to fix it.

    Treat all integer multiplier suffixes as base-2.
    
    Originally both base-2 and base-10 were supported, but since
    there seems to be little need for base-10 in XZ Utils, treat
    everything as base-2 and also be more relaxed about the case
    of the first letter of the suffix. Now xz will accept e.g.
    KiB, Ki, k, K, kB, and KB, and interpret them all as 1024. The
    recommended spelling of the suffixes are still KiB, MiB, and GiB.

    Consistently round up the memory usage limit in messages.
    
    It still feels a bit wrong to round 1 byte to 1 MiB but
    at least it is now done consistently so that the same
    byte value is always rounded the same way to MiB.

    Change the default of --enable-assume-ram from 32 to 128 MiB.
    
    This is to allow files created with "xz -9" to be decompressed
    if the amount of RAM cannot be determined.

commit 2672bcc9f85ba28ff648e092e9eb4cd9e69ce418
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sun Mar 7 13:29:28 2010 +0200

    Increase the default memory usage limit on "low-memory" systems.
    
    Previously the default limit was always 40 % of RAM. The
    new limit is a little bit more complex:
    
      - If 40 % of RAM is at least 80 MiB, 40 % of RAM is used
        as the limit.
    
      - If 80 % of RAM is over 80 MiB, 80 MiB is used as the limit.
    
      - Otherwise 80 % of RAM is used as the limit.
    
    This should make it possible to decompress files created with
    "xz -9" on more systems. Swapping is generally more expected
    on systems with less RAM, so higher default limit on them
    shouldn't cause too bad surprises in terms of heavy swapping.
    Instead, the higher default limit should reduce the number of
    bad surprises when it used to prevent decompression of files
    created with "xz -9". The DoS prevention system shouldn't be
    a DoS itself.
    
    Note that even with the new default limit, a system with 64 MiB
    RAM cannot decompress files created with "xz -9" without user
    overriding the limit. This should be OK, because if xz is going
    to need more memory than the system has RAM, it will run very
    very slowly and thus it's good that user has to override the limit
    in that case.

    Fix missing initialization in lzma_strm_init().
    
    With bad luck, lzma_code() could return LZMA_BUF_ERROR
    when it shouldn't.
    
    This has been here since the early days of liblzma.
    It got triggered by the modifications made to the xz
    tool in commit 18c10c30d2833f394cd7bce0e6a821044b15832f
    but only when decompressing .lzma files. Somehow I managed
    to miss testing that with Valgrind earlier.
    
    This fixes <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305591>.

    Subtle change to liblzma Block handling API.
    
    lzma_block.version has to be initialized even for
    lzma_block_header_decode(). This way a future version
    of liblzma won't allocate memory in a way that an old
    application doesn't know how to free it.
    
    The subtlety of this change is that all current apps
    using lzma_block_header_decode() will keep working for
    now, because the only possible version value is zero,
    and lzma_block_header_decode() unconditionally sets the
    version to zero even now. Unless fixed, these apps will
    break in the future if a new version of the Block options
    is ever needed.

    Revise the Windows build files.
    
    The old Makefile + config.h was deleted, because it
    becomes outdated too easily and building with the
    Autotools based build system works fine even on Windows.
    
    windows/build.sh hasn't got much testing, but it should
    work to build 32-bit x86 and x86-64 versions of XZ Utils
    using MSYS, MinGW or MinGW-w32, and MinGW-w64.
    
    windows/INSTALL-Windows.txt describes what packages are
    needed and how to install them.
    
    windows/README-Windows.txt is a readme file for the binary
    package that build.sh hopefully builds.
    
    There are no instructions about using Autotools for now,
    so those using a git snapshot may want to run
    "autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make mydist" on a UN*X
    box and then copy the resulting .tar.gz to a Windows.

    If signal handlers haven't been established, then it's
    useless to try to block them, especially since the sigset_t
    used for blocking hasn't been initialized yet.

    Delay opening the destionation file and other fixes.
    
    The opening of the destination file is now delayed a little.
    The coder is initialized, and if decompressing, the memory
    usage of the first Block compared against the memory
    usage limit before the destination file is opened. This
    means that if --force was used, the old "target" file won't
    be deleted so easily when something goes wrong very early.
    Thanks to Mark K for the bug report.
    
    The above fix required some changes to progress message
    handling. Now there is a separate function for setting and
    printing the filename. It is used also in list.c.
    
    list_file() now handles stdin correctly (gives an error).
    
    A useless check for user_abort was removed from file_io.c.

    Don't read compressed data from a terminal or write it

    It just seems more reasonable this way.

    Don't compress or decompress special files unless writing
    to stdout even if --force is used.
    
    --force will still enable compression of symlinks, but only
    in case they point to a regular file.
    
    The new way simply seems more reasonable. It matches gzip's
    behavior while the old one matched bzip2's behavior.

    Revised the Index handling code.
    
    This breaks API and ABI but most apps are not affected
    since most apps don't use this part of the API. You will
    get a compile error if you are using anything that got
    broken.
    
    Summary of changes:
    
      - Ability to store Stream Flags, which are needed
        for random-access reading in multi-Stream files.
    
      - Separate function to set size of Stream Padding.
    
      - Iterator structure makes it possible to read the same
        lzma_index from multiple threads at the same time.
    
      - A lot faster code to locate Blocks.
    
      - Removed lzma_index_equal() without adding anything
        to replace it. I don't know what it should do exactly
        with the new features and what actually needs this
        function in the first place other than test_index.c,
        which now has its own code to compare lzma_indexes.

    update po/.gitignore
    
    Since the *.gmo files are deleted by the maintainer-clean target,
    I assume they are not meant to be tracked.
    
    Also add the other files listed in the Makefile’s clean targets
    (stamp-poT, xz.po, xz.[12].po, *.new.po, xz.mo) to make sure they
    are not accidentally tracked.  Most of these are intermediate
    files that would not appear unless a build is interrupted or
    fails.
    
    Split the list of untracked files by origin to make it easier to
    tell if files are missing in the future.

    lzma_index_read() didn't skip over Stream Padding
    if it was the first record in the Index.
    
    lzma_index_cat() didn't combine small Indexes correctly.

    These bugs didn't affect the xz command line tool or
    most users of liblzma in any way.

    Index decoder fixes.
    
    The Index decoder code didn't perfectly match the API docs,
    which said that *i will be set to point to the decoded Index
    only after decoding has succeeded. The docs were a bit unclear
    too.
    
    Now the decoder will initially set *i to NULL. *i will be set
    to point to the decoded Index once decoding has succeeded.
    This simplifies applications too, since it avoids dangling
    pointers.

    Create sparse files by default when decompressing into
    a regular file.
    
    Sparse file creation can be disabled with --no-sparse.
    I don't promise yet that the name of this option won't
    change before 5.0.0. It's possible that the code, that
    checks when it is safe to use sparse output on stdout,
    is not good enough, and a more flexible command line
    option is needed to configure sparse file handling.

    I'm too lazy to think how to make a good Autoconf test
    for this and it's not that important anyway.
    
    No longer define HAVE_ASM_X86 or HAVE_ASM_X86_64.
    Inline assembler (if any) is used if a macro like
    __i386__ or __x86_64__ is defined.

    I had hoped to keep liblzma as purely a compression
    library as possible (e.g. file I/O will go into

    linking agaisnt liblzma need some way to determine
    the memory usage limit, and knowing the amount of RAM
    is one reasonable way to help making such decisions.

    Fix a design error in liblzma API.
    
    Originally the idea was that using LZMA_FULL_FLUSH
    with Stream encoder would read the filter chain
    from the same array that was used to intialize the
    Stream encoder. Since most apps wouldn't use
    LZMA_FULL_FLUSH, most apps wouldn't need to keep
    the filter chain available after initializing the
    Stream encoder. However, due to my mistake, it
    actually required keeping the array always available.
    
    Since setting the new filter chain via the array
    used at initialization time is not a nice way to do
    it for a couple of reasons, this commit ditches it
    and introduces lzma_filters_update(). This new function
    replaces also the "persistent" flag used by LZMA2
    (and to-be-designed Subblock filter), which was also
    an ugly thing to do.
    
    Thanks to Alexey Tourbin for reminding me about the problem
    that Stream encoder used to require keeping the filter
    chain allocated.

    This will be needed internally by liblzma once I fix
    a design mistake in the encoder API. This function may
    be useful to applications too so it's good to export it.

    Escape dashes in xzmore.1
    
    A minus sign is larger, easier to see in a printout, and more
    likely to use the same glyph as ASCII hyphen-minus in a terminal
    than a hyphen.  Since broken manual pagers do not find hyphens
    when the user searches for a hyphen-minus, minus signs are also
    easier to search for.  So use minus signs instead of hyphens to
    render sample terminal output.

    Make liblzma produce the same output on both endiannesses.
    
    Seems that it is a problem in some cases if the same
    version of XZ Utils produces different output on different
    endiannesses, so this commit fixes that problem. The output
    will still vary between different XZ Utils versions, but I
    cannot avoid that for now.
    
    This commit bloatens the code on big endian systems by 1 KiB,
    which should be OK since liblzma is bloated already. ;-)

    Use sysctl() != -1 instead of !sysctl() to check if
    the function call succeeded.
    
    NetBSD 4.0 returns positive values on success, but
    NetBSD Current and FreeBSD return zero. OpenBSD's
    man page doesn't tell what sysctl() returns on
    success. All these BSDs return -1 on error.
    
    Thanks to Robert Elz and Thomas Klausner.

    Fix options parsing bug in xz.
    
    xz used to reject "xz --lzma2=pb=2," while
    "xz --lzma2=pb=2,," worked. Now both work.

    and use a fix that works on all systems using
    GNU assembler.
    
    Maybe the assembler code is used e.g. on Solaris x86
    but let's worry about it if this doesn't work on it.

    Use even more hackish way to support thousand separators.
    
    Seems that in addition on Windows and DOS, also OpenBSD
    lacks support for %'d style printf() format strings.
    So far that is the only modern POSIX-like system I know
    with this problem, but after this hack, the thousand
    separator shouldn't be a problem on any system.
    
    Maybe testing if a format string like %'d produces
    reasonable output is invoking undefined behavior on some
    systems, but so far all the problematic systems I've tried
    just print the raw format string (e.g. %'d prints 'd).
    
    Maybe Autoconf test would have been better, but this
    hack works also for cross-compilation, and avoids
    recompilation in case the system libc starts to support
    the thousand separator.

    Make --enable-dynamic a tristate option.
    
    Some programs will by default be linked against static
    liblzma and some against shared liblzma. --enable-dynamic
    now allows overriding the default to both directions
    (all dynamic or all static) even when building both
    shared and static liblzma.
    
    This is quite messy compared to how simple thing it is supposed
    to be. The complexity is mostly due to Windows support.

    lzmainfo now links against static liblzma. In contrast
    to other command line tools in XZ Utils, linking lzmainfo
    against static liblzma by default is dumb. This will be
    fixed once I have fixed some related issues in configure.ac.

    “xzdiff a.xz b.xz” always fails
    
    Attempts to compare two compressed files result in no output and
    exit status 2.
    
    Instead of going to standard output, ‘diff’ output is being
    captured in the xz_status variable along with the exit status from
    the decompression commands.  Later, when this variable is examined
    for nonzero status codes, numerals from dates in the ‘diff’ output
    make it appear as though decompression failed.
    
    So let the ‘diff’ output leak to standard output with another file
    descriptor.  (This trick is used in all similar contexts elsewhere
    in xzdiff and in the analogous context in gzip’s zdiff script.)

    xzless: Support compressed standard input
    
    It can be somewhat confusing that
    
    	less < some_file.txt
    
    works fine, whereas
    
    	xzless < some_file.txt.xz
    
    does not.  Since version 429, ‘less’ allows a filter specified in
    the LESSOPEN environment variable to preprocess its input even if
    it comes from standard input, if $LESSOPEN begins with ‘|-’.  So
    set $LESSOPEN to take advantage of this feature.
    
    Check less’s version at runtime so xzless can continue to work
    with older versions.

    It seems that the Doxygen authors' intent is to not apply
    their copyright on generated files, but since it doesn't
    matter for XZ Utils at all, better safe than sorry.

    This is a quick and slightly dirty fix to make the code
    conform to the latest file format specification. Without
    this patch, it's possible to make corrupt files by
    specifying start offset that is not a multiple of the
    filter's alignment. Custom start offset is almost never
    used, so this was only a minor bug.
    
    The xz command line tool doesn't validate the start offset,
    so one will get a bit unclear error message if trying to use
    an invalid start offset.

    Look for full command names instead of substrings
    like "un", "cat", and "lz" when determining if
    xz is run as unxz, xzcat, lzma, unlzma, or lzcat.
    
    This is to ensure that if xz is renamed (e.g. via
    --program-transform-name), it doesn't so easily
    work in wrong mode.

    Remove --force from xzdec.
    
    It was ignored for compatibility with xz, but now that
    --decompress --stdout --force copies unrecognized files
    as is to stdout, simply ignoring --force in xzdec would
    be wrong. xzdec will not support copying unrecognized
    data as is to stdout, so it cannot support --force.

    Use sed instead of $(SED) so that we don't need to
    use AC_PROG_SED. We don't do anything fancy with sed,
    so this should work OK. libtool 2.2 sets SED but 1.5
    doesn't, so $(SED) happened to work when using libtool 2.2.

    Major update to the xzgrep and other scripts based on
    the latest versions found from gzip CVS repository.
    
    configure will try to find a POSIX shell to be used by
    the scripts. This should ease portability on systems
    which have pre-POSIX /bin/sh.
    
    xzgrep and xzdiff support .xz, .lzma, .gz, and .bz2 files.
    xzmore and xzless support only .xz and .lzma files.
    
    The name of the xz executable used in these scripts is
    now correct even if --program-transform-name has been used.

    Make "xz --decompress --stdout --force" copy unrecognized
    files as is to standard output.
    
    This feature is needed to be more compatible with gzip's
    behavior. This was more complicated to implement than it
    sounds, because the way liblzma is able to return errors with
    files of only a few bytes in size. xz now has its own file
    type detection code and no longer uses lzma_auto_decoder().

    Build system fixes
    
    Don't use libtool convenience libraries to avoid recently
    discovered long-standing subtle but somewhat severe bugs
    in libtool (at least 1.5.22 and 2.2.6 are affected). It
    was found when porting XZ Utils to Windows
    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2009-06/msg00070.html>
    but the problem is significant also e.g. on GNU/Linux.
    
    Unless --disable-shared is passed to configure, static
    library built from a set of convenience libraries will
    contain PIC objects. That is, while libtool builds non-PIC
    objects too, only PIC objects will be used from the
    convenience libraries. On 32-bit x86 (tested on mobile XP2400+),
    using PIC instead of non-PIC makes the decompressor 10 % slower
    with the default CFLAGS.
    
    So while xz was linked against static liblzma by default,
    it got the slower PIC objects unless --disable-shared was
    used. I tend develop and benchmark with --disable-shared
    due to faster build time, so I hadn't noticed the problem
    in benchmarks earlier.
    
    This commit also adds support for building Windows resources
    into liblzma and executables.

    If xz is run as lzma, unlzma, or lzcat, simply imply
    --format=lzma. This means that xz emulating lzma
    doesn't decompress .xz files, while before this

    code and especially in upcoming documentation.

    Make the default memory usage limit 40 % of RAM for both
    compressing and decompressing. This should be OK now that
    xz automatically scales down the compression settings if
    they would exceed the memory usage limit (earlier, the limit
    for compression was increased to 90 % because low limit broke
    scripts that used "xz -9" on systems with low RAM).
    
    Support spcifying the memory usage limit as a percentage
    of RAM (e.g. --memory=50%).
    
    Support --threads=0 to reset the thread limit to the default
    value (number of available CPU cores). Use UINT32_MAX instead
    of SIZE_MAX as the maximum in args.c. hardware.c was already
    expecting uint32_t value.
    
    Cleaned up the output of --help and --long-help.

    Support special value "max" where xz and xzdec accept an integer.
    Don't round the memory usage limit in xzdec --help to avoid
    an integer overflow and to not give wrong impression that
    the limit is high enough when it may not actually be.

    Fixed a crash in liblzma.
    
    liblzma tries to avoid useless free()/malloc() pairs in
    initialization when multiple files are handled using the
    same lzma_stream. This didn't work with filter chains
    due to comparison of wrong pointers in lzma_next_coder_init(),
    making liblzma think that no memory reallocation is needed
    even when it actually is.
    
    Easy way to trigger this bug is to decompress two files with
    a single xz command. The first file should have e.g. x86+LZMA2
    as the filter chain, and the second file just LZMA2.

    Fix off-by-one in LZ decoder.
    
    Fortunately, this bug had no security risk other than accepting
    some corrupt files as valid.

    Test for Linux-specific sysinfo() only on Linux systems.
    Some other systems have sysinfo() with different semantics.

    Fixes to progress message handling in xz:
    
      - Don't use Windows-specific code on Windows. The old code
        required at least Windows 2000. Now it should work on
        Windows 98 and later, and maybe on Windows 95 too.
    
      - Use less precision when showing estimated remaining time.
    
      - Fix some small design issues.

    Added lzma_easy_buffer_encode(). Splitted easy.c into small
    pieces to avoid unneeded dependencies making statically
    linked applications bigger than needed.

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 14 00:45:29 2009 +0200

    Cleanups to the code that detects the amount of RAM and
    the number of CPU cores. Added support for using sysinfo()
    on Linux systems whose libc lacks appropriate sysconf()
    support (at least dietlibc). The Autoconf macros were
    split into separate files, and CPU core count detection
    was moved from hardware.c to cpucores.h. The core count
    isn't used for anything real for now, so a problematic
    part in process.c was commented out.

    Windows port: Take advantage of the version number macros.
    Now the version number is not duplicated in the
    Windows-specific files anymore.

commit fdbc0cfa71f7d660855098a609175ba384259529
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 13 18:00:03 2009 +0200

    Changed how the version number is specified in various places.
    Now configure.ac will get the version number directly from
    src/liblzma/api/lzma/version.h. The intent is to reduce the
    number of places where the version number is duplicated. In
    future, support for displaying Git commit ID may be added too.

    .gitignore vs. Makefiles
    
    How about this for those of us who do srcdir builds?

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 10 21:48:35 2009 +0200

    Removed Makefile from .gitignore since not all Makefiles
    in the repository are generated by Autotools. People
    should do test builds in a separate build directory anyway.

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sun Feb 8 18:24:50 2009 +0200

    Add a separate internal function to initialize the CRC32
    table, which is used also by LZ encoder. This was needed
    because calling lzma_crc32() and ignoring the result is
    a no-op due to lzma_attr_pure.

    Make it easy to choose if command line tools should be
    linked statically or dynamically against liblzma. The
    default is still to use static liblzma, but it can now
    be changed by passing --enable-dynamic to configure.
    Thanks to Mike Frysinger for the original patch.
    
    Fixed a few minor bugs in configure.ac.

    MinGW support: Don't build fastpos_tablegen.c as part of
    liblzma. Build both static and dynamic liblzma, and also
    static and dynamic versions of the command line tools.

    Support LZMA_API_STATIC in assembler files to
    avoid __declspec(dllexport) equivalent.

commit 3306cf3883492720b3c34baa02f4eb4227d91c73
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 7 11:11:50 2009 +0200

    Introduced LZMA_API_STATIC macro, which the applications
    need to #define when linking against static liblzma on
    platforms like Windows. Most developers don't need to
    care about LZMA_API_STATIC at all.

    Recreated the BCJ test files for x86 and SPARC. The old files
    were linked with crt*.o, which are copyrighted, and thus the
    old test files were not in the public domain as a whole. They
    are freely distributable though, but it is better to be careful
    and avoid including any copyrighted pieces in the test files.
    The new files are just compiled and assembled object files,
    and thus don't contain any copyrighted code.

    Fix wrong filename argument for utime() and utimes().
    This doesn't affect most systems, since most systems
    have better functions available.

    Updated the x86 assembler code:
      - Use call/ret pair to get instruction pointer for PIC.
      - Use PIC only if PIC or __PIC__ is #defined.
      - The code should work on MinGW and Darwin in addition
        to GNU/Linux and Solaris.

    Modify LZMA_API macro so that it works on Windows with
    other compilers than MinGW. This may hurt readability
    of the API headers slightly, but I don't know any
    better way to do this.

    Beta was supposed to be API stable but I had forgot to rename
    lzma_memlimit_encoder and lzma_memlimit_decoder to
    lzma_raw_encoder_memlimit and lzma_raw_decoder_memlimit. :-(
    Now it is fixed. Hopefully it doesn't cause too much trouble
    to those who already thought API is stable.

    Updated src/liblzma/Makefile.am to use liblzma.pc.in, which
    should have been in the previous commit.

commit 7ed9d943b31d3ee9c5fb2387e84a241ba33afe90
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 31 00:30:49 2008 +0200

    Remove lzma_init() and other init functions from liblzma API.
    Half of developers were already forgetting to use these
    functions, which could have caused total breakage in some future
    liblzma version or even now if --enable-small was used. Now
    liblzma uses pthread_once() to do the initializations unless
    it has been built with --disable-threads which make these
    initializations thread-unsafe.
    
    When --enable-small isn't used, liblzma currently gets needlessly
    linked against libpthread (on systems that have it). While it is
    stupid for now, liblzma will need threads in future anyway, so
    this stupidity will be temporary only.
    
    When --enable-small is used, different code CRC32 and CRC64 is
    now used than without --enable-small. This made the resulting
    binary slightly smaller, but the main reason was to clean it up
    and to handle the lack of lzma_init_check().
    
    The pkg-config file lzma.pc was renamed to liblzma.pc. I'm not
    sure if it works correctly and portably for static linking
    (Libs.private includes -pthread or other operating system
    specific flags). Hopefully someone complains if it is bad.
    
    lzma_rc_prices[] is now included as a precomputed array even
    with --enable-small. It's just 128 bytes now that it uses uint8_t
    instead of uint32_t. Smaller array seemed to be at least as fast
    as the more bloated uint32_t array on x86; hopefully it's not bad
    on other architectures.

    Revert a change made in 3b34851de1eaf358cf9268922fa0eeed8278d680
    that was related to LZMA_MODE_FAST. The original code is slightly
    faster although it compresses slightly worse. But since it is fast
    mode, it is better to select the faster version.

    Renamed lzma to xz and lzmadec to xzdec. We create symlinks
    lzma, unlzma, and lzcat in "make install" for backwards
    compatibility with LZMA Utils 4.32.x; I'm not sure if this
    should be the default though.

    Oh well, big messy commit again. Some highlights:
      - Updated to the latest, probably final file format version.
      - Command line tool reworked to not use threads anymore.
        Threading will probably go into liblzma anyway.
      - Memory usage limit is now about 30 % for uncompression
        and about 90 % for compression.
      - Progress indicator with --verbose
      - Simplified --help and full --long-help
      - Upgraded to the last LGPLv2.1+ getopt_long from gnulib.
      - Some bug fixes

    Check for LZMA_FILTER_RESERVED_START in filter_flags_encoder.c.
    Use LZMA_PROG_ERROR instead of LZMA_HEADER_ERROR if the Filter ID
    is in the reserved range. This allows Block Header encoder to
    detect unallowed Filter IDs, which is good for Stream encoder.

    Added support for raw encoding and decoding to the command

    --lzma1 to prevent people from accidentally using LZMA when
    they want LZMA2.

    Don't allow LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH with decoders anymore. There's
    simply nothing that would use it. Allow LZMA_FINISH to the
    decoders, which will usually ignore it (auto decoder and
    Stream decoder being exceptions).

    Updated auto decoder to handle LZMA_CONCATENATED when decoding
    LZMA_Alone files. Decoding of concatenated LZMA_Alone files is
    intentionally not supported, so it is better to put this in
    auto decoder than LZMA_Alone decoder.

    Sort of garbage collection commit. :-| Many things are still
    broken. API has changed a lot and it will still change a
    little more here and there. The command line tool doesn't
    have all the required changes to reflect the API changes, so
    it's easy to get "internal error" or trigger assertions.

    decoder structure.
    
    Make the LZMA decoder to rely on the current internal API
    to free the allocated memory in case an error occurs.

    Update the code to mostly match the new simpler file format
    specification. Simplify things by removing most of the
    support for known uncompressed size in most places.
    There are some miscellaneous changes here and there too.
    
    The API of liblzma has got many changes and still some
    more will be done soon. While most of the code has been
    updated, some things are not fixed (the command line tool
    will choke with invalid filter chain, if nothing else).
    
    Subblock filter is somewhat broken for now. It will be
    updated once the encoded format of the Subblock filter
    has been decided.

    a lot simpler than the previous versions, but it also means
    that the existing code will change a lot.

    Fix a buffer overflow in the LZMA encoder. It was due to my
    misunderstanding of the code. There's no tiny fix for this
    problem, so I also cleaned up the code in general.
    
    This reduces the speed of the encoder 2-5 % in the fastest
    compression mode ("lzma -1"). High compression modes should
    have no noticeable performance difference.
    
    This commit breaks things (especially LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH) but I
    will fix them once the new format and LZMA2 has been roughly
    implemented. Plain LZMA won't support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH at all
    and won't be supported in the new .lzma format. This may
    change still but this is what it looks like now.
    
    Support for known uncompressed size (that is, LZMA or LZMA2
    without EOPM) is likely to go away. This means there will
    be API changes.

Date:   Mon Apr 28 17:06:34 2008 +0300

    Fixed wrong spelling "limitter" to "limiter". This affects
    liblzma's API.

commit beeb81060821dfec4e7898e0d44b7900dcb2215e
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Fri Apr 25 15:39:50 2008 +0300

    Prevent LZ encoder from hanging with known uncompressed
    size. The "fix" breaks LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH at end of stream
    with known uncompressed size, but since it currently seems
    likely that support for encoding with known uncompressed
    size will go away anyway, I'm not fixing this problem now.

Date:   Fri Apr 25 13:58:56 2008 +0300

    Removed src/liblzma/common/sysdefs.h symlink, which was
    annoying, because "make dist" put two copies of sysdefs.h
    into the tarball instead of the symlink.

    Bumped version number to 4.999.3alpha. It will become 5.0.0
    once we have a stable release (won't be very soon). The
    version number is no longer related to version of LZMA SDK.
    
    Made some small Automake-related changes to toplevel
    Makefile.am and configure.ac.

Date:   Thu Apr 24 17:30:51 2008 +0300

    Use 64-bit integer as range encoder's cache size. This fixes a
    theoretical data corruption, which should be very hard to trigger
    even intentionally.

    Replaced the range decoder optimization that used arithmetic
    right shift with as fast version that doesn't need
    arithmetic right shift. Removed the related check from
    configure.ac.

    Demystified the "state" variable in LZMA code. Use the
    word literal instead of char for better consistency.
    There are still some names with _char instead of _literal
    in lzma_optimum, these may be changed later.
    
    Renamed length coder variables.
    
    This commit doesn't change the program logic.

    Initialize align_price_count and match_price_count in
    lzma_encoder_init.c. While we don't call
    fill_distances_prices() and fill_align_prices() in
    lzma_lzma_encoder_init(), we still need to initialize
    these two variables so that the fill functions get
    called in lzma_encoder_getoptimum.c in the beginning
    of a stream.

    Always initialize lz->temp_size in lz_decoder.c. temp_size did
    get initialized as a side-effect after allocating a new decoder,
    but not when the decoder was reused.

    Remove two redundant validity checks from the LZMA decoder.
    These are already checked elsewhere, so omitting these
    gives (very) tiny speed up.

    Don't memzero() the history buffer when initializing LZ
    decoder. There's no danger of information leak here, so
    it isn't required. Doing memzero() takes a lot of time
    with large dictionaries, which could make it easier to
    construct DoS attack to consume too much CPU time.

    Return LZMA_HEADER_ERROR if LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH is used with any
    of the so called simple filters. If there is demand, limited
    support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH may be added in future.
    
    After this commit, using LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH shouldn't cause
    undefined behavior in any situation.

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 25 23:12:36 2008 +0200

    Combine lzma_options_block validation needed by both Block
    encoder and decoder, and put the shared things to
    block_private.h. Improved the checks a little so that
    they may detect too big Compressed Size at initialization
    time if lzma_options_block.total_size or .total_limit is
    known.
    
    Allow encoding and decoding Blocks with combinations of
    fields that are not allowed by the file format specification.
    Doing this requires that the application passes such a
    combination in lzma_options_lzma; liblzma doesn't do that,
    but it's not impossible that someone could find them useful
    in some custom file format.

    Improved the memory limitter:
      - Added lzma_memlimit_max() and lzma_memlimit_reached()
        API functions.
      - Added simple estimation of malloc()'s memory usage
        overhead.
      - Fixed integer overflow detection in lzma_memlimit_alloc().
      - Made some white space cleanups and added more comments.
    
    The description of lzma_memlimit_max() in memlimit.h is bad
    and should be improved.

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 23 13:36:07 2008 +0200

    Fix Size of Header Metadata Block handling. Now
    lzma_metadata.header_metadata_size == LZMA_VLI_VALUE_UNKNOWN
    is not allowed at all. To indicate missing Header Metadata
    Block, header_metadata_size must be set to zero. This is
    what Metadata decoder does after this patch too.
    
    Note that other missing fields in lzma_metadata are still
    indicated with LZMA_VLI_VALUE_UNKNOWN. This isn't as
    illogical as it sounds at first, because missing Size of
    Header Metadata Block means that Header Metadata Block is
    not present in the Stream. With other Metadata fields,
    a missing field means only that the value is unknown.

    Added lzma_easy_* functions. These should make using
    liblzma as easy as using zlib, because the easy API
    don't require developers to know any fancy LZMA options.
    
    Note that Multi-Block Stream encoding is currently broken.
    The easy API should be OK, the bug(s) are elsewhere.

    Fix alignment handling bugs in Subblock encoder.
    
    This leaves one known alignment bug unfixed: If repeat count
    doesn't fit into 28-bit integer, the encoder has to split
    this to multiple Subblocks with Subblock Type `Repeating Data'.
    The extra Subblocks may have wrong alignment. Correct alignment
    is restored after the split Repeating Data has been completely
    written out.
    
    Since the encoder doesn't even try to fix the alignment unless
    the size of Data is at least 4 bytes, to trigger this bug you
    need at least 4 GiB of repeating data with sequence length of
    4 or more bytes. Since the worst thing done by this bug is
    misaligned data (no data corruption), this bug simply isn't
    worth fixing, because a proper fix isn't simple.

Date:   Sat Jan 19 21:16:33 2008 +0200

    Implemented LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH support to the Subblock encoder.
    The API for handing Subfilters was changed to make it
    consistent with LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.
    
    A few sanity checks were added for Subfilter handling. Some
    small bugs were fixed. More comments were added.

Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 19 15:19:21 2008 +0200

    Revised the Delta filter implementation. The initialization
    function is still shared between encoder and decoder, but the
    actual coding is in separate files for encoder and decoder.
    
    There are now separate functions for the actual delta
    calculation depending on if Delta is the last filter in the
    chain or not. If it is the last, the new code copies the
    data from input to output buffer and does the delta
    calculation at the same time. The old code first copied the
    data, then did the delta in the target buffer, which required
    reading through the data twice.
    
    Support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH was added to the Delta encoder.
    This doesn't change anything in the file format.

    Subblock decoder: Don't exit the main loop in decode_buffer()
    too early if we hit End of Input while decoding a Subblock of
    type Repeating Data. To keep the loop termination condition
    elegant, the order of enumerations in coder->sequence were
    changed.
    
    To keep the case-labels in roughly the same order as the
    enumerations in coder->sequence, large chunks of code was
    moved around. This made the diff big and ugly compared to
    the amount of the actual changes made.

    Fix wrong too small size of argument unfiltered_max
    in ia64_coder_init(). It triggered assert() in
    simple_coder.c, and could have caused a buffer overflow.
    
    This error was probably a copypaste mistake, since most
    of the simple filters use unfiltered_max = 4.

    Revised the fastpos code. It now uses the slightly faster
    table-based version from LZMA SDK 4.57. This should be
    fast on most systems.
    
    A simpler and smaller alternative version is also provided.
    On some CPUs this can be even a little faster than the
    default table-based version (see comments in fastpos.h),
    but on most systems the table-based code is faster.

    Automatically disable assembler code on Darwin x86.
    Darwin has different ABI than GNU+Linux and Solaris,
    thus the assembler code doesn't assemble on Darwin.

    With printf(), use PRIu64 with a cast to uint64_t instead
    of %zu, because some pre-C99 libc versions don't support %zu.

commit 4e7e54c4c522ab2f6a7abb92cefc4f707e9568fb
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 6 16:27:41 2008 +0200

    Introduced compatibility with systems that have pre-C99
    or no inttypes.h. This is useful when the compiler has
    good enough support for C99, but libc headers don't.
    
    Changed liblzma API so that sys/types.h and inttypes.h
    have to be #included before #including lzma.h. On systems
    that don't have C99 inttypes.h, it's the problem of the
    applications to provide the required types and macros
    before #including lzma.h.
    
    If lzma.h defined the missing types and macros, it could
    conflict with third-party applications whose configure
    has detected that the types are missing and defined them
    in config.h already. An alternative would have been
    introducing lzma_uint32 and similar types, but that would
    just be an extra pain on modern systems.

    Fix stupid bugs in flush marker detection.

commit 0029cbbabe87d491fc046a55a629a6d556010baa
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 4 21:30:33 2008 +0200

    Added support for flush marker, which will be in files
    that use LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH with encoder (not implemented
    yet). This is a new feature in the raw LZMA format,
    which isn't supported by old decoders. This shouldn't
    be a problem in practice, since lzma_alone_encoder()
    will not allow LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH, and thus not allow
    creating files on decodable with old decoders.
    
    Made lzma_decoder.c to require tab width of 4 characters
    if one wants to fit the code in 80 columns. This makes
    the code easier to read.

    Moved range decoder initialization (reading the first
    five input bytes) from LZMA decoder to range decoder
    header. Did the same for decoding of direct bits.

    Use the filename suffix .S instead of .s for assembler files
    so that the preprocessor removes the /* */ style comments,
    which are not supported by some non-GNU assemblers (Solaris)
    that otherwise work with this code.

commit 3e16d51dd645667b05ff826665b1fc353aa41cd9
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

    Remove uncompressed size tracking from the filter encoders.
    It's not strictly needed there, and just complicates the
    code. LZ encoder never even had this feature.
    
    The primary reason to have uncompressed size tracking in
    filter encoders was validating that the application
    doesn't give different amount of input that it had
    promised. A side effect was to validate internal workings
    of liblzma.
    
    Uncompressed size tracking is still present in the Block
    encoder. Maybe it should be added to LZMA_Alone and raw
    encoders too. It's simpler to have one coder just to
    validate the uncompressed size instead of having it
    in every filter.

    Get rid of no-NLS gnulib. I don't know how to get it
    working with Automake. People who want smaller lzmadec
    should use --disable-nls on non-GNU systems.
