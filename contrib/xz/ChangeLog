    tuklib_integer.h: Fix a recent copypaste error in Clang detection.
    
    Wrong line was changed in 7062348bf35c1e4cbfee00ad9fffb4a21aa6eff7.
    Also, this has >= instead of == since ints larger than 32 bits would
    work too even if not relevant in practice.

    Windows: Include <intrin.h> when needed.
    
    Legacy Windows did not need to #include <intrin.h> to use the MSVC
    intrinsics. Newer versions likely just issue a warning, but the MSVC
    documentation says to include the header file for the intrinsics we use.
    
    GCC and Clang can "pretend" to be MSVC on Windows, so extra checks are
    needed in tuklib_integer.h to only include <intrin.h> when it will is
    actually needed.

    tuklib_integer: Use __builtin_clz() with Clang.
    
    Clang has support for __builtin_clz(), but previously Clang would
    fallback to either the MSVC intrinsic or the regular C code. This was
    discovered due to a bug where a new version of Clang required the
    <intrin.h> header file in order to use the MSVC intrinsics.
    
    Thanks to Anton Kochkov for notifying us about the bug.

    CMake: Allows setting thread method.
    
    The thread method is now configurable for the CMake build. It matches
    the Autotools build by allowing ON (pick the best threading method),
    OFF (no threading), posix, win95, and vista. If both Windows and
    posix threading are both available, then ON will choose Windows
    threading. Windows threading will also not use:
    
    target_link_libraries(liblzma Threads::Threads)
    
    since on systems like MinGW-w64 it would link the posix threads
    without purpose.

    Build: Fix --disable-threads breaking the building of shared libs.
    
    This is broken in the releases 5.2.6 to 5.4.2. A workaround
    for these releases is to pass EGREP='grep -E' as an argument
    to configure in addition to --disable-threads.
    
    The problem appeared when m4/ax_pthread.m4 was updated in
    the commit 6629ed929cc7d45a11e385f357ab58ec15e7e4ad which
    introduced the use of AC_EGREP_CPP. AC_EGREP_CPP calls
    AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_EGREP]) to set the shell variable EGREP
    but this was only executed if POSIX threads were enabled.
    Libtool code also has AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_EGREP]) but Autoconf
    omits it as AC_PROG_EGREP has already been required earlier.
    Thus, if not using POSIX threads, the shell variable EGREP
    would be undefined in the Libtool code in configure.
    
    ax_pthread.m4 is fine. The bug was in configure.ac which called
    AX_PTHREAD conditionally in an incorrect way. Using AS_CASE
    ensures that all AC_REQUIREs get always run.
    
    Thanks to Frank Busse for reporting the bug.

    When the docs are installed, calling the directory "liblzma" is

    liblzma: Add set lzma.h as the main page for Doxygen documentation.
    
    The \mainpage command is used in the first block of comments in lzma.h.
    This changes the previously nearly empty index.html to use the first
    comment block in lzma.h for its contents.
    
    lzma.h is no longer documented separately, but this is for the better
    since lzma.h only defined a few macros that users do not need to use.
    The individual API header files all have a disclaimer that they should
    not be #included directly, so there should be no confusion on the fact
    that lzma.h should be the only header used by applications.
    
    Additionally, the note "See ../lzma.h for information about liblzma as
    a whole." was removed since lzma.h is now the main page of the
    generated HTML and does not have its own page anymore. So it would be
    confusing in the HTML version and was only a "nice to have" when
    browsing the source files.

    Build: Create doxygen/update-doxygen script.
    
    This is a helper script to generate the Doxygen documentation. It can be
    run in 'liblzma' or 'internal' mode by setting the first argument. It
    will default to 'liblzma' mode and only generate documentation for the
    liblzma API header files.
    
    The helper script will be run during the custom mydist hook when we
    create releases. This hook already alters the source directory, so its
    fine to do it here too. This way, we can include the Doxygen generated
    files in the distrubtion and when installing.
    
    In 'liblzma' mode, the JavaScript is stripped from the .html files and
    the .js files are removed. This avoids license hassle from jQuery and
    other libraries that Doxygen 1.9.6 puts into jquery.js in minified form.

    Build: Install Doxygen docs and include in distribution if generated.
    
    Added a install-data-local target to install the Doxygen documentation
    only when it has been generated. In order to correctly remove the docs,
    a corresponding uninstall-local target was added.
    
    If the doxygen docs exist in the source tree, they will also be included
    in the distribution now too.

    Doxygen: Refactor Doxyfile.in to doxygen/Doxyfile.
    
    Instead of having Doxyfile.in configured by Autoconf, the Doxyfile
    can have the tags that need to be configured piped into the doxygen
    command through stdin with the overrides after Doxyfile's contents.
    
    Going forward, the documentation should be generated in two different
    modes: liblzma or internal.
    
    liblzma is useful for most users. It is the documentation for just
    the liblzma API header files. This is the default.
    
    internal is for people who want to understand how xz and liblzma work.
    It might be useful for people who want to contribute to the project.

    xz: Don't fail if Capsicum is enabled but kernel doesn't support it.
    
    (This commit combines related commits from the master branch.)
    
    If Capsicum support is missing from the kernel or xz is being run
    in an emulator that lacks Capsicum suport, the syscalls will fail
    and set errno to ENOSYS. Previously xz would display and error and
    exit, making xz unusable. Now it will check for ENOSYS and run
    without sandbox support. Other tools like ssh behave similarly.
    
    Displaying a warning for missing Capsicum support was considered
    but such extra output would quickly become annoying. It would also
    break test_scripts.sh in "make check".
    
    Also move cap_enter() to be the first step instead of the last one.
    This matches the example in the cap_rights_limit(2) man page. With
    the current code it shouldn't make any practical difference though.

    liblzma: Clarify lzma_lzma_preset() documentation in lzma12.h.
    
    lzma_lzma_preset() does not guarentee that the lzma_options_lzma are
    usable in an encoder even if it returns false (success). If liblzma
    is built with default configurations, then the options will always be
    usable. However if the match finders hc3, hc4, or bt4 are disabled, then
    the options may not be usable depending on the preset level requested.
    
    The documentation was updated to reflect this complexity, since this
    behavior was unclear before.

commit dfc9a54082e0fc7b3b796ea15336b5075acc79d5

    liblzma: Avoid null pointer + 0 (undefined behavior in C).
    
    In the C99 and C17 standards, section 6.5.6 paragraph 8 means that
    adding 0 to a null pointer is undefined behavior. As of writing,
    "clang -fsanitize=undefined" (Clang 15) diagnoses this. However,
    I'm not aware of any compiler that would take advantage of this
    when optimizing (Clang 15 included). It's good to avoid this anyway
    since compilers might some day infer that pointer arithmetic implies
    that the pointer is not NULL. That is, the following foo() would then
    unconditionally return 0, even for foo(NULL, 0):
    
        void bar(char *a, char *b);
    
        int foo(char *a, size_t n)
        {
            bar(a, a + n);
            return a == NULL;
        }
    
    In contrast to C, C++ explicitly allows null pointer + 0. So if
    the above is compiled as C++ then there is no undefined behavior
    in the foo(NULL, 0) call.
    
    To me it seems that changing the C standard would be the sane
    thing to do (just add one sentence) as it would ensure that a huge
    amount of old code won't break in the future. Based on web searches
    it seems that a large number of codebases (where null pointer + 0
    occurs) are being fixed instead to be future-proof in case compilers
    will some day optimize based on it (like making the above foo(NULL, 0)
    return 0) which in the worst case will cause security bugs.
    
    Some projects don't plan to change it. For example, gnulib and thus
    many GNU tools currently require that null pointer + 0 is defined:
    
        https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2021-11/msg00000.html
    
        https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/Other-portability-assumptions.html
    
    In XZ Utils null pointer + 0 issue should be fixed after this
    commit. This adds a few if-statements and thus branches to avoid
    null pointer + 0. These check for size > 0 instead of ptr != NULL
    because this way bugs where size > 0 && ptr == NULL will likely
    get caught quickly. None of them are in hot spots so it shouldn't
    matter for performance.
    
    A little less readable version would be replacing
    
        ptr + offset
    
    with
    
        offset != 0 ? ptr + offset : ptr
    
    or creating a macro for it:
    
        #define my_ptr_add(ptr, offset) \
                ((offset) != 0 ? ((ptr) + (offset)) : (ptr))
    
    Checking for offset != 0 instead of ptr != NULL allows GCC >= 8.1,
    Clang >= 7, and Clang-based ICX to optimize it to the very same code
    as ptr + offset. That is, it won't create a branch. So for hot code
    this could be a good solution to avoid null pointer + 0. Unfortunately
    other compilers like ICC 2021 or MSVC 19.33 (VS2022) will create a
    branch from my_ptr_add().
    
    Thanks to Marcin Kowalczyk for reporting the problem:

    Build: Use only the generic symbol versioning on MicroBlaze.
    
    On MicroBlaze, GCC 12 is broken in sense that
    __has_attribute(__symver__) returns true but it still doesn't
    support the __symver__ attribute even though the platform is ELF
    and symbol versioning is supported if using the traditional
    __asm__(".symver ...") method. Avoiding the traditional method is
    good because it breaks LTO (-flto) builds with GCC.
    
    See also: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101766
    
    For now the only extra symbols in liblzma_linux.map are the
    compatibility symbols with the patch that spread from RHEL/CentOS 7.
    These require the use of __symver__ attribute or __asm__(".symver ...")
    in the C code. Compatibility with the patch from CentOS 7 doesn't
    seem valuable on MicroBlaze so use liblzma_generic.map on MicroBlaze
    instead. It doesn't require anything special in the C code and thus
    no LTO issues either.
    
    An alternative would be to detect support for __symver__
    attribute in configure.ac and CMakeLists.txt and fall back
    to __asm__(".symver ...") but then LTO would be silently broken
    on MicroBlaze. It sounds likely that MicroBlaze is a special
    case so let's treat it as a such because that is simpler. If
    a similar issue exists on some other platform too then hopefully
    someone will report it and this can be reconsidered.
    
    (This doesn't do the same fix in CMakeLists.txt. Perhaps it should
    but perhaps CMake build of liblzma doesn't matter much on MicroBlaze.
    The problem breaks the build so it's easy to notice and can be fixed
    later.)
    
    Thanks to Vincent Fazio for reporting the problem and proposing
    a patch (in the end that solution wasn't used):

    liblzma: Fix documentation in filter.h for lzma_str_to_filters()
    
    The previous documentation for lzma_str_to_filters() was technically
    correct, but misleading. lzma_str_to_filters() returns NULL on success,
    which is in practice always defined to 0. This is the same value as
    LZMA_OK, but lzma_str_to_filters() does not return lzma_ret so we should
    be more clear.

    tuklib_physmem: Silence warning from -Wcast-function-type on MinGW-w64.
    
    tuklib_physmem depends on GetProcAddress() for both MSVC and MinGW-w64
    to retrieve a function address. The proper way to do this is to cast the
    return value to the type of function pointer retrieved. Unfortunately,
    this causes a cast-function-type warning, so the best solution is to
    simply ignore the warning.

    Tests: Fix warnings from clang --Wassign-enum.
    
    Explicitly casting the integer to lzma_check silences the warning.
    Since such an invalid value is needed in multiple tests, a constant
    INVALID_LZMA_CHECK_ID was added to tests.h.
    
    The use of 0x1000 for lzma_block.check wasn't optimal as if
    the underlying type is a char then 0x1000 will be truncated to 0.
    However, in these test cases the value is ignored, thus even with
    such truncation the test would have passed.

    Tests: Silence warnings from -Wsign-conversion.
    
    Note that assigning an unsigned int to lzma_check doesn't warn
    on GNU/Linux x86-64 since the enum type is unsigned on that
    platform. The enum can be signed on some other platform though
    so it's best to use enumeration type lzma_check in these situations.

    sysdefs.h: Don't include strings.h anymore.
    
    On some platforms src/xz/suffix.c may need <strings.h> for
    strcasecmp() but suffix.c includes the header when it needs it.
    
    Unless there is an old system that otherwise supports enough C99
    to build XZ Utils but doesn't have C89/C90-compatible <string.h>,
    there should be no need to include <strings.h> in sysdefs.h.

    xz: Include <strings.h> in suffix.c if needed for strcasecmp().
    
    SUSv2 and POSIX.1‐2017 declare only a few functions in <strings.h>.
    Of these, strcasecmp() is used on some platforms in suffix.c.
    Nothing else in the project needs <strings.h> (at least if
    building on a modern system).
    
    sysdefs.h currently includes <strings.h> if HAVE_STRINGS_H is
    defined and suffix.c relied on this.
    
    Note that dos/config.h doesn't #define HAVE_STRINGS_H even though
    DJGPP does have strings.h. It isn't needed with DJGPP as strcasecmp()
    is also in <string.h> in DJGPP.

    This only occurs in test_filter_flags when the BCJ filters are not
    configured and built. In this case, ARRAY_SIZE() returns 0 and causes a
    type-limits warning with the loop variable since an unsigned number will
    always be >= 0.

    liblzma: CLMUL CRC64: Work around a bug in MSVC, second attempt.
    
    This affects only 32-bit x86 builds. x86-64 is OK as is.
    
    I still cannot easily test this myself. The reporter has tested
    this and it passes the tests included in the CMake build and
    performance is good: raw CRC64 is 2-3 times faster than the
    C version of the slice-by-four method. (Note that liblzma doesn't
    include a MSVC-compatible version of the 32-bit x86 assembly code
    for the slice-by-four method.)
    
    Thanks to Iouri Kharon for figuring out a fix, testing, and
    benchmarking.

    for 32-bit x86 if optimizations are enabled.

    sysdefs.h: Don't include memory.h anymore even if it were available.
    
    It quite probably was never needed, that is, any system where memory.h
    was required likely couldn't compile XZ Utils for other reasons anyway.
    
    XZ Utils 5.2.6 and later source packages were generated using
    Autoconf 2.71 which no longer defines HAVE_MEMORY_H. So the code
    being removed is no longer used anyway.

    Tests: test_filter_flags: Clean up minor issues.
    
    Here are the list of the most significant issues addressed:
    - Avoid using internal common.h header. It's not good to copy the
    constants like this but common.h cannot be included for use outside
    of liblzma. This is the quickest thing to do that could be fixed later.
    
    - Omit the INIT_FILTER macro. Initialization should be done with just
    regular designated initializers.
    
    - Use start_offset = 257 for BCJ tests. It demonstrates that Filter
    Flags encoder and decoder don't validate the options thoroughly.
    257 is valid only for the x86 filter. This is a bit silly but
    not a significant problem in practice because the encoder and
    decoder initialization functions will catch bad alignment still.
    Perhaps this should be fixed but it's not urgent and doesn't need
    to be in 5.4.x.
    
    - Various tweaks to comments such as filter id -> Filter ID

    It's not needed in XZ Utils at least for now. It's good to support

    liblzma: Remove common.h include from common/index.h.
    
    common/index.h is needed by liblzma internally and tests. common.h will
    include and define many things that are not needed by the tests.
    
    Also, this prevents include order problems because both common.h and
    lzma.h define LZMA_API. On most platforms it results only in a warning
    but on Windows it would break the build as the definition in common.h
    must be used only for building liblzma itself.

    Build: Only define HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME if it is set to 1.
    
    HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME is renamed to
    HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME. Previously,
    HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME was always set when
    building with autotools. CMake would only set this when it was 1, and the
    dos/config.h did not define it. The new macro definition is consistent
    across build systems.

    liblzma: Includes sys/time.h conditionally in mythread
    
    Previously, <sys/time.h> was always included, even if mythread only used
    clock_gettime. <time.h> is still needed even if clock_gettime is not used
    though because struct timespec is needed for mythread_condtime.

    Build: No longer require HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC to always be set.
    
    Previously, if threading was enabled HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC would always
    be set to 0 or 1. However, this macro was needed in xz so if xz was not
    built with threading and HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC was not defined but
    HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME was, it caused a warning during build. Now,
    HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC has been renamed to HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC and
    will only be set if it is 1.

    liblzma: Fix lzma_microlzma_encoder() return value.
    
    Using return_if_error on lzma_lzma_lclppb_encode was improper because
    return_if_error is expecting an lzma_ret value, but
    lzma_lzma_lclppb_encode returns a boolean. This could result in
    lzma_microlzma_encoder, which would be misleading for applications.

    Update INSTALL: CMake on Windows isn't experimental anymore.
    
    Using CMake to build liblzma should work on a few other OSes
    but building the command line tools is still subtly broken.
    
    It is known that shared library versioning may differ between
    CMake and Libtool builds on some OSes, most notably Darwin.

    xz: Don't modify argv[].
    
    The code that parses --memlimit options and --block-list modified
    the argv[] when parsing the option string from optarg. This was
    visible in "ps auxf" and such and could be confusing. I didn't
    understand it back in the day when I wrote that code. Now a copy
    is allocated when modifiable strings are needed.

    liblzma: Use __has_attribute(__symver__) to fix Clang detection.
    
    If someone sets up Clang to define __GNUC__ to 10 or greater
    then symvers broke. __has_attribute is supported by such GCC
    and Clang versions that don't support __symver__ so this should
    be much better and simpler way to detect if __symver__ is
    actually supported.

    liblzma: Omit zero-skipping from ARM64 filter.
    
    It has some complicated downsides and its usefulness is more limited
    than I originally thought. So this change is bad for certain very
    specific situations but a generic solution that works for other
    filters (and is otherwise better too) is planned anyway. And this
    way 7-Zip can use the same compatible filter for the .7z format.
    
    This is still marked as experimental with a new temporary Filter ID.

    liblzma: Add lzma_str_to_filters, _from_filters, and _list_filters.
    
    lzma_str_to_filters() uses static error messages which makes
    them not very precise. It tells the position in the string
    where an error occurred though which helps quite a bit if
    applications take advantage of it. Dynamic error messages can
    be added later with a new flag if it seems important enough.

commit 33b8a24b6646a9dbfd8358405aec466b13078559
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2022-11-27 23:16:21 +0200

    liblzma: Add LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1EXT to support LZMA1 without end marker.
    
    Some file formats need support for LZMA1 streams that don't use
    the end of payload marker (EOPM) alias end of stream (EOS) marker.
    So far liblzma API has supported decompressing such streams via
    lzma_alone_decoder() when .lzma header specifies a known
    uncompressed size. Encoding support hasn't been available in the API.
    
    Instead of adding a new LZMA1-only API for this purpose, this commit
    adds a new filter ID for use with raw encoder and decoder. The main
    benefit of this approach is that then also filter chains are possible,
    for example, if someone wants to implement support for .7z files that
    use the x86 BCJ filter with LZMA1 (not BCJ2 as that isn't supported
    in liblzma).

    liblzma: Allow nice_len 2 and 3 even if match finder requires 3 or 4.
    
    That is, if the specified nice_len is smaller than the minimum
    of the match finder, silently use the match finder's minimum value
    instead of reporting an error. The old behavior is annoying to users
    and it complicates xz options handling too.

    Build: Don't put GNU/Linux-specific symbol versions into static liblzma.
    
    It not only makes no sense to put symbol versions into a static library
    but it can also cause breakage.
    
    By default Libtool #defines PIC if building a shared library and
    doesn't define it for static libraries. This is documented in the
    Libtool manual. It can be overriden using --with-pic or --without-pic.
    configure.ac detects if --with-pic or --without-pic is used and then
    gives an error if neither --disable-shared nor --disable-static was
    used at the same time. Thus, in normal situations it works to build
    both shared and static library at the same time on GNU/Linux,
    only --with-pic or --without-pic requires that only one type of
    library is built.
    
    Thanks to John Paul Adrian Glaubitz from Debian for reporting
    the problem that occurred on ia64:

    liblzma: Refactor to use lzma_filters_free().
    
    lzma_filters_free() sets the options to NULL and ids to
    LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN so there is no need to do it by caller;
    the filter arrays will always be left in a safe state.
    
    Also use memcpy() instead of a loop to copy a filter chain
    when it is known to be safe to copy LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1
    (even if the elements past the terminator might be uninitialized).

    liblzma: Fix another invalid free() after memory allocation failure.
    
    This time it can happen when lzma_stream_encoder_mt() is used
    to reinitialize an existing multi-threaded Stream encoder
    and one of 1-4 tiny allocations in lzma_filters_copy() fail.
    
    It's very similar to the previous bug
    10430fbf3820dafd4eafd38ec8be161a6978ed2b, happening with
    an array of lzma_filter structures whose old options are freed
    but the replacement never arrives due to a memory allocation
    failure in lzma_filters_copy().

    liblzma: Add support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH in the Block encoder.
    
    The documentation mentions that lzma_block_encoder() supports
    LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH but it was never added to supported_actions[]
    in the internal structure. Because of this, LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH could
    not be used with the Block encoder unless it was the next coder
    after something like stream_encoder() or stream_encoder_mt().

    liblzma: Fix invalid free() after memory allocation failure.
    
    The bug was in the single-threaded .xz Stream encoder
    in the code that is used for both re-initialization and for
    lzma_filters_update(). To trigger it, an application had
    to either re-initialize an existing encoder instance with
    lzma_stream_encoder() or use lzma_filters_update(), and
    then one of the 1-4 tiny allocations in lzma_filters_copy()
    (called from stream_encoder_update()) must fail. An error
    was correctly reported but the encoder state was corrupted.
    
    This is related to the recent fix in
    f8ee61e74eb40600445fdb601c374d582e1e9c8a which is good but
    it wasn't enough to fix the main problem in stream_encoder.c.

    liblzma: Fix infinite loop in LZMA encoder init with dict_size >= 2 GiB.
    
    The encoder doesn't support dictionary sizes larger than 1536 MiB.
    This is validated, for example, when calculating the memory usage
    via lzma_raw_encoder_memusage(). It is also enforced by the LZ
    part of the encoder initialization. However, LZMA encoder with
    LZMA_MODE_NORMAL did an unsafe calculation with dict_size before
    such validation and that results in an infinite loop if dict_size
    was 2 << 30 or greater.

    This reverts commit 177bdc922cb17bd0fd831ab8139dfae912a5c2b8
    and also does equivalent change to arm64.c.
    
    Now that ARM64 filter will use lzma_options_bcj, this change
    is not needed anymore.

    Replace the experimental ARM64 filter with a new experimental version.
    
    This is incompatible with the previous version.
    
    This has space/tab fixes in filter_*.c and bcj.h too.

commit f644473a211394447824ea00518d0a214ff3f7f2
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2022-11-14 21:34:57 +0200

    liblzma: Add fast CRC64 for 32/64-bit x86 using SSSE3 + SSE4.1 + CLMUL.
    
    It also works on E2K as it supports these intrinsics.
    
    On x86-64 runtime detection is used so the code keeps working on
    older processors too. A CLMUL-only build can be done by using
    -msse4.1 -mpclmul in CFLAGS and this will reduce the library
    size since the generic implementation and its 8 KiB lookup table
    will be omitted.
    
    On 32-bit x86 this isn't used by default for now because by default
    on 32-bit x86 the separate assembly file crc64_x86.S is used.
    If --disable-assembler is used then this new CLMUL code is used
    the same way as on 64-bit x86. However, a CLMUL-only build
    (-msse4.1 -mpclmul) won't omit the 8 KiB lookup table on
    32-bit x86 due to a currently-missing check for disabled
    assembler usage.
    
    The configure.ac check should be such that the code won't be
    built if something in the toolchain doesn't support it but
    --disable-clmul-crc option can be used to unconditionally
    disable this feature.
    
    CLMUL speeds up decompression of files that have compressed very
    well (assuming CRC64 is used as a check type). It is know that
    the CLMUL code is significantly slower than the generic code for
    tiny inputs (especially 1-8 bytes but up to 16 bytes). If that
    is a real-world problem then there is already a commented-out
    variant that uses the generic version for small inputs.
    
    Thanks to Ilya Kurdyukov for the original patch which was
    derived from a white paper from Intel [1] (published in 2009)
    and public domain code from [2] (released in 2016).

    Build: Omit x86_64 from --enable-assembler.
    
    It didn't do anything. There are only 32-bit x86 assembly files
    and it feels likely that new files won't be added as intrinsics
    in C are more portable across toolchains and OSes.

    liblzma: Use __attribute__((__constructor__)) if available.
    
    This uses it for CRC table initializations when using --disable-small.
    It avoids mythread_once() overhead. It also means that then
    --disable-small --disable-threads is thread-safe if this attribute
    is supported.

    __SSE2__ is the correct macro for SSE2 support with GCC, Clang,
    and ICC. __SSE2_MATH__ means doing floating point math with SSE2
    instead of 387. Often the latter macro is defined if the first
    one is but it was still a bug.

    xz: Add --arm64 to --long-help and omit endianness from ARM(-Thumb).
    
    Modern 32-bit ARM in big endian mode use little endian for
    instruction encoding still, so the filters work on such
    executables too. It's likely less confusing for users this way.
    
    The --arm64 option hasn't been implemented yet (there is
    --experimental-arm64 but it's different). The --arm64 option
    is added now anyway because this is the likely result and the
    strings need to be ready for translators.

    xz: Add .lz (lzip) decompression support.
    
    If configured with --disable-lzip-decoder then --long-help will
    still list `lzip' in --format but I left it like that since
    due to translations it would be messy to have two help strings.
    Features are disabled only in special situations so wrong help
    in such a situation shouldn't matter much.
    
    Thanks to Michał Górny for the original patch.

commit 0538db038f3cdc352007dacb42454aa1806b8e40

Date:   2022-10-06 15:50:20 +0300

    liblzma: Add .lz (lzip) decompression support (format versions 0 and 1).
    
    Support for format version 0 was removed from lzip 1.18 for some
    reason. .lz format version 0 files are rare (and old) but some
    source packages were released in this format, and some people might
    have personal files in this format too. It's very little extra code
    to support it along side format version 1 so this commits adds
    support for both.
    
    The Sync Flush marker extentension to the original .lz format
    version 1 isn't supported. It would require changes to the
    LZMA decoder itself. Such files are very rare anyway.
    
    See the API doc for lzma_lzip_decoder() for more details about
    the .lz format support.
    
    Thanks to Michał Górny for the original patch.

    "xz -v < regular_file > out.xz" doesn't display the percentage

    xz: Fix displaying of file sizes in progress indicator in passthru mode.
    
    It worked for one input file since the counters are zero when
    xz starts but they weren't reset when starting a new file in
    passthru mode. For example, if files A, B, and C are one byte each,
    then "xz -dcvf A B C" would show file sizes as 1, 2, and 3 bytes
    instead of 1, 1, and 1 byte.

    liblzma: Include cached memory in reported memusage in threaded decoder.
    
    This affects lzma_memusage() and lzma_memlimit_set() when used
    with the threaded decompressor. Now all allocations are reported
    by lzma_memusage() (so it's not misleading) and lzma_memlimit_set()
    cannot lower the limit below that value.
    
    The alternative would have been to allow lowering the limit if
    doing so is possible by freeing the cached memory but since
    the primary use case of lzma_memlimit_set() is to increase
    memlimit after LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR this simple approach
    was selected.
    
    The cached memory was always included when enforcing
    the memory usage limit while decoding.
    
    Thanks to Jia Tan.

    Don't call InitOnceComplete() if initialization was already done.
    
    So far mythread_once() has been needed only when building
    with --enable-small. windows/build.bash does this together
    with --disable-threads so the Vista-specific mythread_once()
    is never needed by those builds. VS project files or
    CMake-builds don't support HAVE_SMALL builds at all.

    xz: Fix decompressor behavior if input uses an unsupported check type.
    
    Now files with unsupported check will make xz display
    a warning, set the exit status to 2 (unless --no-warn is used),
    and then decompress the file normally. This is how it was
    supposed to work since the beginning but this was broken by
    the commit 231c3c7098f1099a56abb8afece76fc9b8699f05, that is,
    a little before 5.0.0 was released. The buggy behavior displayed
    a message, set exit status 1 (error), and xz didn't attempt to
    to decompress the file.
    
    This doesn't matter today except for special builds that disable
    CRC64 or SHA-256 at build time (but such builds should be used
    in special situations only). The bug matters if new check type
    is added in the future and an old xz version is used to decompress
    such a file; however, it's likely that such files would use a new
    filter too and an old xz wouldn't be able to decompress the file
    anyway.
    
    The first hunk in the commit is the actual fix. The second hunk
    is a cleanup since LZMA_TELL_ANY_CHECK isn't used in xz.
    
    There is a test file for unsupported check type but it wasn't
    used by test_files.sh, perhaps due to different behavior between
    xz and the simpler xzdec.

    xz: If input file cannot be removed, treat it as a warning, not error.
    
    Treating it as a warning (message + exit status 2) matches gzip
    and it seems more logical as at that point the output file has
    already been successfully closed. When it's a warning it is
    possible to suppress it with --no-warn.

    liblzma: Threaded decoder: Stop the worker threads on errors.
    
    It's waste of CPU time and electricity to leave the unfinished
    worker threads running when it is known that their output will

    tuklib_cpucores: Use HW_NCPUONLINE on OpenBSD.
    
    On OpenBSD the number of cores online is often less
    than what HW_NCPU would return because OpenBSD disables
    simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) by default.
    
    Thanks to Christian Weisgerber.

    Tests: Skip tests in test_*.sh if encoders and/or decoders are disabled.
    
    This isn't perfect as the scripts can still fail if only
    certain filters are disabled. This is still an improvement
    as now "make check" has better behavior when all encoders
    or decoders are disabled.
    
    Grepping ../config.h is simple and fairly clean but it only
    works if config.h was created. CMake builds don't create
    config.h but they don't use these test scripts either.
    
    Thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for reporting the problem.
    Thanks to Jia Tan for the original patch which grepped xz
    error messages instead of config.h.

    Test: Remove the (exit 1) lines.
    
    I suspect that I used these in the original version because
    Autoconf's manual describes that such a trick is needed in
    some specific situations for portability reasons. None of those
    situations listed on Autoconf 2.71 manual apply to these test
    scripts though so this cleans them up.

    LZMA_PROG_ERROR. Now, the validation is similar to
    lzma_index_append, which does a NULL check on the index
    parameter.

    liblzma: Fix copying of check type statistics in lzma_index_cat().
    
    The check type of the last Stream in dest was never copied to
    dest->checks (the code tried to copy it but it was done too late).
    This meant that the value returned by lzma_index_checks() would
    only include the check type of the last Stream when multiple
    lzma_indexes had been concatenated.
    
    In xz --list this meant that the summary would only list the
    check type of the last Stream, so in this sense this was only
    a visual bug. However, it's possible that some applications
    use this information for purposes other than merely showing
    it to the users in an informational message. I'm not aware of
    such applications though and it's quite possible that such
    applications don't exist.
    
    Regular streamed decompression in xz or any other application
    doesn't use lzma_index_cat() and so this bug cannot affect them.

    This test fails before commit 18d7facd3802b55c287581405c4d49c98708c136.
    
    test_files.sh now runs xz -l for bad-3-index-uncomp-overflow.xz
    because only then the previously-buggy code path gets tested.
    Normal decompression doesn't use lzma_index_append() at all.
    Instead, lzma_index_hash functions are used and those already
    did the overflow check.

    xzgrep: Fix compatibility with old shells.
    
    Running the current xzgrep on Slackware 10.1 with GNU bash 3.00.15:
    
        xzgrep: line 231: syntax error near unexpected token `;;'
    
    On SCO OpenServer 5.0.7 with Korn Shell 93r:
    
        syntax error at line 231 : `;;' unexpected
    
    Turns out that some old shells don't like apostrophes (') inside
    command substitutions. For example, the following fails:
    
        x=$(echo foo
        # asdf'zxcv
        echo bar)
        printf '%s\n' "$x"
    
    The problem was introduced by commits
    69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6 (2022-03-29),
    bd7b290f3fe4faeceb7d3497ed9bf2e6ed5e7dc5 (2022-07-18), and
    a648978b20495b7aa4a8b029c5a810b5ad9d08ff (2022-07-19).
    5.2.6 is the only stable release that included
    this problem.
    
    Thanks to Kevin R. Bulgrien for reporting the problem
    on SCO OpenServer 5.0.7 and for providing the fix.

    Tests: Silence warnings about unused functions from tuktest.h.
    
    Warnings about unused tuktest_run_test conveniently tell which
    test programs haven't been converted to tuktest.h yet but I
    silenced that warning too for now anyway.
    
    It is fine to use __attribute__((__unused__)) even when the
    function is actually used because the attribute only means
    that the function might be unused.

    liblzma: lzma_filters_copy: Keep dest[] unmodified if an error occurs.
    
    lzma_stream_encoder() and lzma_stream_encoder_mt() always assumed
    this. Before this patch, failing lzma_filters_copy() could result
    in free(invalid_pointer) or invalid memory reads in stream_encoder.c
    or stream_encoder_mt.c.
    
    To trigger this, allocating memory for a filter options structure
    has to fail. These are tiny allocations so in practice they very
    rarely fail.
    
    Certain badness in the filter chain array could also make
    lzma_filters_copy() fail but both stream_encoder.c and
    stream_encoder_mt.c validate the filter chain before
    trying to copy it, so the crash cannot occur this way.

    liblzma: lzma_index_append: Add missing integer overflow check.
    
    The documentation in src/liblzma/api/lzma/index.h suggests that
    both the unpadded (compressed) size and the uncompressed size
    are checked for overflow, but only the unpadded size was checked.
    The uncompressed check is done first since that is more likely to
    occur than the unpadded or index field size overflows.

    CMake: Update for liblzma_*.map files and fix wrong common_w32res.rc dep.
    
    The previous commit split liblzma.map into liblzma_linux.map and
    liblzma_generic.map. This commit updates the CMake build for those.
    
    common_w32res.rc dependency was listed under Linux/FreeBSD while
    obviously it belongs to Windows when building a DLL.

commit 913ddc5572b9455fa0cf299be2e35c708840e922

    liblzma: Vaccinate against an ill patch from RHEL/CentOS 7.
    
    RHEL/CentOS 7 shipped with 5.1.2alpha, including the threaded
    encoder that is behind #ifdef LZMA_UNSTABLE in the API headers.
    In 5.1.2alpha these symbols are under XZ_5.1.2alpha in liblzma.map.
    API/ABI compatibility tracking isn't done between development
    releases so newer releases didn't have XZ_5.1.2alpha anymore.
    
    Later RHEL/CentOS 7 updated xz to 5.2.2 but they wanted to keep
    the exported symbols compatible with 5.1.2alpha. After checking
    the ABI changes it turned out that >= 5.2.0 ABI is backward
    compatible with the threaded encoder functions from 5.1.2alpha
    (but not vice versa as fixes and extensions to these functions
    were made between 5.1.2alpha and 5.2.0).
    
    In RHEL/CentOS 7, XZ Utils 5.2.2 was patched with
    xz-5.2.2-compat-libs.patch to modify liblzma.map:
    
      - XZ_5.1.2alpha was added with lzma_stream_encoder_mt and
        lzma_stream_encoder_mt_memusage. This matched XZ Utils 5.1.2alpha.
    
      - XZ_5.2 was replaced with XZ_5.2.2. It is clear that this was
        an error; the intention was to keep using XZ_5.2 (XZ_5.2.2
        has never been used in XZ Utils). So XZ_5.2.2 lists all
        symbols that were listed under XZ_5.2 before the patch.
        lzma_stream_encoder_mt and _mt_memusage are included too so
        they are listed both here and under XZ_5.1.2alpha.
    
    The patch didn't add any __asm__(".symver ...") lines to the .c
    files. Thus the resulting liblzma.so exports the threaded encoder
    functions under XZ_5.1.2alpha only. Listing the two functions
    also under XZ_5.2.2 in liblzma.map has no effect without
    matching .symver lines.
    
    The lack of XZ_5.2 in RHEL/CentOS 7 means that binaries linked
    against unpatched XZ Utils 5.2.x won't run on RHEL/CentOS 7.
    This is unfortunate but this alone isn't too bad as the problem
    is contained within RHEL/CentOS 7 and doesn't affect users
    of other distributions. It could also be fixed internally in
    RHEL/CentOS 7.
    
    The second problem is more serious: In XZ Utils 5.2.2 the API
    headers don't have #ifdef LZMA_UNSTABLE for obvious reasons.
    This is true in RHEL/CentOS 7 version too. Thus now programs
    using new APIs can be compiled without an extra #define. However,
    the programs end up depending on symbol version XZ_5.1.2alpha
    (and possibly also XZ_5.2.2) instead of XZ_5.2 as they would
    with an unpatched XZ Utils 5.2.2. This means that such binaries
    won't run on other distributions shipping XZ Utils >= 5.2.0 as
    they don't provide XZ_5.1.2alpha or XZ_5.2.2; they only provide
    XZ_5.2 (and XZ_5.0). (This includes RHEL/CentOS 8 as the patch
    luckily isn't included there anymore with XZ Utils 5.2.4.)
    
    Binaries built by RHEL/CentOS 7 users get distributed and then
    people wonder why they don't run on some other distribution.
    Seems that people have found out about the patch and been copying
    it to some build scripts, seemingly curing the symptoms but
    actually spreading the illness further and outside RHEL/CentOS 7.
    
    The ill patch seems to be from late 2016 (RHEL 7.3) and in 2017 it
    had spread at least to EasyBuild. I heard about the events only
    recently. :-(
    
    This commit splits liblzma.map into two versions: one for
    GNU/Linux and another for other OSes that can use symbol versioning
    (FreeBSD, Solaris, maybe others). The Linux-specific file and the
    matching additions to .c files add full compatibility with binaries
    that have been built against a RHEL/CentOS-patched liblzma. Builds
    for OSes other than GNU/Linux won't get the vaccine as they should
    be immune to the problem (I really hope that no build script uses
    the RHEL/CentOS 7 patch outside GNU/Linux).
    
    The RHEL/CentOS compatibility symbols XZ_5.1.2alpha and XZ_5.2.2
    are intentionally put *after* XZ_5.2 in liblzma_linux.map. This way
    if one forgets to #define HAVE_SYMBOL_VERSIONS_LINUX when building,
    the resulting liblzma.so.5 will have lzma_stream_encoder_mt@@XZ_5.2
    since XZ_5.2 {...} is the first one that lists that function.
    Without HAVE_SYMBOL_VERSIONS_LINUX @XZ_5.1.2alpha and @XZ_5.2.2
    will be missing but that's still a minor problem compared to
    only having lzma_stream_encoder_mt@@XZ_5.1.2alpha!
    
    The "local: *;" line was moved to XZ_5.0 so that it doesn't need
    to be moved around. It doesn't matter where it is put.
    
    Having two similar liblzma_*.map files is a bit silly as it is,
    at least for now, easily possible to generate the generic one
    from the Linux-specific file. But that adds extra steps and
    increases the risk of mistakes when supporting more than one
    build system. So I rather maintain two files in parallel and let
    validate_map.sh check that they are in sync when "make mydist"
    is run.
    
    This adds .symver lines for lzma_stream_encoder_mt@XZ_5.2.2 and
    lzma_stream_encoder_mt_memusage@XZ_5.2.2 even though these
    weren't exported by RHEL/CentOS 7 (only @@XZ_5.1.2alpha was
    for these two). I added these anyway because someone might
    misunderstand the RHEL/CentOS 7 patch and think that @XZ_5.2.2
    (@@XZ_5.2.2) versions were exported too.
    
    At glance one could suggest using __typeof__ to copy the function
    prototypes when making aliases. However, this doesn't work trivially
    because __typeof__ won't copy attributes (lzma_nothrow, lzma_pure)
    and it won't change symbol visibility from hidden to default (done
    by LZMA_API()). Attributes could be copied with __copy__ attribute
    but that needs GCC 9 and a fallback method would be needed anyway.
    
    This uses __symver__ attribute with GCC >= 10 and
    __asm__(".symver ...") with everything else. The attribute method
    is required for LTO (-flto) support with GCC. Using -flto with
    GCC older than 10 is now broken on GNU/Linux and will not be fixed
    (can silently result in a broken liblzma build that has dangerously
    incorrect symbol versions). LTO builds with Clang seem to work
    with the traditional __asm__(".symver ...") method.
    
    Thanks to Boud Roukema for reporting the problem and discussing
    the details and testing the fix.

    Windows: Fix broken liblzma.dll build with Visual Studio project files.
    
    The bug was introduced in 352ba2d69af2136bc814aa1df1a132559d445616
    "Windows: Fix building of resource files when config.h isn't used."
    
    That commit fixed liblzma.dll build with CMake while keeping it
    working with Autotools on Windows but the VS project files were
    forgotten.
    
    I haven't tested these changes.
    
    Thanks to Olivier B. for reporting the bug and for the initial patch.

    liblzma: Threaded decoder: Improve LZMA_FAIL_FAST when LZMA_FINISH is used.
    
    It will now return LZMA_DATA_ERROR (not LZMA_OK or LZMA_BUF_ERROR)
    if LZMA_FINISH is used and there isn't enough input to finish
    decoding the Block Header or the Block. The use of LZMA_DATA_ERROR
    is simpler and the less risky than LZMA_BUF_ERROR but this might
    be changed before 5.4.0.

    xzgrep: Improve error handling, especially signals.
    
    xzgrep wouldn't exit on SIGPIPE or SIGQUIT when it clearly
    should have. It's quite possible that it's not perfect still
    but at least it's much better.
    
    If multiple exit statuses compete, now it tries to pick
    the largest of value.
    
    Some comments were added.
    
    The exit status handling of signals is still broken if the shell
    uses values larger than 255 in $? to indicate that a process
    died due to a signal ***and*** their "exit" command doesn't take
    this into account. This seems to work well with the ksh and yash
    versions I tried. However, there is a report in gzip/zgrep that
    OpenSolaris 5.11 (not 5.10) has a problem with "exit" truncating
    the argument to 8 bits:
    
        https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=22900#25
    
    Such a bug would break xzgrep but I didn't add a workaround
    at least for now. 5.11 is old and I don't know if the problem
    exists in modern descendants, or if the problem exists in other
    ksh implementations in use.

    xzgrep: Make the fix for ZDI-CAN-16587 more robust.
    
    I don't know if this can make a difference in the real world
    but it looked kind of suspicious (what happens with sed
    implementations that cannot process very long lines?).
    At least this commit shouldn't make it worse.

commit bd7b290f3fe4faeceb7d3497ed9bf2e6ed5e7dc5
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2022-07-18 21:52:31 +0300

    xzgrep: Use grep -H --label when available (GNU, *BSDs).
    
    It avoids the use of sed for prefixing filenames to output lines.
    Using sed for that is slower and prone to security bugs so now
    the sed method is only used as a fallback.
    
    This also fixes an actual bug: When grepping a binary file,
    GNU grep nowadays prints its diagnostics to stderr instead of
    stdout and thus the sed-method for prefixing the filename doesn't
    work. So with this commit grepping binary files gives reasonable
    output with GNU grep now.
    
    This was inspired by zgrep but the implementation is different.

commit 6a4a4a7d2667837dc824c26fcb19ed6ca5aff645
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2022-07-17 21:36:25 +0300

    xzgrep: Add more LC_ALL=C to avoid bugs with multibyte characters.
    
    Also replace one use of expr with printf.
    
    The rationale for LC_ALL=C was already mentioned in
    69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6 that fixed a security
    issue. However, unrelated uses weren't changed in that commit yet.
    
    POSIX says that with sed and such tools one should use LC_ALL=C
    to ensure predictable behavior when strings contain byte sequences
    that aren't valid multibyte characters in the current locale. See
    under "Application usage" in here:
    
    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html
    
    With GNU sed invalid multibyte strings would work without this;
    it's documented in its Texinfo manual. Some other implementations
    aren't so forgiving.

    xzgrep: Fix parsing of certain options.
    
    Fix handling of "xzgrep -25 foo" (in GNU grep "grep -25 foo" is
    an alias for "grep -C25 foo"). xzgrep would treat "foo" as filename
    instead of as a pattern. This bug was fixed in zgrep in gzip in 2012.
    
    Add -E, -F, -G, and -P to the "no argument required" list.
    
    Add -X to "argument required" list. It is an
    intentionally-undocumented GNU grep option so this isn't
    an important option for xzgrep but it seems that other grep
    implementations (well, those that I checked) don't support -X
    so I hope this change is an improvement still.
    
    grep -d (grep --directories=ACTION) requires an argument. In
    contrast to zgrep, I kept -d in the "no argument required" list
    because it's not supported in xzgrep (or zgrep). This way
    "xzgrep -d" gives an error about option being unsupported instead
    of telling that it requires an argument. Both zgrep and xzgrep
    tell that it's unsupported if an argument is specified.
    
    Add comments.

    liblzma: Add optional autodetection of LZMA end marker.
    
    Turns out that this is needed for .lzma files as the spec in
    LZMA SDK says that end marker may be present even if the size
    is stored in the header. Such files are rare but exist in the
    real world. The code in liblzma is so old that the spec didn't
    exist in LZMA SDK back then and I had understood that such
    files weren't possible (the lzma tool in LZMA SDK didn't
    create such files).
    
    This modifies the internal API so that LZMA decoder can be told
    if EOPM is allowed even when the uncompressed size is known.
    It's allowed with .lzma and not with other uses.
    
    Thanks to Karl Beldan for reporting the problem.

    Tests: Created tests for hardware functions.
    
    Created tests for all API functions exported in
    src/liblzma/api/lzma/hardware.h. The tests are fairly trivial
    but are helpful because they will inform users if their machines
    cannot support these functions. They also improve the code
    coverage metrics.

    Build: Enable Automake's parallel test harness.
    
    It has been the default for quite some time already and
    the old serial harness isn't discouraged. The downside is
    that with parallel tests one cannot print progress info or
    other diagnostics to the terminal; all output from the tests
    will be in the log files only. But now that the compression
    tests are separated the parallel tests will speed things up.

    Tests: Split test_compress.sh into separate test unit for each file.
    
    test_compress.sh now takes one command line argument:
    a filename to be tested. If it begins with "compress_generated_"
    the file will be created with create_compress_files.
    
    This will allow parallel execution of the slow tests.

    If a command line argument is given, then only the test file
    of that type is created. It's quite dumb in sense that unknown

    The SIZE_MAX / 3 was 1365 MiB. 1400 MiB gives little more room
    and it looks like a round (artificial) number in --info-memory

    xz: Add a default soft memory usage limit for --threads=0.
    
    This is a soft limit in sense that it only affects the number of
    threads. It never makes xz fail and it never makes xz change
    settings that would affect the compressed output.
    
    The idea is to make -T0 have more reasonable behavior when
    the system has very many cores or when a memory-hungry
    compression options are used. This also helps with 32-bit xz,
    preventing it from running out of address space.
    
    The downside of this commit is that now the number of threads
    might become too low compared to what the user expected. I
    hope this to be an acceptable compromise as the old behavior
    has been a source of well-argued complaints for a long time.

    xz: Make -T0 use multithreaded mode on single-core systems.
    
    The main problem withi the old behavior is that the compressed
    output is different on single-core systems vs. multicore systems.
    This commit fixes it by making -T0 one thread in multithreaded mode
    on single-core systems.
    
    The downside of this is that it uses more memory. However, if
    --memlimit-compress is used, xz can (thanks to the previous commit)
    drop to the single-threaded mode still.

    xz: Changes to --memlimit-compress and --no-adjust.
    
    In single-threaded mode, --memlimit-compress can make xz scale down
    the LZMA2 dictionary size to meet the memory usage limit. This
    obviously affects the compressed output. However, if xz was in
    threaded mode, --memlimit-compress could make xz reduce the number
    of threads but it wouldn't make xz switch from multithreaded mode
    to single-threaded mode or scale down the LZMA2 dictionary size.
    This seemed illogical and there was even a "FIXME?" about it.
    
    Now --memlimit-compress can make xz switch to single-threaded
    mode if one thread in multithreaded mode uses too much memory.
    If memory usage is still too high, then the LZMA2 dictionary
    size can be scaled down too.
    
    The option --no-adjust was also changed so that it no longer
    prevents xz from scaling down the number of threads as that
    doesn't affect compressed output (only performance). After
    this commit --no-adjust only prevents adjustments that affect
    compressed output, that is, with --no-adjust xz won't switch
    from multithreaded mode to single-threaded mode and won't
    scale down the LZMA2 dictionary size.

    xz: Add --memlimit-mt-decompress along with a default limit value.
    
    --memlimit-mt-decompress allows specifying the limit for
    multithreaded decompression. This matches memlimit_threading in
    liblzma. This limit can only affect the number of threads being
    used; it will never prevent xz from decompressing a file. The
    old --memlimit-decompress option is still used at the same time.
    
    If the value of --memlimit-decompress (the default value or
    one specified by the user) is less than the value of
    --memlimit-mt-decompress , then --memlimit-mt-decompress is
    reduced to match --memlimit-decompress.

    In most cases if the input file is corrupt the application won't
    care about the uncompressed content at all. With this new flag
    the threaded decoder will return an error as soon as any thread
    has detected an error; it won't wait to copy out the data before
    the location of the error.
    
    I don't plan to use this in xz to keep the behavior consistent
    between single-threaded and multi-threaded modes.

    liblzma: Threaded decoder: Support zpipe.c-style decoding loop.
    
    This makes it possible to call lzma_code() in a loop that only
    reads new input when lzma_code() didn't fill the output buffer
    completely. That isn't the calling style suggested by the
    liblzma example program 02_decompress.c so perhaps the usefulness
    of this feature is limited.
    
    Also, it is possible to write such a loop so that it works
    with the single-threaded decoder but not with the threaded
    decoder even after this commit, or so that it works only if
    lzma_mt.timeout = 0.
    
    The zlib tutorial <https://zlib.net/zlib_how.html> is a well-known
    example of a loop where more input is read only when output isn't
    full. Porting this as is to liblzma would work with the
    single-threaded decoder (if LZMA_CONCATENATED isn't used) but it
    wouldn't work with threaded decoder even after this commit because
    the loop assumes that no more output is possible when it cannot
    read more input ("if (strm.avail_in == 0) break;"). This cannot
    be fixed at liblzma side; the loop has to be modified at least
    a little.
    
    I'm adding this in any case because the actual code is simple
    and short and should have no harmful side-effects in other
    situations.

    xzgrep: Fix escaping of malicious filenames (ZDI-CAN-16587).
    
    Malicious filenames can make xzgrep to write to arbitrary files
    or (with a GNU sed extension) lead to arbitrary code execution.
    
    xzgrep from XZ Utils versions up to and including 5.2.5 are
    affected. 5.3.1alpha and 5.3.2alpha are affected as well.
    This patch works for all of them.
    
    This bug was inherited from gzip's zgrep. gzip 1.12 includes
    a fix for zgrep.
    
    The issue with the old sed script is that with multiple newlines,
    the N-command will read the second line of input, then the
    s-commands will be skipped because it's not the end of the
    file yet, then a new sed cycle starts and the pattern space
    is printed and emptied. So only the last line or two get escaped.
    
    One way to fix this would be to read all lines into the pattern
    space first. However, the included fix is even simpler: All lines
    except the last line get a backslash appended at the end. To ensure
    that shell command substitution doesn't eat a possible trailing
    newline, a colon is appended to the filename before escaping.
    The colon is later used to separate the filename from the grep
    output so it is fine to add it here instead of a few lines later.
    
    The old code also wasn't POSIX compliant as it used \n in the
    replacement section of the s-command. Using \<newline> is the
    POSIX compatible method.
    
    LC_ALL=C was added to the two critical sed commands. POSIX sed
    manual recommends it when using sed to manipulate pathnames
    because in other locales invalid multibyte sequences might
    cause issues with some sed implementations. In case of GNU sed,
    these particular sed scripts wouldn't have such problems but some
    other scripts could have, see:
    
        info '(sed)Locale Considerations'
    
    This vulnerability was discovered by:
    cleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
    
    Thanks to Jim Meyering and Paul Eggert discussing the different
    ways to fix this and for coordinating the patch release schedule
    with gzip.

    liblzma: Fix a deadlock in threaded decoder.
    
    If a worker thread has consumed all input so far and it's
    waiting on thr->cond and then the main thread enables
    partial update for that thread, the code used to deadlock.
    This commit allows one dummy decoding pass to occur in this
    situation which then also does the partial update.
    
    As part of the fix, this moves thr->progress_* updates to
    avoid the second thr->mutex locking.

    xz: Add initial support for threaded decompression.
    
    If threading support is enabled at build time, this will
    use lzma_stream_decoder_mt() even for single-threaded mode.
    With memlimit_threading=0 the behavior should be identical.
    
    This needs some work like adding --memlimit-threading=LIMIT.
    
    The original patch from Sebastian Andrzej Siewior included
    a method to get currently available RAM on Linux. It might
    be one way to go but as it is Linux-only, the available-RAM
    approach needs work for portability or using a fallback method
    on other OSes.

    liblzma: Add threaded .xz decompressor.
    
    I realize that this is about a decade late.
    
    Big thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the original patch.
    I made a bunch of smaller changes but after a while quite a few
    things got rewritten. So any bugs in the commit were created by me.

    liblzma: Fix docs: lzma_block_decoder() cannot return LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK.
    
    If Check is unsupported, it will be silently ignored.

    liblzma: Add new output queue (lzma_outq) features.
    
    Add lzma_outq_clear_cache2() which may leave one buffer allocated
    in the cache.
    
    Add lzma_outq_outbuf_memusage() to get the memory needed for
    a single lzma_outbuf. This is now used internally in outqueue.c too.
    
    Track both the total amount of memory allocated and the amount of
    memory that is in active use (not in cache).
    
    In lzma_outbuf, allow storing the current input position that
    matches the current output position. This way the main thread
    can notice when no more output is possible without first providing
    more input.
    
    Allow specifying return code for lzma_outq_read() in a finished
    lzma_outbuf.

    liblzma: Check the return value of lzma_index_append() in threaded encoder.
    
    If lzma_index_append() failed (most likely memory allocation failure)
    it could have gone unnoticed and the resulting .xz file would have
    an incorrect Index. Decompressing such a file would produce the
    correct uncompressed data but then an error would occur when
    verifying the Index field.

    liblzma: Make Block decoder catch certain types of errors better.
    
    Now it limits the input and output buffer sizes that are
    passed to a raw decoder. This way there's no need to check
    if the sizes can grow too big or overflow when updating
    Compressed Size and Uncompressed Size counts. This also means
    that a corrupt file cannot cause the raw decoder to process
    useless extra input or output that would exceed the size info
    in Block Header (and thus cause LZMA_DATA_ERROR anyway).
    
    More importantly, now the size information is verified more
    carefully in case raw decoder returns LZMA_OK. This doesn't
    really matter with the current single-threaded .xz decoder
    as the errors would be detected slightly later anyway. But
    this helps avoiding corner cases in the upcoming threaded
    decompressor, and it might help other Block decoder uses
    outside liblzma too.
    
    The test files bad-1-lzma2-{9,10,11}.xz test these conditions.
    With the single-threaded .xz decoder the only difference is
    that LZMA_DATA_ERROR is detected in a difference place now.

    Reduce maximum possible memory limit on MIPS32
    
    Due to architectural limitations, address space available to a single
    userspace process on MIPS32 is limited to 2 GiB, not 4, even on systems
    that have more physical RAM -- e.g. 64-bit systems with 32-bit
    userspace, or systems that use XPA (an extension similar to x86's PAE).
    
    So, for MIPS32, we have to impose stronger memory limits. I've chosen
    2000MiB to give the process some headroom.

commit a61dd82ada39030f41b4ffca9ea551714908bedc
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>

    CMake: Try to improve compatibility with the FindLibLZMA module.
    
    The naming conflict with FindLibLZMA module gets worse.
    Not avoiding it in the first place was stupid.
    
    Normally find_package(LibLZMA) will use the module and
    find_package(liblzma 5.2.5 REQUIRED CONFIG) will use the config
    file even with a case insensitive file system. However, if
    CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG is TRUE and the file system
    is case insensitive, find_package(LibLZMA) will find our liblzma
    config file instead of using FindLibLZMA module.
    
    One big problem with this is that FindLibLZMA uses
    LibLZMA::LibLZMA and we use liblzma::liblzma as the target
    name. With target names CMake happens to be case sensitive.
    To workaround this, this commit adds
    
        add_library(LibLZMA::LibLZMA ALIAS liblzma::liblzma)
    
    to the config file. Then both spellings work.
    
    To make the behavior consistent between case sensitive and
    insensitive file systems, the config and related files are
    renamed from liblzmaConfig.cmake to liblzma-config.cmake style.
    With this style CMake looks for lowercase version of the package
    name so find_package(LiBLzmA 5.2.5 REQUIRED CONFIG) will work
    to find our config file.
    
    There are other differences between our config file and
    FindLibLZMA so it's still possible that things break for
    reasons other than the spelling of the target name. Hopefully
    those situations aren't too common.
    
    When the config file is available, it should always give as good or
    better results as FindLibLZMA so this commit doesn't affect the
    recommendation to use find_package(liblzma 5.2.5 REQUIRED CONFIG)
    which explicitly avoids FindLibLZMA.
    
    Thanks to Markus Rickert.

    liblzma: In EROFS LZMA decoder, verify that comp_size matches at the end.
    
    When the uncompressed size is known to be exact, after decompressing
    the stream exactly comp_size bytes of input must have been consumed.
    This is a minor improvement to error detection.

    liblzma: Make EROFS LZMA decoder work when exact uncomp_size isn't known.
    
    The caller must still not specify an uncompressed size bigger
    than the actual uncompressed size.
    
    As a downside, this now needs the exact compressed size.

    liblzma: Add EROFS LZMA encoder and decoder.
    
    Right now this is just a planned extra-compact format for use
    in the EROFS file system in Linux. At this point it's possible
    that the format will either change or be abandoned and removed
    completely.
    
    The special thing about the encoder is that it uses the
    output-size-limited encoding added in the previous commit.
    EROFS uses fixed-sized blocks (e.g. 4 KiB) to hold compressed
    data so the compressors must be able to create valid streams
    that fill the given block size.

commit 625f4c7c99b2fcc4db9e7ab2deb4884790e2e17c
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2021-01-13 19:16:32 +0200

    liblzma: Add rough support for output-size-limited encoding in LZMA1.
    
    With this it is possible to encode LZMA1 data without EOPM so that
    the encoder will encode as much input as it can without exceeding
    the specified output size limit. The resulting LZMA1 stream will
    be a normal LZMA1 stream without EOPM. The actual uncompressed size
    will be available to the caller via the uncomp_size pointer.
    
    One missing thing is that the LZMA layer doesn't inform the LZ layer
    when the encoding is finished and thus the LZ may read more input
    when it won't be used. However, this doesn't matter if encoding is
    done with a single call (which is the planned use case for now).
    For proper multi-call encoding this should be improved.
    
    This commit only adds the functionality for internal use.
    Nothing uses it yet.

    xz: Make --keep accept symlinks, hardlinks, and setuid/setgid/sticky.
    
    Previously this required using --force but that has other
    effects too which might be undesirable. Changing the behavior
    of --keep has a small risk of breaking existing scripts but
    since this is a fairly special corner case I expect the
    likehood of breakage to be low enough.
    
    I think the new behavior is more logical. The only reason for
    the old behavior was to be consistent with gzip and bzip2.

    Scripts: Fix exit status of xzgrep.
    
    Omit the -q option from xz, gzip, and bzip2. With xz this shouldn't
    matter. With gzip it's important because -q makes gzip replace SIGPIPE
    with exit status 2. With bzip2 it's important because with -q bzip2
    is completely silent if input is corrupt while other decompressors
    still give an error message.
    
    Avoiding exit status 2 from gzip is important because bzip2 uses
    exit status 2 to indicate corrupt input. Before this commit xzgrep
    didn't recognize corrupt .bz2 files because xzgrep was treating
    exit status 2 as SIGPIPE for gzip compatibility.
    
    zstd still needs -q because otherwise it is noisy in normal
    operation.
    
    The code to detect real SIGPIPE didn't check if the exit status
    was due to a signal (>= 128) and so could ignore some other exit
    status too.

commit 194029ffaf74282a81f0c299c07f73caca3232ca
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2021-01-11 22:01:51 +0200

    Scripts: Fix exit status of xzdiff/xzcmp.
    
    This is a minor fix since this affects only the situation when
    the files differ and the exit status is something else than 0.
    In such case there could be SIGPIPE from a decompression tool
    and that would result in exit status of 2 from xzdiff/xzcmp
    while the correct behavior would be to return 1 or whatever
    else diff or cmp may have returned.
    
    This commit omits the -q option from xz/gzip/bzip2/lzop arguments.
    I'm not sure why the -q was used in the first place, perhaps it
    hides warnings in some situation that I cannot see at the moment.
    Hopefully the removal won't introduce a new bug.
    
    With gzip the -q option was harmful because it made gzip return 2
    instead of >= 128 with SIGPIPE. Ignoring exit status 2 (warning
    from gzip) isn't practical because bzip2 uses exit status 2 to
    indicate corrupt input file. It's better if SIGPIPE results in
    exit status >= 128.
    
    With bzip2 the removal of -q seems to be good because with -q
    it prints nothing if input is corrupt. The other tools aren't
    silent in this situation even with -q. On the other hand, if
    zstd support is added, it will need -q since otherwise it's
    noisy in normal situations.
    
    Thanks to Étienne Mollier and Sebastian Andrzej Siewior.

    liblzma: Make lzma_outq usable for threaded decompression too.
    
    Before this commit all output queue buffers were allocated as
    a single big allocation. Now each buffer is allocated separately
    when needed. Used buffers are cached to avoid reallocation
    overhead but the cache will keep only one buffer size at a time.
    This should make things work OK in the decompression where most
    of the time the buffer sizes will be the same but with some less
    common files the buffer sizes may vary.
    
    While this should work fine, it's still a bit preliminary
    and may even get reverted if it turns out to be useless for
    decompression.

    xz: Never use thousand separators in DJGPP builds.
    
    DJGPP 2.05 added support for thousands separators but it's
    broken at least under WinXP with Finnish locale that uses
    a non-breaking space as the thousands separator. Workaround
    by disabling thousands separators for DJGPP builds.

    Build: Fix bugs in the CMake files.
    
    Seems that the phrase "add more quotes" from sh/bash scripting
    applies to CMake as well. E.g. passing an unquoted list ${FOO}
    to a function that expects one argument results in only the
    first element of the list being passed as an argument and
    the rest get ignored. Adding quotes helps ("${FOO}").
    
    list(INSERT ...) is weird. Inserting an empty string to an empty
    variable results in empty list, but inserting it to a non-empty
    variable does insert an empty element to the list.
    
    Since INSERT requires at least one element,
    "${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}" needs to be quoted in CMakeLists.txt.
    It might result in an empty element in the list. It seems to not
    matter as empty elements consistently get ignored in that variable.
    In fact, calling cmake_check_push_state() and cmake_check_pop_state()
    will strip the empty elements from CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES!
    
    In addition to quoting fixes, this fixes checks for the cache
    variables in tuklib_cpucores.cmake and tuklib_physmem.cmake.
    
    Thanks to Martin Matuška for testing and reporting the problems.
    These fixes aren't tested yet but hopefully they soon will be.

    Build: Add very limited experimental CMake support.
    
    This does *NOT* replace the Autotools-based build system in
    the foreseeable future. See the comment in the beginning
    of CMakeLists.txt.
    
    So far this has been tested only on GNU/Linux but I commit
    it anyway to make it easier for others to test. Since I
    haven't played much with CMake before, it's likely that
    there are things that have been done in a silly or wrong
    way and need to be fixed.

    There is no specific reason for this other than blocking

    Autoconf 2.69 (2012)

    Build: Use AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION and require 0.19.6.
    
    This bumps the version requirement from 0.19 (from 2014) to
    0.19.6 (2015).
    
    Using only the old AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION results in old
    gettext infrastructure being placed in the package. By using
    both macros we get the latest gettext files while the other
    programs in the Autotools family can still see the old macro.

    Build: Add support for translated man pages using po4a.
    
    The dependency on po4a is optional. It's never required to install
    the translated man pages when xz is built from a release tarball.
    If po4a is missing when building from xz.git, the translated man
    pages won't be generated but otherwise the build will work normally.
    
    The translations are only updated automatically by autogen.sh and
    by "make mydist". This makes it easy to keep po4a as an optional
    dependency and ensures that I won't forget to put updated
    translations to a release tarball.
    
    The translated man pages aren't installed if --disable-nls is used.
    
    The installation of translated man pages abuses Automake internals
    by calling "install-man" with redefined dist_man_MANS and man_MANS.
    This makes the hairy script code slightly less hairy. If it breaks
    some day, this code needs to be fixed; don't blame Automake developers.
    
    Also, this adds more quotes to the existing shell script code in
    the Makefile.am "-hook"s.

    I don't know if the problem is in gnulib's gl_POSIX_SHELL macro
    or if xzgrep does something that isn't in POSIX. The workaround
    adds a special case for Solaris: if /usr/xpg4/bin/sh exists and
    gl_cv_posix_shell wasn't overriden on the configure command line,
    use that shell for xzgrep and other scripts. That shell is known
    to work and exists on most Solaris systems.

    xz: Limit --memlimit-compress to at most 4020 MiB for 32-bit xz.
    
    See the code comment for reasoning. It's far from perfect but
    hopefully good enough for certain cases while hopefully doing
    nothing bad in other situations.
    
    At presets -5 ... -9, 4020 MiB vs. 4096 MiB makes no difference
    on how xz scales down the number of threads.
    
    The limit has to be a few MiB below 4096 MiB because otherwise
    things like "xz --lzma2=dict=500MiB" won't scale down the dict
    size enough and xz cannot allocate enough memory. With
    "ulimit -v $((4096 * 1024))" on x86-64, the limit in xz had
    to be no more than 4085 MiB. Some safety margin is good though.
    
    This is hack but it should be useful when running 32-bit xz on
    a 64-bit kernel that gives full 4 GiB address space to xz.
    Hopefully this is enough to solve this:
    
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1196786
    
    FreeBSD has a patch that limits the result in tuklib_physmem()
    to SIZE_MAX on 32-bit systems. While I think it's not the way
    to do it, the results on --memlimit-compress have been good. This
    commit should achieve practically identical results for compression
    while leaving decompression and tuklib_physmem() and thus
    lzma_physmem() unaffected.

    xz: Set the --flush-timeout deadline when the first input byte arrives.
    
    xz --flush-timeout=2000, old version:
    
      1. xz is started. The next flush will happen after two seconds.
      2. No input for one second.
      3. A burst of a few kilobytes of input.
      4. No input for one second.
      5. Two seconds have passed and flushing starts.
    
    The first second counted towards the flush-timeout even though
    there was no pending data. This can cause flushing to occur more
    often than needed.
    
    xz --flush-timeout=2000, after this commit:
    
      1. xz is started.
      2. No input for one second.
      3. A burst of a few kilobytes of input. The next flush will
         happen after two seconds counted from the time when the
         first bytes of the burst were read.
      4. No input for one second.
      5. No input for another second.
      6. Two seconds have passed and flushing starts.

    xz: coder.c: Make writing output a separate function.
    
    The same code sequence repeats so it's nicer as a separate function.
    Note that in one case there was no test for opt_mode != MODE_TEST,
    but that was only because that condition would always be true, so
    this commit doesn't change the behavior there.

    xz: Fix semi-busy-waiting in xz --flush-timeout.
    
    When input blocked, xz --flush-timeout=1 would wake up every
    millisecond and initiate flushing which would have nothing to
    flush and thus would just waste CPU time. The fix disables the
    timeout when no input has been seen since the previous flush.

    Rename read32ne to aligned_read32ne, and similarly for the others.
    
    Using the aligned methods requires more care to ensure that
    the address really is aligned, so it's nicer if the aligned
    methods are prefixed. The next commit will remove the unaligned_
    prefix from the unaligned methods which in liblzma are used in
    more places than the aligned ones.

    Revise tuklib_integer.h and .m4.
    
    Add a configure option --enable-unsafe-type-punning to get the
    old non-conforming memory access methods. It can be useful with
    old compilers or in some other less typical situations but
    shouldn't normally be used.
    
    Omit the packed struct trick for unaligned access. While it's
    best in some cases, this is simpler. If the memcpy trick doesn't
    work, one can request unsafe type punning from configure.
    
    Because CRC32/CRC64 code needs fast aligned reads, if no very
    safe way to do it is found, type punning is used as a fallback.
    This sucks but since it currently works in practice, it seems to
    be the least bad option. It's never needed with GCC >= 4.7 or
    Clang >= 3.6 since these support __builtin_assume_aligned and
    thus fast aligned access can be done with the memcpy trick.
    
    Other things:
      - Support GCC/Clang __builtin_bswapXX
      - Cleaner bswap fallback macros
      - Minor cleanups

    This adds a configure option --enable-path-for-scripts=PREFIX
    which defaults to empty except on Solaris it is /usr/xpg4/bin
    to make POSIX grep and others available. The Solaris case had
    been documented in INSTALL with a manual fix but it's better
    to do this automatically since it is needed on most Solaris
    systems anyway.

    Add LZMA_RET_INTERNAL1..8 to lzma_ret and use one for LZMA_TIMED_OUT.
    
    LZMA_TIMED_OUT is *internally* used as a value for lzma_ret
    enumeration. Previously it was #defined to 32 and cast to lzma_ret.
    That way it wasn't visible in the public API, but this was hackish.
    
    Now the public API has eight LZMA_RET_INTERNALx members and
    LZMA_TIMED_OUT is #defined to LZMA_RET_INTERNAL1. This way
    the code is cleaner overall although the public API has a few
    extra mysterious enum members.

    tuklib_integer: Improve unaligned memory access.
    
    Now memcpy() or GNU C packed structs for unaligned access instead
    of type punning. See the comment in this commit for details.
    
    Avoiding type punning with unaligned access is needed to
    silence gcc -fsanitize=undefined.
    
    New functions: unaliged_readXXne and unaligned_writeXXne where
    XX is 16, 32, or 64.

commit 2a22de439ec63da1927b640eda309296a1e8dce5
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2019-05-13 20:05:17 +0300

    liblzma: Avoid memcpy(NULL, foo, 0) because it is undefined behavior.
    
    I should have always known this but I didn't. Here is an example
    as a reminder to myself:
    
        int mycopy(void *dest, void *src, size_t n)
        {
            memcpy(dest, src, n);
            return dest == NULL;
        }
    
    In the example, a compiler may assume that dest != NULL because
    passing NULL to memcpy() would be undefined behavior. Testing
    with GCC 8.2.1, mycopy(NULL, NULL, 0) returns 1 with -O0 and -O1.
    With -O2 the return value is 0 because the compiler infers that
    dest cannot be NULL because it was already used with memcpy()
    and thus the test for NULL gets optimized out.
    
    In liblzma, if a null-pointer was passed to memcpy(), there were
    no checks for NULL *after* the memcpy() call, so I cautiously
    suspect that it shouldn't have caused bad behavior in practice,
    but it's hard to be sure, and the problematic cases had to be
    fixed anyway.
    
    Thanks to Jeffrey Walton.

    Windows/VS2017: Omit WindowsTargetPlatformVersion from project files.
    
    I understood that if a WTPV is specified, it's often wrong
    because different VS installations have different SDK version
    installed. Omitting the WTPV tag makes VS2017 default to
    Windows SDK 8.1 which often is also missing, so in any case
    people may need to specify the WTPV before building. But some
    day in the future a missing WTPV tag will start to default to
    the latest installed SDK which sounds reasonable:

    xz: Fix a crash in progress indicator when in passthru mode.
    
    "xz -dcfv not_an_xz_file" crashed (all four options are
    required to trigger it). It caused xz to call
    lzma_get_progress(&strm, ...) when no coder was initialized
    in strm. In this situation strm.internal is NULL which leads
    to a crash in lzma_get_progress().
    
    The bug was introduced when xz started using lzma_get_progress()
    to get progress info for multi-threaded compression, so the
    bug is present in versions 5.1.3alpha and higher.
    
    Thanks to Filip Palian <Filip.Palian@pjwstk.edu.pl> for
    the bug report.

    liblzma: Don't verify header CRC32s if building for fuzz testing.
    
    FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION is #defined when liblzma
    is being built for fuzz testing.
    
    Most fuzzed inputs would normally get rejected because of incorrect
    CRC32 and the actual header decoding code wouldn't get fuzzed.
    Disabling CRC32 checks avoids this problem. The fuzzer program
    must still use LZMA_IGNORE_CHECK flag to disable verification of
    integrity checks of uncompressed data.

    of the code.
    
    Thanks to Pavel Raiskup.

    liblzma: Fix lzma_memlimit_set(strm, 0).
    
    The 0 got treated specially in a buggy way and as a result
    the function did nothing. The API doc said that 0 was supposed
    to return LZMA_PROG_ERROR but it didn't.
    
    Now 0 is treated as if 1 had been specified. This is done because
    0 is already used to indicate an error from lzma_memlimit_get()
    and lzma_memusage().
    
    In addition, lzma_memlimit_set() no longer checks that the new
    limit is at least LZMA_MEMUSAGE_BASE. It's counter-productive
    for the Index decoder and was actually needed only by the
    auto decoder. Auto decoder has now been modified to check for
    LZMA_MEMUSAGE_BASE.

commit cbc74017939690d13441b8926bb743fb03211b83
Author: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>
Date:   2017-03-30 18:58:18 +0300

    liblzma: Fix handling of memlimit == 0 in lzma_index_decoder().
    
    It returned LZMA_PROG_ERROR, which was done to avoid zero as
    the limit (because it's a special value elsewhere), but using
    LZMA_PROG_ERROR is simply inconvenient and can cause bugs.
    
    The fix/workaround is to treat 0 as if it were 1 byte. It's
    effectively the same thing. The only weird consequence is
    that then lzma_memlimit_get() will return 1 even when 0 was
    specified as the limit.
    
    This fixes a very rare corner case in xz --list where a specific
    memory usage limit and a multi-stream file could print the
    error message "Internal error (bug)" instead of saying that
    the memory usage limit is too low.

    liblzma: Avoid multiple definitions of lzma_coder structures.
    
    Only one definition was visible in a translation unit.
    It avoided a few casts and temp variables but seems that
    this hack doesn't work with link-time optimizations in compilers
    as it's not C99/C11 compliant.

    tuklib_cpucores: Add support for sched_getaffinity().
    
    It's available in glibc (GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD). It's better
    than sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) because sched_getaffinity()
    gives the number of cores available to the process instead of
    the total number of cores online.
    
    As a side effect, this commit fixes a bug on GNU/kFreeBSD where
    configure would detect the FreeBSD-specific cpuset_getaffinity()
    but it wouldn't actually work because on GNU/kFreeBSD it requires
    using -lfreebsd-glue when linking. Now the glibc-specific function
    will be used instead.
    
    Thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the original patch
    and testing.

    liblzma: Disable external SHA-256 by default.
    
    This is the sane thing to do. The conflict with OpenSSL
    on some OSes and especially that the OS-provided versions
    can be significantly slower makes it clear that it was
    a mistake to have the external SHA-256 support enabled by
    default.
    
    Those who want it can now pass --enable-external-sha256 to
    configure. INSTALL was updated with notes about OSes where
    this can be a bad idea.
    
    The SHA-256 detection code in configure.ac had some bugs that
    could lead to a build failure in some situations. These were
    fixed, although it doesn't matter that much now that the
    external SHA-256 is disabled by default.
    
    MINIX >= 3.2.0 uses NetBSD's libc and thus has SHA256_Init
    in libc instead of libutil. Support for the libutil version
    was removed.

    Build: Avoid SHA256_Init on FreeBSD and MINIX 3.
    
    On FreeBSD 10 and older, SHA256_Init from libmd conflicts
    with libcrypto from OpenSSL. The OpenSSL version has
    different sizeof(SHA256_CTX) and it can cause weird
    problems if wrong SHA256_Init gets used.
    
    Looking at the source, MINIX 3 seems to have a similar issue but
    I'm not sure. To be safe, I disabled SHA256_Init on MINIX 3 too.
    
    NetBSD has SHA256_Init in libc and they had a similar problem,
    but they already fixed it in 2009.
    
    Thanks to Jim Wilcoxson for the bug report that helped
    in finding the problem.

    liblzma: Make Valgrind happier with optimized (gcc -O2) liblzma.
    
    When optimizing, GCC can reorder code so that an uninitialized
    value gets used in a comparison, which makes Valgrind unhappy.
    It doesn't happen when compiled with -O0, which I tend to use
    when running Valgrind.

    ago by someone else but nothing was done back then.

    People shouldn't rely on the presets when decoding raw streams,
    but xz uses the presets as the starting point for raw decoder

    lzma_encocder_presets.c was renamed to lzma_presets.c to
    make it clear it's not used solely by the encoder code.

    lzma_index_dup() calls index_dup_stream() which, in case of

    Update German translation, mostly wrt orthography
    
    Provide an update of the German translation.
    * A lot of compound words were previously written with spaces, while
      German orthography is relatively clear in that the components
      should not be separated.
    * When referring to the actual process of (de)compression rather than the
      concept, replace “(De-)Kompression” with “(De-)Komprimierung”.
      Previously, both forms were used in this context and are now used in a
      manner consistent with “Komprimierung” being more likely to refer to
      a process.
    * Consistently translate “standard input”/“output”
    * Use “Zeichen” instead of false friend “Charakter” for “character”
    * Insert commas around relative clauses (as required in German)
    * Some other minor corrections
    * Capitalize “ß” as “ẞ”
    * Consistently start option descriptions in --help with capital letters

    Fix typo in German translation.
    
    As pointed out by Robert Pollak, there's a typo in the German
    translation of the compression preset option (-0 ... -9) help text.
    "The compressor" translates to "der Komprimierer", and the genitive
    form is "des Komprimierers". The old word makes no sense at all.

    Revert "xz: Use pipe2() if available."
    
    This reverts commit 7a11c4a8e5e15f13d5fa59233b3172e65428efdd.
    It is a problem when libc has pipe2() but the kernel is too
    old to have pipe2() and thus pipe2() fails. In xz it's pointless
    to have a fallback for non-functioning pipe2(); it's better to
    avoid pipe2() completely.
    
    Thanks to Michael Fox for the bug report.

    xz: Add support for sandboxing with Capsicum.
    
    The sandboxing is used conditionally as described in main.c.
    This isn't optimal but it was much easier to implement than
    a full sandboxing solution and it still covers the most common
    use cases where xz is writing to standard output. This should
    have practically no effect on performance even with small files
    as fork() isn't needed.
    
    C and locale libraries can open files as needed. This has been
    fine in the past, but it's a problem with things like Capsicum.
    io_sandbox_enter() tries to ensure that various locale-related
    files have been loaded before cap_enter() is called, but it's
    possible that there are other similar problems which haven't
    been seen yet.
    
    Currently Capsicum is available on FreeBSD 10 and later
    and there is a port to Linux too.
    
    Thanks to Loganaden Velvindron for help.

    Fix bugs and otherwise improve ax_check_capsicum.m4.
    
    AU_ALIAS was removed because the new version is incompatible
    with the old version.
    
    It no longer checks for <sys/capability.h> separately.
    It's enough to test for it as part of AC_CHECK_DECL.
    The defines HAVE_CAPSICUM_SYS_CAPSICUM_H and
    HAVE_CAPSICUM_SYS_CAPABILITY_H were removed as unneeded.
    HAVE_SYS_CAPSICUM_H from AC_CHECK_HEADERS is enough.
    
    It no longer does a useless search for the Capsicum library
    if the header wasn't found.
    
    Fixed a bug in ACTION-IF-FOUND (the first argument). Specifying
    the argument omitted the default action but the given action
    wasn't used instead.
    
    AC_DEFINE([HAVE_CAPSICUM]) is now always called when Capsicum
    support is found. Previously it was part of the default
    ACTION-IF-FOUND which a custom action would override. Now
    the default action only prepends ${CAPSICUM_LIB} to LIBS.
    
    The documentation was updated.
    
    Since there as no serial number, "#serial 2" was added.

    Fix CPU core count detection on QNX.
    
    It tried to use sysctl() on QNX but
      - it broke the build because sysctl() needs -lsocket on QNX;
      - sysctl() doesn't work for detecting the core count on QNX
        even if it compiled.
    
    sysconf() works. An alternative would have been to use
    QNX-specific SYSPAGE_ENTRY(num_cpu) from <sys/syspage.h>.
    
    Thanks to Ole André Vadla Ravnås.

    xz: Don't fail if stdin doesn't support O_NONBLOCK.
    
    It's a problem at least on OpenBSD which doesn't support
    O_NONBLOCK on e.g. /dev/null. I'm not surprised if it's
    a problem on other OSes too since this behavior is allowed
    in POSIX-1.2008.
    
    The code relying on this behavior was committed in June 2013
    and included in 5.1.3alpha released on 2013-10-26. Clearly
    the development releases only get limited testing.

    Bump version and soname for 5.2.0.
    
    I know that soname != app version, but I skip AGE=1
    in -version-info to make the soname match the liblzma
    version anyway. It doesn't hurt anything as long as
    it doesn't conflict with library versioning rules.
