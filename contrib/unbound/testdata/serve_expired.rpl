; Scenario overview:
; - query for example.com. IN A
; - check that we get an answer for example.com. IN A with the correct TTL
; - query again (without the RD bit) right after the TTL expired
; - check that we get the expired cached answer (this should trigger prefetching)
; - query with RD bit and check that the cached record was updated
