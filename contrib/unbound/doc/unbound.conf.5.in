.TH "UNBOUND.CONF" "5" "Oct 22, 2025" "1.24.1" "Unbound"
.SH NAME
unbound.conf \- Unbound 1.24.1 configuration file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBunbound.conf\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBunbound.conf\fP is used to configure \fI\%unbound(8)\fP\&.
The file format has attributes and values.
Some attributes have attributes inside them.
The notation is: \fBattribute: value\fP\&.
.sp
Comments start with \fB#\fP and last to the end of line.
Empty lines are ignored as is whitespace at the beginning of a line.
.sp
The utility \fI\%unbound\-checkconf(8)\fP can be
used to check \fBunbound.conf\fP prior to usage.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
An example config file is shown below.
Copy this to \fB/etc/unbound/unbound.conf\fP and start the server with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ unbound \-c /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Most settings are the defaults.
Stop the server with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ kill \(gacat /etc/unbound/unbound.pid\(ga
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Below is a minimal config file.
The source distribution contains an extensive \fBexample.conf\fP file with
all the options.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# unbound.conf(5) config file for unbound(8).

.SH FILE FORMAT
.sp
There must be whitespace between keywords.
Attribute keywords end with a colon \fB\(aq:\(aq\fP\&.
An attribute is followed by a value, or its containing attributes in which case
it is referred to as a clause.
Clauses can be repeated throughout the file (or included files) to group
attributes under the same clause.
.sp
Files can be included using the \fBinclude:\fP directive.
It can appear anywhere, it accepts a single file name as argument.
Processing continues as if the text from the included file was copied into the
config file at that point.
If also using \fI\%chroot\fP, using full path names for
the included files works, relative pathnames for the included names work if the
directory where the daemon is started equals its chroot/working directory or is
specified before the include statement with \fI\%directory:
dir\fP\&.
Wildcards can be used to include multiple files, see \fIglob(7)\fP\&.
.sp
For a more structural include option, the \fBinclude\-toplevel:\fP directive can
be used.
This closes whatever clause is currently active (if any) and forces the use of
clauses in the included files and right after this directive.
.SS Server Options
.sp
These options are part of the \fBserver:\fP clause.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B verbosity: \fI<number>\fP 
The verbosity level.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Level 0
No verbosity, only errors.
.TP
.B Level 1
Gives operational information.
.TP
.B Level 2
Gives detailed operational information including short information per
query.
.TP
.B Level 3
Gives query level information, output per query.
.TP
.B Level 4
Gives algorithm level information.
.TP
.B Level 5
Logs client identification for cache misses.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The verbosity can also be increased from the command line and during run
time via remote control. See \fI\%unbound(8)\fP and
\fI\%unbound\-control(8)\fP respectively.
.sp
Default: 1
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B statistics\-interval: \fI<seconds>\fP 
The number of seconds between printing statistics to the log for every
thread.
Disable with value \fB0\fP or \fB\(dq\(dq\fP\&.
The histogram statistics are only printed if replies were sent during the
statistics interval, requestlist statistics are printed for every interval
(but can be 0).
This is because the median calculation requires data to be present.
.sp
Default: 0 (disabled)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B statistics\-cumulative: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If enabled, statistics are cumulative since starting Unbound, without
clearing the statistics counters after logging the statistics.
.sp
Default: no
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B extended\-statistics: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If enabled, extended statistics are printed from
\fI\%unbound\-control(8)\fP\&.
The counters are listed in
\fI\%unbound\-control(8)\fP\&.
Keeping track of more statistics takes time.
.sp
Default: no
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B statistics\-inhibit\-zero: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If enabled, selected extended statistics with a value of 0 are inhibited
from printing with
\fI\%unbound\-control(8)\fP\&.
These are query types, query classes, query opcodes, answer rcodes
(except NOERROR, FORMERR, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, NOTIMPL, REFUSED)
and PRZ actions.
.sp
Default: yes
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B num\-threads: \fI<number>\fP 
The number of threads to create to serve clients. Use 1 for no threading.
.sp
Default: 1
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B port: \fI<port number>\fP 
The port number on which the server responds to queries.
.sp
Default: 53
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B interface: \fI<IP address or interface name[@port]>\fP 
Interface to use to connect to the network.
This interface is listened to for queries from clients, and answers to
clients are given from it.
Can be given multiple times to work on several interfaces.
If none are given the default is to listen on localhost.
.sp
If an interface name is used instead of an IP address, the list of IP
addresses on that interface are used.
The interfaces are not changed on a reload (\fBkill \-HUP\fP) but only on
restart.
.sp
A port number can be specified with @port (without spaces between interface
and port number), if not specified the default port (from
\fI\%port\fP) is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ip\-address: \fI<IP address or interface name[@port]>\fP 
Same as \fI\%interface\fP (for ease of
compatibility with \fI\%nsd.conf(5)\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B interface\-automatic: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
Listen on all addresses on all (current and future) interfaces, detect the
source interface on UDP queries and copy them to replies.
This is a lot like \fI\%ip\-transparent\fP, but
this option services all interfaces whilst with
\fI\%ip\-transparent\fP you can select which
(future) interfaces Unbound provides service on.
This feature is experimental, and needs support in your OS for particular
socket options.
.sp
Default: no
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B interface\-automatic\-ports: \fI\(dq<string>\(dq\fP 
List the port numbers that
\fI\%interface\-automatic\fP listens on.
If empty, the default port is listened on.
The port numbers are separated by spaces in the string.
.sp
This can be used to have interface automatic to deal with the interface,
and listen on the normal port number, by including it in the list, and
also HTTPS or DNS\-over\-TLS port numbers by putting them in the list as
well.
.sp
Default: \(dq\(dq
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B outgoing\-interface: \fI<IPv4/IPv6 address or IPv6 netblock>\fP 
Interface to use to connect to the network.
This interface is used to send queries to authoritative servers and receive
their replies.
Can be given multiple times to work on several interfaces.
If none are given the default (all) is used.
You can specify the same interfaces in
\fI\%interface\fP and
\fI\%outgoing\-interface\fP lines, the
interfaces are then used for both purposes.
Outgoing queries are sent via a random outgoing interface to counter
spoofing.
.sp
If an IPv6 netblock is specified instead of an individual IPv6 address,
outgoing UDP queries will use a randomised source address taken from the
netblock to counter spoofing.
Requires the IPv6 netblock to be routed to the host running Unbound, and
requires OS support for unprivileged non\-local binds (currently only
supported on Linux).
Several netblocks may be specified with multiple
\fI\%outgoing\-interface\fP options, but do
not specify both an individual IPv6 address and an IPv6 netblock, or the
randomisation will be compromised.
Consider combining with \fI\%prefer\-ip6: yes\fP to
increase the likelihood of IPv6 nameservers being selected for queries.
On Linux you need these two commands to be able to use the freebind socket
option to receive traffic for the ip6 netblock:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip \-6 addr add mynetblock/64 dev lo && \e
ip \-6 route add local mynetblock/64 dev lo
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B outgoing\-range: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of ports to open.
This number of file descriptors can be opened per thread.
Must be at least 1.
Default depends on compile options.
Larger numbers need extra resources from the operating system.
For performance a very large value is best, use libevent to make this
possible.
.sp
Default: 4096 (libevent) / 960 (minievent) / 48 (windows)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B outgoing\-port\-permit: \fI<port number or range>\fP 
Permit Unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send queries.
A larger number of permitted outgoing ports increases resilience against
spoofing attempts.
Make sure these ports are not needed by other daemons.
By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA are
used.
Give a port number or a range of the form \(dqlow\-high\(dq, without spaces.
.sp
The \fI\%outgoing\-port\-permit\fP and
\fI\%outgoing\-port\-avoid\fP statements
are processed in the line order of the config file, adding the permitted
ports and subtracting the avoided ports from the set of allowed ports.
The processing starts with the non IANA allocated ports above 1024 in the
set of allowed ports.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B outgoing\-port\-avoid: \fI<port number or range>\fP 
Do not permit Unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send
queries.
Use this to make sure Unbound does not grab a port that another daemon
needs.
The port is avoided on all outgoing interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6.
By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA are
used.
Give a port number or a range of the form \(dqlow\-high\(dq, without spaces.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B outgoing\-num\-tcp: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of outgoing TCP buffers to allocate per thread.
If set to 0, or if \fI\%do\-tcp: no\fP is set, no TCP
queries to authoritative servers are done.
For larger installations increasing this value is a good idea.
.sp
Default: 10
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B incoming\-num\-tcp: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of incoming TCP buffers to allocate per thread.
If set to 0, or if \fI\%do\-tcp: no\fP is set, no TCP
queries from clients are accepted.
For larger installations increasing this value is a good idea.
.sp
Default: 10
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B edns\-buffer\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of bytes size to advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer size.
This is the value put into datagrams over UDP towards peers.
The actual buffer size is determined by
\fI\%msg\-buffer\-size\fP (both for TCP and
UDP).
Do not set higher than that value.
Setting to 512 bypasses even the most stringent path MTU problems, but is
seen as extreme, since the amount of TCP fallback generated is excessive
(probably also for this resolver, consider tuning
\fI\%outgoing\-num\-tcp\fP).
.sp
Default: 1232 (\fI\%DNS Flag Day 2020 recommendation\fP)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B max\-udp\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Maximum UDP response size (not applied to TCP response).
65536 disables the UDP response size maximum, and uses the choice from the
client, always.
Suggested values are 512 to 4096.
.sp
Default: 1232 (same as \fI\%edns\-buffer\-size\fP)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stream\-wait\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of bytes size maximum to use for waiting stream buffers.
A plain number is in bytes, append \(aqk\(aq, \(aqm\(aq or \(aqg\(aq for kilobytes, megabytes
or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).
As TCP and TLS streams queue up multiple results, the amount of memory used
for these buffers does not exceed this number, otherwise the responses are
dropped.
This manages the total memory usage of the server (under heavy use), the
number of requests that can be queued up per connection is also limited,
with further requests waiting in TCP buffers.
.sp
Default: 4m
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B msg\-buffer\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of bytes size of the message buffers.
Default is 65552 bytes, enough for 64 Kb packets, the maximum DNS message
size.
No message larger than this can be sent or received.
Can be reduced to use less memory, but some requests for DNS data, such as
for huge resource records, will result in a SERVFAIL reply to the client.
.sp
Default: 65552
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B msg\-cache\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of bytes size of the message cache.
A plain number is in bytes, append \(aqk\(aq, \(aqm\(aq or \(aqg\(aq for kilobytes, megabytes
or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).
.sp
Default: 4m
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B msg\-cache\-slabs: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of slabs in the message cache.
Slabs reduce lock contention by threads.
Must be set to a power of 2.
Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.
If left unconfigured, it will be configured automatically to be a power of
2 close to the number of configured threads in multi\-threaded environments.
.sp
Default: (unconfigured)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B num\-queries\-per\-thread: \fI<number>\fP 
The number of queries that every thread will service simultaneously.
If more queries arrive that need servicing, and no queries can be jostled
out (see \fI\%jostle\-timeout\fP), then the
queries are dropped.
This forces the client to resend after a timeout; allowing the server time
to work on the existing queries.
Default depends on compile options.
.sp
Default: 2048 (libevent) / 512 (minievent) / 24 (windows)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B jostle\-timeout: \fI<msec>\fP 
Timeout used when the server is very busy.
Set to a value that usually results in one roundtrip to the authority
servers.
.sp
If too many queries arrive, then 50% of the queries are allowed to run to
completion, and the other 50% are replaced with the new incoming query if
they have already spent more than their allowed time.
This protects against denial of service by slow queries or high query
rates.
.sp
The effect is that the qps for long\-lasting queries is about:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
(num\-queries\-per\-thread / 2) / (average time for such long queries) qps
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The qps for short queries can be about:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
(num\-queries\-per\-thread / 2) / (jostle\-timeout in whole seconds) qps per thread
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
about (2048/2)*5 = 5120 qps by default.
.sp
Default: 200
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B delay\-close: \fI<msec>\fP 
Extra delay for timeouted UDP ports before they are closed, in msec.
This prevents very delayed answer packets from the upstream (recursive)
servers from bouncing against closed ports and setting off all sort of
close\-port counters, with eg. 1500 msec.
When timeouts happen you need extra sockets, it checks the ID and remote IP
of packets, and unwanted packets are added to the unwanted packet counter.
.sp
Default: 0 (disabled)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B udp\-connect: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
Perform \fIconnect(2)\fP for UDP sockets that mitigates ICMP side channel
leakage.
.sp
Default: yes
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B unknown\-server\-time\-limit: \fI<msec>\fP 
The wait time in msec for waiting for an unknown server to reply.
Increase this if you are behind a slow satellite link, to eg. 1128.
That would then avoid re\-querying every initial query because it times out.
.sp
Default: 376
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B discard\-timeout: \fI<msec>\fP 
The wait time in msec where recursion requests are dropped.
This is to stop a large number of replies from accumulating.
They receive no reply, the work item continues to recurse.
It is nice to be a bit larger than
\fI\%serve\-expired\-client\-timeout\fP
if that is enabled.
A value of \fB1900\fP msec is suggested.
The value \fB0\fP disables it.
.sp
Default: 1900
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B wait\-limit: \fI<number>\fP 
The number of replies that can wait for recursion, for an IP address.
This makes a ratelimit per IP address of waiting replies for recursion.
It stops very large amounts of queries waiting to be returned to one
destination.
The value \fB0\fP disables wait limits.
.sp
Default: 1000
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B wait\-limit\-cookie: \fI<number>\fP 
The number of replies that can wait for recursion, for an IP address
that sent the query with a valid DNS Cookie.
Since the cookie validates the client address, this limit can be higher.
.sp
Default: 10000
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B wait\-limit\-netblock: \fI<netblock>\fP \fI<number>\fP 
The wait limit for the netblock.
If not given the
\fI\%wait\-limit\fP
value is used.
The most specific netblock is used to determine the limit.
Useful for overriding the default for a specific, group or individual,
server.
The value \fB\-1\fP disables wait limits for the netblock.
By default the loopback has a wait limit netblock of \fB\-1\fP, it is not
limited, because it is separated from the rest of network for spoofed
packets.
The loopback addresses \fB127.0.0.0/8\fP and \fB::1/128\fP are default at \fB\-1\fP\&.
.sp
Default: (none)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B wait\-limit\-cookie\-netblock: \fI<netblock>\fP \fI<number>\fP 
The wait limit for the netblock, when the query has a DNS Cookie.
If not given, the
\fI\%wait\-limit\-cookie\fP
value is used.
The value \fB\-1\fP disables wait limits for the netblock.
The loopback addresses \fB127.0.0.0/8\fP and \fB::1/128\fP are default at \fB\-1\fP\&.
.sp
Default: (none)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B so\-rcvbuf: \fI<number>\fP 
If not 0, then set the SO_RCVBUF socket option to get more buffer space on
UDP port 53 incoming queries.
So that short spikes on busy servers do not drop packets (see counter in
\fBnetstat \-su\fP).
Otherwise, the number of bytes to ask for, try \(dq4m\(dq on a busy server.
.sp
The OS caps it at a maximum, on linux Unbound needs root permission to
bypass the limit, or the admin can use \fBsysctl net.core.rmem_max\fP\&.
.sp
On BSD change \fBkern.ipc.maxsockbuf\fP in \fB/etc/sysctl.conf\fP\&.
.sp
On OpenBSD change header and recompile kernel.
.sp
On Solaris \fBndd \-set /dev/udp udp_max_buf 8388608\fP\&.
.sp
Default: 0 (use system value)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B so\-sndbuf: \fI<number>\fP 
If not 0, then set the SO_SNDBUF socket option to get more buffer space on
UDP port 53 outgoing queries.
This for very busy servers handles spikes in answer traffic, otherwise:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
send: resource temporarily unavailable
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
can get logged, the buffer overrun is also visible by \fBnetstat \-su\fP\&.
If set to 0 it uses the system value.
Specify the number of bytes to ask for, try \(dq8m\(dq on a very busy server.
.sp
It needs some space to be able to deal with packets that wait for local
address resolution, from like ARP and NDP discovery, before they are sent
out, hence it is elevated above the system default by default.
.sp
The OS caps it at a maximum, on linux Unbound needs root permission to
bypass the limit, or the admin can use \fBsysctl net.core.wmem_max\fP\&.
.sp
On BSD, Solaris changes are similar to
\fI\%so\-rcvbuf\fP\&.
.sp
Default: 4m
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B so\-reuseport: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If yes, then open dedicated listening sockets for incoming queries for each
thread and try to set the SO_REUSEPORT socket option on each socket.
May distribute incoming queries to threads more evenly.
.sp
On Linux it is supported in kernels >= 3.9.
.sp
On other systems, FreeBSD, OSX it may also work.
.sp
You can enable it (on any platform and kernel), it then attempts to open
the port and passes the option if it was available at compile time, if that
works it is used, if it fails, it continues silently (unless verbosity 3)
without the option.
.sp
At extreme load it could be better to turn it off to distribute the queries
evenly, reported for Linux systems (4.4.x).
.sp
Default: yes
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ip\-transparent: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If yes, then use IP_TRANSPARENT socket option on sockets where Unbound is
listening for incoming traffic.
Allows you to bind to non\-local interfaces.
For example for non\-existent IP addresses that are going to exist later on,
with host failover configuration.
.sp
This is a lot like
\fI\%interface\-automatic\fP, but that one
services all interfaces and with this option you can select which (future)
interfaces Unbound provides service on.
.sp
This option needs Unbound to be started with root permissions on some
systems.
The option uses IP_BINDANY on FreeBSD systems and SO_BINDANY on OpenBSD
systems.
.sp
Default: no
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ip\-freebind: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If yes, then use IP_FREEBIND socket option on sockets where Unbound is
listening to incoming traffic.
Allows you to bind to IP addresses that are nonlocal or do not exist, like
when the network interface or IP address is down.
.sp
Exists only on Linux, where the similar
\fI\%ip\-transparent\fP option is also
available.
.sp
Default: no
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ip\-dscp: \fI<number>\fP 
The value of the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) in the
differentiated services field (DS) of the outgoing IP packet headers.
The field replaces the outdated IPv4 Type\-Of\-Service field and the IPv6
traffic class field.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rrset\-cache\-size: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of bytes size of the RRset cache.
A plain number is in bytes, append \(aqk\(aq, \(aqm\(aq or \(aqg\(aq for kilobytes, megabytes
or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).
.sp
Default: 4m
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rrset\-cache\-slabs: \fI<number>\fP 
Number of slabs in the RRset cache.
Slabs reduce lock contention by threads.
Must be set to a power of 2.
Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.
If left unconfigured, it will be configured automatically to be a power of
2 close to the number of configured threads in multi\-threaded environments.
.sp
Default: (unconfigured)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

Harden against algorithm downgrade when multiple algorithms are advertised

then expecting signatures from all the advertised signing algorithms from
the chosen DS(es) to be present.
If no, allows any one supported algorithm to validate the zone, even if
other advertised algorithms are broken.
\fI\%RFC 6840\fP mandates that zone signers must produce zones signed with all
advertised algorithms, but sometimes they do not.
\fI\%RFC 6840\fP also clarifies that this requirement is not for validators and
validators should accept any single valid path.
It should thus be explicitly noted that this option violates \fI\%RFC 6840\fP

.B minimal\-responses: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
If yes, Unbound does not insert authority/additional sections into response
messages when those sections are not required.
This reduces response size significantly, and may avoid TCP fallback for
some responses which may cause a slight speedup.
The default is yes, even though the DNS protocol RFCs mandate these
sections, and the additional content could save roundtrips for clients that
use the additional content.
However these sections are hardly used by clients.
Enabling prefetch can benefit clients that need the additional content
by trying to keep that content fresh in the cache.

If yes, disables the DNSSEC lameness check in the iterator.
This check sees if RRSIGs are present in the answer, when DNSSEC is

The probes are run several times per month, thus the machine must be online
frequently.
The initial file can be one with contents as described in

The file is written to when the anchor is updated, so the Unbound user must
have write permission.
Write permission to the file, but also to the directory it is in (to create
a temporary file, which is necessary to deal with filesystem full events),
it must also be inside the \fI\%chroot\fP (if that is

The resource record is entered in the same format as \fIdig(1)\fP or \fIdrill(1)\fP

.B domain\-insecure: \fI<domain name>\fP 
Sets \fI<domain name>\fP to be insecure, DNSSEC chain of trust is ignored
towards the \fI<domain name>\fP\&.
So a trust anchor above the domain name can not make the domain secure with
a DS record, such a DS record is then ignored.
Can be given multiple times to specify multiple domains that are treated as
if unsigned.
If you set trust anchors for the domain they override this setting (and the
domain is secured).

This can be useful if you want to make sure a trust anchor for external

Minimum number of seconds of clock skew to apply to validated signatures.
A value of 10% of the signature lifetime (expiration \- inception) is used,

This way you can monitor what happens with validation.
Use a diagnosis tool, such as dig or drill, to find out why validation is
failing for these queries.

usual.
The client receives the bogus data.
For messages that are found to be secure the AD bit is set in replies.

.B ignore\-cd\-flag: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
Instruct Unbound to ignore the CD flag from clients and refuse to return
bogus answers to them.
Thus, the CD (Checking Disabled) flag does not disable checking any more.
This is useful if legacy (w2008) servers that set the CD flag but cannot
validate DNSSEC themselves are the clients, and then Unbound provides them
with DNSSEC protection.

.B disable\-edns\-do: \fI<yes or no>\fP 
Disable the EDNS DO flag in upstream requests.
It breaks DNSSEC validation for Unbound\(aqs clients.
This results in the upstream name servers to not include DNSSEC records in
their replies and could be helpful for devices that cannot handle DNSSEC
information.
When the option is enabled, clients that set the DO flag receive no EDNS
record in the response to indicate the lack of support to them.

A \fI\%stub\-zone\fP can be used to have unbound
send queries to another server, an authoritative server, to fetch the

With a \fI\%forward\-zone\fP, unbound sends
queries to a server that is a recursive server to fetch the information.
With an \fI\%auth\-zone\fP a zone can be loaded from

.B response\-ip: \fI<IP\-netblock> <action>\fP 
This requires use of the \fBrespip\fP module.
.sp
If the IP address in an AAAA or A RR in the answer section of a response
matches the specified IP netblock, the specified action will apply.
\fI<action>\fP has generally the same semantics as that for
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\-action\fP,
but there are some exceptions.
.sp
Actions for \fI\%response\-ip\fP are different
from those for \fI\%local\-zone\fP in that in case
of the former there is no point of such conditions as \(dqthe query matches it
but there is no local data\(dq.
Because of this difference, the semantics of
\fI\%response\-ip\fP actions are modified or
simplified as follows: The \fIstatic\fP, \fIrefuse\fP, \fItransparent\fP,
\fItypetransparent\fP, and \fInodefault\fP actions are invalid for \fIresponse\-ip\fP\&.
Using any of these will cause the configuration to be rejected as faulty.
The \fIdeny\fP action is non\-conditional, i.e. it always results in dropping
the corresponding query.
The resolution result before applying the \fIdeny\fP action is still cached and
can be used for other queries.

.B response\-ip\-data: \fI<IP\-netblock> <\(dqresource record string\(dq>\fP 
This requires use of the \fBrespip\fP module.
.sp
This specifies the action data for
\fI\%response\-ip\fP with action being to redirect
as specified by \fI<\(dqresource record string\(dq>\fP\&.
\fI<\(dqResource record string\(dq>\fP is similar to that of
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\-action\fP,
but it must be of either AAAA, A or CNAME types.
If the \fI<IP\-netblock>\fP is an IPv6/IPv4 prefix, the record must be AAAA/A
respectively, unless it is a CNAME (which can be used for both versions of
IP netblocks).
If it is CNAME there must not be more than one
\fI\%response\-ip\-data\fP for the same
\fI<IP\-netblock>\fP\&.
Also, CNAME and other types of records must not coexist for the same
\fI<IP\-netblock>\fP, following the normal rules for CNAME records.
The textual domain name for the CNAME does not have to be explicitly
terminated with a dot (\fB\(dq.\(dq\fP); the root name is assumed to be the origin
for the name.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B response\-ip\-tag: \fI<IP\-netblock> <\(dqlist of tags\(dq>\fP 
This requires use of the \fBrespip\fP module.
.sp
Assign tags to response \fI<IP\-netblock>\fP\&.
If the IP address in an AAAA or A RR in the answer section of a response
matches the specified \fI<IP\-netblock>\fP, the specified tags are assigned to
the IP address.
Then, if an \fI\%access\-control\-tag\fP is
defined for the client and it includes one of the tags for the response IP,
the corresponding
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\-action\fP
will apply.
Tag matching rule is the same as that for
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\fP and
\fI\%local\-zone\fP\&.
Unlike \fI\%local\-zone\-tag\fP,
\fI\%response\-ip\-tag\fP can be defined for an
\fI<IP\-netblock>\fP even if no \fI\%response\-ip\fP is
defined for that netblock.
If multiple \fI\%response\-ip\-tag\fP options
are specified for the same \fI<IP\-netblock>\fP in different statements, all but
the first will be ignored.
However, this will not be flagged as a configuration error, but the result
is probably not what was intended.
.sp
Actions specified in an
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\-action\fP
that has a matching tag with
\fI\%response\-ip\-tag\fP can be those that are
\(dqinvalid\(dq for \fI\%response\-ip\fP listed above,
since
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\-action\fP
can be shared with local zones.
For these actions, if they behave differently depending on whether local
data exists or not in case of local zones, the behavior for
\fI\%response\-ip\-data\fP will generally
result in NOERROR/NODATA instead of NXDOMAIN, since the
\fI\%response\-ip\fP data are inherently type
specific, and non\-existence of data does not indicate anything about the
existence or non\-existence of the qname itself.
For example, if the matching tag action is static but there is no data for
the corresponding \fI\%response\-ip\fP
configuration, then the result will be NOERROR/NODATA.
The only case where NXDOMAIN is returned is when an
\fI\%always_nxdomain\fP
action applies.

.B ratelimit: \fI<number or 0>\fP 
Enable ratelimiting of queries sent to nameserver for performing recursion.
0 disables the feature.
This option is experimental at this time.
.sp
The ratelimit is in queries per second that are allowed.
More queries are turned away with an error (SERVFAIL).
Cached responses are not ratelimited by this setting.
.sp
This stops recursive floods, eg. random query names, but not spoofed
reflection floods.
The zone of the query is determined by examining the nameservers for it,
the zone name is used to keep track of the rate.
For example, 1000 may be a suitable value to stop the server from being
overloaded with random names, and keeps unbound from sending traffic to the
nameservers for those zones.

.SS Stub Zone Options
.sp
There may be multiple \fBstub\-zone:\fP clauses.
Each with a \fI\%name\fP and zero or more hostnames or
IP addresses.
For the stub zone this list of nameservers is used.
Class IN is assumed.
The servers should be authority servers, not recursors; Unbound performs the
recursive processing itself for stub zones.
.sp
The stub zone can be used to configure authoritative data to be used by the
resolver that cannot be accessed using the public internet servers.
This is useful for company\-local data or private zones.
Setup an authoritative server on a different host (or different port).
Enter a config entry for Unbound with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
stub\-addr: <ip address of host[@port]>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Unbound resolver can then access the data, without referring to the public
internet for it.
.sp
This setup allows DNSSEC signed zones to be served by that authoritative
server, in which case a trusted key entry with the public key can be put in
config, so that Unbound can validate the data and set the AD bit on replies for
the private zone (authoritative servers do not set the AD bit).
This setup makes Unbound capable of answering queries for the private zone, and
can even set the AD bit (\(aqauthentic\(aq), but the AA (\(aqauthoritative\(aq) bit is not
set on these replies.
.sp
Consider adding \fI\%server\fP statements for
\fI\%domain\-insecure\fP and for
\fI\%local\-zone: <name> nodefault\fP
for the zone if it is a locally served zone.
The insecure clause stops DNSSEC from invalidating the zone.

.SS Forward Zone Options
.sp
There may be multiple \fBforward\-zone:\fP clauses.
Each with a \fI\%name\fP and zero or more hostnames

For the forward zone this list of nameservers is used to forward the queries
to.
The servers listed as \fI\%forward\-host\fP
and \fI\%forward\-addr\fP have to handle
further recursion for the query.
Thus, those servers are not authority servers, but are (just like Unbound is)
recursive servers too; Unbound does not perform recursion itself for the
forward zone, it lets the remote server do it.
Class IN is assumed.
CNAMEs are chased by Unbound itself, asking the remote server for every name in
the indirection chain, to protect the local cache from illegal indirect
referenced items.
A \fI\%forward\-zone\fP entry with name
\fB\(dq.\(dq\fP and a \fI\%forward\-addr\fP target

.SS Authority Zone Options
.sp
Authority zones are configured with \fBauth\-zone:\fP, and each one must have a
\fI\%name\fP\&.
There can be multiple ones, by listing multiple auth\-zone clauses, each with a
different name, pertaining to that part of the namespace.
The authority zone with the name closest to the name looked up is used.
Authority zones can be processed on two distinct, non\-exclusive, configurable
stages.
.sp
With \fI\%for\-downstream: yes\fP (default),
authority zones are processed after \fBlocal\-zones\fP and before cache.
When used in this manner, Unbound responds like an authority server with no
further processing other than returning an answer from the zone contents.
A notable example, in this case, is CNAME records which are returned verbatim
to downstream clients without further resolution.
.sp
With \fI\%for\-upstream: yes\fP (default),
authority zones are processed after the cache lookup, just before going to the
network to fetch information for recursion.
When used in this manner they provide a local copy of an authority server
that speeds up lookups for that data during resolving.
.sp
If both options are enabled (default), client queries for an authority zone are
answered authoritatively from Unbound, while internal queries that require data
from the authority zone consult the local zone data instead of going to the
network.
.sp
An interesting configuration is
\fI\%for\-downstream: no\fP,
\fI\%for\-upstream: yes\fP
that allows for hyperlocal behavior where both client and internal queries
consult the local zone data while resolving.
In this case, the aforementioned CNAME example will result in a thoroughly
resolved answer.
.sp
Authority zones can be read from zonefile.
And can be kept updated via AXFR and IXFR.
After update the zonefile is rewritten.
The update mechanism uses the SOA timer values and performs SOA UDP queries to
detect zone changes.
.sp
If the update fetch fails, the timers in the SOA record are used to time
another fetch attempt.
Until the SOA expiry timer is reached.
Then the zone is expired.
When a zone is expired, queries are SERVFAIL, and any new serial number is
accepted from the primary (even if older), and if fallback is enabled, the
fallback activates to fetch from the upstream instead of the SERVFAIL.

.sp
A typical use case is when rotating certificates, existing clients may
still use the client magic from the old cert in their queries until they
fetch and update the new cert.
Likewise, it would allow one to prime the new cert/key without distributing
the new cert yet, this can be useful when using a network of servers using
anycast and on which the configuration may not get updated at the exact

If the destination address is allowed in the configuration Unbound will add the
EDNS0 option to the query containing the relevant part of the client\(aqs address.
When an answer contains the ECS option the response and the option are placed
in a specialized cache.
If the authority indicated no support, the response is stored in the regular
cache.
.sp
Additionally, when a client includes the option in its queries, Unbound will
forward the option when sending the query to addresses that are explicitly
allowed in the configuration using
\fI\%send\-client\-subnet\fP\&.
The option will always be forwarded, regardless the allowed addresses, when
\fI\%client\-subnet\-always\-forward: yes\fP
is set.
In this case the lookup in the regular cache is skipped.
.sp
The maximum size of the ECS cache is controlled by
\fI\%msg\-cache\-size\fP in the configuration file.
On top of that, for each query only 100 different subnets are allowed to be
stored for each address family.
Exceeding that number, older entries will be purged from cache.
.sp
Note that due to the nature of how EDNS Client Subnet works, by segregating the
client IP space in order to try and have tailored responses for prefixes of
unknown sizes, resolution and cache response performance are impacted as a
result.
Usage of the subnetcache module should only be enabled in installations that
require such functionality where the resolver and the clients belong to
different networks.

If this module is enabled and configured, the specified backend database works
as a second level cache; when Unbound cannot find an answer to a query in its
built\-in in\-memory cache, it consults the specified backend.
If it finds a valid answer in the backend, Unbound uses it to respond to the
query without performing iterative DNS resolution.
If Unbound cannot even find an answer in the backend, it resolves the query as
usual, and stores the answer in the backend.
.sp
This module interacts with the \fIserve\-expired\-*\fP options and will reply with
expired data if Unbound is configured for that.
.sp
If Unbound was built with \fB\-\-with\-libhiredis\fP on a system that has installed
the hiredis C client library of Redis, then the \fBredis\fP backend can be used.

Unbound never removes data stored in the Redis server, even if some data

Additionally, the

that the expire information is stored as absolute Unix timestamps in Redis
(computer time must be stable).
.sp
This backend uses synchronous communication with the Redis server based on the
assumption that the communication is stable and sufficiently fast.
The thread waiting for a response from the Redis server cannot handle other DNS
queries.
Although the backend has the ability to reconnect to the server when the
connection is closed unexpectedly and there is a configurable timeout in case
the server is overly slow or hangs up, these cases are assumed to be very rare.
If connection close or timeout happens too often, Unbound will be effectively
unusable with this backend.

.SS Response Policy Zone Options
.sp
Response Policy Zones are configured with \fBrpz:\fP, and each one must have a
\fI\%name\fP attribute.
There can be multiple ones, by listing multiple RPZ clauses, each with a
different name.
RPZ clauses are applied in order of configuration and any match from an earlier
RPZ zone will terminate the RPZ lookup.
Note that a PASSTHRU action is still considered a match.
The respip module needs to be added to the
\fI\%module\-config\fP, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
module\-config: \(dqrespip validator iterator\(dq
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
QNAME, Response IP Address, nsdname, nsip and clientip triggers are supported.
Supported actions are: NXDOMAIN, NODATA, PASSTHRU, DROP, Local Data, tcp\-only
and drop.
RPZ QNAME triggers are applied after any
\fI\%local\-zone\fP and before any
\fI\%auth\-zone\fP\&.
.sp
The RPZ zone is a regular DNS zone formatted with a SOA start record as usual.
The items in the zone are entries, that specify what to act on (the trigger)
and what to do (the action).
The trigger to act on is recorded in the name, the action to do is recorded as
the resource record.
The names all end in the zone name, so you could type the trigger names without
a trailing dot in the zonefile.
.sp
An example RPZ record, that answers \fBexample.com\fP with \fBNXDOMAIN\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
example.com CNAME .
.ft P
.fi

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The netblock is written as \fB<netblocklen>.<ip address in reverse>\fP\&.
For IPv6 use \fB\(aqzz\(aq\fP for \fB\(aq::\(aq\fP\&.
Specify individual addresses with scope length of 32 or 128.
For example, \fB24.10.100.51.198.rpz\-ip\fP is \fB198.51.100.10/24\fP and
\fB32.10.zz.db8.2001.rpz\-ip\fP is \fB2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:10/32\fP\&.

Name of the authority zone.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B primary: \fI<IP address or host name>\fP 
Where to download a copy of the zone from, with AXFR and IXFR.
Multiple primaries can be specified.
They are all tried if one fails.
.sp
To use a non\-default port for DNS communication append \fB\(aq@\(aq\fP with the
port number.
.sp
You can append a \fB\(aq#\(aq\fP and a name, then AXFR over TLS can be used and the
TLS authentication certificates will be checked with that name.
.sp
If you combine the \fB\(aq@\(aq\fP and \fB\(aq#\(aq\fP, the \fB\(aq@\(aq\fP comes first.
If you point it at another Unbound instance, it would not work because that
does not support AXFR/IXFR for the zone, but if you used
\fI\%url\fP to download the zonefile as a text file
from a webserver that would work.
.sp
If you specify the hostname, you cannot use the domain from the zonefile,
because it may not have that when retrieving that data, instead use a plain
IP address to avoid a circular dependency on retrieving that IP address.

.sp
Multiple url statements can be given, they are tried in turn.
.sp
If only urls are given the SOA refresh timer is used to wait for making new
downloads.
If also primaries are listed, the primaries are first probed with UDP SOA
queries to see if the SOA serial number has changed, reducing the number of
downloads.
If none of the URLs work, the primaries are tried with IXFR and AXFR.
.sp
For HTTPS, the \fI\%tls\-cert\-bundle\fP and
the hostname from the url are used to authenticate the connection.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B allow\-notify: \fI<IP address or host name or netblockIP/prefix>\fP 
With \fI\%allow\-notify\fP you can specify
additional sources of notifies.
When notified, the server attempts to first probe and then zone transfer.
If the notify is from a primary, it first attempts that primary.
Otherwise other primaries are attempted.
If there are no primaries, but only urls, the file is downloaded when
notified.
.sp

can be assigned to client addresses using
\fI\%access\-control\-tag\fP or
\fI\%interface\-tag\fP\&.
Enclose list of tags in quotes (\fB\(dq\(dq\fP) and put spaces between tags.

.SH MEMORY CONTROL EXAMPLE
.sp
In the example config settings below memory usage is reduced.
Some service levels are lower, notable very large data and a high TCP load are
no longer supported.
Very large data and high TCP loads are exceptional for the DNS.
DNSSEC validation is enabled, just add trust anchors.
If you do not have to worry about programs using more than 3 Mb of memory, the
