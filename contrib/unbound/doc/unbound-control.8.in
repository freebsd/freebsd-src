.TH "UNBOUND-CONTROL" "8" "Oct 22, 2025" "1.24.1" "Unbound"
.SH NAME
unbound-control \- Unbound 1.24.1 remote server control utility.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBunbound\-control\fP [\fB\-hq\fP] [\fB\-c cfgfile\fP] [\fB\-s server\fP] command
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBunbound\-control\fP performs remote administration on the
\fI\%unbound(8)\fP DNS server.
It reads the configuration file, contacts the Unbound server over TLS sends the
command and displays the result.
.sp
The available options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
Show the version and commandline option help.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c <cfgfile>
The config file to read with settings.
If not given the default config file
\fB@ub_conf_file@\fP is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s <server[@port]>
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to contact.
If not given, the address is read from the config file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet, if the option is given it does not print anything if it works ok.
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
There are several commands that the server understands.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B start 
Start the server.
Simply execs \fI\%unbound(8)\fP\&.
The \fBunbound\fP executable is searched for in the \fBPATH\fP set in the
environment.
It is started with the config file specified using \fI\%\-c\fP or the
default config file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stop 
Stop the server.
The server daemon exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B reload 
Reload the server.
This flushes the cache and reads the config file fresh.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B reload_keep_cache 
Reload the server but try to keep the RRset and message cache if
(re)configuration allows for it.
That means the caches sizes and the number of threads must not change
between reloads.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B fast_reload [\fB+dpv\fP] 
Reload the server, but keep downtime to a minimum, so that user queries
keep seeing service.
This needs the code compiled with threads.
The config is loaded in a thread, and prepared, then it briefly pauses the
existing server and updates config options.
The intent is that the pause does not impact the service of user queries.
The cache is kept.
Also user queries worked on are kept and continue, but with the new config
options.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This command is experimental at this time.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The amount of temporal memory needed during a fast_reload is twice the
amount needed for configuration.
This is because Unbound temporarily needs to store both current
configuration values and new ones while trying to fast_reload.
Zones loaded from disk (authority zones and RPZ zones) are included in such
memory needs.
.sp
Options that can be changed are for
\fI\%forwards\fP,
\fI\%stubs\fP,
\fI\%views\fP,
\fI\%authority zones\fP,
\fI\%RPZ zones\fP and
\fI\%local zones\fP\&.
.sp
Also
\fI\%access\-control\fP and similar options,
\fI\%interface\-action\fP and similar
options and
\fI\%tcp\-connection\-limit\fP\&.
It can reload some
\fI\%define\-tag\fP
changes, more on that below.
Further options include
\fI\%insecure\-lan\-zones\fP,
\fI\%domain\-insecure\fP,
\fI\%trust\-anchor\-file\fP,
\fI\%trust\-anchor\fP,
\fI\%trusted\-keys\-file\fP,
\fI\%auto\-trust\-anchor\-file\fP,
\fI\%edns\-client\-string\fP,
ipset,
\fI\%log\-identity\fP,
\fI\%infra\-cache\-numhosts\fP,
\fI\%msg\-cache\-size\fP,
\fI\%rrset\-cache\-size\fP,
\fI\%key\-cache\-size\fP,
\fI\%ratelimit\-size\fP,
\fI\%neg\-cache\-size\fP,
\fI\%num\-queries\-per\-thread\fP,
\fI\%jostle\-timeout\fP,
\fI\%use\-caps\-for\-id\fP,
\fI\%unwanted\-reply\-threshold\fP,
\fI\%tls\-use\-sni\fP,
\fI\%outgoing\-tcp\-mss\fP,
\fI\%ip\-dscp\fP,
\fI\%max\-reuse\-tcp\-queries\fP,
\fI\%tcp\-reuse\-timeout\fP,
\fI\%tcp\-auth\-query\-timeout\fP,
\fI\%delay\-close\fP\&.
\fI\%iter\-scrub\-promiscuous\fP\&.
.sp
It does not work with
\fI\%interface\fP and
\fI\%outgoing\-interface\fP changes,
also not with
\fI\%remote control\fP,
\fI\%outgoing\-port\-permit\fP,
\fI\%outgoing\-port\-avoid\fP,
\fI\%msg\-buffer\-size\fP,
any \fB*\-slabs\fP options and
\fI\%statistics\-interval\fP changes.
.sp
For \fI\%dnstap\fP these options can be changed:
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-resolver\-query\-messages\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-resolver\-response\-messages\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-client\-query\-messages\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-client\-response\-messages\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-forwarder\-query\-messages\fP and
\fI\%dnstap\-log\-forwarder\-response\-messages\fP\&.
.sp
It does not work with these options:
\fI\%dnstap\-enable\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-bidirectional\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-socket\-path\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-ip\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-tls\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-tls\-server\-name\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-tls\-cert\-bundle\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-tls\-client\-key\-file\fP and
\fI\%dnstap\-tls\-client\-cert\-file\fP\&.
.sp
The options
\fI\%dnstap\-send\-identity\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-send\-version\fP,
\fI\%dnstap\-identity\fP, and
\fI\%dnstap\-version\fP can be loaded
when \fB+p\fP is not used.
.sp
The \fB+v\fP option makes the output verbose which includes the time it took
to do the reload.
With \fB+vv\fP it is more verbose which includes the amount of memory that
was allocated temporarily to perform the reload; this amount of memory can
be big if the config has large contents.
In the timing output the \(aqreload\(aq time is the time during which the server
was paused.
.sp
The \fB+p\fP option makes the reload not pause threads, they keep running.
Locks are acquired, but items are updated in sequence, so it is possible
for threads to see an inconsistent state with some options from the old
and some options from the new config, such as cache TTL parameters from the
old config and forwards from the new config.
The stubs and forwards are updated at the same time, so that they are
viewed consistently, either old or new values together.
The option makes the reload time take eg. 3 microseconds instead of 0.3
milliseconds during which the worker threads are interrupted.
So, the interruption is much shorter, at the expense of some inconsistency.
After the reload itself, every worker thread is briefly contacted to make
them release resources, this makes the delete timing a little longer, and
takes up time from the remote control servicing worker thread.
.sp
With the nopause option (\fB+p\fP), the reload does not work to reload some
options, that fast reload works on without the nopause option:
\fI\%val\-bogus\-ttl\fP,
\fI\%val\-override\-date\fP,
\fI\%val\-sig\-skew\-min\fP,
\fI\%val\-sig\-skew\-max\fP,
\fI\%val\-max\-restart\fP,
\fI\%val\-nsec3\-keysize\-iterations\fP,
\fI\%target\-fetch\-policy\fP,
\fI\%outbound\-msg\-retry\fP,
\fI\%max\-sent\-count\fP,
\fI\%max\-query\-restarts\fP,
\fI\%do\-not\-query\-address\fP,
\fI\%do\-not\-query\-localhost\fP,
\fI\%private\-address\fP,
\fI\%private\-domain\fP,
\fI\%caps\-exempt\fP,
\fI\%nat64\-prefix\fP,
\fI\%do\-nat64\fP,
\fI\%infra\-host\-ttl\fP,
\fI\%infra\-keep\-probing\fP,
\fI\%ratelimit\fP,
\fI\%ip\-ratelimit\fP,
\fI\%ip\-ratelimit\-cookie\fP,
\fI\%wait\-limit\-netblock\fP,
\fI\%wait\-limit\-cookie\-netblock\fP,
\fI\%ratelimit\-below\-domain\fP,
\fI\%ratelimit\-for\-domain\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB+d\fP option makes the reload drop queries that the worker threads are
working on.
This is like
\fI\%flush_requestlist\fP\&.
Without it the queries are kept so that users keep getting answers for
those queries that are currently processed.
The drop makes it so that queries during the life time of the
query processing see only old, or only new config options.
.sp
When there are changes to the config tags, from the
\fI\%define\-tag\fP option,
then the \fB+d\fP option is implicitly turned on with a warning printout, and
queries are dropped.
This is to stop references to the old tag information, by the old
queries.
If the number of tags is increased in the newly loaded config, by
adding tags at the end, then the implicit \fB+d\fP option is not needed.
.sp
For response ip, that is actions associated with IP addresses, and perhaps
intersected with access control tag and action information, those settings
are stored with a query when it comes in based on its source IP address.
The old information is kept with the query until the queries are done.
This is gone when those queries are resolved and finished, or it is
possible to flush the requestlist with \fB+d\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B verbosity \fInumber\fP 
Change verbosity value for logging.
Same values as the \fBverbosity:\fP keyword in
\fI\%unbound.conf(5)\fP\&.
This new setting lasts until the server is issued a reload (taken from
config file again), or the next verbosity control command.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B log_reopen 
Reopen the logfile, close and open it.
Useful for logrotation to make the daemon release the file it is logging
to.
If you are using syslog it will attempt to close and open the syslog (which
may not work if chrooted).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stats 
Print statistics.
Resets the internal counters to zero, this can be controlled using the
\fBstatistics\-cumulative:\fP config statement.
Statistics are printed with one \fB[name]: [value]\fP per line.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stats_noreset 
Peek at statistics.
Prints them like the stats command does, but does not reset the internal
counters to zero.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B status 
Display server status.
Exit code 3 if not running (the connection to the port is refused), 1 on
error, 0 if running.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_zone \fIname type\fP 
Add new local zone with name and type.
Like local\-zone config statement.
If the zone already exists, the type is changed to the given argument.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_zone_remove \fIname\fP 
Remove the local zone with the given name.
Removes all local data inside it.
If the zone does not exist, the command succeeds.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_data \fIRR data...\fP 
Add new local data, the given resource record.
Like \fBlocal\-data:\fP keyword, except for when no covering zone exists.
In that case this remote control command creates a transparent zone with
the same name as this record.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_data_remove \fIname\fP 
Remove all RR data from local name.
If the name already has no items, nothing happens.
Often results in NXDOMAIN for the name (in a static zone), but if the name
has become an empty nonterminal (there is still data in domain names below
the removed name), NOERROR nodata answers are the result for that name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_zones 
Add local zones read from stdin of unbound\-control.
Input is read per line, with name space type on a line.
For bulk additions.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_zones_remove 
Remove local zones read from stdin of unbound\-control.
Input is one name per line.
For bulk removals.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_datas 
Add local data RRs read from stdin of unbound\-control.
Input is one RR per line.
For bulk additions.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B local_datas_remove 
Remove local data RRs read from stdin of unbound\-control.
Input is one name per line.
For bulk removals.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B dump_cache 
The contents of the cache is printed in a text format to stdout.
You can redirect it to a file to store the cache in a file.
Not supported in remote Unbounds in multi\-process operation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B load_cache 
The contents of the cache is loaded from stdin.
Uses the same format as dump_cache uses.
Loading the cache with old, or wrong data can result in old or wrong data
returned to clients.
Loading data into the cache in this way is supported in order to aid with
debugging.
Not supported in remote Unbounds in multi\-process operation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cache_lookup [\fB+t\fP] \fInames\fP 
Print to stdout the RRsets and messages that are in the cache.
For every name listed the content at or under the name is printed.
Several names separated by spaces can be given, each is printed.
When subnetcache is enabled, also matching entries from the subnet
cache are printed.
.sp
The \fB+t\fP option allows tld and root names.
With it names like \(aqcom\(aq and \(aq.\(aq can be used, but it takes a lot of
effort to look up in the cache.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B lookup \fIname\fP 
Print to stdout the name servers that would be used to look up the name
specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush [\fB+c\fP] \fIname\fP 
Remove the name from the cache.
Removes the types A, AAAA, NS, SOA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, PTR, SRV, NAPTR,
SVCB and HTTPS.
Because that is fast to do.
Other record types can be removed using \fBflush_type\fP or \fBflush_zone\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB+c\fP option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
If cachedb is in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_type [\fB+c\fP] \fIname type\fP 
Remove the name, type information from the cache.
.sp
The \fB+c\fP option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
If cachedb is in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_zone [\fB+c\fP] name 
Remove all information at or below the name from the cache.
The rrsets and key entries are removed so that new lookups will be
performed.
This needs to walk and inspect the entire cache, and is a slow operation.
The entries are set to expired in the implementation of this command (so,
with serve\-expired enabled, it\(aqll serve that information but schedule a
prefetch for new information).
.sp
The \fB+c\fP option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
If cachedb is in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_bogus [\fB+c\fP] 
Remove all bogus data from the cache.
.sp
The \fB+c\fP option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
If cachedb is in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_negative [\fB+c\fP] 
Remove all negative data from the cache.
This is nxdomain answers, nodata answers and servfail answers.
Also removes bad key entries (which could be due to failed lookups) from
the dnssec key cache, and iterator last\-resort lookup failures from the
rrset cache.
.sp
The \fB+c\fP option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
If cachedb is in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_stats 
Reset statistics to zero.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_requestlist 
Drop the queries that are worked on.
Stops working on the queries that the server is working on now.
The cache is unaffected.
No reply is sent for those queries, probably making those users request
again later.
Useful to make the server restart working on queries with new settings,
such as a higher verbosity level.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B dump_requestlist 
Show what is worked on.
Prints all queries that the server is currently working on.
Prints the time that users have been waiting.
For internal requests, no time is printed.
And then prints out the module status.
This prints the queries from the first thread, and not queries that are
being serviced from other threads.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B flush_infra \fIall|IP\fP 
If all then entire infra cache is emptied.
If a specific IP address, the entry for that address is removed from the
cache.
It contains EDNS, ping and lameness data.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B dump_infra 
Show the contents of the infra cache.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B set_option \fIopt: val\fP 
Set the option to the given value without a reload.
The cache is therefore not flushed.
The option must end with a \fB\(aq:\(aq\fP and whitespace must be between the
option and the value.
Some values may not have an effect if set this way, the new values are not
written to the config file, not all options are supported.
This is different from the set_option call in libunbound, where all values
work because Unbound has not been initialized.
.sp
The values that work are: statistics\-interval, statistics\-cumulative,
do\-not\-query\-localhost,  harden\-short\-bufsize, harden\-large\-queries,
harden\-glue, harden\-dnssec\-stripped, harden\-below\-nxdomain,
harden\-referral\-path,  prefetch, prefetch\-key, log\-queries, hide\-identity,
hide\-version, identity, version, val\-log\-level, val\-log\-squelch,
ignore\-cd\-flag, add\-holddown, del\-holddown, keep\-missing, tcp\-upstream,
ssl\-upstream, max\-udp\-size, ratelimit, ip\-ratelimit, cache\-max\-ttl,
cache\-min\-ttl, cache\-max\-negative\-ttl.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B get_option \fIopt\fP 
Get the value of the option.
Give the option name without a trailing \fB\(aq:\(aq\fP\&.
The value is printed.
If the value is \fB\(dq\(dq\fP, nothing is printed and the connection closes.
On error \fB\(aqerror ...\(aq\fP is printed (it gives a syntax error on unknown
option).
For some options a list of values, one on each line, is printed.
The options are shown from the config file as modified with set_option.
For some options an override may have been taken that does not show up with
this command, not results from e.g. the verbosity and forward control
commands.
Not all options work, see list_stubs, list_forwards, list_local_zones and
list_local_data for those.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_stubs 
List the stub zones in use.
These are printed one by one to the output.
This includes the root hints in use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_forwards 
List the forward zones in use.
These are printed zone by zone to the output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_insecure 
List the zones with domain\-insecure.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_local_zones 
List the local zones in use.
These are printed one per line with zone type.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_local_data 
List the local data RRs in use.
The resource records are printed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B insecure_add \fIzone\fP 
Add a domain\-insecure for the given zone, like the statement in
unbound.conf.
Adds to the running Unbound without affecting the cache
contents (which may still be bogus, use flush_zone to remove it), does not
affect the config file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B insecure_remove \fIzone\fP 
Removes domain\-insecure for the given zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B forward_add [\fB+it\fP] \fIzone addr ...\fP 
Add a new forward zone to running Unbound.
With \fB+i\fP option also adds a domain\-insecure for the zone (so it can
resolve insecurely if you have a DNSSEC root trust anchor configured for
other names).
The addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver names, like forward\-zone config in
unbound.conf.
The \fB+t\fP option sets it to use TLS upstream, like
\fI\%forward\-tls\-upstream: yes\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B forward_remove [\fB+i\fP] \fIzone\fP 
Remove a forward zone from running Unbound.
The \fB+i\fP also removes a domain\-insecure for the zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stub_add [\fB+ipt\fP] \fIzone addr ...\fP 
Add a new stub zone to running Unbound.
With \fB+i\fP option also adds a domain\-insecure for the zone.
With \fB+p\fP the stub zone is set to prime, without it it is set to
notprime.
The addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver names, like the \fBstub\-zone:\fP
config in unbound.conf.
The \fB+t\fP option sets it to use TLS upstream, like
\fI\%stub\-tls\-upstream: yes\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stub_remove [\fB+i\fP] \fIzone\fP 
Remove a stub zone from running Unbound.
The \fB+i\fP also removes a domain\-insecure for the zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B forward [\fIoff\fP | \fIaddr ...\fP ] 
Setup forwarding mode.
Configures if the server should ask other upstream nameservers, should go
to the internet root nameservers itself, or show the current config.
You could pass the nameservers after a DHCP update.
.sp
Without arguments the current list of addresses used to forward all queries
to is printed.
On startup this is from the forward\-zone \fB\(dq.\(dq\fP configuration.
Afterwards it shows the status.
It prints off when no forwarding is used.
.sp
If off is passed, forwarding is disabled and the root nameservers are
used.
This can be used to avoid to avoid buggy or non\-DNSSEC supporting
nameservers returned from DHCP.
But may not work in hotels or hotspots.
.sp
If one or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are given, those are then used to
forward queries to.
The addresses must be separated with spaces.
With \fB\(aq@port\(aq\fP the port number can be set explicitly (default port is 53
(DNS)).
.sp
By default the forwarder information from the config file for the root
\fB\(dq.\(dq\fP is used.
The config file is not changed, so after a reload these changes are gone.
Other forward zones from the config file are not affected by this command.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ratelimit_list [\fB+a\fP] 
List the domains that are ratelimited.
Printed one per line with current estimated qps and qps limit from config.
With \fB+a\fP it prints all domains, not just the ratelimited domains, with
their estimated qps.
The ratelimited domains return an error for uncached (new) queries, but
cached queries work as normal.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ip_ratelimit_list [\fB+a\fP] 
List the ip addresses that are ratelimited.
Printed one per line with current estimated qps and qps limit from config.
With \fB+a\fP it prints all ips, not just the ratelimited ips, with their
estimated qps.
The ratelimited ips are dropped before checking the cache.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list_auth_zones 
List the auth zones that are configured.
Printed one per line with a status, indicating if the zone is expired and
current serial number.
Configured RPZ zones are included.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B auth_zone_reload \fIzone\fP 
Reload the auth zone (or RPZ zone) from zonefile.
The zonefile is read in overwriting the current contents of the zone in
memory.
This changes the auth zone contents itself, not the cache contents.
Such cache contents exists if you set Unbound to validate with
\fBfor\-upstream: yes\fP and that can be cleared with \fBflush_zone\fP \fIzone\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B auth_zone_transfer \fIzone\fP 
Transfer the auth zone (or RPZ zone) from master.
The auth zone probe sequence is started, where the masters are probed to
see if they have an updated zone (with the SOA serial check).
And then the zone is transferred for a newer zone version.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rpz_enable \fIzone\fP 
Enable the RPZ zone if it had previously been disabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rpz_disable \fIzone\fP 
Disable the RPZ zone.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

Cookie secrets can be either \fBactive\fP or \fBstaging\fP\&.
\fBActive\fP cookie secrets are used to create DNS Cookies, but verification
of a DNS Cookie succeeds with any of the \fBactive\fP or \fBstaging\fP cookie
secrets.
The state of the current cookie secrets can be printed with the
\fI\%print_cookie_secrets\fP
command.
.sp
When there are no cookie secrets configured yet, the \fIsecret\fP is added as
\fBactive\fP\&.
If there is already an \fBactive\fP cookie secret, the \fIsecret\fP is added as
\fBstaging\fP or replacing an existing \fBstaging\fP secret.

After \fBall\fP nodes have the new secret \fBactive\fP for at least one hour,
the previous secret can be dropped with the

The setup requires a self\-signed certificate and private keys for both the
server and client.
The script \fBunbound\-control\-setup\fP generates these in the default run
directory, or with \fB\-d\fP in another directory.
If you change the access control permissions on the key files you can decide
who can use \fBunbound\-control\fP, by default owner and group but not all users.
Run the script under the same username as you have configured in
\fBunbound.conf\fP or as root, so that the daemon is permitted to read the
