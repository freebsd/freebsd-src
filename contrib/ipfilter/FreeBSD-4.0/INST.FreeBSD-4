To build a kernel with the IP filter, follow these seven steps:

	1. do "make freebsd4"

	2. do "make install-bsd"
	   (probably has to be done as root)

	3. run "FreeBSD-4/kinstall" as root

	4. build a new kernel

	5. install the new kernel
 
	6. If not using DEVFS, create devices for IP Filter as follows:
		mknod /dev/ipl c 79 0
		mknod /dev/ipnat c 79 1
		mknod /dev/ipstate c 79 2
		mknod /dev/ipauth c 79 3
 
	7. reboot
