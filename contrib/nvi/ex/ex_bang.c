 * "$t" as an argument if that is what the user entered.  Also, there's a
 * special expansion done for the bang command.  Any exclamation points in
 * the user's argument are replaced by the last, expanded ! command.

 * ways of getting here display the right things.  It took a long time to
 * get it right (wrong?), so be careful.
