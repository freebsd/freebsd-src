	 * mode, but the trailing backslashes were retained on the input.  We
	 * match historic practice except that we discard the backslashes.

	 * Input lines specified on the ex command line lines are separated by
	 * <newline>s.  If there is a trailing delimiter an empty line was
	 * inserted.  There may also be a leading delimiter, which is ignored
	 * unless it's also a trailing delimiter.  It is possible to encounter
	 * a termination line, i.e. a single '.', in a global command, but not
	 * necessary if the text insert command was the last of the global
