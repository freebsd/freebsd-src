 * "yl" do not.  Unfortunately, it's too late to change this now.  Matching
 * the historic semantics isn't easy.  The line number was always changed and
 * column movement was usually relative.  However, "y'a" moved the cursor to
 * the first non-blank of the line marked by a, while "y`a" moved the cursor
 * to the line and column marked by a.  Hopefully, the motion component code
 * got it right...   Unlike delete, we make no adjustments here.
