 * In historic vi, the section commands ignored empty lines, unlike the
 * paragraph commands, which was probably okay.  However, they also moved
 * to the start of the last line when there where no more sections instead
 * of the end of the last line like the paragraph commands.  I've changed
 * the latter behavior to match the paragraph commands.
 *
 * In historic vi, a section was defined as the first character(s) of the
 * line matching, which could be followed by anything.  This implementation
 * follows that historic practice.
 *
 * !!!
 * The historic vi documentation (USD:15-10) claimed:
 *	The section commands interpret a preceding count as a different
 *	window size in which to redraw the screen at the new location,
 *	and this window size is the base size for newly drawn windows
 *	until another size is specified.  This is very useful if you are
 *	on a slow terminal ...
 *
 * I can't get the 4BSD vi to do this, it just beeps at me.  For now, a
 * count to the section commands simply repeats the command.
