	 * Historic vi allowed "dl" when the cursor was on the last column,
	 * deleting the last character, and similarly allowed "dw" when
	 * the cursor was on the last column of the file.  It didn't allow
	 * "dh" when the cursor was on column 1, although these cases are
	 * not strictly analogous.  The point is that some movements would
	 * succeed if they were associated with a motion command, and fail
	 * otherwise.  This is part of the off-by-1 schizophrenia that
	 * plagued vi.  Other examples are that "dfb" deleted everything
	 * up to and including the next 'b' character, while "d/b" deleted
	 * everything up to the next 'b' character.  While this implementation
	 * regularizes the interface to the extent possible, there are many
	 * special cases that can't be fixed.  The special cases are handled
	 * by setting flags per command so that the underlying command and
	 * motion routines know what's really going on.
	 *
	 * The VM_* flags are set in the vikeys array and by the underlying
	 * functions (motion component or command) as well.  For this reason,
	 * the flags in the VICMD and VIKEYS structures live in the same name

	 * There are four cursor locations that we worry about: the initial
	 * cursor position, the start of the range, the end of the range,
	 * and the final cursor position.  The initial cursor position and
	 * the start of the range are both m_start, and are always the same.
	 * All locations are initialized to the starting cursor position by
	 * the main vi routines, and the underlying functions depend on this.
	 *
	 * Commands that can be motion components set the end of the range
	 * cursor position, m_stop.  All commands must set the ending cursor
	 * position, m_final.  The reason that m_stop isn't the same as m_final
	 * is that there are situations where the final position of the cursor
	 * is outside of the cut/delete range (e.g. 'd[[' from the first column
	 * of a line).  The final cursor position often varies based on the
	 * direction of the movement, as well as the command.  The only special
	 * case that the delete code handles is that it will make adjustments
	 * if the final cursor position is deleted.
	 *
	 * The reason for all of this is that the historic vi semantics were
	 * defined command-by-command.  Every function has to roll its own
	 * starting and stopping positions, and adjust them if it's being used
	 * as a motion component.  The general rules are as follows:
	 *
	 *	1: If not a motion component, the final cursor is at the end
	 *	   of the range.
	 *	2: If moving backward in the file, delete and yank move the
	 *	   final cursor to the end of the range.
	 *	3: If moving forward in the file, delete and yank leave the
	 *	   final cursor at the start of the range.
	 *
	 * Usually, if moving backward in the file and it's a motion component,
	 * the starting cursor is decremented by a single character (or, in a
	 * few cases, to the end of the previous line) so that the starting
	 * cursor character isn't cut or deleted.  No cursor adjustment is
	 * needed for moving forward, because the cut/delete routines handle
	 * m_stop inclusively, i.e. the last character in the range is cut or
	 * deleted.  This makes cutting to the EOF/EOL reasonable.
	 *
	 * The 'c', '<', '>', and '!' commands are special cases.  We ignore
	 * the final cursor position for all of them: for 'c', the text input
	 * routines set the cursor to the last character inserted; for '<',
	 * '>' and '!', the underlying ex commands that do the operation will
	 * set the cursor for us, usually to something related to the first
	 * <nonblank>.

/*
 * We use a single "window" for each set of vi screens.  The model would be
 * simpler with two windows (one for the text, and one for the modeline)
 * because scrolling the text window down would work correctly then, not
 * affecting the mode line.  As it is we have to play games to make it look
 * right.  The reason for this choice is that it would be difficult for
 * curses to optimize the movement, i.e. detect that the downward scroll
 * isn't going to change the modeline, set the scrolling region on the
 * terminal and only scroll the first part of the text window.
 *
 * Structure for mapping lines to the screen.  An SMAP is an array, with one
 * structure element per screen line, which holds information describing the
 * physical line which is displayed in the screen line.  The first two fields
 * (lno and off) are all that are necessary to describe a line.  The rest of
 * the information is useful to keep information from being re-calculated.
 *
 * The SMAP always has an entry for each line of the physical screen, plus a
 * slot for the colon command line, so there is room to add any screen into
 * another one at screen exit.
 *
 * Lno is the line number.  If doing the historic vi long line folding, soff
 * is the screen offset into the line.  For example, the pair 2:1 would be
 * the first screen of line 2, and 2:2 would be the second.  In the case of
 * long lines, the screen map will tend to be staggered, e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3,
 * 2:1, 3:1, etc.  If doing left-right scrolling, the coff field is the screen
 * column offset into the lines, and can take on any value, as it's adjusted
 * by the user set value O_SIDESCROLL.
