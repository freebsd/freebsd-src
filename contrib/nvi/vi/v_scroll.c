/*
 * The historic vi had a problem in that all movements were by physical
 * lines, not by logical, or screen lines.  Arguments can be made that this
 * is the right thing to do.  For example, single line movements, such as
 * 'j' or 'k', should probably work on physical lines.  Commands like "dj",
 * or "j.", where '.' is a change command, make more sense for physical lines
 * than they do for logical lines.
 *
 * These arguments, however, don't apply to scrolling commands like ^D and
 * ^F -- if the window is fairly small, using physical lines can result in
 * a half-page scroll repainting the entire screen, which is not what the
 * user wanted.  Second, if the line is larger than the screen, using physical
 * lines can make it impossible to display parts of the line -- there aren't
 * any commands that don't display the beginning of the line in historic vi,
 * and if both the beginning and end of the line can't be on the screen at
 * the same time, you lose.  This is even worse in the case of the H, L, and
 * M commands -- for large lines, they may all refer to the same line and
 * will result in no movement at all.
 *
 * Another issue is that page and half-page scrolling commands historically
 * moved to the first non-blank character in the new line.  If the line is
 * approximately the same size as the screen, this loses because the cursor
 * before and after a ^D, may refer to the same location on the screen.  In
 * this implementation, scrolling commands set the cursor to the first non-
 * blank character if the line changes because of the scroll.  Otherwise,
 * the cursor is left alone.
 *
 * This implementation does the scrolling (^B, ^D, ^F, ^U, ^Y, ^E), and the
 * cursor positioning commands (H, L, M) commands using logical lines, not
 * physical.
