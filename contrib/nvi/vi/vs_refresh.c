	 *
	 * Users can use the window, w300, w1200 and w9600 options to make
	 * the screen artificially small.  The behavior of these options
	 * in the historic vi wasn't all that consistent, and, in fact, it

	 *	1: The screen would expand in size, showing the line
	 *	2: The screen would scroll, showing the line
	 *	3: The screen would compress to its smallest size and
	 *		repaint.
	 * In general, scrolling didn't cause compression (200^D was handled
	 * the same as ^D), movement to a specific line would (:N where N
	 * was 1 line below the screen caused a screen compress), and cursor
	 * movement would scroll if it was 11 lines or less, and compress if
	 * it was more than 11 lines.  (And, no, I have no idea where the 11
	 * comes from.)
	 *
	 * What we do is try and figure out if the line is less than half of
	 * a full screen away.  If it is, we expand the screen if there's
	 * room, and then scroll as necessary.  The alternative is to compress
	 * and repaint.
	 *
	 * !!!
	 * This code is a special case from beginning to end.  Unfortunately,
	 * home modems are still slow enough that it's worth having.
	 *
	 * XXX
	 * If the line a really long one, i.e. part of the line is on the
	 * screen but the column offset is not, we'll end up in the adjust
	 * code, when we should probably have compressed the screen.
