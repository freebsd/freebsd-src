o Nvi was written by Keith Bostic, and the last version is 1.79.  After that,

	Sven Verdoolaege added the iconv support and the DB3 locking.

	Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino developed the file encoding detection
	techniques in his nvi-m17n.

o In nvi2, Zhihao Yuan incorporated the multibyte encoding support onto DB1.

	It was not possible without great support from Alexander Leidinger,
	Peter Wemm, and the FreeBSD community.

	Last but not least, money from Google Summer of Code.

o Since then,

	Todd C. Miller and Craig Leres adopted and refined the NetBSD-style
	expandtab option.

	Yamamoto Takashi, Matija Skala, and Jessica Clarke ported the
	software to macOS and Linux.

	Anthony J. Bentley made heroic efforts to modernize the code base
	and documentation, leveraging experience from OpenBSD to improve the
	quality of the project.

	...and many others, including Michael McConville, Marc Simpson,
	Jeffrey H. Johnson, Bosco Garc√≠a, Anton Konyahin, Walter Alejandro
	Iglesias, and those who tried hard to keep anonymous on GitHub :)
	Their insights render the software usable, secure, and sustainable.

The following acknowledgments were written by Keith Bostic:

o This software is several years old and is the product of many folks' work.

	This software was originally derived from software contributed to
	the University of California, Berkeley by Steve Kirkendall, the
	author of the vi clone elvis.  Without his work, this work would
	have been far more difficult.

	IEEE POSIX 1003.2 style regular expression support is courtesy of
	Henry Spencer, for which I am *very* grateful.

	Elan Amir did the original 4BSD curses work that made it possible
	to support a full-screen editor using curses.

	George Neville-Neil added the Tcl interpreter, and the initial
	interpreter design was his.

	Sven Verdoolaege added the Perl interpreter.

	Rob Mayoff provided the original Cscope support.

o Many, many people suggested enhancements, and provided bug reports and
  testing, far too many to individually thank.

o From the original vi acknowledgements, by William Joy and Mark Horton:

	Bruce Englar encouraged the early development of this display
	editor.  Peter Kessler helped bring sanity to version 2's
	command layout.  Bill Joy wrote versions 1 and 2.0 through 2.7,
	and created the framework that users see in the present editor.
	Mark Horton added macros and other features and made the editor
	work on a large number of terminals and Unix systems.

o And...
	The financial support of UUNET Communications Services is gratefully
	acknowledged.
