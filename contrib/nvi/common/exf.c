	 * So, the persistent readonly state has to be stored in the screen
	 * structure, and the edit option value toggles with the contents of
	 * the edit buffer.  If the persistent readonly flag is set, set the
	 * readonly edit option.
	 *

	 * or not a file is writeable, and the best that a user program can
	 * do is guess.  Obvious loopholes are files that are on a file system
	 * mounted readonly (access catches this one on a few systems), or
	 * alternate protection mechanisms, ACL's for example, that we can't
	 * portably check.  Lots of fun, and only here because users whined.
	 *
	 * !!!
	 * Historic vi displayed the readonly message if none of the file
	 * write bits were set, or if an an access(2) call on the path
	 * failed.  This seems reasonable.  If the file is mode 444, root
	 * users may want to know that the owner of the file did not expect
	 * it to be written.
	 *
	 * Historic vi set the readonly bit if no write bits were set for
	 * a file, even if the access call would have succeeded.  This makes
	 * the superuser force the write even when vi expects that it will
	 * succeed.  I'm less supportive of this semantic, but it's historic
	 * practice and the conservative approach to vi'ing files as root.
	 *
	 * It would be nice if there was some way to update this when the user
	 * does a "^Z; chmod ...".  The problem is that we'd first have to
	 * distinguish between readonly bits set because of file permissions
	 * and those set for other reasons.  That's not too hard, but deciding
	 * when to reevaluate the permissions is trickier.  An alternative
	 * might be to turn off the readonly bit if the user forces a write
	 * and it succeeds.

/*
 * set_alt_name --
 *	Set the alternate pathname.
 *
 * Set the alternate pathname.  It's a routine because I wanted some place
 * to hang this comment.  The alternate pathname (normally referenced using
 * the special character '#' during file expansion and in the vi ^^ command)
 * is set by almost all ex commands that take file names as arguments.  The
 * rules go something like this:
 *
 *    1: If any ex command takes a file name as an argument (except for the
 *	 :next command), the alternate pathname is set to that file name.
 *	 This excludes the command ":e" and ":w !command" as no file name
 *       was specified.  Note, historically, the :source command did not set
 *	 the alternate pathname.  It does in nvi, for consistency.
 *
 *    2: However, if any ex command sets the current pathname, e.g. the
 *	 ":e file" or ":rew" commands succeed, then the alternate pathname
 *	 is set to the previous file's current pathname, if it had one.
 *	 This includes the ":file" command and excludes the ":e" command.
 *	 So, by rule #1 and rule #2, if ":edit foo" fails, the alternate
 *	 pathname will be "foo", if it succeeds, the alternate pathname will
 *	 be the previous current pathname.  The ":e" command will not set
 *       the alternate or current pathnames regardless.
 *
 *    3: However, if it's a read or write command with a file argument and
 *	 the current pathname has not yet been set, the file name becomes
 *	 the current pathname, and the alternate pathname is unchanged.
 *
 * If the user edits a temporary file, there may be times when there is no
 * alternative file name.  A name argument of NULL turns it off.
