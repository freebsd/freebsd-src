 * and VWERASE characters described by the user's termios structure.
 *
 * Ex was not consistent with this scheme, as it historically ran in tty
 * cooked mode.  This meant that the scroll command and autoindent erase
 * characters were mapped to the user's EOF character, and the character
 * and word deletion characters were the user's tty character and word

 * !!!
 * The flag EC_NODIGIT probably needs some explanation.  First, the idea of
 * mapping keys is that one or more keystrokes act like a function key.
 * What's going on is that vi is reading a number, and the character following
 * the number may or may not be mapped (EC_MAPCOMMAND).  For example, if the
 * user is entering the z command, a valid command is "z40+", and we don't want
 * to map the '+', i.e. if '+' is mapped to "xxx", we don't want to change it
 * into "z40xxx".  However, if the user enters "35x", we want to put all of the
 * characters through the mapping code.
 *
 * Historical practice is a bit muddled here.  (Surprise!)  It always permitted
 * mapping digits as long as they weren't the first character of the map, e.g.
 * ":map ^A1 xxx" was okay.  It also permitted the mapping of the digits 1-9
 * (the digit 0 was a special case as it doesn't indicate the start of a count)
 * as the first character of the map, but then ignored those mappings.  While
 * it's probably stupid to map digits, vi isn't your mother.
 *
 * The way this works is that the EC_MAPNODIGIT causes term_key to return the
 * end-of-digit without "looking" at the next character, i.e. leaving it as the
 * user entered it.  Presumably, the next term_key call will tell us how the
 * user wants it handled.
 *
 * There is one more complication.  Users might map keys to digits, and, as
 * it's described above, the commands:
 *
 *	:map g 1G
 *	d2g
 *
 * would return the keys "d2<end-of-digits>1G", when the user probably wanted
 * "d21<end-of-digits>G".  So, if a map starts off with a digit we continue as
 * before, otherwise, we pretend we haven't mapped the character, and return
 * <end-of-digits>.
 *
 * Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about Energizer Bunny macros.
 * It's easy to create macros that expand to a loop, e.g. map x 3x.  It's
 * fairly easy to detect this example, because it's all internal to term_key.
 * If we're expanding a macro and it gets big enough, at some point we can
 * assume it's looping and kill it.  The examples that are tough are the ones
 * where the parser is involved, e.g. map x "ayyx"byy.  We do an expansion
 * on 'x', and get "ayyx"byy.  We then return the first 4 characters, and then
 * find the looping macro again.  There is no way that we can detect this
 * without doing a full parse of the command, because the character that might
 * cause the loop (in this case 'x') may be a literal character, e.g. the map
 * map x "ayy"xyy"byy is perfectly legal and won't cause a loop.
 *
 * Historic vi tried to detect looping macros by disallowing obvious cases in
 * the map command, maps that that ended with the same letter as they started
 * (which wrongly disallowed "map x 'x"), and detecting macros that expanded
 * too many times before keys were returned to the command parser.  It didn't
 * get many (most?) of the tricky cases right, however, and it was certainly
 * possible to create macros that ran forever.  And, even if it did figure out
 * what was going on, the user was usually tossed into ex mode.  Finally, any
 * changes made before vi realized that the macro was recursing were left in
 * place.  We recover gracefully, but the only recourse the user has in an
 * infinite macro loop is to interrupt.
 *
 * !!!
 * It is historic practice that mapping characters to themselves as the first
 * part of the mapped string was legal, and did not cause infinite loops, i.e.
 * ":map! { {^M^T" and ":map n nz." were known to work.  The initial, matching
 * characters were returned instead of being remapped.
 *
 * !!!
 * It is also historic practice that the macro "map ] ]]^" caused a single ]
 * keypress to behave as the command ]] (the ^ got the map past the vi check
 * for "tail recursion").  Conversely, the mapping "map n nn^" went recursive.
 * What happened was that, in the historic vi, maps were expanded as the keys
 * were retrieved, but not all at once and not centrally.  So, the keypress ]
 * pushed ]]^ on the stack, and then the first ] from the stack was passed to
 * the ]] command code.  The ]] command then retrieved a key without entering
 * the mapping code.  This could bite us anytime a user has a map that depends
 * on secondary keys NOT being mapped.  I can't see any possible way to make
 * this work in here without the complete abandonment of Rationality Itself.
 *
 * XXX
 * The final issue is recovery.  It would be possible to undo all of the work
 * that was done by the macro if we entered a record into the log so that we
 * knew when the macro started, and, in fact, this might be worth doing at some
 * point.  Given that this might make the log grow unacceptably (consider that
 * cursor keys are done with maps), for now we leave any changes made in place.
