/*
 * Marks are maintained in a key sorted singly linked list.  We can't
 * use arrays because we have no idea how big an index key could be.
 * The underlying assumption is that users don't have more than, say,
 * 10 marks at any one time, so this will be is fast enough.
 *
 * Marks are fixed, and modifications to the line don't update the mark's
 * position in the line.  This can be hard.  If you add text to the line,
 * place a mark in that text, undo the addition and use ` to move to the
 * mark, the location will have disappeared.  It's tempting to try to adjust
 * the mark with the changes in the line, but this is hard to do, especially
 * if we've given the line to v_ntext.c:v_ntext() for editing.  Historic vi
 * would move to the first non-blank on the line when the mark location was
 * past the end of the line.  This can be complicated by deleting to a mark
 * that has disappeared using the ` command.  Historic vi treated this as
 * a line-mode motion and deleted the line.  This implementation complains to
 * the user.
 *
 * In historic vi, marks returned if the operation was undone, unless the
 * mark had been subsequently reset.  Tricky.  This is hard to start with,
 * but in the presence of repeated undo it gets nasty.  When a line is
 * deleted, we delete (and log) any marks on that line.  An undo will create
 * the mark.  Any mark creations are noted as to whether the user created
 * it or if it was created by an undo.  The former cannot be reset by another
 * undo, but the latter may.
 *
 * All of these routines translate ABSMARK2 to ABSMARK1.  Setting either of
 * the absolute mark locations sets both, so that "m'" and "m`" work like
 * they, ah, for lack of a better word, "should".
