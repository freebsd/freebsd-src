This directory contains the necessary bits to get an NFS server
running in a rump kernel.  In essence, it's:

  * rpcbind
  * mountd
  * nfsd

Additionally, you need the libc rpc code which is in
tests/fs/common/nfsrpc.

TODO: make the standard nfs userspace services usable (the challenge
comes from rpc being in libc).
