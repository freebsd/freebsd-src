# The second child* instance (attaching at parentii) is useless: it will be
# shadowed by the first one, which is semantically the same, from a parentii
# device's point of view.
#
# The two child* instances are aliases, and at some point the orphan-checking
# code skipped some aliases, in the shadowing situation and some others.
#
# This test should pass, the lines are valid, even though the second one is
# useless.
