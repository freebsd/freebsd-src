.Sh NAME
.Nm blacklistctl
.Nd display and change the state of blacklistd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm dump
.Op Fl abdnrw
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program used to display the state of
.Xr blacklistd 8
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Show all database entries, by default it shows only the embryonic ones.
.It Fl b
Show only the blocked entries.
.It Fl d
Increase debugging level.
.It Fl n
Don't display a header.
.It Fl r

.It Fl w
Normally the width of addresses is good for IPv4, the
.Fl w
flag, makes the display wide enough for IPv6 addresses.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr blacklistd 8
.Sh NOTES
Sometimes the reported number of failed attempts can exceed the number
of attempts that
.Xr blacklistd 8
is configured to block.
This can happen either because the rule has been removed manually, or
because there were more attempts in flight while the rule block was being
added.
This condition is normal; in that case
.Xr blacklistd 8
will first attempt to remove the existing rule, and then it will re-add
it to make sure that there is only one rule active.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 7 .
.Fx
support for
.Nm
was implemented in
.Fx 11 .
