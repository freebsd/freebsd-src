.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm blocklistctl
.Nd display and change the state of the blocklistd database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm dump
.Op Fl abdnrw
.Op Fl D Ar dbname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program used to display and change the state of the
.Xr blocklistd 8
database.
The following sub-commands are supported:
.Ss dump
The following options are available for the
.Cm dump
sub-command:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Show all database entries, by default it shows only the active ones.
Inactive entries will be shown with a last-access (or, with
.Fl r ,
the remaining) time of
.Ql never .
.It Fl b
Show only the blocked entries.
.It Fl D Ar dbname
Specify the location of the
.Ic blocklistd
database file to use.
The default is
.Pa /var/db/blocklistd.db .
.It Fl d
Increase debugging level.
.It Fl n
Don't display a header.
.It Fl r
Show the remaining blocked time instead of the last activity time.
.It Fl w
Normally the width of addresses is good for IPv4, the
.Fl w
flag, makes the display wide enough for IPv6 addresses.
.El
.Pp
The output of the
.Cm dump
sub-command consists of a header (unless
.Fl n
was given) and one line for each record in the database, where each line
has the following columns:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ql rulename
The packet filter rule name associated with the database entry,
usually
.Dv blocklistd .
.It Ql address/ma:port
The remote address, mask, and local port number of the client connection
associated with the database entry.
.It Ql id
column will show the identifier for the packet filter rule associated
with the database entry, though this may only be the word
.Ql OK
for packet filters which do not create a unique identifier for each rule.
.It Ql nfail
The number of
.Em failures
reported for the client on the noted port, as well as the number of
failures allowed before blocking (or, with
.Fl a ,
an asterisk
.Aq * )
.It So last access Sc | So remaining time Sc
The last time a the client was reported as attempting access, or, with
.Fl r ,
the time remaining before the rule blocking the client will be removed.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr blocklistd 8
.Sh NOTES
Sometimes the reported number of failed attempts can exceed the number
of attempts that
.Xr blocklistd 8
is configured to block.
This can happen either because the rule has been removed manually, or
because there were more attempts in flight while the rule block was being
added.
This condition is normal; in that case
.Xr blocklistd 8
will first attempt to remove the existing rule, and then it will re-add
it to make sure that there is only one rule active.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 7 .
.Fx
support for
.Nm
was implemented in
.Fx 11 .
