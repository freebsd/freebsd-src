		#
		#	block in proto tcp/udp from any to any head blocklistd
		#
		# where "blocklistd" is the default rulename (i.e. "$2")
		#
		# This rule can come before any rule that logs connections,
		# etc., and should be followed by final rules such as:
		#
		#	# log all as-yet unblocked incoming TCP connection
		#	# attempts
		#	log in proto tcp from any to any flags S/SAFR
		#	# last "pass" match wins for all non-blocked packets
		#	pass in all
		#	pass out all
		#
		# I.e. a "pass" rule which will be the final match and override
		# the "block".  This way the rules added by blocklistd will
		# actually block packets, and prevent logging of them as
		# connections, because they include the "quick" flag.
		#
		# N.b.:  $port is not included/used in rules -- abusers are cut
		# off completely from all services!
		#
		# Note RST packets are not returned for blocked SYN packets of
		# active attacks, so the port will not appear to be closed.
		# This will probably give away the fact that a firewall has been
		# triggered to block connections, but it prevents generating
		# extra outbound traffic, and it may also slow down the attacker
		# somewhat.
		#
		# Note also that we don't block all packets, just new attempts
		# to open connections (see $flags above).  This allows us to do
		# counterespionage against the attacker (or continue to make use
		# of any other services that might be on the same subnet as the
		# supposed attacker).  However it does not kill any active
		# connections -- we rely on the reporting daemon to do its own
