.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions can be used by daemons to notify
.Xr blocklistd 8
about successful and failed remote connections so that blocklistd can
block or release port access to prevent Denial of Service attacks.
.Pp
The function
.Fn blocklist_open
creates the necessary state to communicate with
.Xr blocklistd 8
and returns a pointer to it, or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Pp
The function
.Fn blocklist_open2
is similar to
.Fn blocklist_open
but allows a
.Fa logger
to be specified.
If the
.Fa logger
is
.Dv NULL ,
then no logging is performed.
.Pp
The
.Fn blocklist_close
function frees all memory and resources used.
.Pp
The
.Fn blocklist
function sends a message to
.Xr blocklistd 8 ,
with an integer
.Ar action
argument specifying the type of notification,
a file descriptor
.Ar fd
specifying the accepted file descriptor connected to the client,
and an optional message in the
.Ar msg
argument.
.Pp
The
.Ar action
parameter can take these values:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv BLOCKLIST_ABUSIVE_BEHAVIOR"
.It Dv BLOCKLIST_AUTH_FAIL
There was an unsuccessful authentication attempt.
.It Dv BLOCKLIST_AUTH_OK
A user successfully authenticated.
.It Dv BLOCKLIST_ABUSIVE_BEHAVIOR
The sending daemon has detected abusive behavior
from the remote system.
The remote address should
be blocked as soon as possible.
.It Dv BLOCKLIST_BAD_USER
The sending daemon has determined the username
presented for authentication is invalid.
The
.Xr blocklistd 8
daemon compares the username to a configured list of forbidden
usernames and
blocks the address immediately if a forbidden username matches.
(The
.Dv BLOCKLIST_BAD_USER
support is not currently available.)
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn blocklist_r
function is more efficient because it keeps the blocklist state around.
.Pp
The
.Fn blocklist_sa
and
.Fn blocklist_sa_r
functions can be used with unconnected sockets, where
.Xr getpeername 2
will not work, the server will pass the peer name in the message.
.Pp
In all cases the file descriptor passed in the
.Fa fd
argument must be pointing to a valid socket so that
.Xr blocklistd 8
can establish ownership of the local endpoint
using
.Xr getsockname 2 .
.Pp
By default,
.Xr syslogd 8
is used for message logging.
The internal
.Fn bl_create
function can be used to create the required internal
state and specify a custom logging function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function
.Fn blocklist_open
returns a cookie on success and
.Dv NULL
on failure setting
.Dv errno
to an appropriate value.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn blocklist ,
.Fn blocklist_sa ,
and
.Fn blocklist_sa_r
return
.Dv 0
on success and
.Dv \-1
on failure setting
.Dv errno
to an appropriate value.
