# Within each test, the names of the sub-targets follow these

# * If it's expected that two or more targets may be made in parallel,
#   then the target names will differ only in an alphabetic component
#   such as ".a" or ".b".
# * If it's expected that two or more targets should be made in sequence
#   then the target names will differ in numeric components, such that
#   lexical ordering of the target names matches the expected order
#   in which the targets should be made.
#
# Targets may echo ${PARALLEL_TARG} to print a modified version
# of their own name, in which alphabetic components like ".a" or ".b"
# are converted to ".*".  Two targets that are expected to
# be made in parallel will thus print the same strings, so that the
# output is independent of the order in which these targets are made.
