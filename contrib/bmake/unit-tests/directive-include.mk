# restriction is not practically relevant since the expressions inside
# '.include' directives are typically kept as simple as possible.

# If the whole line were expanded before parsing, the filename to be included
# would be empty, and the closing '"' would be in the trailing part of the
# line, which is ignored as of 2021-12-03.

### TODO: expect+1: Could not find
# The following include directive behaves differently, depending on whether
# the current file has a slash or is a relative filename.  In the first case,
# make opens the directory of the current file and tries to read from it,
# resulting in the error message ":1: Zero byte read from file".
# In the second case, the error message is "Could not find ", without quotes
# or any other indicator for the empty filename at the end of the line.

# Since parse.c 1.612 from 2022-01-01 and before parse.c 1.620 from
# 2022-01-07, including an empty regular file called bmake_malloc(0), which
# may return a null pointer.  On OpenBSD, this led to a segmentation fault in
# Buf_InitSize, which assumes that bmake_malloc never returns NULL, just like
# all other places in the code.
