# Since 2020-09-13, undefined variables that are used on the left-hand side
# of a condition at parse time get a proper error message.  Before, the
# error message was "Malformed conditional" only, which was wrong and
# misleading.  The form of the condition is totally fine, it's the evaluation
# that fails.
#
# Since 2020-09-13, the "Malformed conditional" error message is not printed
# anymore.

# The dynamic variables like .TARGET are treated specially.  It does not make
# sense to expand them in the global scope since they will never be defined
# there under normal circumstances.  Therefore they expand to a string that
# will later be expanded correctly, when the variable is evaluated again in
# the scope of an actual target.
#
# Even though the "@" variable is not defined at this point, this is not an
# error.  In all practical cases, this is no problem.  This particular test
# case is made up and unrealistic.

# Since 2020-09-13, Var_Parse properly reports errors for undefined variables,

# hoping for the caller to print an error message.  This resulted in the
# well-known "Malformed conditional" error message, even though the
# conditional was well-formed and the only error was an undefined variable.
# expect+1: Variable "UNDEF" is undefined

# In a condition that has a defined(UNDEF) guard, all guarded conditions
# may assume that the variable is defined since they will only be evaluated

# or not.

# SysV modifier.

# In lint mode, the whole variable text is evaluated to check for unclosed
# expressions and unknown operators.  During this check, the subexpression
# '${:U2}' is not expanded, instead it is copied verbatim into the regular
# expression, leading to '.*=.{1,${:U2}}$'.
#
# Before var.c 1.856 from 2021-03-14, this regular expression was then
# compiled even though that was not necessary for checking the syntax at the
# level of expressions.  The unexpanded '$' then resulted in a wrong
# error message.
#
# This only happened in lint mode since in default mode the early check for
# unclosed expressions and unknown modifiers is skipped.
