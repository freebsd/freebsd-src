# The commit from 2005-05-01 intended to detect this situation, but it failed
# to do this since the call to is_token had its arguments switched.  They were
# expected as (str, token, token_len) but were actually passed as (token, str,
# token_len).  This made is_token return true even if the directive was
# directly followed by alphanumerical characters, which was wrong.  The
# typical cases produced an error message such as "Malformed conditional
# (x 123)", while the intended error message was "Unknown directive".
#
# Back at that time, the commits only modified the main code but did not add
# the corresponding unit tests.  This allowed the bug to hide for more than
# 15 years.
#
# Since 2020-11-10, the correct error message is produced.  The '.ifx' is no
# longer interpreted as a variant of '.if', therefore the '.error' and '.else'
# are interpreted as ordinary directives, producing the error messages
# "if-less else" and "if-less endif".
