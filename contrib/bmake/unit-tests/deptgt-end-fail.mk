# Until 2020-12-07, several of the test cases printed "`all' not remade
# because of errors.", followed by "exit status 0", which contradicted
# each other.

# Until 2020-12-07, '.END' was even made if 'all' failed, but if a dependency
# of 'all' failed, it was skipped.  This inconsistency was not needed for
# anything and thus has been dropped.  To run some commands on error, use the
# .ERROR target instead, see deptgt-error.mk.
