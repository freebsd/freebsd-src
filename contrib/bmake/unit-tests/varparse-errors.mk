# Demonstrate an edge case in which the 'static' for 'errorReported' in
# Var_Subst actually makes a difference, preventing "a plethora of messages".
# Given that this is an edge case and the error message is wrong and thus
# misleading anyway, that piece of code is probably not necessary.  The wrong
# condition was added in var.c 1.185 from 2014-05-19.
#
# To trigger this difference, the variable assignment must use the assignment
# operator ':=' to make VarEvalMode_ShouldKeepUndef return true.  There must
# be 2 expressions that create a parse error, which in this case is ':OX'.
# These expressions must be nested in some way.  The below expressions are
# minimal, that is, removing any part of it destroys the effect.
#
# Without the 'static', there would be one more message like this:
#	Undefined variable "${:U:OX"
#
#.MAKEFLAGS: -dv
IND=	${:OX}
# expect+4: Unknown modifier ":OX"
# expect+3: Unknown modifier ":OX"
# expect+2: Unknown modifier ":OX"
# expect+1: Unknown modifier ":OX"
