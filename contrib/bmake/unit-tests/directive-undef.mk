# Before var.c 1.737 from 2020-12-19, .undef only undefined the first
# variable, silently skipping all further variable names.
#
# Before var.c 1.761 from 2020-12-22, .undef complained about too many
# arguments.
#
# Since var.c 1.761 from 2020-12-22, .undef handles multiple variable names
# just like the .export directive.
