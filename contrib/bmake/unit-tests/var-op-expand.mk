# Similar to the two test cases above, the situation gets a bit more involved
# here, due to the double indirection.  The variable 'indirect' is supposed to
# be the lowercase version of the variable 'INDIRECT'.
#
# The assignment operator ':=' for the variable 'INDIRECT' could be a '=' as
# well, it wouldn't make a difference in this case.  The crucial detail is the
# assignment operator ':=' for the variable 'indirect'.  During this
# assignment, the variable modifier ':S,value,replaced,' is converted to
# lowercase, which turns 'S' into 's', thus producing an unknown modifier.
# In this case, make issues a warning, but in cases where the modifier
# includes a '=', the modifier would be interpreted as a SysV-style
# substitution like '.c=.o', and make would not issue a warning, leading to
# silent unexpected behavior.
#
# As of 2021-11-20, the actual behavior is unexpected.  Fixing it is not
# trivial.  When the assignment to 'indirect' takes place, the expressions
# from the nested expression could be preserved, like this:
#
#	Start with:
#
#		indirect:=	${INDIRECT:tl}
#
#	Since INDIRECT is defined, expand it, remembering that the modifier
#	':tl' must still be applied to the final result.
#
#		indirect:=	${LATER:S,value,replaced,} \
#				OK \
#				${LATER:value=sysv}
#
#	The variable 'LATER' is not defined.  An idea may be to append the
#	remaining modifier ':tl' to each expression that is starting with an
#	undefined variable, resulting in:
#
#		indirect:=	${LATER:S,value,replaced,:tl} \
#				OK \
#				${LATER:value=sysv:tl}
#
#	This would work for the first expression.  The second expression ends
#	with the SysV modifier ':from=to', and when this modifier is parsed,
#	it consumes all characters until the end of the expression, which in
#	this case would replace the suffix 'value' with the literal 'sysv:tl',
#	ignoring that the ':tl' was intended to be an additional modifier.
#
# Due to all of this, this surprising behavior is not easy to fix.
