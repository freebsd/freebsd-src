# Tests for indirect variable modifiers, such as in ${VAR:${M_modifiers}}.
# These can be used for very basic purposes like converting a string to either
# uppercase or lowercase, as well as for fairly advanced modifiers that first
# look like line noise and are hard to decipher.
#
# Initial support for indirect modifiers was added in var.c 1.101 from
# 2006-02-18.  Since var.c 1.108 from 2006-05-11 it is possible to use
# indirect modifiers for all but the very first modifier as well.


# To apply a modifier indirectly via another variable, the whole
# modifier must be put into a single expression.
# The following expression generates a parse error since its indirect
# modifier contains more than a sole expression.
#
# expect+1: Unknown modifier ":${"
.if ${value:L:${:US}${:U,value,replacement,}} != "S,value,replacement,}"

# Adding another level of indirection (the 2 nested :U expressions) helps.

# they are separated with colons.

# There is no practical use case for this feature though, as demonstrated
# in the test case directly below.

# empty string and is neither followed by a ':' nor '}', this produces a parse
