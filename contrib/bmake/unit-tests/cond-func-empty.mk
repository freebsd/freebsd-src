# Since the variable was undefined to begin with, the fallback value from the

# Since cond.c 1.76 from 2020-06-28 and before var.c 1.226 from 2020-07-02,
# the following example generated a wrong error message "Variable VARNAME is
# recursive".
#
# Since at least 1993, the manual page claimed that irrelevant parts of
# conditions were not evaluated, but that was wrong for a long time.  The
# expressions in irrelevant parts of the condition were actually evaluated,
# they just allowed undefined variables to be used in the conditions.  These
# unnecessary evaluations were fixed in several commits, starting with var.c
# 1.226 from 2020-07-02.
#
# In this example, the variable "VARNAME2" is not defined, so evaluation of
# the condition should have stopped at this point, and the rest of the
# condition should have been processed in parse-only mode.  The right-hand
# side containing the '!empty' was evaluated though, as it had always been.
#
# When evaluating the !empty condition, the variable name was parsed as
# "VARNAME${:U2}", but without expanding any nested expression, in
# this case the ${:U2}.  The expression '${:U2}' was replaced with an empty
# string, the resulting variable name was thus "VARNAME".  This conceptually
# wrong variable name should have been discarded quickly after parsing it, to
# prevent it from doing any harm.
#
# The expression was evaluated, and this was wrong.  The evaluation was done
# without VARE_EVAL (called VARF_WANTRES back then) though.  This had the
# effect that the ${:U1} from the value of VARNAME evaluated to an empty
# string.  This in turn created the seemingly recursive definition
# VARNAME=${VARNAME}, and that definition was evaluated even though it was
# never meant to be evaluated.
#
# This was fixed by evaluating nested expressions in the variable name only
# when the whole expression was evaluated as well.

# If the word 'empty' is not followed by '(', it is not a function call but an
