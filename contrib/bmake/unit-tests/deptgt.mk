# Tests for special targets like .BEGIN or .SUFFIXES in dependency
# declarations.

# TODO: Implementation

# Just in case anyone tries to compile several special targets in a single
# dependency line: That doesn't work, and make immediately rejects it.

# The following lines demonstrate how 'targets' is set and reset during
# parsing of dependencies.  To see it in action, set breakpoints in:
#
#	ParseDependency		at the beginning
#	FinishDependencyGroup	at "targets = NULL"
#	Parse_File		at "Lst_Free(targets)"
#	Parse_File		at "targets = Lst_New()"
#	ParseLine_ShellCommand	at "targets == NULL"
