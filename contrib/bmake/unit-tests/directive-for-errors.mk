# A slash is not whitespace, therefore this is not parsed as a .for loop.

# XXX: The error message is misleading though.  As of 2020-12-31, it says
# 'Unknown directive "for"', but that directive is actually known.  This is
# because ForEval does not detect the .for loop as such, so parsing
# continues in ParseLine > ParseDependencyLine > ParseDependency >
# ParseDependencyTargets > ParseErrorNoDependency, and there the directive
# name is parsed a bit differently.

# The '$$' was not replaced with the values '1' or '3' from the .for loop,
# instead it was kept as-is, and when the .info directive expanded its

# expression" ${$} got replaced though, even though this would be a parse
# error everywhere outside a .for loop.
