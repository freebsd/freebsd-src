/*
 * A search path is a list of CachedDir structures. A CachedDir has in it the
 * name of the directory and the names of all the files in the directory.
 * This is used to cut down on the number of system calls necessary to find
 * implicit dependents and their like. Since these searches are made before
 * any actions are taken, we need not worry about the directory changing due
 * to creation commands. If this hampers the style of some makefiles, they
 * must be changed.
 *
 * All previously-read directories are kept in openDirs, which is checked
 * first before a directory is opened.
 *
 * This cache is used by the multi-level transformation code in suff.c, which
 * tends to search for far more files than in regular explicit targets. After
 * a directory has been cached, any later changes to that directory are not
 * reflected in the cache. To keep the cache up to date, there are several
 * ideas:
 *
 * 1)	just use stat to test for a file's existence. As mentioned above,
 *	this is very inefficient due to the number of checks performed by
 *	the multi-level transformation code.
 *
 * 2)	use readdir() to search the directories, keeping them open between
 *	checks. Around 1993 or earlier, this didn't slow down the process too
 *	much, but it consumed one file descriptor per open directory, which
 *	was critical on the then-current operating systems, as many limited
 *	the number of open file descriptors to 20 or 32.
 *
 * 3)	record the mtime of the directory in the CachedDir structure and
 *	verify the directory hasn't changed since the contents were cached.
 *	This will catch the creation or deletion of files, but not the
 *	updating of files. However, since it is the creation and deletion
 *	that is the problem, this could be a good thing to do. Unfortunately,
 *	if the directory (say ".") were fairly large and changed fairly
 *	frequently, the constant reloading could seriously degrade
 *	performance. It might be good in such cases to keep track of the
 *	number of reloadings and if the number goes over a (small) limit,
 *	resort to using stat in its place.
 *
 * An additional thing to consider is that make is used primarily to create
 * C programs and until recently (as of 1993 or earlier), pcc-based compilers
 * didn't have an option to specify where the resulting object file should be
 * placed. This forced all objects to be created in the current directory.
 * This isn't meant as a full excuse, just an explanation of some of the
 * reasons for the caching used here.
 *
 * One more note: the location of a target's file is only performed on the
 * downward traversal of the graph and then only for terminal nodes in the
 * graph. This could be construed as wrong in some cases, but prevents
 * inadvertent modification of files when the "installed" directory for a
 * file is provided in the search path.
 *
 * Another data structure maintained by this module is an mtime cache used
 * when the searching of cached directories fails to find a file. In the past,
 * Dir_FindFile would simply perform an access() call in such a case to
 * determine if the file could be found using just the name given. When this
 * hit, however, all that was gained was the knowledge that the file existed.
 * Given that an access() is essentially a stat() without the copyout() call,
 * and that the same filesystem overhead would have to be incurred in
 * Dir_MTime, it made sense to replace the access() with a stat() and record
 * the mtime in a cache for when Dir_UpdateMTime was actually called.
