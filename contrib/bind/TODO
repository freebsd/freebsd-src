Things to do.  Each entry should contain the proposer, date proposed, and an
explaination of what's being proposed.  New ones are added at the bottom.
Note that the author/coordinator of BIND does not neccessarily endorse all
of the proposals listed herein; if you did not get explicit "buy-in" then
your changes may not be accepted even if they appear in proposal form here
in this file.

[Mark.Andrews@dms.CSIRO.AU 14dec94]: rfc952/rfc1123 host name compliance:
	-> Test domain names to ensure that the name conforms to the form
	   specified by RFC952 as modified by RFC1123.
	-> WARN if the domain name does not meet the conditions set by 
	   rfc952/rfc1123 for the following resource records.
		class == C_IN && type == T_A 
		class == C_IN && type == T_MX
	-> REJECT this records on the primary server.
	-> CNAME which doesn't match pointing to the above is also
	   illegal but harder to check.

[paul@vix.com 30nov94]: cause NOTIFY to track the IETF process for it;
	reorder ns_resp() again so that "Notify notimp" causes qdelete()
	but the host source address checking and so on is still done.

[paul@vix.com 25apr93]: clean up #ifdef's and portability
	feature #ifdef's should be limited to whole functions, which will be
	called no matter what and would only be non-empty if the feature is
	enabled.  allow feature ifdef's in .h files, though.

	portability #ifdef's should be limited to whole functions, too.  add
	a new portability.c module that implements anything which varies from
	system to system.

	add a second portability.h-like file that is included _before_ all the
	system includes.  portability.h as it stands is included _after_ all
	system includes, which is convenient for most things but not all.

[sater@cs.vu.nl 26apr93]: sortlist improvement
	Improve the code around the sortlist area to better cope with parallel
	networks of different speeds. The -i hack I sent to you could function
	as inspiration only.

[kre@munnari.oz.au 26apr93]: add an INN style control interface
	to replace sending signals.  With that expand debugging to
	permit monitoring of actions taken on a single query
	(query through control port, full traced as it occurs)
	or all queries that reference some particular name or
	zone, or which are forwarded, or asked, of some
	particluar server.   Allow reloads & dumps of a single
	zone, rather 	than the whole universe.  Allow selective
	cache pruning (to edit away bad data that's been obtained
	from somewhere)

[kre@munnari.oz.au 26apr93]: add a syntax to zone files (non rfc
	standard, but I don't care) to permit RR's to age away
	at some particular time, and others to become active at
	some particular time (probably with a syntax something
	like 	"<[date]"  or  "@[date]"   preceding, or in the
	former case, replacing, the TTL field of the record).
	Approaching "date" in the "<[date]" case, the TTL's on
	the record would be decreased, so no data cached anywhere	
	will remain valid after "date", after "date", this RR
	would simply be inoperative (essentially identical to
	a comment).  In the "@[date]" case (or perhaps ">[date]"
	for symmetry) the RR would be ignored until "date" at
	which time the "@[date]" field would simply be ignored.
	Both annotations could be used together (with
	appropriate interpretations depending on which date is
	earlier than the other).   Annotations on RR's in a zone
	would cause the SOA parameters to be automatically
	adjusted in zone transfers (and SOA requests) so that
	secondary servers would also hand out the same values
	(dropping the TTL down low as a "<[date]" approaches,
	and forcing a new zone transfer at "date").

[steve@uunet.uu.net 26apr93]: TXT RR improvements
	- fix TXT records so that they can deal properly with multiple
	strings (e.g., ``foo	IN	TXT	"aaa" "bbb"'').  This
	results in a fair number of smallish changes throughout the
	code and also throughout various tools (e.g., nslookup).

[kyle@uunet.uu.net 16may93]: need an option to die if primary zone file missing
	as of 4.9, a server will not forward a query if it is itself on the
	NS list for the relevant domain.  this means that if a primary server
	cannot load its zone file, it will not be able to answer queries in
	that zone -- it won't even forward them.  this is arguably correct,
	since it prevents bad forwarding loops when two or more servers are
	all unable to load the zone (primary or secondary, with secondary
	failures being the more common).  what is needed is real loop detection
	such that reasonable non-looping queries can be forwarded.  what we're
	likely to actually get is an option that causes named to just syslog
	and die if it can't load a primary zone file.  note that at present,
	named is running somewhat bare-assed since an expired zone in a
	secondary (or missing zone file in a primary) will cause that named
	to return SERVFAIL for all queries to that zone.  if your screwed up
	primary/secondary server is also the forwarding server for a collection
	of hosts, those hosts will get SERVFAIL's back from queries to the
	affected domains, and depending on the age of their resolvers, they
	might not try other servers after they get the first SERVFAIL.
	[ this entry was written by Paul Vixie after getting a problem report
	  from Kyle after uu.net disappeared in a brief but ugly way.  --vix ]

[paul@vix.com 05jun94]: things i'm expecting to fix someday:
	-> finish STATS (b+tree?), remove older A_RR-based tagging
	-> (more?) svr4 changes from wisner@well, marc@cam, istewart@datlog
	-> switch completely to posix-style signals
	-> xfrnets directives should aggregate
	-> syntactic sugar to use "mtime" of file as soa serial number
	-> better support for "firewalls" (zohar@ibm, minnich@dupont)
	-> attributes in TXT RR (cpw@lanl)
	-> fix database consistency problems during zone reloads (Bob Heiney)
	-> preliminary support for variable width subnet masks
	-> failover isn't working very well for hesiod queries (gshapiro)
	-> dig needs to be able to turn on RES_INSECURE{1,2} options
	-> clean out old RR's that lay within a newly loaded zone file (heiney)
	-> automatically refresh root.cache from the root servers periodically
	-> Makefiles should use/pass CFLAGS rather than modifying CC
	-> use Berkeley DB rather than malloc() for all database ops
	-> include files should be generated from templates
	-> use nvi-style port/* hierarchy, fewer portability #ifdef's
	-> make __res static, add procedural interface to replace "extern"'ing
	-> add hesiod/yp capable versions of get{pw,serv,???}by*()
	-> add hesiod/yp to get{net,host}by*()
	-> do something like solaris' /etc/nsswitch.conf (but in resolv.conf)
	-> we should only need one copy of binary->text, text->binary, and
	   packet marshalling/unmarshalling.  add general routines to -lresolv,
	   and rearrange the code to use them.
	-> apps that want to do DNS queries should not have to learn res_query;
	   a higher level interface should be provided, that has its own cache
	   and/or shares with the server's DB-based one.
	-> implement or integrate the next round of RFC's (coming soon).

[paul@vix.com 05jun95]: more things i'm expecting to fix someday:
	-> add "ndc checkconf" (i.e., "named -v")
