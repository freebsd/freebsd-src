<P>The server statement defines the characteristics to be
associated with a remote name server.</P>

<P>If you discover that a server is giving out bad data, marking it as
<CODE>bogus</CODE> will prevent further queries to it.  The default value of
<CODE>bogus</CODE> is <CODE>no</CODE>.  Marking a server as <CODE>bogus</CODE>
will mark all other addresses for that server as <CODE>bogus</CODE> when
a match is made when looking up a server's address by name. 

<P>The server supports two zone transfer methods.  The first,
<CODE>one-answer</CODE>, uses one DNS message per resource record
transferred.  <CODE>many-answers</CODE> packs as many resource records
as possible into a message.  <CODE>many-answers</CODE> is more
efficient, but is only known to be understood by BIND 8.1 and patched
versions of BIND 4.9.5.  You can specify which method to use for a
server with the <CODE>transfer-format</CODE> option.  If
<CODE>transfer-format</CODE> is not specified, the <CODE>transfer-format</CODE>
specified by the <CODE>options</CODE> statement will be used.

<P>The <CODE>transfers</CODE> will be used in a future release of the server
to limit the number of concurrent in-bound zone transfers from the specified
server.  It is checked for syntax but is otherwise ignored.

<P>The <CODE>keys</CODE> clause is used to identify a
<VAR>key_id</VAR> defined by the <CODE>key</CODE> statement, to be
used for transaction security when talking to the remote server.
The <CODE>key</CODE> statememnt must come before the <CODE>server</CODE>
statement that references it.  When a request is sent to the remote server,
a request signature will be generated using the key specified here and
appended to the message.  A request originating from the remote server is not
required to be signed by this key.
