WHAT IS TNFTP?
--------------

`tnftp' is a `port' of the NetBSD FTP client to other systems.
See http://www.NetBSD.org/ for more details about NetBSD.

tnftp was formerly known as `lukemftp'
It was renamed to `tnftp' by Luke Mewburn in February 2003.

The enhancements over the standard ftp client in 4.4BSD (and
derivatives) include:
	* command-line editing within ftp
	* command-line fetching of URLS, including support for:
	    - http proxies (see $http_proxy, $ftp_proxy)
	    - authentication
	* configurable prompt
	* context sensitive command and filename completion
	* dynamic progress bar
	* feature negotiation extensions from RFC 2389
	  (see `feat' and `remopts')
	* extensions to ftp from the IETF ftpext working group
	  (see `mlsd' and `mlst')
	* IPv6 support (from the WIDE project)
	* modification time preservation
	* paging of local and remote files, and of directory listings
	  (see `lpage', `page', `pdir')
	* passive mode support, with fallback to active mode
	* retrieval of filenames listed in a given file (see `fget')
	* `set option' override of ftp environment variables
	* TIS Firewall Toolkit gate ftp proxy support (see `gate')
	* transfer-rate throttling (see `-T', `rate')
	* uploading of files on the command line (see `-u')
	* (Dante) SOCKS5 support

Previous features, currently disabled until a test system is available:
	* SOCKS4 support
