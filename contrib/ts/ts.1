.Sh NAME
.Nm ts
.Nd timestamp input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl i | s
.Op Fl m
.Op Ar format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prepends a timestamp to each line of standard input and writes
it to standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Display time elapsed since the last timestamp.
.It Fl m
Display timestamps derived from a strictly linearly increasing clock.
Without
.Fl m ,
timestamps reflect the current date and time, including time jumps if the
system time is changed.
.It Fl s
Display time elapsed since the start of the program.
.El
.Pp
The optional
.Ar format
argument controls how the timestamp is displayed, according to the conversion
specifications described in the
.Xr strftime 3
manual page.
The default format is
.Qq %b %d %H:%M:%S ;
or
.Qq %H:%M:%S
if one of the
.Fl i
or
.Fl s
options is used.
.Pp
Some additional conversion specifications are also supported
to append microsecond resolution:
.Cm %.S ,
.Cm %.s ,
and
.Cm %.T ;
which are similar to
.Cm %S ,
.Cm %s ,
and
.Cm \&%T .
Examples:
.Qq 10.00001 ,
.Qq 1656427781.00001 ,
and
.Qq 4:20:00.00001 .
