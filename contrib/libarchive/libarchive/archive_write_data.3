.Dt ARCHIVE_WRITE_DATA 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm archive_write_data ,
.Nm archive_write_data_block
.Nd functions for creating archives
.Sh LIBRARY
Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In archive.h
.Ft la_ssize_t
.Fn archive_write_data "struct archive *" "const void *" "size_t"
.Ft la_ssize_t
.Fn archive_write_data_block "struct archive *" "const void *" "size_t size" "int64_t offset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fn archive_write_data
Write data corresponding to the header just written.
.It Fn archive_write_data_block
Write data corresponding to the header just written.
This is like
.Fn archive_write_data
except that it performs a seek on the file being
written to the specified offset before writing the data.
This is useful when restoring sparse files from archive
formats that support sparse files.
Returns number of bytes written or -1 on error.
(Note: This is currently not supported for
.Tn archive_write
handles, only for
.Tn archive_write_disk
handles.
.El
.\" .Sh EXAMPLE
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function returns the number of bytes actually written, or
a negative error code on error.
.\"
.Sh ERRORS
Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
.Fn archive_errno
and
.Fn archive_error_string
functions.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
In libarchive 3.x, this function sometimes returns
zero on success instead of returning the number of bytes written.
Specifically, this occurs when writing to an
.Vt archive_write_disk
handle.
Clients should treat any value less than zero as an error
and consider any non-negative value as success.
