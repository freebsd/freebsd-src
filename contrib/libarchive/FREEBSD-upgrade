libarchive

The source code is pulled with git:

	git clone git://github.com/libarchive/libarchive.git

The git branch for imports is named vendor/libarchive.

For the contrib directory files and directories were pruned by:

sh -c 'for F in `cat FREEBSD-Xlist | grep -v FreeBSD`; do rm -rf ./$F ; done'

You may check if there are any new files that we don't need and add them to
FREEBSD-Xlist.

The instructions for importing new release and merging to main can be found
in the Committers' Guide:

	https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/committers-guide/#vendor-import-git

To make local changes to libarchive, simply patch and commit to the main
branch.  Never make local changes on the vendor branch.
