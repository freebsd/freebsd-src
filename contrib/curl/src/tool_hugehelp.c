"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       curl [options] [URL...]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       curl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the\n"
"       supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,\n"

 fputs(
"       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS,\n"
"       TELNET and TFTP).  The command is designed to work without user  inter-\n"
"       action.\n"
"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-\n"

"       features will make your head spin!\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"
"       libcurl(3) for details.\n"
"\n"
"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\n"
"       tion in RFC 3986.\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\n"
"       within braces as in:\n"
"\n"
"        http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
"\n"

 fputs(
"        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)\n"
"        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt\n"
"\n"
"       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\n"
"       to each other:\n"
"\n"
"        http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be\n"
"       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number\n"

"\n"
"       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to\n"

"PROGRESS METER\n"
"       curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating\n"
"       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time\n"

"       it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output\n"

"\n"
"       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to\n"
"       redirect the response output to a file, using shell  redirect  (>),  -o\n"
"       [file] or similar.\n"
"\n"
"       It  is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit\n"

"       If you prefer a progress \"bar\" instead of the regular meter, -# is your\n"
"       friend.\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       Options  start  with  one or two dashes. Many of the options require an\n"
"       additional value next to them.\n"
"\n"
"       The short \"single-dash\" form of the options, -d  for  example,  may  be\n"
"       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space\n"

"       Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used\n"
"       immediately next to each other, like for example you  can  specify  all\n"
