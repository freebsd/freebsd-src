.TH IBPRINTRT 8 "May 31, 2007" "OpenIB" "OpenIB Diagnostics"

.SH NAME
ibprintrt.pl \- print either only the router specified or a list of routers from the ibnetdiscover output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibprintrt.pl
[-R -l -C <ca_name> -P <ca_port>] [<rt_guid|node_name>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Faster than greping/viewing with an editor the output of ibnetdiscover,
ibprintrt.pl will parse out and print either the router information for the
specified IB router or a list of all IB routers in the subnet.

Finally, ibprintrt.pl will also reuse the cached ibnetdiscover output from
some of the other diag tools which makes it a bit faster than running
ibnetdiscover from scratch.


.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
List the Rts (simply a wrapper for ibrouters).
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Recalculate the ibnetdiscover information, ie do not use the cached
information.  This option is slower but should be used if the diag tools have
not been used for some time or if there are other reasons to believe that
the fabric has changed.
.TP
\fB\-C <ca_name>\fR    use the specified ca_name for the search.
.TP
\fB\-P <ca_port>\fR    use the specified ca_port for the search.
