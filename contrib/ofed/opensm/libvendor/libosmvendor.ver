# In this file we track the current API version
# of the vendor interface (and libraries)
# The version is built of the following
# tree numbers:
# API_REV:RUNNING_REV:AGE
# API_REV - advance on any added API
# RUNNING_REV - advance any change to the vendor files
# AGE - number of backward versions the API still supports
