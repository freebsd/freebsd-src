rdma_client \- simple RDMA CM connection and ping-pong test.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
\fIrdma_client\fR [-s server_address] [-p server_port]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Uses synchronous librdmam calls to establish an RDMA connection between
two nodes.  This example is intended to provide a very simple coding
example of how to use RDMA.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-s server_address
Specifies the address of the system that the rdma_server is running on.
By default, the client will attempt to connect to the server using
127.0.0.1.
.TP
\-p server_port
Specifies the port number that the server listens on.  By default the server
listens on port 7471.
.SH "NOTES"
Basic usage is to start rdma_server, then connect to the server using the
rdma_client program.
.P
Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must ensure
that they have available system resources and permissions.  See the
libibverbs README file for additional details.
