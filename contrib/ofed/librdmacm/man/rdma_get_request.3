.SH NAME
rdma_get_request \- Retrieves the next pending connection request event.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_get_request
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" listen ","
.BI "struct rdma_cm_id **" id ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "listen" 12
Listening rdma_cm_id.
.IP "id" 12
rdma_cm_id associated with the new connection.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Retrieves a connection request event.  If no requests are pending,
the call will block until an event is received.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be
set to indicate the failure reason.
.SH "NOTES"
This call may only be used on listening rdma_cm_id's operating
synchronously.  On success, a new rdma_cm_id representing the
connection request will be returned to the user.  The new rdma_cm_id
will reference event information associated with the request until
the user calls rdma_reject, rdma_accept, or rdma_destroy_id on the
newly created identifier.  For a description of the event data,
see rdma_get_cm_event.
.P
If QP attributes are associated with the listening endpoint, the
returned rdma_cm_id will also reference an allocated QP.
