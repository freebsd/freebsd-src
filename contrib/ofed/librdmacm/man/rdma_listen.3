.SH NAME
rdma_listen \- Listen for incoming connection requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_listen
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" id ","
.BI "int " backlog ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
RDMA identifier.
.IP "backlog" 12
backlog of incoming connection requests.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initiates a listen for incoming connection requests or datagram service
lookup.  The listen will be restricted to the locally bound source
address.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be
set to indicate the failure reason.
.SH "NOTES"
Users must have bound the rdma_cm_id to a local address by calling
rdma_bind_addr before calling this routine.  If the rdma_cm_id is
bound to a specific IP address, the listen will be restricted to that
address and the associated RDMA device.  If the rdma_cm_id is bound
to an RDMA port number only, the listen will occur across all RDMA
devices.
