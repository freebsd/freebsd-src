.SH NAME
rdma_bind_addr \- Bind an RDMA identifier to a source address.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_bind_addr
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" id ","
.BI "struct sockaddr *" addr ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
RDMA identifier.
.IP "addr" 12
Local address information.  Wildcard values are permitted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Associates a source address with an rdma_cm_id.  The address may be
wildcarded.  If binding to a specific local address, the rdma_cm_id
will also be bound to a local RDMA device.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be
set to indicate the failure reason.
.SH "NOTES"
Typically, this routine is called before calling rdma_listen to bind
to a specific port number, but it may also be called on the active side
of a connection before calling rdma_resolve_addr to bind to a specific
address.
.P
If used to bind to port 0, the rdma_cm will select an available port,
which can be retrieved with rdma_get_src_port(3).
