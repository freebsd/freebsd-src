.SH NAME
rdma_xclient \- RDMA CM communication client test program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
\fIrdma_xclient\fR [-s server_address] [-p server_port] [-c comm_type]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Uses synchronous librdmam calls to establish an RDMA connection between
two nodes.  This example is intended to provide a very simple coding
example of how to use RDMA.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-s server_address
Specifies the address of the system that the rdma_server is running on.
By default, the client will attempt to connect to the server using
127.0.0.1.
.TP
\-p server_port
Specifies the port number that the server listens on.  By default the server
listens on port 7471.
.TP
\-c communication type
Specifies the type of communication established with the server program.  'r'
results in using a reliable-connected QP (the default).  'x' uses
extended reliable-connected XRC QPs.
.SH "NOTES"
Basic usage is to start rdma_xserver, then connect to the server using the
rdma_client program.
.P
Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must ensure
that they have available system resources and permissions.  See the
libibverbs README file for additional details.
