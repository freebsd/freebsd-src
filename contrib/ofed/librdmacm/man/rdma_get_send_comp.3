.SH NAME
rdma_get_send_comp \- retrieves a completed send, read, or write request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>"
.P
.B "int" rdma_get_send_comp
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *" id ","
.BI "struct ibv_wc *" wc ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
A reference to a communication identifier to check for completions.
.IP "wc" 12
A reference to a work completion structure to fill in.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Retrieves a completed work request for a send, RDMA read, or RDMA write
operation.  Information about the completed request is returned through
the wc parameter, with the wr_id set to the context of the request.  For
details on the work completion structure, see ibv_poll_cq.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the number of returned completions (0 or 1) on success, or -1 on error.
If an error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure reason.
.SH "NOTES"
This calls polls the send completion queue associated with an rdma_cm_id.
If a completion is not found, the call blocks until a request completes.
This call should only be used on rdma_cm_id's that do not share CQs
with other rdma_cm_id's, and maintain separate CQs for sends and receive
completions.
