The tcsh code has been tested on a solaris-2.6 machine and a
NetBSD-1.3H machine running before, and after the year 2000. The
code has been also visually inspected for Y2K compliance problems.
Tcsh does not use time functions for anything but display purposes,
so its operation should not be affected assuming that the time
related functions of the c library work properly.

Note: Since the last audit, tcsh-6.08.00 has been found to have
a minor problem with %y in the prompt (it will print 10 instead
of 00 in y2k). This has been fixed in tcsh-6.09.00.
