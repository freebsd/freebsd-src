usage: %s [options] [file...]

bc is a command-line, arbitrary-precision calculator with a Turing-complete
language. For details, use `man %s` or see the online documentation at
https://git.gavinhoward.com/gavin/bc/src/tag/%s/manuals/bc/%s.1.md.

This bc is compatible with both the GNU bc and the POSIX bc spec. See the GNU bc
manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html) and bc spec
(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html)
for details.

This bc has three differences to the GNU bc:

  1) Arrays can be passed to the builtin "length" function to get the number of
     elements currently in the array. The following example prints "1":

       a[0] = 0
       length(a[])

  2) The precedence of the boolean "not" operator (!) is equal to that of the
     unary minus (-), or negation, operator. This still allows POSIX-compliant
     scripts to work while somewhat preserving expected behavior (versus C) and
     making parsing easier.
  3) This bc has many more extensions than the GNU bc does. For details, see the
     man page or online documentation.

This bc also implements the dot (.) extension of the BSD bc.

Options:

  -C  --no-digit-clamp

      Disables clamping of digits that are larger than or equal to the current
      ibase when parsing numbers.

      This means that the value added to a number from a digit is always that
      digit's value multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power of the
      digit's position, which starts from 0 at the least significant digit.

      If multiple of this option and the -c option are given, the last is used.

  -c  --digit-clamp

      Enables clamping of digits that are larger than or equal to the current
      ibase when parsing numbers.

      This means that digits that the value added to a number from a digit that
      is greater than or equal to the ibase is the value of ibase minus 1 all
      multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power of the digit's
      position, which starts from 0 at the least significant digit.

      If multiple of this option and the -C option are given, the last is used.
{{ A H N HN }}

  -E  seed  --seed=seed

      Sets the builtin variable seed to the given value assuming that the given
      value is in base 10. It is a fatal error if the given value is not a valid
      number.
{{ end }}

  -e  expr  --expression=expr

      Run "expr" and quit. If multiple expressions or files (see below) are
      given, they are all run before executing from stdin.

  -f  file  --file=file

      Run the bc code in "file" and exit. See above as well.

  -g  --global-stacks

      Turn scale, ibase, and obase into stacks. This makes the value of each be
      be restored on returning from functions. See the man page or online
      documentation for more details.

  -h  --help

      Print this usage message and exit.

  -I  ibase  --ibase=ibase

      Sets the builtin variable ibase to the given value assuming that the given
      value is in base 10. It is a fatal error if the given value is not a valid
      number.

  -i  --interactive

      Force interactive mode.

  -L  --no-line-length

      Disable line length checking.

  -l  --mathlib

      Use predefined math routines:

          s(expr)  =  sine of expr in radians
          c(expr)  =  cosine of expr in radians
          a(expr)  =  arctangent of expr, returning radians
          l(expr)  =  natural log of expr
          e(expr)  =  raises e to the power of expr
          j(n, x)  =  Bessel function of integer order n of x

      This bc may load more functions with these options. See the manpage or
      online documentation for details.

  -O  obase  --obase=obase

      Sets the builtin variable obase to the given value assuming that the given
      value is in base 10. It is a fatal error if the given value is not a valid
      number.

  -P  --no-prompt

      Disable the prompts in interactive mode.

  -R  --no-read-prompt

      Disable the read prompt in interactive mode.

  -r  keyword  --redefine=keyword

      Redefines "keyword" and allows it to be used as a function, variable, and
      array name. This is useful when this bc gives parse errors on scripts
      meant for other bc implementations.

      Only keywords that are not in the POSIX bc spec may be redefined.

      It is a fatal error to attempt to redefine a keyword that cannot be
      redefined or does not exist.

  -q  --quiet

      Don't print version and copyright.

  -S  scale  --scale=scale

      Sets the builtin variable scale to the given value assuming that the given
      value is in base 10. It is a fatal error if the given value is not a valid
      number.

  -s  --standard

      Error if any non-POSIX extensions are used.

  -w  --warn

      Warn if any non-POSIX extensions are used.

  -v  --version

      Print version information and copyright and exit.

  -z  --leading-zeroes

      Enable leading zeroes on numbers greater than -1 and less than 1.

Environment variables:

  POSIXLY_CORRECT

      Error if any non-POSIX extensions are used.

  BC_ENV_ARGS

      Command-line arguments to use on every run.

  BC_LINE_LENGTH

      If an integer, the number of characters to print on a line before
      wrapping. Using 0 will disable line length checking.

  BC_BANNER

      If an integer and non-zero, display the copyright banner in interactive
      mode.

      If zero, disable the banner.

      Overrides the default, which is %s print the banner.

  BC_SIGINT_RESET

      If an integer and non-zero, reset on SIGINT, rather than exit, when in
      interactive mode.

      If zero, do not reset on SIGINT in all cases, but exit instead.

      Overrides the default, which is %s.

  BC_TTY_MODE

      If an integer and non-zero, enable TTY mode when it is available.

      If zero, disable TTY mode in all cases.

      Overrides the default, which is TTY mode %s.

  BC_PROMPT

      If an integer and non-zero, enable prompt when TTY mode is possible.

      If zero, disable prompt in all cases.

      Overrides the default, which is prompt %s.

  BC_EXPR_EXIT

      If an integer and non-zero, exit when expressions or expression files are
      given on the command-line, and does not exit when an integer and zero.

      Overrides the default, which is %s.

  BC_DIGIT_CLAMP

      If an integer and non-zero, clamp digits larger than or equal to the
      current ibase when parsing numbers.

      Overrides the default, which is %s.
