usage: %s [options] [file...]

bc is a command-line, arbitrary-precision calculator with a Turing-complete
language. For details, use `man %s`.

This bc is compatible with both the GNU bc and the POSIX bc spec. See the GNU bc
manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html) and bc spec
(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html)
for details.

This bc has three differences to the GNU bc:

  1) Arrays can be passed to the builtin "length" function to get the number of
     elements currently in the array. The following example prints "1":

       a[0] = 0
       length(a[])

  2) The precedence of the boolean "not" operator (!) is equal to that of the
     unary minus (-), or negation, operator. This still allows POSIX-compliant
     scripts to work while somewhat preserving expected behavior (versus C) and
     making parsing easier.
  3) This bc has many more extensions than the GNU bc does. For details, see the
     man page.

This bc also implements the dot (.) extension of the BSD bc.

Options:

  -e  expr  --expression=expr

      Run "expr" and quit. If multiple expressions or files (see below) are
      given, they are all run before executing from stdin.

  -f  file  --file=file

      Run the bc code in "file" and exit. See above as well.

  -g  --global-stacks

      Turn scale, ibase, and obase into stacks. This makes the value of each be
      be restored on returning from functions. See the man page for more
      details.

  -h  --help

      Print this usage message and exit.

  -i  --interactive

      Force interactive mode.

  -l  --mathlib

      Use predefined math routines:

          s(expr)  =  sine of expr in radians
          c(expr)  =  cosine of expr in radians
          a(expr)  =  arctangent of expr, returning radians
          l(expr)  =  natural log of expr
          e(expr)  =  raises e to the power of expr
          j(n, x)  =  Bessel function of integer order n of x

      This bc may load more functions with these options. See the manpage for
      details.

  -P  --no-prompt

      Disable the prompt in interactive mode.

  -q  --quiet

      Don't print version and copyright.

  -s  --standard

      Error if any non-POSIX extensions are used.

  -w  --warn

      Warn if any non-POSIX extensions are used.

  -v  --version

      Print version information and copyright and exit.
