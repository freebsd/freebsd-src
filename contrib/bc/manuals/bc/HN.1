.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
bc(1) is an interactive processor for a language first standardized in
1991 by POSIX.
(See the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R] section.)
The language provides unlimited precision decimal arithmetic and is
somewhat C-like, but there are differences.
Such differences will be noted in this document.
.PP
After parsing and handling options, this bc(1) reads any files given on
the command line and executes them before reading from \f[B]stdin\f[R].
.PP
This bc(1) is a drop-in replacement for \f[I]any\f[R] bc(1), including
(and especially) the GNU bc(1).
It also has many extensions and extra features beyond other
implementations.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: If running this bc(1) on \f[I]any\f[R] script meant for
another bc(1) gives a parse error, it is probably because a word this
bc(1) reserves as a keyword is used as the name of a function, variable,
or array.
To fix that, use the command-line option \f[B]-r\f[R] \f[I]keyword\f[R],
where \f[I]keyword\f[R] is the keyword that is used as a name in the
script.
For more information, see the \f[B]OPTIONS\f[R] section.
.PP
If parsing scripts meant for other bc(1) implementations still does not
work, that is a bug and should be reported.
See the \f[B]BUGS\f[R] section.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following are the options that bc(1) accepts.
.TP
\f[B]-C\f[R], \f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R]
Disables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current
\f[B]ibase\f[R] when parsing numbers.
.RS
.PP
This means that the value added to a number from a digit is always that
digit\[cq]s value multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power
of the digit\[cq]s position, which starts from 0 at the least
significant digit.
.PP
If this and/or the \f[B]-c\f[R] or \f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R] options are
given multiple times, the last one given is used.
.PP
This option overrides the \f[B]BC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section) and the default, which
can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R], \f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R]
Enables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current
\f[B]ibase\f[R] when parsing numbers.
.RS
.PP
This means that digits that the value added to a number from a digit
that is greater than or equal to the ibase is the value of ibase minus 1
all multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power of the
digit\[cq]s position, which starts from 0 at the least significant
digit.
.PP
If this and/or the \f[B]-C\f[R] or \f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R] options
are given multiple times, the last one given is used.
.PP
This option overrides the \f[B]BC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section) and the default, which
can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-E\f[R] \f[I]seed\f[R], \f[B]--seed\f[R]=\f[I]seed\f[R]
Sets the builtin variable \f[B]seed\f[R] to the value \f[I]seed\f[R]
assuming that \f[I]seed\f[R] is in base 10.
It is a fatal error if \f[I]seed\f[R] is not a valid number.
.RS
.PP
If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is used.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-e\f[R] \f[I]expr\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R]=\f[I]expr\f[R]
Evaluates \f[I]expr\f[R].
If multiple expressions are given, they are evaluated in order.
If files are given as well (see the \f[B]-f\f[R] and \f[B]--file\f[R]
options), the expressions and files are evaluated in the order given.
This means that if a file is given before an expression, the file is
read in and evaluated first.
.RS
.PP
If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R], see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section),
then after processing all expressions and files, bc(1) will exit, unless
\f[B]-\f[R] (\f[B]stdin\f[R]) was given as an argument at least once to
\f[B]-f\f[R] or \f[B]--file\f[R], whether on the command-line or in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R].
However, if any other \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R],
\f[B]-f\f[R], or \f[B]--file\f[R] arguments are given after
\f[B]-f-\f[R] or equivalent is given, bc(1) will give a fatal error and
exit.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R] \f[I]file\f[R], \f[B]--file\f[R]=\f[I]file\f[R]
Reads in \f[I]file\f[R] and evaluates it, line by line, as though it
were read through \f[B]stdin\f[R].
If expressions are also given (see the \f[B]-e\f[R] and
\f[B]--expression\f[R] options), the expressions are evaluated in the
order given.
.RS
.PP
If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R], see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section),
then after processing all expressions and files, bc(1) will exit, unless
\f[B]-\f[R] (\f[B]stdin\f[R]) was given as an argument at least once to
\f[B]-f\f[R] or \f[B]--file\f[R].
However, if any other \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R],
\f[B]-f\f[R], or \f[B]--file\f[R] arguments are given after
\f[B]-f-\f[R] or equivalent is given, bc(1) will give a fatal error and
exit.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-g\f[R], \f[B]--global-stacks\f[R]
Turns the globals \f[B]ibase\f[R], \f[B]obase\f[R], \f[B]scale\f[R], and
\f[B]seed\f[R] into stacks.
.RS
.PP
This has the effect that a copy of the current value of all four are
pushed onto a stack for every function call, as well as popped when
every function returns.
This means that functions can assign to any and all of those globals
without worrying that the change will affect other functions.
Thus, a hypothetical function named \f[B]output(x,b)\f[R] that simply
printed \f[B]x\f[R] in base \f[B]b\f[R] could be written like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
define void output(x, b) {
    obase=b
    x
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
instead of like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
define void output(x, b) {
    auto c
    c=obase
    obase=b
    x
    obase=c
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This makes writing functions much easier.
.PP
(\f[B]Note\f[R]: the function \f[B]output(x,b)\f[R] exists in the
extended math library.
See the \f[B]LIBRARY\f[R] section.)
.PP
However, since using this flag means that functions cannot set
\f[B]ibase\f[R], \f[B]obase\f[R], \f[B]scale\f[R], or \f[B]seed\f[R]
globally, functions that are made to do so cannot work anymore.
There are two possible use cases for that, and each has a solution.
.PP
First, if a function is called on startup to turn bc(1) into a number
converter, it is possible to replace that capability with various shell
aliases.
Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
alias d2o=\[dq]bc -e ibase=A -e obase=8\[dq]
alias h2b=\[dq]bc -e ibase=G -e obase=2\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Second, if the purpose of a function is to set \f[B]ibase\f[R],
\f[B]obase\f[R], \f[B]scale\f[R], or \f[B]seed\f[R] globally for any
other purpose, it could be split into one to four functions (based on
how many globals it sets) and each of those functions could return the
desired value for a global.
.PP
For functions that set \f[B]seed\f[R], the value assigned to
\f[B]seed\f[R] is not propagated to parent functions.
This means that the sequence of pseudo-random numbers that they see will
not be the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers that any parent sees.
This is only the case once \f[B]seed\f[R] has been set.
.PP
If a function desires to not affect the sequence of pseudo-random
numbers of its parents, but wants to use the same \f[B]seed\f[R], it can
use the following line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
seed = seed
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the behavior of this option is desired for every run of bc(1), then
users could make sure to define \f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] and include this
option (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section for more
details).
.PP
If \f[B]-s\f[R], \f[B]-w\f[R], or any equivalents are used, this option
is ignored.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]--help\f[R]
Prints a usage message and exits.
.TP
\f[B]-I\f[R] \f[I]ibase\f[R], \f[B]--ibase\f[R]=\f[I]ibase\f[R]
Sets the builtin variable \f[B]ibase\f[R] to the value \f[I]ibase\f[R]
assuming that \f[I]ibase\f[R] is in base 10.
It is a fatal error if \f[I]ibase\f[R] is not a valid number.
.RS
.PP
If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is used.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-i\f[R], \f[B]--interactive\f[R]
Forces interactive mode.
(See the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R] section.)
.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-L\f[R], \f[B]--no-line-length\f[R]
Disables line length checking and prints numbers without backslashes and
newlines.
In other words, this option sets \f[B]BC_LINE_LENGTH\f[R] to \f[B]0\f[R]
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].

\f[B]-l\f[R], \f[B]--mathlib\f[R]
Sets \f[B]scale\f[R] (see the \f[B]SYNTAX\f[R] section) to \f[B]20\f[R]
and loads the included math library and the extended math library before
running any code, including any expressions or files specified on the

assuming that \f[I]obase\f[R] is in base 10.

\f[B]-P\f[R], \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R]
Disables the prompt in TTY mode.
(The prompt is only enabled in TTY mode.
See the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section.)
This is mostly for those users that do not want a prompt or are not used
to having them in bc(1).
Most of those users would want to put this option in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.RS
.PP
These options override the \f[B]BC_PROMPT\f[R] and \f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R]
environment variables (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R], \f[B]--quiet\f[R]
This option is for compatibility with the GNU bc(1)
(https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/); it is a no-op.
Without this option, GNU bc(1) prints a copyright header.
This bc(1) only prints the copyright header if one or more of the
\f[B]-v\f[R], \f[B]-V\f[R], or \f[B]--version\f[R] options are given
unless the \f[B]BC_BANNER\f[R] environment variable is set and contains
a non-zero integer or if this bc(1) was built with the header displayed
by default.
If \f[I]any\f[R] of that is the case, then this option \f[I]does\f[R]
prevent bc(1) from printing the header.
.RS

This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-R\f[R], \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R]
Disables the read prompt in TTY mode.
(The read prompt is only enabled in TTY mode.
See the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section.)
This is mostly for those users that do not want a read prompt or are not
used to having them in bc(1).
Most of those users would want to put this option in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
This option is also useful in hash bang lines of bc(1) scripts that
prompt for user input.
.RS
.PP
This option does not disable the regular prompt because the read prompt
is only used when the \f[B]read()\f[R] built-in function is called.
.PP
These options \f[I]do\f[R] override the \f[B]BC_PROMPT\f[R] and
\f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variables (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT

\f[B]-r\f[R] \f[I]keyword\f[R], \f[B]--redefine\f[R]=\f[I]keyword\f[R]
Redefines \f[I]keyword\f[R] in order to allow it to be used as a
function, variable, or array name.
This is useful when this bc(1) gives parse errors when parsing scripts
meant for other bc(1) implementations.

multiple times.

.PP
If no files or expressions are given by the \f[B]-f\f[R],
\f[B]--file\f[R], \f[B]-e\f[R], or \f[B]--expression\f[R] options, then
bc(1) reads from \f[B]stdin\f[R].
.PP
However, there are a few caveats to this.
.PP
First, \f[B]stdin\f[R] is evaluated a line at a time.
The only exception to this is if the parse cannot complete.
That means that starting a string without ending it or starting a
function, \f[B]if\f[R] statement, or loop without ending it will also
cause bc(1) to not execute.
.PP
Second, after an \f[B]if\f[R] statement, bc(1) doesn\[cq]t know if an
\f[B]else\f[R] statement will follow, so it will not execute until it
knows there will not be an \f[B]else\f[R] statement.
.SH STDOUT
.PP
Any non-error output is written to \f[B]stdout\f[R].
In addition, if history (see the \f[B]HISTORY\f[R] section) and the
prompt (see the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section) are enabled, both are output
to \f[B]stdout\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Unlike other bc(1) implementations, this bc(1) will
issue a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section) if it cannot
write to \f[B]stdout\f[R], so if \f[B]stdout\f[R] is closed, as in
\f[B]bc >&-\f[R], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that bc(1) can report problems when \f[B]stdout\f[R] is
redirected to a file.
.PP
If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other bc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stdout\f[R] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[R].
.SH STDERR
.PP
Any error output is written to \f[B]stderr\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Unlike other bc(1) implementations, this bc(1) will
issue a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section) if it cannot
write to \f[B]stderr\f[R], so if \f[B]stderr\f[R] is closed, as in
\f[B]bc 2>&-\f[R], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that bc(1) can exit with an error code when
\f[B]stderr\f[R] is redirected to a file.

If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other bc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stderr\f[R] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[R].
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The syntax for bc(1) programs is mostly C-like, with some differences.
This bc(1) follows the POSIX standard (see the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R]
section), which is a much more thorough resource for the language this
bc(1) accepts.
This section is meant to be a summary and a listing of all the
extensions to the standard.
.PP
In the sections below, \f[B]E\f[R] means expression, \f[B]S\f[R] means
statement, and \f[B]I\f[R] means identifier.

Identifiers (\f[B]I\f[R]) start with a lowercase letter and can be

letters (\f[B]a-z\f[R]), digits (\f[B]0-9\f[R]), and underscores
(\f[B]_\f[R]).
The regex is \f[B][a-z][a-z0-9_]*\f[R].
Identifiers with more than one character (letter) are a

.PP
\f[B]ibase\f[R] is a global variable determining how to interpret
constant numbers.
It is the \[lq]input\[rq] base, or the number base used for interpreting
input numbers.
\f[B]ibase\f[R] is initially \f[B]10\f[R].
If the \f[B]-s\f[R] (\f[B]--standard\f[R]) and \f[B]-w\f[R]
(\f[B]--warn\f[R]) flags were not given on the command line, the max
allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] is \f[B]36\f[R].
Otherwise, it is \f[B]16\f[R].
The min allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] is \f[B]2\f[R].
The max allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] can be queried in bc(1)
programs with the \f[B]maxibase()\f[R] built-in function.
.PP
\f[B]obase\f[R] is a global variable determining how to output results.
It is the \[lq]output\[rq] base, or the number base used for outputting
numbers.
\f[B]obase\f[R] is initially \f[B]10\f[R].
The max allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]BC_BASE_MAX\f[R] and
can be queried in bc(1) programs with the \f[B]maxobase()\f[R] built-in
function.
The min allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]0\f[R].
If \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]0\f[R], values are output in scientific
notation, and if \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]1\f[R], values are output in
engineering notation.
Otherwise, values are output in the specified base.
.PP
Outputting in scientific and engineering notations are \f[B]non-portable
extensions\f[R].
.PP
The \f[I]scale\f[R] of an expression is the number of digits in the
result of the expression right of the decimal point, and \f[B]scale\f[R]
is a global variable that sets the precision of any operations, with
exceptions.
\f[B]scale\f[R] is initially \f[B]0\f[R].
\f[B]scale\f[R] cannot be negative.
The max allowable value for \f[B]scale\f[R] is \f[B]BC_SCALE_MAX\f[R]
and can be queried in bc(1) programs with the \f[B]maxscale()\f[R]
built-in function.
.PP
bc(1) has both \f[I]global\f[R] variables and \f[I]local\f[R] variables.
All \f[I]local\f[R] variables are local to the function; they are
parameters or are introduced in the \f[B]auto\f[R] list of a function
(see the \f[B]FUNCTIONS\f[R] section).
If a variable is accessed which is not a parameter or in the
\f[B]auto\f[R] list, it is assumed to be \f[I]global\f[R].
If a parent function has a \f[I]local\f[R] variable version of a
variable that a child function considers \f[I]global\f[R], the value of
that \f[I]global\f[R] variable in the child function is the value of the
variable in the parent function, not the value of the actual
\f[I]global\f[R] variable.
.PP
All of the above applies to arrays as well.
.PP
The value of a statement that is an expression (i.e., any of the named
expressions or operands) is printed unless the lowest precedence
operator is an assignment operator \f[I]and\f[R] the expression is
notsurrounded by parentheses.
.PP
The value that is printed is also assigned to the special variable
\f[B]last\f[R].
A single dot (\f[B].\f[R]) may also be used as a synonym for
\f[B]last\f[R].
These are \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R].
.PP
Either semicolons or newlines may separate statements.
.SS Comments
.PP
There are two kinds of comments:
.IP "1." 3
Block comments are enclosed in \f[B]/*\f[R] and \f[B]*/\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Line comments go from \f[B]#\f[R] until, and not including, the next
newline.

Numbers 6 and 7 are \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R].
.PP
The meaning of \f[B]seed\f[R] is dependent on the current pseudo-random
number generator but is guaranteed to not change except for new major
versions.
.PP
The \f[I]scale\f[R] and sign of the value may be significant.
.PP
If a previously used \f[B]seed\f[R] value is assigned to \f[B]seed\f[R]
and used again, the pseudo-random number generator is guaranteed to
produce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers as it did when the
\f[B]seed\f[R] value was previously used.
.PP
The exact value assigned to \f[B]seed\f[R] is not guaranteed to be
returned if \f[B]seed\f[R] is queried again immediately.
However, if \f[B]seed\f[R] \f[I]does\f[R] return a different value, both
values, when assigned to \f[B]seed\f[R], are guaranteed to produce the
same sequence of pseudo-random numbers.
This means that certain values assigned to \f[B]seed\f[R] will
\f[I]not\f[R] produce unique sequences of pseudo-random numbers.
The value of \f[B]seed\f[R] will change after any use of the
\f[B]rand()\f[R] and \f[B]irand(E)\f[R] operands (see the
\f[I]Operands\f[R] subsection below), except if the parameter passed to
\f[B]irand(E)\f[R] is \f[B]0\f[R], \f[B]1\f[R], or negative.
.PP
There is no limit to the length (number of significant decimal digits)
or \f[I]scale\f[R] of the value that can be assigned to \f[B]seed\f[R].
.PP
Variables and arrays do not interfere; users can have arrays named the
same as variables.
This also applies to functions (see the \f[B]FUNCTIONS\f[R] section), so
a user can have a variable, array, and function that all have the same
name, and they will not shadow each other, whether inside of functions
or not.
.PP
Named expressions are required as the operand of
\f[B]increment\f[R]/\f[B]decrement\f[R] operators and as the left side

\f[B]rand()\f[R]: A pseudo-random integer between \f[B]0\f[R]
(inclusive) and \f[B]BC_RAND_MAX\f[R] (inclusive).
Using this operand will change the value of \f[B]seed\f[R].
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.IP "24." 4
\f[B]irand(E)\f[R]: A pseudo-random integer between \f[B]0\f[R]
(inclusive) and the value of \f[B]E\f[R] (exclusive).
If \f[B]E\f[R] is negative or is a non-integer (\f[B]E\f[R]\[cq]s
\f[I]scale\f[R] is not \f[B]0\f[R]), an error is raised, and bc(1)
resets (see the \f[B]RESET\f[R] section) while \f[B]seed\f[R] remains
unchanged.
If \f[B]E\f[R] is larger than \f[B]BC_RAND_MAX\f[R], the higher bound is
honored by generating several pseudo-random integers, multiplying them
by appropriate powers of \f[B]BC_RAND_MAX+1\f[R], and adding them
together.
Thus, the size of integer that can be generated with this operand is
unbounded.
Using this operand will change the value of \f[B]seed\f[R], unless the
value of \f[B]E\f[R] is \f[B]0\f[R] or \f[B]1\f[R].
In that case, \f[B]0\f[R] is returned, and \f[B]seed\f[R] is
\f[I]not\f[R] changed.

.IP "25." 4
\f[B]maxrand()\f[R]: The max integer returned by \f[B]rand()\f[R].
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.PP
The integers generated by \f[B]rand()\f[R] and \f[B]irand(E)\f[R] are
guaranteed to be as unbiased as possible, subject to the limitations of
the pseudo-random number generator.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: The values returned by the pseudo-random number
generator with \f[B]rand()\f[R] and \f[B]irand(E)\f[R] are guaranteed to
\f[I]NOT\f[R] be cryptographically secure.
This is a consequence of using a seeded pseudo-random number generator.
However, they \f[I]are\f[R] guaranteed to be reproducible with identical
\f[B]seed\f[R] values.
This means that the pseudo-random values from bc(1) should only be used
where a reproducible stream of pseudo-random numbers is
\f[I]ESSENTIAL\f[R].
In any other case, use a non-seeded pseudo-random number generator.
.SS Numbers
.PP
Numbers are strings made up of digits, uppercase letters, and at most
\f[B]1\f[R] period for a radix.
Numbers can have up to \f[B]BC_NUM_MAX\f[R] digits.
Uppercase letters are equal to \f[B]9\f[R] plus their position in the
alphabet, starting from \f[B]1\f[R] (i.e., \f[B]A\f[R] equals
\f[B]10\f[R], or \f[B]9+1\f[R]).
.PP
If a digit or letter makes no sense with the current value of
\f[B]ibase\f[R] (i.e., they are greater than or equal to the current
value of \f[B]ibase\f[R]), then the behavior depends on the existence of
the \f[B]-c\f[R]/\f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R] or
\f[B]-C\f[R]/\f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R] options (see the
\f[B]OPTIONS\f[R] section), the existence and setting of the
\f[B]BC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES\f[R] section), or the default, which can be queried with the
\f[B]-h\f[R]/\f[B]--help\f[R] option.
.PP
If clamping is off, then digits or letters that are greater than or
equal to the current value of \f[B]ibase\f[R] are not changed.
Instead, their given value is multiplied by the appropriate power of
\f[B]ibase\f[R] and added into the number.
This means that, with an \f[B]ibase\f[R] of \f[B]3\f[R], the number
\f[B]AB\f[R] is equal to \f[B]3\[ha]1*A+3\[ha]0*B\f[R], which is
\f[B]3\f[R] times \f[B]10\f[R] plus \f[B]11\f[R], or \f[B]41\f[R].
.PP
If clamping is on, then digits or letters that are greater than or equal
to the current value of \f[B]ibase\f[R] are set to the value of the
highest valid digit in \f[B]ibase\f[R] before being multiplied by the
appropriate power of \f[B]ibase\f[R] and added into the number.
This means that, with an \f[B]ibase\f[R] of \f[B]3\f[R], the number
\f[B]AB\f[R] is equal to \f[B]3\[ha]1*2+3\[ha]0*2\f[R], which is
\f[B]3\f[R] times \f[B]2\f[R] plus \f[B]2\f[R], or \f[B]8\f[R].
.PP
There is one exception to clamping: single-character numbers (i.e.,
\f[B]A\f[R] alone).
Such numbers are never clamped and always take the value they would have
in the highest possible \f[B]ibase\f[R].
This means that \f[B]A\f[R] alone always equals decimal \f[B]10\f[R] and
\f[B]Z\f[R] alone always equals decimal \f[B]35\f[R].
This behavior is mandated by the standard (see the STANDARDS section)
and is meant to provide an easy way to set the current \f[B]ibase\f[R]
(with the \f[B]i\f[R] command) regardless of the current value of
\f[B]ibase\f[R].
.PP
If clamping is on, and the clamped value of a character is needed, use a
leading zero, i.e., for \f[B]A\f[R], use \f[B]0A\f[R].
.PP
In addition, bc(1) accepts numbers in scientific notation.
These have the form \f[B]<number>e<integer>\f[R].
The exponent (the portion after the \f[B]e\f[R]) must be an integer.
An example is \f[B]1.89237e9\f[R], which is equal to
\f[B]1892370000\f[R].
Negative exponents are also allowed, so \f[B]4.2890e-3\f[R] is equal to
\f[B]0.0042890\f[R].
.PP
Using scientific notation is an error or warning if the \f[B]-s\f[R] or
\f[B]-w\f[R], respectively, command-line options (or equivalents) are
given.
.PP
\f[B]WARNING\f[R]: Both the number and the exponent in scientific
notation are interpreted according to the current \f[B]ibase\f[R], but
the number is still multiplied by \f[B]10\[ha]exponent\f[R] regardless
of the current \f[B]ibase\f[R].
For example, if \f[B]ibase\f[R] is \f[B]16\f[R] and bc(1) is given the
number string \f[B]FFeA\f[R], the resulting decimal number will be
\f[B]2550000000000\f[R], and if bc(1) is given the number string
\f[B]10e-4\f[R], the resulting decimal number will be \f[B]0.0016\f[R].
.PP
Accepting input as scientific notation is a \f[B]non-portable
extension\f[R].

\f[B]Warning\f[R]: The behavior of this bc(1) on \f[B]quit\f[R] is
slightly different from other bc(1) implementations.
Other bc(1) implementations will exit as soon as they finish parsing the

The \f[B]halt\f[R] statement causes bc(1) to quit, if it is executed.
(Unlike \f[B]quit\f[R] if it is on a branch of an \f[B]if\f[R] statement
that is not executed, bc(1) does not quit.)
.PP
The \f[B]limits\f[R] statement prints the limits that this bc(1) is
subject to.
This is like the \f[B]quit\f[R] statement in that it is a compile-time

.PP
An expression by itself is evaluated and printed, followed by a newline.
.PP
Both scientific notation and engineering notation are available for
printing the results of expressions.
Scientific notation is activated by assigning \f[B]0\f[R] to
\f[B]obase\f[R], and engineering notation is activated by assigning
\f[B]1\f[R] to \f[B]obase\f[R].
To deactivate them, just assign a different value to \f[B]obase\f[R].
.PP
Scientific notation and engineering notation are disabled if bc(1) is
run with either the \f[B]-s\f[R] or \f[B]-w\f[R] command-line options

Printing numbers in scientific notation and/or engineering notation is a
\f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.SS Strings
.PP
If strings appear as a statement by themselves, they are printed without
a trailing newline.
.PP
In addition to appearing as a lone statement by themselves, strings can
be assigned to variables and array elements.
They can also be passed to functions in variable parameters.
.PP
If any statement that expects a string is given a variable that had a
string assigned to it, the statement acts as though it had received a
string.
.PP
If any math operation is attempted on a string or a variable or array
element that has been assigned a string, an error is raised, and bc(1)
resets (see the \f[B]RESET\f[R] section).
.PP
Assigning strings to variables and array elements and passing them to
functions are \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R].
.SS Print Statement
.PP
The \[lq]expressions\[rq] in a \f[B]print\f[R] statement may also be
strings.
If they are, there are backslash escape sequences that are interpreted
specially.
What those sequences are, and what they cause to be printed, are shown
below:
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]a\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]a\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]b\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]b\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]\[rs]\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]e\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]f\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]f\f[R]

\f[B]\[rs]n\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]n\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]q\f[R]: \f[B]\[lq]\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]r\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]r\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]\[rs]t\f[R]: \f[B]\[rs]t\f[R]
.PP
Any other character following a backslash causes the backslash and
character to be printed as-is.
.PP
Any non-string expression in a print statement shall be assigned to
\f[B]last\f[R], like any other expression that is printed.
.SS Stream Statement
.PP
The \[lq]expressions in a \f[B]stream\f[R] statement may also be
strings.
.PP
If a \f[B]stream\f[R] statement is given a string, it prints the string
as though the string had appeared as its own statement.
In other words, the \f[B]stream\f[R] statement prints strings normally,
without a newline.
.PP
If a \f[B]stream\f[R] statement is given a number, a copy of it is
truncated and its absolute value is calculated.
The result is then printed as though \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]256\f[R]
and each digit is interpreted as an 8-bit ASCII character, making it a
byte stream.
.SS Order of Evaluation
.PP
All expressions in a statment are evaluated left to right, except as
necessary to maintain order of operations.
This means, for example, assuming that \f[B]i\f[R] is equal to
\f[B]0\f[R], in the expression
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
a[i++] = i++
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
the first (or 0th) element of \f[B]a\f[R] is set to \f[B]1\f[R], and
\f[B]i\f[R] is equal to \f[B]2\f[R] at the end of the expression.
.PP
This includes function arguments.
Thus, assuming \f[B]i\f[R] is equal to \f[B]0\f[R], this means that in
the expression
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
x(i++, i++)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
the first argument passed to \f[B]x()\f[R] is \f[B]0\f[R], and the
second argument is \f[B]1\f[R], while \f[B]i\f[R] is equal to
\f[B]2\f[R] before the function starts executing.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.PP
Function definitions are as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
define I(I,...,I){
    auto I,...,I
    S;...;S
    return(E)
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Any \f[B]I\f[R] in the parameter list or \f[B]auto\f[R] list may be
replaced with \f[B]I[]\f[R] to make a parameter or \f[B]auto\f[R] var an
array, and any \f[B]I\f[R] in the parameter list may be replaced with
\f[B]*I[]\f[R] to make a parameter an array reference.
Callers of functions that take array references should not put an
asterisk in the call; they must be called with just \f[B]I[]\f[R] like
normal array parameters and will be automatically converted into
references.
.PP
As a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R], the opening brace of a
\f[B]define\f[R] statement may appear on the next line.
.PP
As a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R], the return statement may also be
in one of the following forms:

\f[B]return\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]return\f[R] \f[B](\f[R] \f[B])\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]return\f[R] \f[B]E\f[R]
.PP
The first two, or not specifying a \f[B]return\f[R] statement, is
equivalent to \f[B]return (0)\f[R], unless the function is a
\f[B]void\f[R] function (see the \f[I]Void Functions\f[R] subsection

    S;...;S
    return
}
\f[R]
.fi

They can only be used as standalone expressions, where such an
expression would be printed alone, except in a print statement.
.PP
Void functions can only use the first two \f[B]return\f[R] statements
listed above.
They can also omit the return statement entirely.
.PP
The word \[lq]void\[rq] is not treated as a keyword; it is still
possible to have variables, arrays, and functions named \f[B]void\f[R].

.SH RESET
.PP
When bc(1) encounters an error or a signal that it has a non-default
handler for, it resets.
This means that several things happen.
.PP
First, any functions that are executing are stopped and popped off the
stack.
The behavior is not unlike that of exceptions in programming languages.
Then the execution point is set so that any code waiting to execute
(after all functions returned) is skipped.
.PP
Thus, when bc(1) resets, it skips any remaining code waiting to be
executed.
Then, if it is interactive mode, and the error was not a fatal error
(see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section), it asks for more input;
otherwise, it exits with the appropriate return code.
.PP
Note that this reset behavior is different from the GNU bc(1), which
attempts to start executing the statement right after the one that
caused an error.
.SH PERFORMANCE
.PP
Most bc(1) implementations use \f[B]char\f[R] types to calculate the
value of \f[B]1\f[R] decimal digit at a time, but that can be slow.
This bc(1) does something different.
.PP
It uses large integers to calculate more than \f[B]1\f[R] decimal digit
at a time.
If built in a environment where \f[B]BC_LONG_BIT\f[R] (see the
\f[B]LIMITS\f[R] section) is \f[B]64\f[R], then each integer has
\f[B]9\f[R] decimal digits.
If built in an environment where \f[B]BC_LONG_BIT\f[R] is \f[B]32\f[R]
then each integer has \f[B]4\f[R] decimal digits.
This value (the number of decimal digits per large integer) is called
\f[B]BC_BASE_DIGS\f[R].
.PP
The actual values of \f[B]BC_LONG_BIT\f[R] and \f[B]BC_BASE_DIGS\f[R]
can be queried with the \f[B]limits\f[R] statement.
.PP
In addition, this bc(1) uses an even larger integer for overflow
checking.
This integer type depends on the value of \f[B]BC_LONG_BIT\f[R], but is
always at least twice as large as the integer type used to store digits.
.SH LIMITS
.PP
The following are the limits on bc(1):
.TP
\f[B]BC_LONG_BIT\f[R]
The number of bits in the \f[B]long\f[R] type in the environment where
bc(1) was built.
This determines how many decimal digits can be stored in a single large
integer (see the \f[B]PERFORMANCE\f[R] section).
.TP
\f[B]BC_BASE_DIGS\f[R]
The number of decimal digits per large integer (see the
\f[B]PERFORMANCE\f[R] section).

.TP
\f[B]BC_BASE_POW\f[R]

\f[B]BC_BASE_DIGS\f[R]) plus \f[B]1\f[R].

.TP
\f[B]BC_OVERFLOW_MAX\f[R]

Set at \f[B]2\[ha]BC_LONG_BIT-1\f[R].
.TP
Exponent
The maximum allowable exponent (positive or negative).
Set at \f[B]BC_OVERFLOW_MAX\f[R].

The maximum number of vars/arrays.
Set at \f[B]SIZE_MAX-1\f[R].
.PP
The actual values can be queried with the \f[B]limits\f[R] statement.
.PP
These limits are meant to be effectively non-existent; the limits are so
large (at least on 64-bit machines) that there should not be any point
at which they become a problem.
In fact, memory should be exhausted before these limits should be hit.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
As \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R], bc(1) recognizes the following
environment variables:
.TP
\f[B]POSIXLY_CORRECT\f[R]
If this variable exists (no matter the contents), bc(1) behaves as if
the \f[B]-s\f[R] option was given.
.TP
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R]
This is another way to give command-line arguments to bc(1).
They should be in the same format as all other command-line arguments.
These are always processed first, so any files given in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] will be processed before arguments and files given
on the command-line.
This gives the user the ability to set up \[lq]standard\[rq] options and
files to be used at every invocation.
The most useful thing for such files to contain would be useful
functions that the user might want every time bc(1) runs.
.RS
.PP
The code that parses \f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] will correctly handle quoted
arguments, but it does not understand escape sequences.
For example, the string \f[B]\[lq]/home/gavin/some bc file.bc\[rq]\f[R]
will be correctly parsed, but the string \f[B]\[lq]/home/gavin/some
\[dq]bc\[dq] file.bc\[rq]\f[R] will include the backslashes.
.PP
The quote parsing will handle either kind of quotes, \f[B]\[cq]\f[R] or
\f[B]\[lq]\f[R].
Thus, if you have a file with any number of single quotes in the name,
you can use double quotes as the outside quotes, as in \f[B]\[lq]some
`bc' file.bc\[rq]\f[R], and vice versa if you have a file with double
quotes.
However, handling a file with both kinds of quotes in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] is not supported due to the complexity of the
parsing, though such files are still supported on the command-line where
the parsing is done by the shell.

with \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R], \f[B]-f\f[R], or
\f[B]--file\f[R], then if this environment variable exists and contains
an integer, a non-zero value makes bc(1) exit after executing the
expressions and expression files, and a zero value makes bc(1) not exit.

This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.

\f[B]BC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R]
When parsing numbers and if this environment variable exists and
contains an integer, a non-zero value makes bc(1) clamp digits that are
greater than or equal to the current \f[B]ibase\f[R] so that all such
digits are considered equal to the \f[B]ibase\f[R] minus 1, and a zero
value disables such clamping so that those digits are always equal to
their value, which is multiplied by the power of the \f[B]ibase\f[R].
.RS
.PP
This never applies to single-digit numbers, as per the standard (see the
\f[B]STANDARDS\f[R] section).
.PP
This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
bc(1) returns the following exit statuses:
.TP
\f[B]0\f[R]
No error.
.TP
\f[B]1\f[R]
A math error occurred.
This follows standard practice of using \f[B]1\f[R] for expected errors,
since math errors will happen in the process of normal execution.
.RS
.PP
Math errors include divide by \f[B]0\f[R], taking the square root of a
negative number, using a negative number as a bound for the
pseudo-random number generator, attempting to convert a negative number
to a hardware integer, overflow when converting a number to a hardware
integer, overflow when calculating the size of a number, and attempting
to use a non-integer where an integer is required.
.PP
Converting to a hardware integer happens for the second operand of the
power (\f[B]\[ha]\f[R]), places (\f[B]\[at]\f[R]), left shift
(\f[B]<<\f[R]), and right shift (\f[B]>>\f[R]) operators and their
corresponding assignment operators.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]2\f[R]
A parse error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Parse errors include unexpected \f[B]EOF\f[R], using an invalid
character, failing to find the end of a string or comment, using a token
where it is invalid, giving an invalid expression, giving an invalid
print statement, giving an invalid function definition, attempting to
assign to an expression that is not a named expression (see the
\f[I]Named Expressions\f[R] subsection of the \f[B]SYNTAX\f[R] section),
giving an invalid \f[B]auto\f[R] list, having a duplicate
\f[B]auto\f[R]/function parameter, failing to find the end of a code
block, attempting to return a value from a \f[B]void\f[R] function,
attempting to use a variable as a reference, and using any extensions
when the option \f[B]-s\f[R] or any equivalents were given.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]3\f[R]
A runtime error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Runtime errors include assigning an invalid number to any global
(\f[B]ibase\f[R], \f[B]obase\f[R], or \f[B]scale\f[R]), giving a bad
expression to a \f[B]read()\f[R] call, calling \f[B]read()\f[R] inside
of a \f[B]read()\f[R] call, type errors, passing the wrong number of
arguments to functions, attempting to call an undefined function, and
attempting to use a \f[B]void\f[R] function call as a value in an
expression.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]4\f[R]
A fatal error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Fatal errors include memory allocation errors, I/O errors, failing to
open files, attempting to use files that do not have only ASCII
characters (bc(1) only accepts ASCII characters), attempting to open a
directory as a file, and giving invalid command-line options.
.RE
.PP
The exit status \f[B]4\f[R] is special; when a fatal error occurs, bc(1)
always exits and returns \f[B]4\f[R], no matter what mode bc(1) is in.
.PP
The other statuses will only be returned when bc(1) is not in
interactive mode (see the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R] section), since
bc(1) resets its state (see the \f[B]RESET\f[R] section) and accepts
more input when one of those errors occurs in interactive mode.
This is also the case when interactive mode is forced by the
\f[B]-i\f[R] flag or \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option.
.PP
These exit statuses allow bc(1) to be used in shell scripting with error
checking, and its normal behavior can be forced by using the
\f[B]-i\f[R] flag or \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.PP
Per the standard (see the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R] section), bc(1) has an
interactive mode and a non-interactive mode.
Interactive mode is turned on automatically when both \f[B]stdin\f[R]
and \f[B]stdout\f[R] are hooked to a terminal, but the \f[B]-i\f[R] flag
and \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option can turn it on in other situations.
.PP
In interactive mode, bc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see the
\f[B]RESET\f[R] section), and in normal execution, flushes
\f[B]stdout\f[R] as soon as execution is done for the current input.
bc(1) may also reset on \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] instead of exit, depending on
the contents of, or default for, the \f[B]BC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R]
environment variable (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.SH TTY MODE
.PP
If \f[B]stdin\f[R], \f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R] are all
connected to a TTY, then \[lq]TTY mode\[rq] is considered to be
available, and thus, bc(1) can turn on TTY mode, subject to some
settings.
.PP
If there is the environment variable \f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R] in the
environment (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section), then if
that environment variable contains a non-zero integer, bc(1) will turn
on TTY mode when \f[B]stdin\f[R], \f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R]
are all connected to a TTY.
If the \f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variable exists but is
\f[I]not\f[R] a non-zero integer, then bc(1) will not turn TTY mode on.
.PP
If the environment variable \f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R] does \f[I]not\f[R]
exist, the default setting is used.
The default setting can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or
\f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
TTY mode is different from interactive mode because interactive mode is
required in the bc(1) standard (see the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R] section),
and interactive mode requires only \f[B]stdin\f[R] and \f[B]stdout\f[R]
to be connected to a terminal.
.SS Prompt
.PP
If TTY mode is available, then a prompt can be enabled.
Like TTY mode itself, it can be turned on or off with an environment
variable: \f[B]BC_PROMPT\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R]
section).
.PP
If the environment variable \f[B]BC_PROMPT\f[R] exists and is a non-zero
integer, then the prompt is turned on when \f[B]stdin\f[R],
\f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R] are connected to a TTY and the
\f[B]-P\f[R] and \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R] options were not used.
The read prompt will be turned on under the same conditions, except that
the \f[B]-R\f[R] and \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R] options must also not be
used.
.PP
However, if \f[B]BC_PROMPT\f[R] does not exist, the prompt can be
enabled or disabled with the \f[B]BC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variable,
the \f[B]-P\f[R] and \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R] options, and the \f[B]-R\f[R]
and \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R] options.
See the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] and \f[B]OPTIONS\f[R] sections
for more details.
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
.PP
Sending a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] will cause bc(1) to do one of two things.
.PP
If bc(1) is not in interactive mode (see the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R]
section), or the \f[B]BC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R] environment variable (see the
\f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section), or its default, is either not
an integer or it is zero, bc(1) will exit.
.PP
However, if bc(1) is in interactive mode, and the
\f[B]BC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R] or its default is an integer and non-zero,
then bc(1) will stop executing the current input and reset (see the
\f[B]RESET\f[R] section) upon receiving a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R].
.PP
Note that \[lq]current input\[rq] can mean one of two things.
If bc(1) is processing input from \f[B]stdin\f[R] in interactive mode,
it will ask for more input.
If bc(1) is processing input from a file in interactive mode, it will
stop processing the file and start processing the next file, if one
exists, or ask for input from \f[B]stdin\f[R] if no other file exists.
.PP
This means that if a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] is sent to bc(1) as it is
executing a file, it can seem as though bc(1) did not respond to the
signal since it will immediately start executing the next file.
This is by design; most files that users execute when interacting with
bc(1) have function definitions, which are quick to parse.
If a file takes a long time to execute, there may be a bug in that file.
The rest of the files could still be executed without problem, allowing
the user to continue.
.PP
\f[B]SIGTERM\f[R] and \f[B]SIGQUIT\f[R] cause bc(1) to clean up and
exit, and it uses the default handler for all other signals.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH STANDARDS
.PP
bc(1) is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2017
(\[lq]POSIX.1-2017\[rq]) specification at
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html .
The flags \f[B]-efghiqsvVw\f[R], all long options, and the extensions
noted above are extensions to that specification.
.PP
In addition, the behavior of the \f[B]quit\f[R] implements an
interpretation of that specification that is different from all known
implementations.
For more information see the \f[B]Statements\f[R] subsection of the
\f[B]SYNTAX\f[R] section.
.PP
Note that the specification explicitly says that bc(1) only accepts
numbers that use a period (\f[B].\f[R]) as a radix point, regardless of
the value of \f[B]LC_NUMERIC\f[R].
.SH BUGS
.PP
Before version \f[B]6.1.0\f[R], this bc(1) had incorrect behavior for
the \f[B]quit\f[R] statement.
.PP
No other bugs are known.
