.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
dc(1) is an arbitrary-precision calculator.
It uses a stack (reverse Polish notation) to store numbers and results
of computations.
Arithmetic operations pop arguments off of the stack and push the
results.
.PP
If no files are given on the command-line, then dc(1) reads from
\f[B]stdin\f[R] (see the \f[B]STDIN\f[R] section).
Otherwise, those files are processed, and dc(1) will then exit.
.PP
If a user wants to set up a standard environment, they can use
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
For example, if a user wants the \f[B]scale\f[R] always set to
\f[B]10\f[R], they can set \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] to \f[B]-e 10k\f[R],
and this dc(1) will always start with a \f[B]scale\f[R] of \f[B]10\f[R].
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following are the options that dc(1) accepts.
.TP
\f[B]-C\f[R], \f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R]
Disables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current
\f[B]ibase\f[R] when parsing numbers.
.RS
.PP
This means that the value added to a number from a digit is always that
digit\[cq]s value multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power
of the digit\[cq]s position, which starts from 0 at the least
significant digit.
.PP
If this and/or the \f[B]-c\f[R] or \f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R] options are
given multiple times, the last one given is used.
.PP
This option overrides the \f[B]DC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section) and the default, which
can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R], \f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R]
Enables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current
\f[B]ibase\f[R] when parsing numbers.
.RS
.PP
This means that digits that the value added to a number from a digit
that is greater than or equal to the ibase is the value of ibase minus 1
all multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the power of the
digit\[cq]s position, which starts from 0 at the least significant
digit.
.PP
If this and/or the \f[B]-C\f[R] or \f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R] options
are given multiple times, the last one given is used.
.PP
This option overrides the \f[B]DC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section) and the default, which
can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-e\f[R] \f[I]expr\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R]=\f[I]expr\f[R]
Evaluates \f[I]expr\f[R].
If multiple expressions are given, they are evaluated in order.
If files are given as well (see below), the expressions and files are
evaluated in the order given.
This means that if a file is given before an expression, the file is
read in and evaluated first.
.RS
.PP
If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R], see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section),
then after processing all expressions and files, dc(1) will exit, unless
\f[B]-\f[R] (\f[B]stdin\f[R]) was given as an argument at least once to
\f[B]-f\f[R] or \f[B]--file\f[R], whether on the command-line or in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R].
However, if any other \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R],
\f[B]-f\f[R], or \f[B]--file\f[R] arguments are given after
\f[B]-f-\f[R] or equivalent is given, dc(1) will give a fatal error and
exit.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R] \f[I]file\f[R], \f[B]--file\f[R]=\f[I]file\f[R]
Reads in \f[I]file\f[R] and evaluates it, line by line, as though it
were read through \f[B]stdin\f[R].
If expressions are also given (see above), the expressions are evaluated
in the order given.
.RS
.PP
If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R], see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section),

However, if any other \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R],
\f[B]-f\f[R], or \f[B]--file\f[R] arguments are given after
\f[B]-f-\f[R] or equivalent is given, dc(1) will give a fatal error and
exit.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].

.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]--help\f[R]
Prints a usage message and exits.
.TP
\f[B]-I\f[R] \f[I]ibase\f[R], \f[B]--ibase\f[R]=\f[I]ibase\f[R]
Sets the builtin variable \f[B]ibase\f[R] to the value \f[I]ibase\f[R]
assuming that \f[I]ibase\f[R] is in base 10.
It is a fatal error if \f[I]ibase\f[R] is not a valid number.
.RS
.PP
If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is used.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].

.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-L\f[R], \f[B]--no-line-length\f[R]
Disables line length checking and prints numbers without backslashes and
newlines.
In other words, this option sets \f[B]BC_LINE_LENGTH\f[R] to \f[B]0\f[R]
(see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-O\f[R] \f[I]obase\f[R], \f[B]--obase\f[R]=\f[I]obase\f[R]
Sets the builtin variable \f[B]obase\f[R] to the value \f[I]obase\f[R]
assuming that \f[I]obase\f[R] is in base 10.
It is a fatal error if \f[I]obase\f[R] is not a valid number.
.RS
.PP
If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is used.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-P\f[R], \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R]
Disables the prompt in TTY mode.
(The prompt is only enabled in TTY mode.
See the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section.)
This is mostly for those users that do not want a prompt or are not used
to having them in dc(1).
Most of those users would want to put this option in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R].
.RS
.PP
These options override the \f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R] and \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R]
environment variables (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-R\f[R], \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R]
Disables the read prompt in TTY mode.
(The read prompt is only enabled in TTY mode.
See the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section.)
This is mostly for those users that do not want a read prompt or are not
used to having them in dc(1).
Most of those users would want to put this option in
\f[B]BC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
This option is also useful in hash bang lines of dc(1) scripts that
prompt for user input.
.RS
.PP
This option does not disable the regular prompt because the read prompt
is only used when the \f[B]?\f[R] command is used.
.PP
These options \f[I]do\f[R] override the \f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R] and
\f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variables (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES\f[R] section), but only for the read prompt.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-S\f[R] \f[I]scale\f[R], \f[B]--scale\f[R]=\f[I]scale\f[R]
Sets the builtin variable \f[B]scale\f[R] to the value \f[I]scale\f[R]
assuming that \f[I]scale\f[R] is in base 10.
It is a fatal error if \f[I]scale\f[R] is not a valid number.
.RS
.PP
If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is used.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE

.TP
\f[B]-x\f[R] \f[B]--extended-register\f[R]
Enables extended register mode.
See the \f[I]Extended Register Mode\f[R] subsection of the
\f[B]REGISTERS\f[R] section for more information.
.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]-z\f[R], \f[B]--leading-zeroes\f[R]
Makes dc(1) print all numbers greater than \f[B]-1\f[R] and less than
\f[B]1\f[R], and not equal to \f[B]0\f[R], with a leading zero.
.RS
.PP
This can be set for individual numbers with the \f[B]plz(x)\f[R],
plznl(x)**, \f[B]pnlz(x)\f[R], and \f[B]pnlznl(x)\f[R] functions in the
extended math library (see the \f[B]LIBRARY\f[R] section).
.PP
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.RE
.PP
All long options are \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R].
.SH STDIN
.PP
If no files are given on the command-line and no files or expressions
are given by the \f[B]-f\f[R], \f[B]--file\f[R], \f[B]-e\f[R], or
\f[B]--expression\f[R] options, then dc(1) reads from \f[B]stdin\f[R].
.PP
However, there is a caveat to this.
.PP
First, \f[B]stdin\f[R] is evaluated a line at a time.
The only exception to this is if a string has been finished, but not
ended.
This means that, except for escaped brackets, all brackets must be
balanced before dc(1) parses and executes.
.SH STDOUT
.PP
Any non-error output is written to \f[B]stdout\f[R].
In addition, if history (see the \f[B]HISTORY\f[R] section) and the
prompt (see the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R] section) are enabled, both are output
to \f[B]stdout\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will
issue a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section) if it cannot
write to \f[B]stdout\f[R], so if \f[B]stdout\f[R] is closed, as in
\f[B]dc >&-\f[R], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that dc(1) can report problems when \f[B]stdout\f[R] is
redirected to a file.
.PP
If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other dc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stdout\f[R] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[R].
.SH STDERR
.PP
Any error output is written to \f[B]stderr\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will
issue a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section) if it cannot
write to \f[B]stderr\f[R], so if \f[B]stderr\f[R] is closed, as in
\f[B]dc 2>&-\f[R], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that dc(1) can exit with an error code when
\f[B]stderr\f[R] is redirected to a file.
.PP
If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other dc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stderr\f[R] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[R].
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
Each item in the input source code, either a number (see the
\f[B]NUMBERS\f[R] section) or a command (see the \f[B]COMMANDS\f[R]
section), is processed and executed, in order.
Input is processed immediately when entered.
.PP
\f[B]ibase\f[R] is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[R] section) that
determines how to interpret constant numbers.
It is the \[lq]input\[rq] base, or the number base used for interpreting
input numbers.
\f[B]ibase\f[R] is initially \f[B]10\f[R].
The max allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] is \f[B]16\f[R].
The min allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] is \f[B]2\f[R].
The max allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[R] can be queried in dc(1)
programs with the \f[B]T\f[R] command.
.PP
\f[B]obase\f[R] is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[R] section) that
determines how to output results.
It is the \[lq]output\[rq] base, or the number base used for outputting
numbers.
\f[B]obase\f[R] is initially \f[B]10\f[R].
The max allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]DC_BASE_MAX\f[R] and
can be queried with the \f[B]U\f[R] command.
The min allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[R] is \f[B]2\f[R].
Values are output in the specified base.
.PP
The \f[I]scale\f[R] of an expression is the number of digits in the
result of the expression right of the decimal point, and \f[B]scale\f[R]
is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[R] section) that sets the
precision of any operations (with exceptions).
\f[B]scale\f[R] is initially \f[B]0\f[R].
\f[B]scale\f[R] cannot be negative.
The max allowable value for \f[B]scale\f[R] can be queried in dc(1)
programs with the \f[B]V\f[R] command.
.SS Comments
.PP
Comments go from \f[B]#\f[R] until, and not including, the next newline.
This is a \f[B]non-portable extension\f[R].
.SH NUMBERS
.PP
Numbers are strings made up of digits, uppercase letters up to
\f[B]F\f[R], and at most \f[B]1\f[R] period for a radix.
Numbers can have up to \f[B]DC_NUM_MAX\f[R] digits.
Uppercase letters are equal to \f[B]9\f[R] plus their position in the
alphabet (i.e., \f[B]A\f[R] equals \f[B]10\f[R], or \f[B]9+1\f[R]).
.PP
If a digit or letter makes no sense with the current value of
\f[B]ibase\f[R] (i.e., they are greater than or equal to the current
value of \f[B]ibase\f[R]), then the behavior depends on the existence of
the \f[B]-c\f[R]/\f[B]--digit-clamp\f[R] or
\f[B]-C\f[R]/\f[B]--no-digit-clamp\f[R] options (see the
\f[B]OPTIONS\f[R] section), the existence and setting of the
\f[B]DC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R] environment variable (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES\f[R] section), or the default, which can be queried with the
\f[B]-h\f[R]/\f[B]--help\f[R] option.
.PP
If clamping is off, then digits or letters that are greater than or
equal to the current value of \f[B]ibase\f[R] are not changed.
Instead, their given value is multiplied by the appropriate power of
\f[B]ibase\f[R] and added into the number.
This means that, with an \f[B]ibase\f[R] of \f[B]3\f[R], the number
\f[B]AB\f[R] is equal to \f[B]3\[ha]1*A+3\[ha]0*B\f[R], which is
\f[B]3\f[R] times \f[B]10\f[R] plus \f[B]11\f[R], or \f[B]41\f[R].
.PP
If clamping is on, then digits or letters that are greater than or equal
to the current value of \f[B]ibase\f[R] are set to the value of the
highest valid digit in \f[B]ibase\f[R] before being multiplied by the
appropriate power of \f[B]ibase\f[R] and added into the number.
This means that, with an \f[B]ibase\f[R] of \f[B]3\f[R], the number
\f[B]AB\f[R] is equal to \f[B]3\[ha]1*2+3\[ha]0*2\f[R], which is
\f[B]3\f[R] times \f[B]2\f[R] plus \f[B]2\f[R], or \f[B]8\f[R].
.PP
There is one exception to clamping: single-character numbers (i.e.,
\f[B]A\f[R] alone).
Such numbers are never clamped and always take the value they would have
in the highest possible \f[B]ibase\f[R].
This means that \f[B]A\f[R] alone always equals decimal \f[B]10\f[R] and
\f[B]Z\f[R] alone always equals decimal \f[B]35\f[R].
This behavior is mandated by the standard for bc(1) (see the STANDARDS
section) and is meant to provide an easy way to set the current
\f[B]ibase\f[R] (with the \f[B]i\f[R] command) regardless of the current
value of \f[B]ibase\f[R].
.PP
If clamping is on, and the clamped value of a character is needed, use a
leading zero, i.e., for \f[B]A\f[R], use \f[B]0A\f[R].

.SH REGISTERS
.PP
Registers are names that can store strings, numbers, and arrays.
(Number/string registers do not interfere with array registers.)
.PP
Each register is also its own stack, so the current register value is
the top of the stack for the register.
All registers, when first referenced, have one value (\f[B]0\f[R]) in
their stack, and it is a runtime error to attempt to pop that item off
of the register stack.
.PP
In non-extended register mode, a register name is just the single
character that follows any command that needs a register name.
The only exceptions are: a newline (\f[B]`\[rs]n'\f[R]) and a left
bracket (\f[B]`['\f[R]); it is a parse error for a newline or a left
bracket to be used as a register name.
.SS Extended Register Mode
.PP
Unlike most other dc(1) implentations, this dc(1) provides nearly
unlimited amounts of registers, if extended register mode is enabled.
.PP
If extended register mode is enabled (\f[B]-x\f[R] or
\f[B]--extended-register\f[R] command-line arguments are given), then
normal single character registers are used \f[I]unless\f[R] the
character immediately following a command that needs a register name is
a space (according to \f[B]isspace()\f[R]) and not a newline
(\f[B]`\[rs]n'\f[R]).
.PP
In that case, the register name is found according to the regex
\f[B][a-z][a-z0-9_]*\f[R] (like bc(1) identifiers), and it is a parse
error if the next non-space characters do not match that regex.
.SH RESET
.PP
When dc(1) encounters an error or a signal that it has a non-default
handler for, it resets.
This means that several things happen.
.PP
First, any macros that are executing are stopped and popped off the
stack.
The behavior is not unlike that of exceptions in programming languages.
Then the execution point is set so that any code waiting to execute
(after all macros returned) is skipped.
.PP
Thus, when dc(1) resets, it skips any remaining code waiting to be
executed.
Then, if it is interactive mode, and the error was not a fatal error
(see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[R] section), it asks for more input;
otherwise, it exits with the appropriate return code.
.SH PERFORMANCE
.PP
Most dc(1) implementations use \f[B]char\f[R] types to calculate the
value of \f[B]1\f[R] decimal digit at a time, but that can be slow.
This dc(1) does something different.
.PP
It uses large integers to calculate more than \f[B]1\f[R] decimal digit
at a time.
If built in a environment where \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[R] (see the
\f[B]LIMITS\f[R] section) is \f[B]64\f[R], then each integer has
\f[B]9\f[R] decimal digits.
If built in an environment where \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[R] is \f[B]32\f[R]
then each integer has \f[B]4\f[R] decimal digits.
This value (the number of decimal digits per large integer) is called
\f[B]DC_BASE_DIGS\f[R].
.PP
In addition, this dc(1) uses an even larger integer for overflow
checking.
This integer type depends on the value of \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[R], but is
always at least twice as large as the integer type used to store digits.

Set at \f[B]DC_OVERFLOW_MAX-1\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]DC_NUM_MAX\f[R]
The maximum length of a number (in decimal digits), which includes
digits after the decimal point.
Set at \f[B]DC_OVERFLOW_MAX-1\f[R].
.TP
Exponent
The maximum allowable exponent (positive or negative).
Set at \f[B]DC_OVERFLOW_MAX\f[R].
.TP
Number of vars
The maximum number of vars/arrays.
Set at \f[B]SIZE_MAX-1\f[R].
.PP
These limits are meant to be effectively non-existent; the limits are so
large (at least on 64-bit machines) that there should not be any point
at which they become a problem.
In fact, memory should be exhausted before these limits should be hit.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
As \f[B]non-portable extensions\f[R], dc(1) recognizes the following
environment variables:
.TP
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R]
This is another way to give command-line arguments to dc(1).
They should be in the same format as all other command-line arguments.
These are always processed first, so any files given in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] will be processed before arguments and files given
on the command-line.
This gives the user the ability to set up \[lq]standard\[rq] options and
files to be used at every invocation.
The most useful thing for such files to contain would be useful
functions that the user might want every time dc(1) runs.
Another use would be to use the \f[B]-e\f[R] option to set
\f[B]scale\f[R] to a value other than \f[B]0\f[R].
.RS
.PP
The code that parses \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] will correctly handle quoted
arguments, but it does not understand escape sequences.
For example, the string \f[B]\[lq]/home/gavin/some dc file.dc\[rq]\f[R]
will be correctly parsed, but the string \f[B]\[lq]/home/gavin/some
\[dq]dc\[dq] file.dc\[rq]\f[R] will include the backslashes.
.PP
The quote parsing will handle either kind of quotes, \f[B]\[cq]\f[R] or
\f[B]\[lq]\f[R].
Thus, if you have a file with any number of single quotes in the name,
you can use double quotes as the outside quotes, as in \f[B]\[lq]some
`dc' file.dc\[rq]\f[R], and vice versa if you have a file with double
quotes.
However, handling a file with both kinds of quotes in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[R] is not supported due to the complexity of the
parsing, though such files are still supported on the command-line where
the parsing is done by the shell.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_LINE_LENGTH\f[R]
If this environment variable exists and contains an integer that is
greater than \f[B]1\f[R] and is less than \f[B]UINT16_MAX\f[R]
(\f[B]2\[ha]16-1\f[R]), dc(1) will output lines to that length,
including the backslash newline combo.
The default line length is \f[B]70\f[R].
.RS
.PP
The special value of \f[B]0\f[R] will disable line length checking and
print numbers without regard to line length and without backslashes and
newlines.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R]
If dc(1) is not in interactive mode (see the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R]
section), then this environment variable has no effect because dc(1)
exits on \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] when not in interactive mode.
.RS
.PP
However, when dc(1) is in interactive mode, then if this environment
variable exists and contains an integer, a non-zero value makes dc(1)
reset on \f[B]SIGINT\f[R], rather than exit, and zero makes dc(1) exit.
If this environment variable exists and is \f[I]not\f[R] an integer,
then dc(1) will exit on \f[B]SIGINT\f[R].
.PP
This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R]
If TTY mode is \f[I]not\f[R] available (see the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R]
section), then this environment variable has no effect.
.RS
.PP
However, when TTY mode is available, then if this environment variable
exists and contains an integer, then a non-zero value makes dc(1) use
TTY mode, and zero makes dc(1) not use TTY mode.
.PP
This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R]
If TTY mode is \f[I]not\f[R] available (see the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[R]
section), then this environment variable has no effect.
.RS
.PP
However, when TTY mode is available, then if this environment variable
exists and contains an integer, a non-zero value makes dc(1) use a
prompt, and zero or a non-integer makes dc(1) not use a prompt.
If this environment variable does not exist and \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R]
does, then the value of the \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variable
is used.
.PP
This environment variable and the \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment
variable override the default, which can be queried with the
\f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_EXPR_EXIT\f[R]
If any expressions or expression files are given on the command-line
with \f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--expression\f[R], \f[B]-f\f[R], or
\f[B]--file\f[R], then if this environment variable exists and contains
an integer, a non-zero value makes dc(1) exit after executing the
expressions and expression files, and a zero value makes dc(1) not exit.
.RS
.PP
This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]DC_DIGIT_CLAMP\f[R]
When parsing numbers and if this environment variable exists and
contains an integer, a non-zero value makes dc(1) clamp digits that are
greater than or equal to the current \f[B]ibase\f[R] so that all such
digits are considered equal to the \f[B]ibase\f[R] minus 1, and a zero
value disables such clamping so that those digits are always equal to
their value, which is multiplied by the power of the \f[B]ibase\f[R].
.RS
.PP
This never applies to single-digit numbers, as per the bc(1) standard
(see the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R] section).
.PP
This environment variable overrides the default, which can be queried
with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or \f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
dc(1) returns the following exit statuses:
.TP
\f[B]0\f[R]
No error.
.TP
\f[B]1\f[R]
A math error occurred.
This follows standard practice of using \f[B]1\f[R] for expected errors,
since math errors will happen in the process of normal execution.
.RS
.PP
Math errors include divide by \f[B]0\f[R], taking the square root of a
negative number, attempting to convert a negative number to a hardware
integer, overflow when converting a number to a hardware integer,
overflow when calculating the size of a number, and attempting to use a
non-integer where an integer is required.
.PP
Converting to a hardware integer happens for the second operand of the
power (\f[B]\[ha]\f[R]) operator.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]2\f[R]
A parse error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Parse errors include unexpected \f[B]EOF\f[R], using an invalid
character, failing to find the end of a string or comment, and using a
token where it is invalid.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]3\f[R]
A runtime error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Runtime errors include assigning an invalid number to any global
(\f[B]ibase\f[R], \f[B]obase\f[R], or \f[B]scale\f[R]), giving a bad
expression to a \f[B]read()\f[R] call, calling \f[B]read()\f[R] inside
of a \f[B]read()\f[R] call, type errors (including attempting to execute
a number), and attempting an operation when the stack has too few
elements.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]4\f[R]
A fatal error occurred.
.RS
.PP
Fatal errors include memory allocation errors, I/O errors, failing to
open files, attempting to use files that do not have only ASCII
characters (dc(1) only accepts ASCII characters), attempting to open a
directory as a file, and giving invalid command-line options.
.RE
.PP
The exit status \f[B]4\f[R] is special; when a fatal error occurs, dc(1)
always exits and returns \f[B]4\f[R], no matter what mode dc(1) is in.
.PP
The other statuses will only be returned when dc(1) is not in
interactive mode (see the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R] section), since
dc(1) resets its state (see the \f[B]RESET\f[R] section) and accepts
more input when one of those errors occurs in interactive mode.
This is also the case when interactive mode is forced by the
\f[B]-i\f[R] flag or \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option.
.PP
These exit statuses allow dc(1) to be used in shell scripting with error
checking, and its normal behavior can be forced by using the
\f[B]-i\f[R] flag or \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.PP
Like bc(1), dc(1) has an interactive mode and a non-interactive mode.
Interactive mode is turned on automatically when both \f[B]stdin\f[R]
and \f[B]stdout\f[R] are hooked to a terminal, but the \f[B]-i\f[R] flag
and \f[B]--interactive\f[R] option can turn it on in other situations.
.PP
In interactive mode, dc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see the
\f[B]RESET\f[R] section), and in normal execution, flushes
\f[B]stdout\f[R] as soon as execution is done for the current input.
dc(1) may also reset on \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] instead of exit, depending on
the contents of, or default for, the \f[B]DC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R]
environment variable (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section).
.SH TTY MODE
.PP
If \f[B]stdin\f[R], \f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R] are all
connected to a TTY, then \[lq]TTY mode\[rq] is considered to be
available, and thus, dc(1) can turn on TTY mode, subject to some
settings.
.PP
If there is the environment variable \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] in the
environment (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section), then if
that environment variable contains a non-zero integer, dc(1) will turn
on TTY mode when \f[B]stdin\f[R], \f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R]
are all connected to a TTY.
If the \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variable exists but is
\f[I]not\f[R] a non-zero integer, then dc(1) will not turn TTY mode on.
.PP
If the environment variable \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] does \f[I]not\f[R]
exist, the default setting is used.
The default setting can be queried with the \f[B]-h\f[R] or
\f[B]--help\f[R] options.
.PP
TTY mode is different from interactive mode because interactive mode is
required in the bc(1) specification (see the \f[B]STANDARDS\f[R]
section), and interactive mode requires only \f[B]stdin\f[R] and
\f[B]stdout\f[R] to be connected to a terminal.
.SS Prompt
.PP
If TTY mode is available, then a prompt can be enabled.
Like TTY mode itself, it can be turned on or off with an environment
variable: \f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R]
section).
.PP
If the environment variable \f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R] exists and is a non-zero
integer, then the prompt is turned on when \f[B]stdin\f[R],
\f[B]stdout\f[R], and \f[B]stderr\f[R] are connected to a TTY and the
\f[B]-P\f[R] and \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R] options were not used.
The read prompt will be turned on under the same conditions, except that
the \f[B]-R\f[R] and \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R] options must also not be
used.
.PP
However, if \f[B]DC_PROMPT\f[R] does not exist, the prompt can be
enabled or disabled with the \f[B]DC_TTY_MODE\f[R] environment variable,
the \f[B]-P\f[R] and \f[B]--no-prompt\f[R] options, and the \f[B]-R\f[R]
and \f[B]--no-read-prompt\f[R] options.
See the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] and \f[B]OPTIONS\f[R] sections
for more details.
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
.PP
Sending a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] will cause dc(1) to do one of two things.
.PP
If dc(1) is not in interactive mode (see the \f[B]INTERACTIVE MODE\f[R]
section), or the \f[B]DC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R] environment variable (see the
\f[B]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section), or its default, is either not
an integer or it is zero, dc(1) will exit.
.PP
However, if dc(1) is in interactive mode, and the
\f[B]DC_SIGINT_RESET\f[R] or its default is an integer and non-zero,
then dc(1) will stop executing the current input and reset (see the
\f[B]RESET\f[R] section) upon receiving a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R].
.PP
Note that \[lq]current input\[rq] can mean one of two things.
If dc(1) is processing input from \f[B]stdin\f[R] in interactive mode,
it will ask for more input.
If dc(1) is processing input from a file in interactive mode, it will
stop processing the file and start processing the next file, if one
exists, or ask for input from \f[B]stdin\f[R] if no other file exists.
.PP
This means that if a \f[B]SIGINT\f[R] is sent to dc(1) as it is
executing a file, it can seem as though dc(1) did not respond to the
signal since it will immediately start executing the next file.
This is by design; most files that users execute when interacting with
dc(1) have function definitions, which are quick to parse.
If a file takes a long time to execute, there may be a bug in that file.
The rest of the files could still be executed without problem, allowing
the user to continue.
.PP
\f[B]SIGTERM\f[R] and \f[B]SIGQUIT\f[R] cause dc(1) to clean up and
exit, and it uses the default handler for all other signals.
.SH LOCALES
.PP
This dc(1) ships with support for adding error messages for different
locales and thus, supports \f[B]LC_MESSAGES\f[R].
