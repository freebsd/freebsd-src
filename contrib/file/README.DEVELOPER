## Auto files

After checking out the source, run the following:

	autoreconf -f -i
	make distclean	# this can fail if you have not built before
	./configure --disable-silent-rules
	make -j4
	make -C tests check

If you see errors, make sure you have the latest libtool and autoconf
This has been tested with autoconf-2.69 and libtool-2.4.2

## Installing dependencies

If your platform doesn't have the above tools, install the following
packages first.
