# file(1) magic for things that have PACK as magic

0	string	PACK

# The actual magic is 'PACK', but that clashes with Doom/Quake packs. However,
# those have a little-endian offset immediately following the magic 'PACK',
# the first byte of which is never 0, while the first byte of the Git pack
# version, since it's a tiny number stored in big-endian format, is always 0.
# GRR: line above is too general as it matches also PackDir archive ./acorn
# test for major version. Git 2017 accepts version number 2 or 3

# Acorn PackDir with method 0 compression has root like ADFS::HardDisc4.$.AsylumSrc
# or SystemDevice::foobar

# but in git binary

!:mime	application/x-git
