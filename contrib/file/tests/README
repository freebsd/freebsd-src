file tests
==========

This directory contains tests for file. It is highly encouraged to add
one each time a bug is found, and each time new magic is added. Each
test consists of two files:

  TEST.testfile
  TEST.result

where TEST is the base name of the test, TEST.testfile is the input,
and TEST.result is the desired output from file.

To add a new test just add the test files to the directory.
