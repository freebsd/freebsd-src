# MKterminfo.sh -- generate terminfo.5 from Caps tabular data
#
# This script takes terminfo.head and terminfo.tail and splices in between
# them a table derived from the Caps data file.  Besides avoiding having
# the docs fall out of sync with the table, this also lets us set up tbl
# commands for better formatting of the table.
#
# NOTE: The s in this script really are control characters.  It translates
#  to \n because I couldn't get used to inserting linefeeds directly.  There
# had better be no s in the table source text.
