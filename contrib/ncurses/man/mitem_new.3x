.SH NAME
\fBnew_item\fP,
\fBfree_item\fP \-
create and destroy menu items
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <menu.h>
.PP
\fBITEM *new_item(const char *\fIname\fP, const char *\fIdescription\fP);
\fBint free_item(ITEM *\fIitem\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBnew_item\fP allocates a new item and initializes it from the
\fBname\fP and \fBdescription\fP pointers.
Please notice that the item stores
only the pointers to the name and description.
Those pointers must be valid
during the lifetime of the item.
So you should be very careful with names
or descriptions allocated on the stack of some routines.
.br
The function \fBfree_item\fP de-allocates an item.
Please notice that it
is the responsibility of the application to release the memory for the
name or the description of the item.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBnew_item\fP returns \fBNULL\fP on error.
It sets \fBerrno\fP according to the function's failure:
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.
.PP
The function \fBfree_item\fP returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_CONNECTED
Item is connected to a menu.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH PORTABILITY

Version 7 or BSD versions.
