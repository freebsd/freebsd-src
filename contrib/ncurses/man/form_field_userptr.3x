.SH NAME
\fBset_field_userptr\fP,
\fBfield_userptr\fP \-
associate application data with a form field
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <form.h>
.PP
\fBint set_field_userptr(FIELD *\fIfield\fP, void *\fIuserptr\fP);
\fBvoid *field_userptr(const FIELD *\fIfield\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every form field has a field that can be used to hold application-specific data
(that is, the form-driver code leaves it alone).
These functions get and set
that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBfield_userptr\fP returns a pointer (which may be \fBNULL\fP).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The function \fBset_field_userptr\fP returns \fBE_OK\fP (success).
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The user pointer is a void pointer.
We chose not to leave it as a char pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
.SH AUTHORS
