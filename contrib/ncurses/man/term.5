compiled \fIterminfo\fR terminal description
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B term
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "Storage Location"
Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory \fB\*d\fP.
Two configurations are supported
(when building the \fI\%ncurses\fP libraries):
.TP 5
.B directory tree
A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search
of a huge Unix system directory: \fB\*d/c/name\fP where
.I name
is the name of the terminal, and
.I c
is the first character of
.IR name .
Thus,
.I act4
can be found in the file \fB\*d/a/act4\fP.
Synonyms for the same terminal are implemented by multiple
links to the same compiled file.
.TP 5
.B hashed database
Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored:
the terminfo data in the same format as stored in a directory tree with
the terminfo's primary name as a key,
and records containing only aliases pointing to the primary name.
.IP
If built to write hashed databases,
\fI\%ncurses\fP can still read terminfo databases organized as a
directory tree,
but cannot write entries into the directory tree.
It can write (or rewrite) entries in the hashed database.
.IP
\fI\%ncurses\fP distinguishes the two cases in the \fI\%TERMINFO\fP and
\fI\%TERMINFO_DIRS\fP environment variable by assuming a directory tree
for entries that correspond to an existing directory,
and hashed database otherwise.
.SS "Legacy Storage Format"
The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all hardware.
An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions about byte ordering
or sign extension are made.
.PP
The compiled file is created with the \fB@TIC@\fP program,
and read by the routine \fBsetupterm\fP(3X).
The file is divided into six parts:
.RS 5
.TP 3
a) \fIheader\fP,
.TP 3
b) \fIterminal names\fP,
.TP 3
c) \fIBoolean flags\fP,
.TP 3
d) \fInumbers\fP,
.TP 3
e) \fIstrings\fP, and
.TP 3
f) \fIstring table\fP.
.RE
.PP
The \fIheader\fP section begins the file.
This section contains six short integers in the format
described below.
These integers are
.RS 5
.TP 5
(1) the \fImagic number\fP (octal 0432);
.TP 5
(2) the size, in bytes, of the \fIterminal names\fP section;
.TP 5
(3) the number of bytes in the \fIBoolean flags\fP section;
.TP 5
(4) the number of short integers in the \fInumbers\fP section;
.TP 5
(5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the \fIstrings\fP section;
.TP 5
(6) the size, in bytes, of the \fIstring table\fP.
.RE
.PP
The capabilities in the
\fIBoolean flags\fP,
\fInumbers\fP, and
\fIstrings\fP
sections are in the same order as the file <term.h>.
.PP
Short integers are signed, in the range \-32768 to 32767.
They are stored as two 8-bit bytes.
The first byte contains the least significant 8 bits of the value,
and the second byte contains the most significant 8 bits.
(Thus, the value represented is 256*second+first.)
This format corresponds to the hardware of the \s-1VAX\s+1
and \s-1PDP\s+1-11 (that is, little-endian machines).
Machines where this does not correspond to the hardware must read the
integers as two bytes and compute the little-endian value.
.PP
Numbers in a terminal description,
whether they are entries in the \fInumbers\fP or \fIstrings\fP table,
are positive integers.
Boolean flags are treated as positive one-byte integers.
In each case, those positive integers represent a terminal capability.
The terminal compiler @TIC@ uses negative integers to handle the cases where
a capability is not available:
.bP
If a capability is absent from this terminal,
@TIC@ stores a \-1 in the corresponding table.
.IP
The integer value \-1 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0377.
.br
Absent Boolean values are represented by the byte 0 (false).
.bP
If a capability has been canceled from this terminal,
@TIC@ stores a \-2 in the corresponding table.
.IP
The integer value \-2 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0376.
.br
The Boolean value \-2 is represented by the byte 0376.
.br
.bP
Other negative values are illegal.
.PP
The \fIterminal names\fP section comes after the \fIheader\fP.
It contains the first line of the terminfo description,
listing the various names for the terminal,
separated by the \*(``|\*('' character.
The \fIterminal names\fP section is terminated
with an \s-1ASCII NUL\s+1 character.
.PP
The \fIBoolean flags\fP section has one byte for each flag.
Boolean capabilities are either 1 or 0 (true or false)
according to whether the terminal supports the given capability or not.
.PP
Between the \fIBoolean flags\fP section and the \fInumber\fP section,
a null byte will be inserted, if necessary,
to ensure that the \fInumber\fP section begins on an even byte
This is a relic of the PDP\-11's word-addressed architecture,
originally designed to avoid traps induced
by addressing a word on an odd byte boundary.
All short integers are aligned on a short word boundary.
.PP
The \fInumbers\fP section is similar to the \fIBoolean flags\fP section.
Each capability takes up two bytes,
and is stored as a little-endian short integer.
.PP
The \fIstrings\fP section is also similar.
Each capability is stored as a short integer.
The capability value is an index into the \fIstring table\fP.
.PP
The \fIstring table\fP is the last section.
It contains all of the values of string capabilities referenced in
the \fIstrings\fP section.
Each string is null-terminated.
Special characters in \*^X or \ec notation are stored in their
interpreted form, not the printing representation.
Padding information $<nn> and parameter information %x are
stored intact in uninterpreted form.
.SS "Extended Storage Format"
The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary format.
With some minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY),
the same binary format is used in all modern Unix systems.
Each system uses a predefined set of Boolean, number or string capabilities.
.PP
The \fI\%ncurses\fP libraries and applications support
extended terminfo binary format,
allowing users to define capabilities which are loaded at runtime.
This
extension is made possible by using the fact that the other implementations
stop reading the terminfo data when they have reached the end of the size given
in the header.
\fI\%ncurses\fP checks the size,
and if it exceeds that due to the predefined data,
continues to parse according to its own scheme.
.PP
First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):
.RS 5
.TP 5
(1)
count of extended Boolean capabilities
.TP 5
(2)
count of extended numeric capabilities
.TP 5
(3)
count of extended string capabilities
.TP 5
(4)
count of the items in extended string table
.TP 5
(5)
size of the extended string table in bytes
.RE
.PP
The count- and size-values for the extended string table
include the extended capability \fInames\fP as well as
extended capability \fIvalues\fP.
.PP
Using the counts and sizes,
\fI\%ncurses\fP allocates arrays and reads data for the extended
capabilities in the same order as the header information.
.PP
The extended string table contains values for string capabilities.
After the end of these values, it contains the names for each of
the extended capabilities in order, e.g., Booleans, then numbers and
finally strings.
.PP
By storing terminal descriptions in this way,
\fI\%ncurses\fP is able to provide a database useful with legacy
applications,
as well as providing data for applications which need more than the
predefined capabilities.
See \fBuser_caps\fP(5) for an overview
of the way \fI\%ncurses\fP uses this extended information.
.PP
Applications which manipulate terminal data can use the definitions
described in \fBterm_variables\fP(3X) which associate the long capability
names with members of a \fBTERMTYPE\fP structure.
.
.SS "Extended Number Format"
On occasion, 16-bit signed integers are not large enough.
With \fI\%ncurses\fP 6.1,
a new format was introduced by making a few changes
to the legacy format:
.bP
a different magic number (octal 01036)
.bP
changing the type for the \fInumber\fP array from signed 16-bit integers
to signed 32-bit integers.
.PP
To maintain compatibility, the library presents the same data structures
to direct users of the \fBTERMTYPE\fP structure as in previous formats.
However, that cannot provide callers with the extended numbers.
The library uses a similar but hidden data structure \fBTERMTYPE2\fP
to provide data for the terminfo functions.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I \*d
compiled terminal description database
.SH PORTABILITY
.SS setupterm
Note that it is possible for
.B setupterm
to expect a different set of capabilities
than are actually present in the file.
Either the database may have been updated since
.B setupterm
was recompiled
(resulting in extra unrecognized entries in the file)
or the program may have been recompiled more recently
than the database was updated
(resulting in missing entries).
The routine
.B setupterm
must be prepared for both possibilities \-
this is why the numbers and sizes are included.
Also, new capabilities must always be added at the end of the lists
of Boolean, number, and string capabilities.
.SS "Binary Format"
X/Open Curses does not specify a format for the terminfo database.
System V curses used a directory-tree of binary files,
one per terminal description.
.PP
Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the otherwise
self-describing format, it is not wise to count on portability of binary
terminfo entries between commercial Unix versions.
The problem is that there
are at least three versions of terminfo (under HP\-UX, AIX, and OSF/1) which
diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added extension
capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format) collide with
System V and X/Open Curses extensions.
See \fBterminfo\fP(5) for detailed
discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.
.PP
This implementation is by default compatible with the binary
terminfo format used by Solaris curses,
except in a few less-used details
where it was found that the latter did not match X/Open Curses.
The format used by the other Unix versions
can be matched by building \fI\%ncurses\fP
with different configuration options.
.SS "Magic Codes"
The magic number in a binary terminfo file is the first 16-bits (two bytes).
Besides making it more reliable for the library to check that a file
is terminfo,
utilities such as \fBfile\fP(1) also use that to tell what the file-format is.
System V defined more than one magic number,
with 0433, 0435 as screen-dumps (see \fBscr_dump\fP(5)).
This implementation uses 01036 as a continuation of that sequence,
but with a different high-order byte to avoid confusion.
.SS "The \fITERMTYPE\fP Structure"
Direct access to the \fBTERMTYPE\fP structure is provided for legacy
applications.
Portable applications should use the \fBtigetflag\fP and related functions
described in \fBcurs_terminfo\fP(3X) for reading terminal capabilities.
.SS "Mixed-case Terminal Names"
A small number of terminal descriptions use uppercase characters in
their names.
If the underlying filesystem ignores the difference between
uppercase and lowercase,
\fI\%ncurses\fP represents the \*(``first character\*(''
of the terminal name used as
the intermediate level of a directory tree in (two-character) hexadecimal form.
.SS Limits
\fI\%ncurses\fP stores compiled terminal descriptions
in three related formats,
described in the sections
.bP
\fBLEGACY STORAGE FORMAT\fP, and
.bP
\fBEXTENDED STORAGE FORMAT\fP, and
.bP
\fBEXTENDED NUMBER FORMAT\fP.
.PP
The legacy storage format and the extended number format differ by
the types of numeric capability which they can store
(i.e., 16-bit versus 32-bit integers).
The extended storage format introduced by \fI\%ncurses\fP 5.0 adds data
to either of these formats.
.PP
Some limitations apply:
.bP
total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes in the legacy format.
.bP
total compiled entries cannot exceed 32768 bytes in the extended format.
.bP
the name field cannot exceed 128 bytes.
.PP
Compiled entries are limited to 32768 bytes because offsets into the
\fIstrings table\fP use two-byte integers.
The legacy format could have supported 32768-byte entries,
but was limited to a virtual memory page's 4096 bytes.
.SH EXAMPLES
As an example, here is a description for the Lear-Siegler
ADM\-3, a popular though rather stupid early terminal:
.PP
.EX
adm3a|lsi adm3a,
        am,
        cols#80, lines#24,
        bel=\*^G, clear=\e032$<1>, cr=\*^M, cub1=\*^H, cud1=\*^J,
        cuf1=\*^L, cup=\eE=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\*^K,
        home=\*^\*^, ind=\*^J,
