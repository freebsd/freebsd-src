/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * **libevdev** is a library for handling evdev kernel devices. It abstracts
 * the \ref ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change
 * the appearance of the device.
 *
 * Development of libevdev is discussed on
 * [input-tools@lists.freedesktop.org](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/input-tools)
 * Please submit patches, questions or general comments there.
 *
 * Handling events and SYN_DROPPED
 * ===============================
 *
 * libevdev provides an interface for handling events, including most notably
 * SYN_DROPPED events. SYN_DROPPED events are sent by the kernel when the
 * process does not read events fast enough and the kernel is forced to drop
 * some events. This causes the device to get out of sync with the process'
 * view of it. libevdev handles this by telling the caller that a SYN_DROPPED
 * has been received and that the state of the device is different to what is
 * to be expected. It then provides the delta between the previous state and
 * the actual state of the device as a set of events. See
 * libevdev_next_event() and @ref syn_dropped for more information on how
 * SYN_DROPPED is handled.
 *
 * Signal safety
 * =============
 *
 * libevdev is signal-safe for the majority of its operations, i.e. many of
 * its functions are safe to be called from within a signal handler.
 * Check the API documentation to make sure, unless explicitly stated a call
 * is <b>not</b> signal safe.
 *
 * Device handling
 * ===============
 *
 * A libevdev context is valid for a given file descriptor and its
 * duration. Closing the file descriptor will not destroy the libevdev device
 * but libevdev will not be able to read further events.
 *
 * libevdev does not attempt duplicate detection. Initializing two libevdev
 * devices for the same fd is valid and behaves the same as for two different
 * devices.
 *
 * libevdev does not handle the file descriptors directly, it merely uses
 * them. The caller is responsible for opening the file descriptors, setting
 * them to O_NONBLOCK and handling permissions.
 *
 * Where does libevdev sit?
 * ========================
 *
 * libevdev is essentially a `read(2)` on steroids for `/dev/input/eventX`
 * devices. It sits below the process that handles input events, in between
 * the kernel and that process. In the simplest case, e.g. an evtest-like tool
 * the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → evtest
 *
 * For X.Org input modules, the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → xf86-input-evdev → X server → X client
 *
 * For Weston/Wayland, the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → Weston → Wayland client
 *
 * libevdev does **not** have knowledge of X clients or Wayland clients, it is
 * too low in the stack.
 *
 * Example
 * =======
 * Below is a simple example that shows how libevdev could be used. This example
 * opens a device, checks for relative axes and a left mouse button and if it
 * finds them monitors the device to print the event.
 *
 * @code
       struct libevdev *dev = NULL;
       int fd;
       int rc = 1;

       fd = open("/dev/input/event0", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK);
       rc = libevdev_new_from_fd(fd, &dev);
       if (rc < 0) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Failed to init libevdev (%s)\n", strerror(-rc));
               exit(1);
       }
       printf("Input device name: \"%s\"\n", libevdev_get_name(dev));
       printf("Input device ID: bus %#x vendor %#x product %#x\n",
              libevdev_get_id_bustype(dev),
              libevdev_get_id_vendor(dev),
              libevdev_get_id_product(dev));
       if (!libevdev_has_event_type(dev, EV_REL) ||
           !libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT)) {
               printf("This device does not look like a mouse\n");
               exit(1);
       }

       do {
               struct input_event ev;
               rc = libevdev_next_event(dev, LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL, &ev);
               if (rc == 0)
                       printf("Event: %s %s %d\n",
                              libevdev_get_event_type_name(ev.type),
                              libevdev_get_event_code_name(ev.type, ev.code),
                              ev.value);
       } while (rc == 1 || rc == 0 || rc == -EAGAIN);
  @endcode

 *
 * Backwards compatibility with older kernel
 * =========================================
 * libevdev attempts to build and run correctly on a number of kernel versions.
 * If features required are not available, libevdev attempts to work around them
 * in the most reasonable way. For more details see \ref backwardscompatibility.

/**
 * @page syn_dropped SYN_DROPPED handling
 *
 * This page describes how libevdev handles SYN_DROPPED events.
 *
 * Receiving SYN_DROPPED events
 * ============================
 *
 * The kernel sends evdev events separated by an event of type EV_SYN and
 * code SYN_REPORT. Such an event marks the end of a frame of hardware
 * events. The number of events between SYN_REPORT events is arbitrary and
 * depends on the hardware. An example event sequence may look like this:
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        9
   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        8
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        10
   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        10
   EV_KEY   BTN_TOUCH    1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        11
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
 * @endcode
 *
 * Events are handed to the client buffer as they appear, the kernel adjusts
 * the buffer size to handle at least one full event. In the normal case,
 * the client reads the event and the kernel can place the next event in the
 * buffer. If the client is not fast enough, the kernel places an event of
 * type EV_SYN and code SYN_DROPPED into the buffer, effectively notifying
 * the client that some events were lost. The above example event sequence
 * may look like this (note the missing/repeated events):
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        9
   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        8
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        10
   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        10
   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED  0
   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        15
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_X        11
   EV_KEY   BTN_TOUCH    0
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
 * @endcode
 *
 * A SYN_DROPPED event may be recieved at any time in the event sequence.
 * When a SYN_DROPPED event is received, the client must:
 * * discard all events since the last SYN_REPORT
 * * discard all events until including the next SYN_REPORT
 * These event are part of incomplete event frames.
 *
 * Synchronizing the state of the device
 * =====================================
 *
 * The handling of the device after a SYN_DROPPED depends on the available
 * event codes. For all event codes of type EV_REL, no handling is
 * necessary, there is no state attached. For all event codes of type
 * EV_KEY, EV_SW, EV_LED and EV_SND, the matching @ref ioctls retrieve the
 * current state. The caller must then compare the last-known state to the
 * retrieved state and handle the deltas accordingly.
 * libevdev simplifies this approach: if the state of the device has
 * changed, libevdev generates an event for each code with the new value and
 * passes it to the caller during libevdev_next_event() if
 * @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC is set.
 *
 * For events of type EV_ABS and an event code less than ABS_MT_SLOT, the
 * handling of state changes is as described above. For events between
 * ABS_MT_SLOT and ABS_MAX, the event handling differs.
 * Slots are the vehicles to transport information for multiple simultaneous
 * touchpoints on a device. Slots are re-used once a touchpoint has ended.
 * The kernel sends an ABS_MT_SLOT event whenever the current slot
 * changes; any event in the above axis range applies only to the currently
 * active slot.
 * Thus, an event sequence from a slot-capable device may look like this:
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
 * @endcode
 * Note the lack of ABS_MT_SLOT: the first ABS_MT_POSITION_Y applies to
 * a slot opened previously, and is the only axis that changed for that
 * slot. The touchpoint in slot 1 now has position 100/80.
 * The kernel does not provide events if a value does not change, and does
 * not send ABS_MT_SLOT events if the slot does not change, or none of the
 * values within a slot changes. A client must thus keep the state for each
 * slot.
 *
 * If a SYN_DROPPED is received,  the client must sync all slots
 * individually and update its internal state. libevdev simplifies this by
 * generating multiple events:
 * * for each slot on the device, libevdev generates an
 *   ABS_MT_SLOT event with the value set to the slot number
 * * for each event code between ABS_MT_SLOT + 1 and ABS_MAX that changed
 *   state for this slot, libevdev generates an event for the new state
 * * libevdev sends a final ABS_MT_SLOT event for the current slot as
 *   seen by the kernel
 * * libevdev terminates this sequence with an EV_SYN SYN_REPORT event
 *
 * An example event sequence for such a sync may look like this:
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   8
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_PRESSURE     12
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
 * @endcode
 * Note the terminating ABS_MT_SLOT event, this indicates that the kernel
 * currently has slot 1 active.
 *
 * Synchronizing ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID
 * ================================
 *
 * The event code ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID is used to denote the start and end of
 * a touch point within a slot. An ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID of zero or greater
 * denotes the start of a touchpoint, an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID of -1 denotes
 * the end of a touchpoint within this slot. During SYN_DROPPED, a touch
 * point may have ended and re-started within a slot - a client must check
 * the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. libevdev simplifies this by emulating extra
 * events if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID has changed:
 * * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was valid and is -1, libevdev enqueues an
 *   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with value -1.
 * * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was -1 and is now a valid ID, libevdev
 *   enqueues an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with the current value.
 * * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was a valid ID and is now a different valid
 *   ID, libevev enqueues an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with value -1 and
 *   another ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with the new value.
 *
 * An example event sequence for such a sync may look like this:
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  45
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   8
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_PRESSURE     12
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
 * @endcode
 * Note how the touchpoint in slot 0 was terminated, the touchpoint in slot
 * 2 was terminated and then started with a new ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. The touchpoint
 * in slot 1 maintained the same ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID and only updated the
 * coordinates. Slot 1 is the currently active slot.
 *
 * In the case of a SYN_DROPPED event, a touch point may be invisible to a
 * client if it started after SYN_DROPPED and finished before the client
 * handles events again. The below example shows an example event sequence
 * and what libevdev sees in the case of a SYN_DROPPED event:
 * @code

             kernel                  |              userspace
                                     |
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0    |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |    EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   ------------------------          |    ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  30   |
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100  |
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80   |
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |           SYN_DROPPED
   ------------------------          |
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1   |
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |
   ------------------------          |    ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1    |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |    EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
 * @endcode
 * If such an event sequence occurs, libevdev will send all updated axes
 * during the sync process. Axis events may thus be generated for devices
 * without a currently valid ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. Specifically for the above
 * example, the client would receive the following event sequence:
 * @code
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0       ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   ------------------------
   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED         0       → LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SYNC
   ------------------------
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100     ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   -----------------------------        → -EGAIN
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1       ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90
   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   -------------------
 * @endcode
 * The axis events do not reflect the position of a current touch point, a
 * client must take care not to generate a new touch point based on those
 * updates.
 *
 * Discarding events before synchronizing
 * =====================================
 *
 * The kernel implements the client buffer as a ring buffer. SYN_DROPPED
 * events are handled when the buffer is full and a new event is received
 * from a device. All existing events are discarded, a SYN_DROPPED is added
 * to the buffer followed by the actual device event. Further events will be
 * appended to the buffer until it is either read by the client, or filled
 * again, at which point the sequence repeats.
 *
 * When the client reads the buffer, the buffer will thus always consist of
 * exactly one SYN_DROPPED event followed by an unspecified number of real
 * events. The data the ioctls return is the current state of the device,
 * i.e. the state after all these events have been processed. For example,
 * assume the buffer contains the following sequence:
 *
 * @code
   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               1
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               2
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               3
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               4
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               5
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               6
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
 * @endcode
 * An ioctl at any time in this sequence will return a value of 6 for ABS_X.
 *
 * libevdev discards all events after a SYN_DROPPED to ensure the events
 * during @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC represent the last known state of the
 * device. This loses some granularity of the events especially as the time
 * between the SYN_DROPPED and the sync process increases. It does however
 * avoid spurious cursor movements. In the above example, the event sequence
 * by libevdev is:
 * @code
   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED
   EV_ABS   ABS_X               6
   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
   @endcode

/**
 * @page backwardscompatibility Compatibility and Behavior across kernel versions
 *
 * This page describes libevdev's behavior when the build-time kernel and the
 * run-time kernel differ in their feature set.
 *
 * With the exception of event names, libevdev defines features that may be
 * missing on older kernels and building on such kernels will not disable
 * features. Running libevdev on a kernel that is missing some feature will
 * change libevdev's behavior. In most cases, the new behavior should be
 * obvious, but it is spelled out below in detail.
 *
 * Minimum requirements
 * ====================
 * libevdev requires a 2.6.36 kernel as minimum. Specifically, it requires
 * kernel-support for ABS_MT_SLOT.
 *
 * Event and input property names
 * ==============================
 * Event names and input property names are defined at build-time by the
 * linux/input.h shipped with libevdev.
 * The list of event names is compiled at build-time, any events not defined
 * at build time will not resolve. Specifically,
 * libevdev_event_code_get_name() for an undefined type or code will
 * always return NULL. Likewise, libevdev_property_get_name() will return NULL
 * for properties undefined at build-time.
 *
 * Input properties
 * ================
 * If the kernel does not support input properties, specifically the
 * EVIOCGPROPS ioctl, libevdev does not expose input properties to the caller.
 * Specifically, libevdev_has_property() will always return 0 unless the
 * property has been manually set with libevdev_enable_property().
 *
 * This also applies to the libevdev-uinput code. If uinput does not honor
 * UI_SET_PROPBIT, libevdev will continue without setting the properties on
 * the device.
 *
 * MT slot behavior
 * =================
 * If the kernel does not support the EVIOCGMTSLOTS ioctl, libevdev
 * assumes all values in all slots are 0 and continues without an error.
 *
 * SYN_DROPPED behavior
 * ====================
 * A kernel without SYN_DROPPED won't send such an event. libevdev_next_event()
 * will never require the switch to sync mode.

/**
 * @page testing libevdev-internal test suite
 *
 * libevdev's internal test suite uses the
 * [Check unit testing framework](http://check.sourceforge.net/). Tests are
 * divided into test suites and test cases. Most tests create a uinput device,
 * so you'll need to run as root, and your kernel must have
 * CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT enabled.
 *
 * To run a specific suite only:
 *
 *     export CK_RUN_SUITE="suite name"
 *
 * To run a specific test case only:
 *
 *     export CK_RUN_TEST="test case name"
 *
 * To get a list of all suites or tests:
 *
 *     git grep "suite_create"
 *     git grep "tcase_create"
 *
 * By default, Check forks, making debugging harder. The test suite tries to detect
 * if it is running inside gdb and disable forking. If that doesn't work for
 * some reason, run gdb as below to avoid forking.
 *
 *     sudo CK_FORK=no CK_RUN_TEST="test case name" gdb ./test/test-libevdev
 *
 * A special target `make gcov-report.txt` exists that runs gcov and leaves a
 * `libevdev.c.gcov` file. Check that for test coverage.
 *
 * `make check` is hooked up to run the test and gcov (again, needs root).
 *
 * The test suite creates a lot of devices, very quickly. Add the following
 * xorg.conf.d snippet to avoid the devices being added as X devices (at the
 * time of writing, mutter can't handle these devices and exits after getting
 * a BadDevice error).

 * libevdev provides two methods of logging library-internal messages. The

 * log handler in libevdev_set_device_log_function(). Developers are encouraged
 * to use the per-context logging facilities over the global log handler as
 * it provides access to the libevdev instance that caused a message, and is
 * more flexible when libevdev is used from within a shared library.
 *
 * If a caller sets both the global log handler and a per-context log
 * handler, each device with a per-context log handler will only invoke that
 * log handler.
 *
 * @note To set a context-specific log handler, a context is needed.
 * Thus developers are discouraged from using libevdev_new_from_fd() as
 * important messages from the device initialization process may get lost.

/**
 * @defgroup mt Multi-touch related functions
 * Functions for querying multi-touch-related capabilities. MT devices
 * following the kernel protocol B (using ABS_MT_SLOT) provide multiple touch
 * points through so-called slots on the same axis. The slots are enumerated,
 * a client reading from the device will first get an ABS_MT_SLOT event, then
 * the values of axes changed in this slot. Multiple slots may be provided in
 * before an EV_SYN event.
 *
 * As with @ref bits, the logical state of the device as seen by the library
 * depends on the caller using libevdev_next_event().
 *
 * The Linux kernel requires all axes on a device to have a semantic
 * meaning, matching the axis names in linux/input.h. Some devices merely
 * export a number of axes beyond the available axis list. For those
 * devices, the multitouch information is invalid. Specfically, if a device
 * provides the ABS_MT_SLOT axis AND also the (ABS_MT_SLOT - 1) axis, the
 * device is not treated as multitouch device. No slot information is
 * available and the ABS_MT axis range for these devices is treated as all
 * other EV_ABS axes.
 *
 * Note that because of limitations in the kernel API, such fake multitouch
 * devices can not be reliably synched after a SYN_DROPPED event. libevdev
 * ignores all ABS_MT axis values during the sync process and instead
 * relies on the device to send the current axis value with the first event
 * after SYN_DROPPED.
