At the moment, only installation from a harddisk
is supported. All commands are shown to you on
the screen before executing. This is just to make
sure that nothing bad is done to your harddisk :-)

You can also select to install from a premounted dir.
Then the "tar/base" directory must be mounted on
"/install", so that all tar-packages from the basic
stuff are in "/install/*.tgz". (So you could be able
to install via NFS...)

Good luck...,
anyone wants to help programming this tool?,

What does "setup" do on my computer?
====================================
Setup will ask you for a partition on your harddisk,
where you would like to have Linux installed.
You can then choose to install this distribution from
your local harddisk or via network (NFS).
setup will install a very basic system.
At the end, you can install lilo, the Linux Loader.
Rebooting your computer with this little linux system
and then running the setup-program on it, will give
the possibility to install more packages.

Creating a Linux-partition:
===========================
To install this Linux distribution, you need to
create an extra partition on your harddisk for
Linux.

What is lilo and how should I install it?
=========================================
Read the lilo-documentation for this...
