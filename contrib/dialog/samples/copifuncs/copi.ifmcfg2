# From this line on, values may be prefixed by a logical expression in

# Possible elements are:
# - Nodelist flags (like "CM", "MNP", "V32" etc.)
# - speed <operator> <numeric>
#         where <operator> is '=', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', '>='
# - address <wildcard>
#         where <wildcard> is an (possibly incomplete) fidonet address, 
#         e.g. "5020/*"
# - time <interval>[,<interval>,...]
#         where <interval> is a day spec. with optional time spec., e.g.
#         Wk2000-0900,Sat1800-0000,Sun
# - phone <prefix>
#         e.g. "phone 7-095-"

# \t tab (0x09)
# \b backspace (0x08)
# \s space (0x20)
# \NNN (where N is an octal digit) - character with octal code NNN
# \d 1 second delay (send strings only)
# \p 1/4 second pause (send strings only)
# \T translated telephone no. (send strings only)
# \D untranslated telephone no. (send strings only)

# ModemPort present a blank-separated list of ports with possible speed

# actual speed is taken from the nodelist.  If speed is omitted (or set
# to zero), previous port speed is not changed.
