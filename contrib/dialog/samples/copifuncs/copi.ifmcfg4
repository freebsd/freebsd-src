# Call options (time, address and nodelist flag dependent)
# All matching are applied in the order they are specified.
# Possible options are "[No]Call", "[No]Hold", "[No]PUA", "[No]EMSI",
# "[No]WaZOO", "[No]Freqs", "[No]Zmodem", "[No]ZedZap", "[No]Janus",
# "[No]Hydra". Here, WaZOO stands for YooHoo/2U2 handshake, not for
# the transfer scheme. FTS-0001 handshake and DietIFNA scheme cannot
# be disallowed (because they are mandatory by standard).  "Hold" 
# means really hold "hold" type packets and files: do not send them
# if our system initiated the session, "NoHold" means  send "hold"
# packets when our system initiated the session. "NoPUA" stands for
# "No PickUp All", i.e. PUP ("Pick Up Primary").  NoCall means do not
# perform outbound call.  This flag has no effect on the nodes
# explicitly specified in the command line.
# Default options are "everything allowed".
# options  ((!CM) & time Any0700-0200) Nocall
