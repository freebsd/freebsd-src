questions that have an answer of either yes or no. \
BTW, do you notice that long lines will be automatically \
wrapped around so that they can fit in the box? You can \
also control line breaking explicitly by inserting \
'backslash n' at any place you like, but in this case, \
auto wrap around will be disabled and you will have to \
control line breaking yourself." 6 30
