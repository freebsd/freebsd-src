This is an enhanced version of the 'dialog' command. Quoting Thomas Dickey,
the ncurses developer, "DIALOG was written by Savio Lam <lam836@cs.cuhk.hk>
and modified by several people.

"Initially, I made fixes and reviewed the code to ensure that problems
reported were not related to ncurses. After that, I resumed development,
adding new widget types. See the changelog for details."
