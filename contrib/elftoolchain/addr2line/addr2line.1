.Sh NAME
.Nm addr2line
.Nd translate program addresses to source file names and line numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a | Fl -addresses
.Op Fl b Ar target | Fl -target Ns = Ns Ar target
.Op Fl e Ar pathname | Fl -exe Ns = Ns Ar pathname
.Op Fl f | Fl -functions
.Op Fl i | Fl -inlines
.Op Fl j Ar sectionname | Fl -section Ns = Ns Ar sectionname
.Op Fl p | Fl -pretty-print
.Op Fl s | Fl -basename
.Op Fl C | Fl -demangle
.Op Fl H | Fl -help
.Op Fl V | Fl -version
.Op Ar hexaddress Ns ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility translates program addresses specified by the command line
arguments
.Ar hexaddress
to their corresponding source file names and line numbers.
If no arguments are given to
.Nm ,
it will read these addresses from standard input.
.Pp
Program addresses specified by arguments
.Ar hexaddress
are encoded using the conventions accepted by
.Xr strtoull 3 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will use the executable
.Dq Pa a.out .
The
.Fl e
option may be used to specified a different ELF object.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility recognizes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a | Fl -addresses
Display the address prior to the line number information.
.It Fl b Ar target | Fl -target Ns = Ns Ar target
This option is recognized by
.Nm
but is ignored.
It is supported for compatibility with GNU binutils.
.It Fl e Ar pathname | Fl -exe Ns = Ns Ar pathname
Use the ELF object specified by argument
.Ar pathname
to translate addresses.
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
will use the file
.Dq Pa a.out .
.It Fl f | Fl -functions
Display function names in addition to file and line number information.
.It Fl i | Fl -inlines
If the address specified belongs to an inlined function, also display the line
number information for its caller, recursively until the first non-inlined
caller.
.It Fl j Ar sectionname | Fl -section Ns = Ns Ar sectionname
The values specified by arguments
.Ar hexaddress
are to be treated as offsets into the section named
.Ar sectionname .
.It Fl p | -pretty-print
Display the line number information on one line, in human readable manner.
.It Fl s | -basename
Display only the base name for each file name.
.It Fl C | Fl -demangle
Demangle C++ names.
.It Fl H | Fl -help
Print a help message.
.It Fl V | Fl -version
Print a version identifier and exit.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
If the
.Fl f
option was not specified,
.Nm
will print the file name and line number for each address specified
on a separate line.
.Pp
If the
.Fl f
option was specified,
.Nm
will print a line containing the name of the function corresponding
to program address
.Ar hexaddress ,
followed by a line with the file name and line number.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option was specified,
.Nm
will print line number information and function name on one line in
human readable manner. If the
.Fl i
option was also specified,
.Nm
will print the caller function information prefixed with
.Dq (inlined by) .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility prints the file name and line number using the format
.Dq FILENAME:LINENUMBER .
.Pp
If a file or function name could not be determined,
.Nm
will print a question mark in their place.
If the line number could not be determined,
.Nm
will print a zero in its place.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To map address 080483c4 in the default executable
.Pa a.out
to a source file name and line number use:
.D1 "% addr2line 080483c4"
.Pp
To map address 080483c4 in executable
.Pa helloworld ,
use:
.D1 "% addr2line -e helloworld 080483c4"
.Pp
To have
.Nm
act as a filter reading addresses from its standard input use:
.D1 "% addr2line"
.Pp
To print the function name corresponding to an address in addition to
its source file and line number use:
.D1 "% addr2line -f 080483c4"
