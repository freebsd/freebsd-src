.Sh NAME
.Nm c++filt
.Nd decode C++ symbols
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -help
.Op Fl _ | Fl -strip-underscores
.Op Fl n | Fl -no-strip-underscores
.Op Fl p | Fl -no-params
.Op Fl s Ar scheme | Fl -format Ns = Ns Ar scheme
.Op Fl V | Fl -version
.Op Ar encoded-names ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility translates encoded C++ symbol names to human-readable form.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility has two operating modes.
.Bl -bullet
.It
If arguments
.Ar encoded-names
are not specified, then
.Nm
will act as a filter, reading from standard input
and writing to standard output.
.It
If arguments
.Ar encoded-names
are specified, then
.Nm
will decode each such argument in turn, writing its decoded form
to standard output.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility recognizes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -help
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl _ | Fl -strip-underscores
Remove a leading underscore from symbol names prior to decoding them.
.It Fl n | Fl -no-strip-underscores
Do not remove leading underscores from names.
.It Fl p | Fl -no-params
This option is recognized but ignored.
.It Fl s Ar scheme | Fl -format Ns = Ns Ar scheme
Select the encoding scheme to use.
Argument
.Ar scheme
can be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "gnu-v5"
.It Ar arm
Use the encoding scheme specified by the C++ Annotated Reference Manual.
.It Ar auto
Guess the encoding scheme from the input.
.It Ar gnu
Use the encoding scheme used by the GNU C++ compiler.
.It Ar gnu-v3
Use the encoding scheme used by the GNU C++ compiler, version 3.
.El
.It Fl V | Fl -version
Print a version identifier for
.Nm
and exit.
