.Dt ELFTC_SET_TIMESTAMPS 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elftc_set_timestamps
.Nd set file timestamps
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelftc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libelftc.h
.Ft int
.Fn elftc_set_timestamps "const char *filename" "struct stat *sb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn elftc_set_timestamps
function is used to set the access and modified time stamps on a file
based on the contents of a
.Vt "struct stat"
descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar filename
names an existing file in the file system.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar sb
points to structure of type
.Vt "struct stat"
populated by a prior call to
.Xr fstat 2
or
.Xr stat 2 .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This function will invoke the high-resolution
.Xr utimes 2
system call if the underlying operating system supports it.
On operating systems lacking support for
.Xr utimes 2 ,
the function will use lower resolution
.Xr utime 2
system call.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the access and modified times for a new file to those of an
existing file, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct stat sb;
const char *existing_filename, *new_filename;

if (stat(existing_filename, &sb) < 0)
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, "stat failed");

if (elftc_set_timestamps(new_filename, &sb) < 0)
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, "timestamps could not be set");
