.Dt ELFTC_VERSION 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elftc_version
.Nd return a project-wide version identifier string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelftc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libelftc.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn elftc_version void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn elftc_version
returns a project-wide identifier string that encodes the source
revision of the project source tree.
.Pp
The returned identifier has four space-separated fields:
.Bl -tag -width ".Em Project Branch"
.It Em "Project-Name"
This is always
.Dq elftoolchain .
.It Em "Project-Branch"
The branch name for the project source tree.
.It Em "Build-OS"
The operating system that the tool chain was compiled for.
.It Em "Version-Number"
A tree-wide version number extracted from the version control
system in use.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn elftc_program_version
returns a pointer to an internal character buffer.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To retrieve and print the current toolchain version identifier, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <libelftc.h>

(void) printf("%s\en", elftc_version());
.Ed
.Pp
On the HEAD branch of the project's sources, when checked out using
Subversion and compiled on a
.Nx
host, this would print:
.D1 Dq elftoolchain HEAD NetBSD svn: Ns Em REVINFO
where
.Em REVINFO
would be the current revision information for the project source tree.
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn elftc_program_version
always succeeds.
