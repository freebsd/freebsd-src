.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates and maintains groups of files combined into an
archive.
Once an archive has been created, new files can be added to it, and
existing files can be extracted, deleted or replaced.
.Pp
Files are named in the archive by their last file name component,
so if a file referenced by a path containing a
.Dq /
is archived, it will be named by the last component of the path.
Similarly when matching paths listed on the command line against
file names stored in the archive, only the last component of the
path will be compared.
.Pp
The normal use of
.Nm
is for the creation and maintenance of libraries suitable for use
with the link editor
.Xr ld 1 ,
although it is not restricted to this purpose.
The
.Nm
utility can create and manage an archive symbol table (see
.Xr ar 5 )
used to speed up link editing operations.
If a symbol table is present in an archive, it will be
kept up-to-date by subsequent operations on the archive.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar member-after
When used with option
.Fl m
this option specifies that the archive members specified by
arguments
.Ar
are moved to after the archive member named by argument
.Ar member-after .
When used with option
.Fl r
this option specifies that the files specified by arguments
.Ar
are added after the archive member named by argument
.Ar member-after .
.It Fl b Ar member-before
When used with option
.Fl m
this option specifies that the archive members specified by
arguments
.Ar
are moved to before the archive member named by argument
.Ar member-before .
When used with option
.Fl r
this option specifies that the files specified by arguments
.Ar
are added before the archive member named by argument
.Ar member-before .
.It Fl c
Suppress the informational message printed when a new archive is
created using the
.Fl r
and
.Fl q
options.
.It Fl C
Prevent extracted files from replacing like-named files
in the file system.
.It Fl d
Delete the members named by arguments
.Ar
from the archive specified by argument
.Ar archive .
The archive's symbol table, if present, is updated to reflect
the new contents of the archive.
.It Fl D
When used in combination with the
.Fl r
or
.Fl q
option, insert 0's instead of the real mtime, uid and gid values
and 0644 instead of file mode from the members named by arguments
.Ar .
This ensures that checksums on the resulting archives are reproducible
when member contents are identical.
If multiple
.Fl D
and
.Fl U
options are specified on the command line, the final one takes precedence.
.It Fl f
Synonymous with option
.Fl T .
.It Fl F Ar flavor | Fl -flavor Ar flavor
Create archives with the specified archive format.
Legal values for argument
.Ar flavor
are:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Ar bsd
Create BSD format archives.
.It Ar gnu
An alias for
.Ar svr4 .
.It Ar svr4
Create SVR4 format archives.
.El
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
will create archives using the SVR4 format.
.It Fl i Ar member-before
Synonymous with option
.Fl b .
.It Fl j
This option is accepted for compatibility with the
.Tn FreeBSD
version of the
.Nm
utility, but is ignored.
.It Fl l
This option is accepted for compatibility with GNU
.Xr ar 1 ,
but is ignored.
.It Fl m
Move archive members specified by arguments
.Ar
within the archive.
If a position has been specified by one of the
.Fl a ,
.Fl b
or
.Fl i
options, the members are moved to before or after the specified
position.
If no position has been specified, the specified members are moved
to the end of the archive.
If the archive has a symbol table, it is updated to reflect the
new contents of the archive.
.It Fl M
Read and execute MRI librarian commands from standard input.
The commands understood by the
.Nm
utility are described in the section
.Sx "MRI Librarian Commands" .
.It Fl o
Preserve the original modification times of members when extracting
them.
.It Fl p
Write the contents of the specified archive members named by
arguments
.Ar
to standard output.
If no members were specified, the contents of all the files in the
archive are written in the order they appear in the archive.
.It Fl q
Append the files specified by arguments
.Ar
to the archive specified by argument
.Ar archive
without checking if the files already exist in the archive.
The archive symbol table will be updated as needed.
If the file specified by the argument
.Ar archive
does not already exist, a new archive will be created.
.It Fl r
Replace (add) the files specified by arguments
.Ar
in the archive specified by argument
.Ar archive ,
creating the archive if necessary.
Replacing existing members will not change the order of members within
the archive.
If a file named in arguments
.Ar
does not exist, existing members in the archive that match that
name are not changed.
New files are added to the end of the archive unless one of the
positioning options
.Fl a ,
.Fl b
or
.Fl i
is specified.
The archive symbol table, if it exists, is updated to reflect the
new state of the archive.
.It Fl s
Add an archive symbol table (see
.Xr ar 5 )
to the archive specified by argument
.Ar archive .
Invoking
.Nm
with the
.Fl s
option alone is equivalent to invoking
.Xr ranlib 1 .
.It Fl S
Do not generate an archive symbol table.
.It Fl t
For
.Nm ,
list the files specified by arguments
.Ar
in the order in which they appear in the archive, one per line.
If no files are specified, all files in the archive are listed.
.It Fl T
Use only the first fifteen characters of the archive member name or
command line file name argument when naming archive members.
.It Fl u
Conditionally update the archive or extract members.
When used with the
.Fl r
option, files named by arguments
.Ar
will be replaced in the archive if they are newer than their
archived versions.
When used with the
.Fl x
option, the members specified by arguments
.Ar
will be extracted only if they are newer than the corresponding
files in the file system.
.It Fl U
When used in combination with the
.Fl r
or
.Fl q
option, insert the real mtime, uid and gid, and file mode values
from the members named by arguments
.Ar .
If multiple
.Fl D
and
.Fl U
options are specified on the command line, the final one takes precedence.
.It Fl v
Provide verbose output.
When used with the
.Fl d ,
.Fl m ,
.Fl q
or
.Fl x
options,
.Nm
gives a file-by-file description of the archive modification being
performed, which consists of three white-space separated fields:
the option letter, a dash
.Dq "-" ,
and the file name.
When used with the
.Fl r
option,
.Nm
displays the description as above, but the initial letter is an
.Dq a
if the file is added to the archive, or an
.Dq r
if the file replaces a file already in the archive.
When used with the
.Fl p
option, the name of the file enclosed in
.Dq <
and
.Dq >
characters is written to standard output preceded by a single newline
character and followed by two newline characters.
The contents of the named file follow the file name.
When used with the
.Fl t
option,
.Nm
displays eight whitespace separated fields:
the file permissions as displayed by
.Xr strmode 3 ,
decimal user and group IDs separated by a slash (
.Dq / Ns ) ,
the file size in bytes, the file modification time in
.Xr strftime 3
format
.Dq "%b %e %H:%M %Y" ,
and the name of the file.
.It Fl V
Print a version identifier and exit.
.It Fl x
Extract archive members specified by arguments
.Ar
into the current directory.
If no members have been specified, extract all members of the archive.
If the file corresponding to an extracted member does not exist it
will be created.
If the file corresponding to an extracted member does exist, its owner
and group will not be changed while its contents will be overwritten
and its permissions will set to that entered in the archive.
The file's access and modification time would be that of the time
of extraction unless the
.Fl o
option was specified.
.It Fl z
This option is accepted for compatibility with the
.Tn FreeBSD
version of the
.Nm
utility, but is ignored.
.El
.Ss "MRI Librarian Commands"
If the
.Fl M
option is specified, the
.Nm
utility will read and execute commands from its standard input.
If standard input is a terminal, the
.Nm
utility will display the prompt
.Dq Li "AR >"
before reading a line, and will continue operation even if errors are
encountered.
If standard input is not a terminal, the
.Nm
utility will not display a prompt and will terminate execution on
encountering an error.
.Pp
Each input line contains a single command.
Words in an input line are separated by whitespace characters.
The first word of the line is the command, the remaining words are
the arguments to the command.
The command word may be specified in either case.
Arguments may be separated by commas or blanks.
.Pp
Empty lines are allowed and are ignored.
Long lines are continued by ending them with the
.Dq Li +
character.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li *
and
.Dq Li "\;"
characters start a comment.
Comments extend till the end of the line.
.Pp
When executing an MRI librarian script the
.Nm
utility works on a temporary copy of an archive.
Changes to the copy are made permanent using the
.Ic save
command.
.Pp
Commands understood by the
.Nm
utility are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic addlib Ar archive | Ic addlib Ar archive Pq Ar member Oo Li , Ar member Oc Ns ...
Add the contents of the archive named by argument
.Ar archive
to the current archive.
If specific members are named using the arguments
.Ar member ,
then those members are added to the current archive.
If no members are specified, the entire contents of the archive
are added to the current archive.
.It Ic addmod Ar member Oo Li , Ar member Oc Ns ...
Add the files named by arguments
.Ar member
to the current archive.
.It Ic clear
Discard all the contents of the current archive.
.It Ic create Ar archive

the
.Ic verbose
command.
Output is sent to standard output, or to the file specified by
argument
.Ar outputfile .
.It Ic end
Exit successfully from the
.Nm
utility.
Any unsaved changes to the current archive will be discarded.
