.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to manipulate comment sections in an ELF object.
If a command-line argument
.Ar file
names an
.Xr ar 1
archive, then
.Nm
will operate on the ELF objects contained in the archive.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
operates on the ELF section named
.Dq .comment .
This may be changed using the
.Fl n
option.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl a Ar string"
.It Fl a Ar string
Append the text in
.Ar string
to the comment section.
This option may be specified multiple times.
.It Fl c
Compress the comment section by removing duplicate entries.
.It Fl d
Delete the comment section from the ELF object.
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Display a usage message and exit.
.It Fl n Ar name
Operate on the section named
.Ar name .
.It Fl p
Print the contents of the comment section.
This step is taken after actions specified by the
.Fl a
and
.Fl c
options (if any) are completed.
.It Fl V | Fl -version
Print a version identifier and exit.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The behavior of the
.Nm
utility differs from its SVR4 counterpart in the following ways:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If the
.Fl d
option is specified, it causes any
.Fl a ,
.Fl c
and
.Fl p
options present to be ignored.
.It
The order of options
.Fl a ,
.Fl c ,
.Fl d ,
and
.Fl p
on the command line is not significant.
