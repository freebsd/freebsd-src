.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h

.Fa "char ***filenames"
.Fa "Dwarf_Signed *filenamecount"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_srcfiles
returns the source file names associated with a compilation unit.
Source file names are returned as an array of NUL-terminated strings.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar die
should reference a DWARF debugging information entry descriptor with
source file information, see
.Xr dwarf 3 .
Argument
.Ar filenames
should point to a location that will hold a pointer to the returned array
of file names.
Argument
.Ar filenamecount
should point to a location that will hold the number of file names returned.
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Ss Memory Management
The memory areas used for the file names and for array of pointers
being returned are managed by the DWARF(3) library.
The application should not attempt to directly free these memory areas.
Portable code should indicate that the memory areas are to be freed
by using
.Xr dwarf_dealloc 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_srcfiles
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
when it succeeds.
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_srcfiles
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Ar die ,
.Ar filenames
or
.Ar filenamecount
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
The compilation unit referenced by argument
.Ar die
does not have associated source file information.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_MEMORY
An out of memory condition was encountered during the execution of
this function.
