Function
.Fn dwarf_add_frame_cie
adds a DWARF call frame common information entry (CIE) to a producer
instance.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar augmenter
should point to a NUL-terminated augmentation string for the common
information entry.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar caf
specifies the code alignment factor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar daf
specifies the data alignment factor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar ra
specifies the column number used for the return address register.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar initinst
should point to a byte stream containing the initial instructions
for the common information entry.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar initlen
should hold the length in bytes of the byte stream pointed to by
argument
.Ar initinst .
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_add_frame_cie
returns the index value of the created common information entry.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_add_frame_cie
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NOCOUNT
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_frame_cie
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
