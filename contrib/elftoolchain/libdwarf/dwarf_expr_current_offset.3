.Sh NAME
.Nm dwarf_expr_current_offset
.Nd retrieve the number of bytes in a location expression stream
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libdwarf

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_expr_current_offset
returns the size in bytes of the stream representation of a location
expression.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar expr
should reference a location expression descriptor allocated using
.Xr dwarf_new_expr 3 .
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case
of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_expr_current_offset
returns the size in bytes of the location descriptor's stream
representation.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_expr_current_offset
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NOCOUNT
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_expr_current_offset
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar expr
was NULL.
