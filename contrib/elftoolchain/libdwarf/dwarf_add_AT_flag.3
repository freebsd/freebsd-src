.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_flag
creates an attribute descriptor belonging to the
.Sq flag
class, and attaches it to the debugging information entry referenced
by argument
.Ar die .
The created attribute descriptor will have DWARF form
.Dv DW_FORM_flag .
.Pp

.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar die
should reference a debugging information entry allocated using
.Xr dwarf_new_die 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar attr
should specify the attribute code for the new attribute descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar flag
should specify the value of the new attribute descriptor.

.Sq false
and a non-zero value as
.Sq true .
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_flag
returns the created attribute descriptor.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_flag
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_BADADDR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
