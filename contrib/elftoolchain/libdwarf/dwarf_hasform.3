.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_hasform
indicates whether the DWARF attribute denoted by argument
.Ar attr
has the attribute form specified by argument
.Ar form .
If the attribute has the specified form, then
argument
.Ar ret
is set to a non-zero value, otherwise it is set to zero.
If argument
.Ar err
is non-NULL, it will be used to return an error descriptor in
case of an error.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_whatform
sets the location specified by argument
.Ar retform
to the attribute form code for the DWARF attribute referenced
by argument
.Ar attr .
If the attribute referenced by argument
.Ar attr
has an indirect form attribute, this function will return the final
form for the attribute.
If argument
.Ar err
is non-NULL, it will be used to return an error descriptor in
case of an error.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_whatform_direct
sets the location specified by argument
.Ar retform
to the attribute form code for the DWARF attribute referenced
by argument
.Ar attr .
If the form is an indirect form, the function sets the location
specified by argument
.Ar retform
to
.Dv DW_FORM_indirect .
If argument
.Ar err
is non-NULL, it will be used to return an error descriptor in
case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
on success.
In case of an error, these functions return
