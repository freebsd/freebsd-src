.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_get_arange
.Fa "Dwarf_Arange *ar_list"
.Fa "Dwarf_Unsigned ar_cnt"
.Fa "Dwarf_Addr addr"
.Fa "Dwarf_Arange *ret_ar"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_arange
searches an array of
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptors for one that covers a given address.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar ar_list
should point to an array of
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptors.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar ar_cnt
specifies the number of
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptors in the array pointed to by argument
.Ar ar_list .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar addr
specifies the address being looked up.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar ret_ar
will be used to store the
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptor that covers the given address.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_arange
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
when it succeeds.
It returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY
if there is no
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptor that covers the provided address.
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_arange
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Ar dbg ,
.Ar ar_list
or
.Ar ret_ar
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Value of argument
.Ar ar_cnt
equals to 0.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
A
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptor that covers the given address
was not found.
