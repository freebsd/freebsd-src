.Sh DESCRIPTION
These convenience functions are used to retrieve DWARF attribute
values associated with a Debugging Information Entry (DIE) descriptor
denoted by argument
.Ar die .
These functions store the value of the requested attribute into the
location pointed to by their second argument, provided that the requested
attribute exists in the debugging information entry.
.Pp
The list of functions and the DWARF attribute that they retrieve are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Fn dwarf_arrayorder" -compact
.It Fn dwarf_arrayorder
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_ordering
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_bitoffset
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_bit_offset
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_bitsize
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_bit_size
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_bytesize
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_byte_size
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_highpc
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_high_pc
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_highpc_b
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_high_pc
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_lowpc
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_low_pc
attribute value.
.It Fn dwarf_srclang
Retrieve the
.Dv DW_AT_language
attribute value.
.El
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_highpc_b
is an enhanced version of function
.Fn dwarf_highpc .
It sets the location specified by argument
.Ar ret_form
to the form code of the attribute
.Dv DW_AT_high_pc ,
and sets the location specified by argument
.Ar ret_class
to the class of that form.
A value of NULL may be used for either of the arguments
.Ar ret_form
or
.Ar ret_class
if the caller is not interested in the respective value.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
on success.
.Pp
If the debugging information entry descriptor denoted by argument
.Ar die
does not contain the requested attribute, these functions return
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY
and set argument
.Ar err .
For other errors, they return
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and set argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions can fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Arguments
.Ar die ,
.Ar ret_highpc ,
.Ar ret_lowpc ,
.Ar ret_size ,
.Ar ret_lang
or
.Ar ret_order
were NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
Argument
.Ar die
had no requested attribute.
