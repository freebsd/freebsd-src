.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn dwarf_dealloc
is used by applications to indicate that memory areas returned by
.Lb libdwarf
may be safely disposed off.
Due to the way memory is managed in the current implementation, the
use of
.Fn dwarf_dealloc
is only necessary for a small set of DWARF types.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a valid debugging context allocated using
.Xr dwarf_init 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar ptr
should point to an object or memory area obtained by a prior call
to a DWARF(3) function.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar type
indicates the type of object being deallocated.
The indicated type must match that of the object being passed in
argument
.Ar ptr .
Valid values for the
.Ar type
argument are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv DW_DLA_FRAME_BLOCK"
.It Dv DW_DLA_ABBREV
An object of type
.Vt Dwarf_Abbrev ,
as returned by a call to the function
.Xr dwarf_get_abbrev 3 .
.It Dv DW_DLA_DIE
An object of type
.Vt Dwarf_Die ,
as returned by calls to the functions
.Xr dwarf_child 3 ,
.Xr dwarf_offdie 3
or
.Xr dwarf_siblingof 3 .
.It Dv DW_DLA_FRAME_BLOCK
An array of objects of type
.Vt Dwarf_Frame_op ,
as returned by a call to the function
.Xr dwarf_expand_frame_instructions 3 .
.El
.Pp
Calls to
.Fn dwarf_dealloc
with other values for argument
.Ar type
are no-ops in this implementation.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn dwarf_fde_cie_list_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_funcs_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_globals_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_pubtypes_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_ranges_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_srclines_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_types_dealloc ,
.Fn dwarf_vars_dealloc
and
.Fn dwarf_weaks_dealloc
are provided for compatibility with other implementations of the
DWARF(3) API.
Due to the way memory is managed in the current implementation, these
functions are effectively no-ops.
.Pp
See
.Xr dwarf 3
for more information about the memory management scheme in this
implementation of the DWARF(3) API.
