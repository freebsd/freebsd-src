.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_lne_end_sequence
sets the address that indicates the end of a sequence of target machine
instructions.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar addr
specifies an address value which is the first byte after the end of a
instruction sequence.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case
of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_lne_end_sequence
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_lne_end_sequence
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NOCOUNT
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_lne_end_sequence
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar dbg
