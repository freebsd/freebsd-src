.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_targ_address_b
creates an attribute descriptor belonging to the
.Sq address
class and attaches it to the debugging information entry referenced by
argument
.Ar die .
.Pp
The created attribute descriptor will have DWARF form
.Dv DW_FORM_addr .
If flag
.Dv DW_DLC_SIZE_64
is set on the producer instance, the attribute value will be 8 bytes
in size.
Otherwise the attribute value will be 4 bytes in size.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar die
should reference a debugging information entry allocated using
.Xr dwarf_new_die 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar attr
should specify the attribute code of the created attribute descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar pc_value
should hold a relocatable address value which will become the value of
the created attribute descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar sym_index
should specify the ELF symbol index of the symbol to be used for
relocating the address value.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case
of an error.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_targ_address
is deprecated.
It is similar to function
.Fn dwarf_add_AT_targ_address_b
except that it cannot handle all possible symbol index values.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return the created attribute descriptor.
In case of an error, these functions return
.Dv DW_DLV_BADADDR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Either of the arguments
.Ar dbg
or
.Ar die
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_MEMORY
An out of memory condition was encountered during execution.
