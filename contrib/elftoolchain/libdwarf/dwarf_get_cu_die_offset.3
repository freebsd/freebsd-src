.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions retrieve the offsets, relative to the
.Dq ".debug_info"
DWARF section, of the debugging information entries describing the
compilation unit associated with a
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptor.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset
retrieves the offset of the compilation unit header associated with
argument
.Ar ar ,
and stores it in the location pointed to by argument
.Ar ret .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_cu_die_offset
retrieves the offset of the debugging information entry for the
compilation unit associated with argument
.Ar ar ,
and stores it in the location pointed to by argument
.Ar ret .
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, these functions will use it to store error information,
in case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, they return
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and set the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar ar
was not a valid
.Vt Dwarf_Arange
descriptor.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar ret
was NULL.
