.Sh NAME
.Nm dwarf_set_reloc_application
.Nd set a library-wide relocation flag
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libdwarf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_set_reloc_application
.Fa "int apply"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_set_reloc_application
allows applications to specify how relocation information is to be
handled by the DWARF(3) library.
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar apply
holds a non-zero value, the library will process all the relevant
.Dq ".rel"
and
.Dq ".rela"
relocation sections and will apply the relocation records found to
their corresponding DWARF sections.
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar apply
is zero, the library will not attempt to apply any relocations.
.Pp
The default behaviour of the library is to process relocation records.
.Sh NOTES
Function
.Fn dwarf_set_reloc_application
should be called before initialising a dwarf debugging context, i.e,
it should be called by the application before calling either of the
functions
.Xr dwarf_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_elf_init 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_set_reloc_application
returns the previous value of the library-wide relocation application
flag.
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_set_reloc_application
does not return an error.
