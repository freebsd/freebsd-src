.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs
.Fa "Dwarf_Fde fde"
.Fa "Dwarf_Addr pc"
.Fa "Dwarf_Regtable *reg_table"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs
retrieves a row from the register rule table associated with the given
FDE descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar fde
should reference a valid DWARF FDE descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar pc
should hold the program counter address to be used to locate the
desired table row.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar reg_table
should point to a
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable
descriptor which will hold the returned table row of register rules.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar row_pc
should point to a location which will be set to the lowest program
counter address associated with the table row.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Pp
The
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable
descriptor is defined in the header file
.In libdwarf.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
	struct {
		Dwarf_Small	dw_offset_relevant;
		Dwarf_Half	dw_regnum;
		Dwarf_Addr	dw_offset;
	} rules[DW_REG_TABLE_SIZE];
} Dwarf_Regtable;
.Ed
.Pp
For each of the register rules returned,
the
.Va dw_offset_relevant
field is set to 1 if the register rule has a offset value.
The
.Va dw_regnum
field is set to the register number associated with the regsiter rule.
The
.Va dw_offset
field is set to the offset value associated with the register rule.
.Pp
The number of register columns returned is either the constant
value
.Dv DW_REG_TABLE_SIZE as defined
in the header file
.In libdwarf.h ,
or the value set by function
.Xr dwarf_set_frame_rule_table_size 3 ,
whichever is smaller.
.Ss COMPATIBILITY
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs
is deprecated since it only supports DWARF2 frame sections.
Applications should instead use function
.Xr dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3 3
which supports both DWARF2 and DWARF3 frame sections.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
when it succeeds.
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_PC_NOT_IN_FDE_RANGE"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Ar fde ,
.Ar reg_table
or
.Ar row_pc
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_PC_NOT_IN_FDE_RANGE
The program counter value provided in argument
.Ar pc
did not fall in the range covered by argument
.Ar fde .
