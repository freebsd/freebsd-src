.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b
retrieves the sizes of the DWARF sections in a DWARF debug context.
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF debug context allocated using
.Xr dwarf_init 3 .
The function stores the size of each DWARF section to the location
pointed to by the argument corresponding to the section name.
If a DWARF section does not exist, the location pointed to by the
argument corresponding to that section will be set to zero.
.Pp
A value of NULL may be used for any of the arguments
.Ar debug_info ,
.Ar debug_abbrev ,
.Ar debug_line ,
.Ar debug_loc ,
.Ar debug_aranges ,
.Ar debug_macinfo ,
.Ar debug_pubnames ,
.Ar debug_str ,
.Ar debug_frame ,
.Ar debug_ranges ,
.Ar debug_pubtypes
and
.Ar debug_types
if the caller is not interested in the respective section size.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_max_offsets
is identical to function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b
except that it does not provide argument
.Ar debug_types ,
and thus cannot return the size of the
.Dq \&.debug_types
section.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions return
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
If argument
.Ar dbg
is NULL, they return
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR .

.Xr dwarf_init 3
