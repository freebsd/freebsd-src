.Sh NAME
.Nm dwarf_seterrarg ,
.Nm dwarf_seterrhand
.Nd configure error handling
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libdwarf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft Dwarf_Ptr
.Fn dwarf_seterrarg "Dwarf_Debug dbg" "Dwarf_Ptr arg"
.Ft Dwarf_Handler
.Fn dwarf_seterrhand "Dwarf_Debug dbg" "Dwarf_Handler handler"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used by applications to configure error handling
callbacks.
The error handling scheme used by the library is described in
.Xr dwarf 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_seterrarg
may be used to set the callback argument passed to a configured
error handler at the time it is invoked.
Argument
.Ar arg
is the callback argument being set.
Argument
.Ar dbg
can be a debug context allocated by a prior call to
.Xr dwarf_init 3 ,
or can be NULL to indicate that the library-wide callback argument
is to be set.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_seterrhand
may be used to associate an error handler denoted by argument
.Ar handler
with the DWARF debug context descriptor denoted by argument
.Ar dbg .
Argument
.Ar dbg
should be a debug context allocated by a prior call to
.Xr dwarf_init 3 ,
or may be NULL to indicate that the library-wide error handler
is to be set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_seterrhand
returns the previous error handler associated with argument
.Ar dbg .
If argument
.Ar dbg
is NULL, function
.Fn dwarf_seterrhand
returns the previous library-wide error handler.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_seterrarg
returns the previous callback argument associated with argument
.Ar dbg .
If argument
.Ar dbg
is NULL, function
.Fn dwarf_seterrarg
returns the previous library-wide callback argument.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The behavior of these functions when argument
.Ar dbg
is NULL is a local extension.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions do not set an error code.
