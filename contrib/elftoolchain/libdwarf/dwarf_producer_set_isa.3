.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn dwarf_producer_set_isa
sets the instruction set architecture for a DWARF producer instance.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using one of
the functions
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar isa
specifies the desired instruction set architecture.
Legal values for this argument are those defined by the
.Vt "enum Dwarf_ISA"
enumeration defined in the header file
.In libdwarf.h .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, the function
.Fn dwarf_producer_set_isa
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, this function returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fn dwarf_producer_set_isa
function is a local extension.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn dwarf_producer_set_isa
function can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
