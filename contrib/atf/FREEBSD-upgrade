This document contains a collection of notes specific to the import
of atf into head.  These notes are built on the instructions in
the FreeBSD Subversion Primer that detail how to deal with vendor
branches and you are supposed to follow those:

	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/committers-guide/subversion-primer.html

The ATF source code is hosted on GitHub:

	https://github.com/jmmv/atf

and is imported into the atf vendor branch (see base/vendor/atf/).

To merge the vendor branch into head do something like this:

	cd .../base/head/contrib/atf
	svn merge --accept=postpone \
	    svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/atf/dist .
	svn remove --force $(cat FREEBSD-Xlist)

and resolve any conflicts that may arise at this point.

Once this is done, you must regenerate bconfig.h.  The recommended way
of doing so is by using the release files already imported into the
vendor branch (which is a good justification for importing the verbatim
sources in the first place so that this step is reproducible).  You can
use a set of commands similar to the following:

	mkdir /tmp/atf
	cd /tmp/atf
	.../vendor/atf/dist/configure \
	    --prefix=/ \
	    --exec-prefix=/usr \
	    --datarootdir=/usr/share
	cp bconfig.h .../base/head/contrib/atf/

Please do NOT run './configure' straight from the 'dist' directory of
the vendor branch as you easily risk committing build products into the
tree.

Lastly, with the list of old and new files in this import, make sure
to update the reachover Makefiles accordingly.

Test the build (keeping in mind the WITH_TESTS/WITHOUT_TESTS knobs) and,
if all looks good, you are ready to commit all the changes in one go.
