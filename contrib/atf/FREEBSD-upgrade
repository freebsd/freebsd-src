atf

The source code is hosted on GoogleCode as a subcomponent of the Kyua project:

	http://code.google.com/p/kyua/downloads/list

For the contrib directory, the sources were initially prepared like so:

	./configure --prefix=/ --exec-prefix=/usr --datarootdir=/usr/share

For the contrib directory, files and directories were pruned by:

sh -c 'for F in `cat FREEBSD-Xlist`; do rm -rf ./$F ; done'

You may check if there are any new files that we don't need.

The instructions for importing new release and merging to HEAD can be found
at FreeBSD wiki:

	http://wiki.freebsd.org/SubversionPrimer/VendorImports

To make local changes to atf, simply patch and commit to the trunk
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor branch.
