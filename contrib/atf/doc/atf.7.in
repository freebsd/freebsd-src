.Nd introduction to the Automated Testing Framework
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Automated Testing Framework
.Pf ( Nm )
is a
.Em collection of libraries
to implement test programs in a variety of languages.
These libraries all offer similar functionality and any test program
written with them exposes a consistent user interface.
.Pp
Test programs using the
.Nm
libraries rely on a separate runtime engine to execute them in a
deterministic fashion.
The runtime engine isolates the test programs from the rest of the system
and ensures some common side-effects are cleaned up.
The runtime engine is also responsible for gathering the results of all
tests and composing reports.
The current runtime of choice is Kyua, described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
.Pp
If your operating systems distributes
.Nm ,
it should also provide an introductory
.Xr tests 7
manual page.
You are encouraged to read it now.
.Pp
The rest of this manual page serves as a cross-reference to all the other
documentation shipped with
.Nm .

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
started as a Google Summer of Code 2007 project mentored by The NetBSD
Foundation.
Its original goal was to provide a testing framework for the
.Nx
operating system, but it grew as an independent project because the
framework itself did not need to be tied to a specific operating system.
.Pp
Originally,
.Nm
shipped the collection of libraries described in this manual page as well
as a runtime engine.
The runtime engine has since been replaced by Kyua and the old tools were
removed in
.Nm 0.20 ,
which shipped in early 2014.
.Pp
As of late 2014, both
.Fx
and
.Nx
ship
.Nm
in their base systems and provide extensive test suites based on it.
