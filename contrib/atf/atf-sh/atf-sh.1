.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-sh
.Nd interpreter for shell-based test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar shell
.Ar script
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interpreter that runs the test program given in
.Ar script
after loading the
.Xr atf-sh 3
library.
.Pp
.Nm
is not a real interpreter though: it is just a wrapper around
the system-wide shell defined by
.Va ATF_SHELL .
.Nm
executes the interpreter, loads the
.Xr atf-sh 3
library and then runs the script.
You must consider
.Nm atf-sh
to be a POSIX shell by default and thus should not use any non-standard
extensions.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XsXshellXXX
.It Fl s Ar shell
Specifies the shell to use instead of the value provided by
.Va ATF_SHELL .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ATFXLIBEXECDIRXX -compact
.It Va ATF_LIBEXECDIR
Overrides the builtin directory where
.Nm
is located.
Should not be overridden other than for testing purposes.
.It Va ATF_PKGDATADIR
Overrides the builtin directory where
.Pa libatf-sh.subr
is located.
Should not be overridden other than for testing purposes.
.It Va ATF_SHELL
Path to the system shell to be used in the generated scripts.
Scripts must not rely on this variable being set to select a specific
interpreter.
.It Va ATF_SHELL
Path to the system shell to be used in the generated scripts.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Scripts using
.Xr atf-sh 3
should start with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /usr/bin/env atf-sh
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, if you want to explicitly choose a shell interpreter, you cannot
rely on
.Xr env 1
to find
.Nm .
Instead, you have to hardcode the path to
.Nm
in the script and then use the
.Fl s
option afterwards as a
.Em single parameter :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /path/to/bin/atf-sh -s/bin/bash
.Ed
