Relicensed code
***************

The following code snippets have been taken from other projects.  Even
though they were not originally licensed under the terms above, the
original authors have agreed to relicense their work so that this project
can be distributed under a single license.  This section is put here just to
clarify this fact.

* configure.ac, Makefile.am: The original versions were derived from the
  ones in the XML Catalog Manager project, version 2.2.

  Author: Julio Merino <jmmv@users.sourceforge.net>

* atf-c/ui.c: The format_paragraph and format_text functions were
  derived form the ones in the Monotone project, revision
  3a0982da308228d796df35f98d787c5cff2bb5b6.

  Author: Julio Merino <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

* atf-c++/detail/io.hpp, atf-c++/detail/io.cpp, atf-c++/detail/io_test.cpp:
  These files were derived from the file_handle, systembuf, pipe and pistream
  classes and tests found in the Boost.Process library.

  Author: Julio Merino <jmmv84@gmail.com>

* admin/check-style.sh, admin/check-style-common.awk,
  admin/check-style-cpp.awk, admin/check-style-shell.awk: These files,
  except the first one, were first implemented in the Buildtool project.
  They were later adapted to be part of Boost.Process and, during that
  process, the shell script was created.
