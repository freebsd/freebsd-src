# small list of commands to build all on a linux system
# libtoolize is needed for most other targets

# on Solaris, and other systems that may not have
# the default 'automake' and 'aclocal' script aliases,
# the correct versions may need to be set. On those
# systems, the 'autoreconf' line should be changed to:
# AUTOMAKE=automake-1.10 ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.10 autoreconf

# older versions of libtoolize do not support --install
# so you might need to remove that (with newer versions
# it is needed)
git submodule update --init
libtoolize -ci
autoreconf -fi
./configure --with-examples --with-drill # --with-pyldns --with-p5-dns-ldns
make
make doc  # needs doxygen for the html pages
(cd pcat && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
(cd examples/nsd-test && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
