REGRESSIONS

This version of drill is based on ldns and as such some things
are slightly changed. This file documents the changes.

o When tracing (-T option) we use the local resolver (as specified
  in /etc/resolv.conf) to lookup names. This increases the speed
  dramatically, but you obviously need to be able to reach a recursive
  server/cache.
  Previously drill would try to resolve the names by itself.

o Printing of DSs after DNSKEY records. Because we don't parse our
  own packets anymore, we cannot print the DS directly after the DNSKEY 
  record. The DSs are now printed AFTER the packet.

o The long options are removed.

o The chase function has a different output, and will be subject to change
  in the near future.
 
o The useless (for jokes only) -I option was dropped.

FIXED:
o the argument parsing is much smarter, the order doesn't matter (much)
  anymore
