QUICK INSTALL GUIDE

drill is a subdirectory in ldns.

To compile drill you need:
autoreconf && ./configure && make

If ldns is installed in a different location, use --with-ldns=directory
See also ./configure --help

In the first case you must run drill as:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../.libs ./drill <options>
