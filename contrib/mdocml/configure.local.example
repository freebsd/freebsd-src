# For all settings documented in this file, there are reasonable
# defaults and/or the ./configure script attempts autodetection.
# Consequently, you only need to create a file ./configure.local
# and put any of these settings into it if ./configure autodetection
# fails or if you want to make different choices for other reasons.

# If autodetection fails, please tell <tech@mdocml.bsd.lv>.

# We recommend that you write ./configure.local from scratch and
# only put the lines there you need.  This file contains examples.
# It is not intended as a template to be copied as a whole.

# --- user settings relevant for all builds ----------------------------

# For -Tutf8 and -Tlocale operation, mandoc(1) requires <locale.h>
# providing setlocale(3) and <wchar.h> providing wcwidth(3) and
# putwchar(3) with a wchar_t storing UCS-4 values.  Theoretically,
# the latter should be tested with the __STDC_ISO_10646__ feature
# macro.  In practice, many <wchar.h> headers do not provide that
# macro even though they treat wchar_t as UCS-4.  So the automatic
# test only checks that wchar_t is wide enough, that is, at least
# four bytes.

# The following line forces multi-byte support.
# If your C library does not treat wchar_t as UCS-4, the UTF-8 output
# mode will print garbage.

HAVE_WCHAR=1

# The following line disables multi-byte support.
# The output modes -Tutf8 and -Tlocale will be the same as -Tascii.

HAVE_WCHAR=0

# In manual pages written in the mdoc(7) language, the operating system
# version is displayed in the page footer line.  If an operating system
# is specified as an argument to the .Os macro, that is always used.
# If the .Os macro has no argument and an operation system is specified
# with the mandoc(1) -Ios= command line option, that is used.
# Otherwise, the uname(3) library function is called at runtime to find
# the name of the operating system.
# If you do not want uname(3) to be called but instead want a fixed
# string to be used, use the following line:

OSNAME="OpenBSD 5.6"

# The following installation directories are used.
# It is possible to set only one or a few of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.
# Even if you set PREFIX to something else, the other variables
# pick it up without copying them all over.

PREFIX="/usr/local"
BINDIR="${PREFIX}/bin"
SBINDIR="${PREFIX}/sbin"
INCLUDEDIR="${PREFIX}/include/mandoc"
LIBDIR="${PREFIX}/lib/mandoc"
MANDIR="${PREFIX}/man"
EXAMPLEDIR="${PREFIX}/share/examples/mandoc"

# The man(1) utility needs to know where the manuals reside.
# We know of two ways to tell it: via manpath(1) or man.conf(5).
# The latter is used by OpenBSD and NetBSD, the former by most
# other systems.

# Force usage of manpath(1).
# If it is not installed or not operational,
# man(1), makewhatis(8), and apropos(1) will not work properly.
HAVE_MANPATH=1

# Force usage of man.conf(5).
# If it does not exist or contains no valid configuration,
# man(1), makewhatis(8), and apropos(1) will not work properly.
HAVE_MANPATH=0

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts among manuals.
# If you want to change the names of installed section 7 manual pages,
# the following alternative names are suggested.
# The suffix ".7" will automatically be appended.
# It is possible to set only one or a few of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.

MANM_MAN="mandoc_man"		# default is "man"
MANM_MDOC="mandoc_mdoc"		# default is "mdoc"
MANM_ROFF="mandoc_roff"		# default is "roff"
MANM_EQN="mandoc_eqn"		# default is "eqn"
MANM_TBL="mandoc_tbl"		# default is "tbl"

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts
# with another man(1) utility.
# If you want to change the name of the binary program,
# the following alternative name is suggested.
# Using a different name is possible as well.
# This changes the name of the installed section 1 manual page as well.

BINM_MAN=mman			# default is "man"

# It is possible to change the utility program used for installation
# and the modes files are installed with.  The defaults are:

INSTALL="install"
INSTALL_PROGRAM="${INSTALL} -m 0555"
INSTALL_LIB="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_MAN="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_DATA="${INSTALL} -m 0444"

# --- user settings related to database support ------------------------

# By default, building makewhatis(8) and apropos(1) is enabled.
# To disable it, for example to avoid the dependency on SQLite3,
# use the following line.  It that case, the remaining settings
# in this section are irrelevant.

BUILD_DB=0

# Two libraries are needed: SQLite3 and ohash(3).
# Autoconfiguration tries the following linker flags to find them.
# If none of these work, add a working DBLIB line to configure.local,
# disabling autodetection for library directories.

DBLIB="-lsqlite3"
DBLIB="-lsqlite3 -lutil"
DBLIB="-L/usr/local/lib -lsqlite3"

# When library autodetection decides to use -L/usr/local/lib,
# -I/usr/local/include is automatically added to CFLAGS.
# If you manually set DBLIB to something including -L/usr/local/lib,
# chances are you will also need the following line:

CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -I/usr/local/include"

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts
# with another implementation of apropos(1) and makewhatis(8).
# If you want to change the names of the binary programs,
# the following alternative names are suggested.
# Using other names is possible as well.
# This changes the names of the installed section 1 and section 8
# manual pages as well.
# It is possible to set only one or two of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.

BINM_APROPOS=mapropos		# default is "apropos"
BINM_WHATIS=mwhatis		# default is "whatis"
BINM_MAKEWHATIS=mandocdb	# default is "makewhatis"

# When using the "homebrew" package manager on Mac OS X, the actual
# manuals are located in a so-called "cellar" and only symlinked
# into the manual trees.  To allow mandoc to follow such symlinks,
# you have to specify the physical location of the cellar as returned
# by realpath(3), for example:

PREFIX="/usr/local"
HOMEBREWDIR="${PREFIX}/Cellar"

# --- user settings related man.cgi ------------------------------------

# By default, building man.cgi(8) is disabled.  To enable it, copy
# cgi.h.example to cgi.h, edit it, and use the following line.
# Obviously, this requires that BUILD_DB is enabled, too.

BUILD_CGI=1

# The remaining settings in this section are only relevant if BUILD_CGI
# is enabled.  Otherwise, they have no effect either way.

# By default, man.cgi(8) is linked statically.
# Some systems do not support static linking, for example Mac OS X.
# In that case, use the following line:

STATIC=

# Some systems, for example Linux, require -pthread for static linking:

STATIC="-static -pthread"

# Some directories.
# This works just like PREFIX, see above.

WWWPREFIX="/var/www"
HTDOCDIR="${WWWPREFIX}/htdocs"
CGIBINDIR="${WWWPREFIX}/cgi-bin"

# --- settings that rarely need to be touched --------------------------

# Do not set these variables unless you really need to.

# You can manually override the compiler to be used.
# But that's rarely useful because ./configure asks your make(1)
# which compiler to use, and that answer will hardly be wrong.

CC=cc

# The default compiler flags are:

CFLAGS="-g -W -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-unused-parameter -Wwrite-strings"

# In rare cases, it may be required to skip individual automatic tests.
# Each of the following variables can be set to 0 (test will not be run
# and will be regarded as failed) or 1 (test will not be run and will
# be regarded as successful).

HAVE_DIRENT_NAMLEN=0
HAVE_FGETLN=0
HAVE_FTS=0
HAVE_GETSUBOPT=0
HAVE_MMAP=0
HAVE_REALLOCARRAY=0
HAVE_STRCASESTR=0
HAVE_STRLCAT=0
HAVE_STRLCPY=0
HAVE_STRPTIME=0
HAVE_STRSEP=0
HAVE_STRTONUM=0

HAVE_SQLITE3=0
HAVE_SQLITE3_ERRSTR=0
