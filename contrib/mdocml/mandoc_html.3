.Sh DESCRIPTION
The mandoc HTML formatter is not a formal library.
However, as it is compiled into more than one program, in particular
.Xr mandoc 1
and
.Xr man.cgi 8 ,
and because it may be security-critical in some contexts,
some documentation is useful to help to use it correctly and
to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
.Pp
The formatter produces HTML output on the standard output.
Since proper escaping is usually required and best taken care of
at one central place, the language-specific formatters
.Po
.Pa *_html.c ,
see
.Sx FILES
.Pc
are not supposed to print directly to
.Dv stdout
using functions like
.Xr printf 3 ,
.Xr putc 3 ,
.Xr puts 3 ,
or
.Xr write 2 .
Instead, they are expected to use the output functions declared in
.Pa html.h
and implemented as part of the main HTML formatting engine in
.Pa html.c .
.Ss Data structures
These structures are declared in
.Pa html.h .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Vt struct html
Internal state of the HTML formatter.
.It Vt struct tag
One entry for the LIFO stack of HTML elements.
Members are
.Fa "enum htmltag tag"
and
.Fa "struct tag *next" .
.El
.Ss Private interface functions
The function
.Fn print_gen_decls
prints the opening
.Ao Pf \&? Ic xml ? Ac
and
.Aq Pf \&! Ic DOCTYPE
declarations required for the current document type.
.Pp
The function
.Fn print_gen_head
prints the opening
.Aq Ic META
and
.Aq Ic LINK
elements for the document
.Aq Ic HEAD ,
using the
.Fa style
member of
.Fa h
unless that is
.Dv NULL .
It uses
.Fn print_otag
which takes care of properly encoding attributes,
which is relevant for the
.Fa style
link in particular.
.Pp
The function
.Fn print_otag
prints the start tag of an HTML element with the name
.Fa tag ,
optionally including the attributes specified by
.Fa fmt .
If
.Fa fmt
is the empty string, no attributes are written.
Each letter of
.Fa fmt
specifies one attribute to write.
Most attributes require one
.Va char *
argument which becomes the value of the attribute.
The arguments have to be given in the same order as the attribute letters.
.Bl -tag -width 1n -offset indent
.It Cm c
Print a
.Cm class
attribute.
.It Cm h
Print a
.Cm href
attribute.
This attribute letter can optionally be followed by a modifier letter.
If followed by
.Cm R ,
it formats the link as a local one by prefixing a
.Sq #
character.
If followed by
.Cm I ,
it interpretes the argument as a header file name
and generates a link using the
.Xr mandoc 1
.Fl O Cm includes
option.
If followed by
.Cm M ,
it takes two arguments instead of one, a manual page name and
section, and formats them as a link to a manual page using the
.Xr mandoc 1
.Fl O Cm man
option.
.It Cm i
Print an
.Cm id
attribute.
.It Cm \&?
Print an arbitrary attribute.
This format letter requires two
.Vt char *
arguments, the attribute name and the value.
.It Cm s
Print a
.Cm style
attribute.
If present, it must be the last format letter.
In contrast to the other format letters, this one does not yet
print the value and does not require an argument.
Instead, the rest of the format string consists of pairs of
argument type letters and style name letters.
.El
.Pp
Argument type letters each require on argument as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 1n -offset indent
.It Cm h
Requires one
.Vt int
argument, interpreted as a horizontal length in units of
.Dv SCALE_EN .
.It Cm s
Requires one
.Vt char *
argument, used as a style value.
.It Cm u
Requires one
.Vt struct roffsu *
argument, used as a length.
.It Cm v
Requires one
.Vt int
argument, interpreted as a vertical length in units of
.Dv SCALE_VS .
.It Cm w
Requires one
.Vt char *
argument, interpreted as an
.Xr mdoc 7 Ns -style
width specifier.
.El
.Pp
Style name letters decide what to do with the preceding argument:
.Bl -tag -width 1n -offset indent
.It Cm b
Set
.Cm margin-bottom
to the given length.
.It Cm h
Set
.Cm height
to the given length.
.It Cm i
Set
.Cm text-indent
to the given length.
.It Cm l
Set
.Cm margin-left
to the given length.
.It Cm t
Set
.Cm margin-top
to the given length.
.It Cm w
Set
.Cm width
to the given length.
.It Cm W
Set
.Cm min-width
to the given length.
.It Cm \&?
The special pair
.Cm s?
requires two
.Vt char *
arguments.
The first is the style name, the second its value.
.El
.Pp
.Fn print_otag
uses the private function
.Fn print_encode
to take care of HTML encoding.
If required by the element type, it remembers in
.Fa h
that the element is open.
The function
.Fn print_tagq
is used to close out all open elements up to and including
.Fa until ;
.Fn print_stagq
is a variant to close out all open elements up to but excluding
.Fa suntil .
.Pp
The function
.Fn print_text
prints HTML element content.
It uses the private function
.Fn print_encode
to take care of HTML encoding.
If the document has requested a non-standard font, for example using a
.Xr roff 7
.Ic \ef
font escape sequence,
.Fn print_text
wraps
.Fa word
in an HTML font selection element using the
.Fn print_otag
and
.Fn print_tagq
functions.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn html_strlen ,
.Fn print_eqn ,
.Fn print_tbl ,
and
.Fn print_tblclose
are not yet documented.
