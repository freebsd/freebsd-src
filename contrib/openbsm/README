OpenBSM 1.0

  Introduction

OpenBSM provides an open source implementation of Sun's BSM Audit API. 
Originally created under contract to Apple Computer by McAfee Research, 
this implementation is now maintained by volunteers and the generous 
contribution of several organizations.  Coupled with a kernel audit 
implementation, OpenBSM can be used to maintain system audit streams, and 
is a foundation for an Audit-enabled system.

  Contents

OpenBSM consists of several directories:

    bin/           Audit-related command line tools
    bsm/           System include files for BSM
    etc/           Sample /etc/security configuration files
    libbsm/        Implementation of BSM library interfaces and man pages
    man/           System call and configuration file man pages

OpenBSM currently builds on FreeBSD and Darwin.  With Makefile adjustment
and minor tweaks, it should build without problems on a broad range of
POSIX-like systems.

  Building

OpenBSM is currently built using autoconf and automake, which should allow
for building on a range of operating systems, including FreeBSD, Mac OS X,
and Linux.  Depending on the availability of audit facilities in the
underlying operating system, some components that depend on kernel audit
support are built conditionally.  Typically, build will be performed using

    ./configure
    make

To install, use:

    make install

You may wish to specify that the OpenBSM components not be installed in the
base system, rather in a specific directory.  This may be done using the
--prefix argument to configure.  If installing to a specific directory,
remember to update your library path so that running tools from that
directory the correct libbsm is used:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/rwatson/openbsm
    make
    make install
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/rwatson/openbsm/libbsm ; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

You will need to manually propagate openbsm/etc/* into /etc on your system;
this is not done automatically so as to avoid disrupting the current
configuration.  Currently, the locations of these files is not
configurable.
