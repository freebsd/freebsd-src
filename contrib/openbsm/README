OpenBSM 1.1 alpha 1

  Introduction

OpenBSM provides an open source implementation of Sun's BSM Audit API. 
Originally created under contract to Apple Computer by McAfee Research, this
implementation is now maintained by volunteers and the generous contribution
of several organizations.  Coupled with a kernel audit implementation,
OpenBSM can be used to maintain system audit streams, and is a foundation for
an Audit-enabled system.  Portions of OpenBSM, including include files and
token-building routines, are reusable in a kernel audit implementation, and
may be found in the FreeBSD and Mac OS X kernels.
