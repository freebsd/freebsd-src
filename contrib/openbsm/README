OpenBSM

  Introduction

OpenBSM is an open-source implementation of Sun's BSM event auditing file
format and API.  Originally created for Apple Computer by McAfee Research,
OpenBSM is now maintained by volunteers and through the generous contributions
of several organizations.

OpenBSM includes several command line tools, including auditreduce(8) and
praudit(8) for reducing and printing audit trails, as well as the libbsm(3)
library to manage configuration files, generate audit records, and parse and
print audit trails.  It also includes the auditd(8) audit configuration
daemon, and the auditdistd(8) audit-trail distribution daemon.

Coupled with a kernel audit implementation, OpenBSM can be used to maintain
system audit streams, and is a foundation for a full audit-enabled system.
Portions of OpenBSM, including include files and token-building routines, are
reusable in a kernel audit implementation, and may be found in the FreeBSD
and Mac OS X kernels.
