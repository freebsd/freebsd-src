OpenBSM TODO

- Build a regression test suite for libbsm that generates each token
  type and then compares the results with known good data.  Make sure to
  test that things work properly with respect to endianness of the local
  platform.
- Document contents of libbsm "public" data structures in libbsm man pages.
- The audit.log.5 man page is incomplete, as it does not describe all
  token types.
- It might be desirable to be able to provide EOPNOTSUPP system call stubs
  on systems that don't have the necessary audit system calls; that would
  allow the full libbsm and tool set to build, just not run.
- Teach praudit how to begin printing at any point in a token stream, not
  just at the beginning of a record.  This will make it easier to use
  praudit in test suites processing single-token files without header and
  trailer context.
- Document audit_warn event arguments.
- Allow the path /etc/security to be configured at configure-time so that
  alternative locations can be used.
- NLS support for au_strerror(3), which provides error strings for BSM errors
  not available on the local OS platform.
- Support for client certificates in auditdistd, to include certificate chain
  validation.
