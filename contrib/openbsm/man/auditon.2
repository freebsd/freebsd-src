.Dt AUDITON 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm auditon
.Nd "Configure system audit parameters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/audit.h
.Ft int
.Fn auditon "int cmd" "void *data" "u_int length"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
system call is used to manipulate various audit control operations.
.Ft *data
should point to a structure whose type depends on the command.
.Ft length
specifies the size of the 
.Em data 
in bytes.
.Ft cmd
may be any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width ".It Dv A_GETPINFO_ADDR"
.It Dv A_SETPOLICY
Set audit policy flags.
.Ft *data
must point to a long value set to one of the audit 
policy control values defined in
.Pa audit.h .
Currently, only
.Dv AUDIT_CNT
and
.Dv AUDIT_AHLT
are implemented.
In the
.Dv AUDIT_CNT
case, the action will continue regardless if
an event will not be audited.
In the
.Dv AUDIT_AHLT
case, a
.Xr panic 9
will result if an event will not be written to the
audit log file.
.It Dv A_SETKAUDIT
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_SETKMASK
Set the kernel preselection masks (success and failure).
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_mask_t
structure containing the mask values.
These masks are used for non-attributable audit event preselection.
.It Dv A_SETQCTRL
Set kernel audit queue parameters.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_qctrl_t
structure containing the
kernel audit queue control settings:
.Va high water ,
.Va low water ,
.Va output buffer size ,
.Va percent min free disk space ,
and
.Em delay
(not currently used).
.It Dv A_SETSTAT
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_SETUMASK
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_SETSMASK
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_SETCOND
Set the current auditing condition.
.Ft *data
must point to a long value containing the new
audit condition, one of
.Dv AUC_AUDITING ,
.Dv AUC_NOAUDIT ,
or
.Dv AUC_DISABLED .
.It Dv A_SETCLASS
Set the event class preselection mask for an audit event.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_evclass_map_t
structure containing the audit event and mask.
.It Dv A_SETPMASK
Set the preselection masks for a process.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft auditpinfo_t
structure that contains the given process's audit 
preselection masks for both success and failure.
.It Dv A_SETFSIZE
Set the maximum size of the audit log file.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_fstat_t
structure with the
.Ft af_filesz
field set to the maximum audit log file size. A value of 0
indicates no limit to the size.
.It Dv A_SETKAUDIT
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETCLASS
Return the event to class mapping for the designated audit event.
.Ft *data
must point to a 
.Ft au_evclass_map_t
structure.
.It Dv A_GETKAUDIT
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETPINFO
Return the audit settings for a process.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft auditpinfo_t
structure which will be set to contain
the audit ID, preselection mask, terminal ID, and audit session
ID of the given process.
.It Dv A_GETPINFO_ADDR
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETKMASK
Return the current kernel preselection masks.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_mask_t
structure which will be set to 
the current kernel preselection masks for non-attributable events.
.It Dv A_GETPOLICY
Return the current audit policy setting.
.Ft *data
must point to a long value which will be set to
one of the current audit policy flags.
Currently, only
.Dv AUDIT_CNT
and
.Dv AUDIT_AHLT
are implemented.
.It Dv A_GETQCTRL
Return the current kernel audit queue control parameters.
.Ft *data
must point to a 
.Ft au_qctrl_t
structure which will be set to the current
kernel audit queue control parameters.
.It Dv A_GETFSIZE
Returns the maximum size of the audit log file.
.Ft *data
must point to a
.Ft au_fstat_t
structure. The
.Ft af_filesz
field will be set to the maximum audit log file size.
A value of 0 indicates no limit to the size.
The
.Ft af_currsz
will be set to the current audit log file size.
.It Dv A_GETCWD
.\" [COMMENTED OUT]: Valid description, not yet implemented.
.\" Return the current working directory as stored in the audit subsystem.
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETCAR
.\" [COMMENTED OUT]: Valid description, not yet implemented.
.\"Stores and returns the current active root as stored in the audit
.\"subsystem.
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETSTAT
.\" [COMMENTED OUT]: Valid description, not yet implemented.
.\"Return the statistics stored in the audit system.
Return
.Er ENOSYS .
.It Dv A_GETCOND
Return the current auditing condition.
.Ft *data
must point to a long value which will be set to
the current audit condition, either
.Dv AUC_AUDITING
or
.Dv AUC_NOAUDIT .
.It Dv A_SENDTRIGGER
Send a trigger to the audit daemon.
.Fr *data
must point to a long value set to one of the acceptable
trigger values:
.Dv AUDIT_TRIGGER_LOW_SPACE
(low disk space where the audit log resides),
.Dv AUDIT_TRIGGER_OPEN_NEW
(open a new audit log file),
.Dv AUDIT_TRIGGER_READ_FILE
(read the
.Pa audit_control
file),
.Dv AUDIT_TRIGGER_CLOSE_AND_DIE
(close the current log file and exit),
or
.Dv AUDIT_TRIGGER_NO_SPACE
(no disk space left for audit log file).

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn auditon
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er

A failure occurred while data transferred to or from
the kernel failed.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
