.Sh NAME
.Nm audit_warn
.Nd "alert when audit daemon issues warnings"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script
runs when
.Xr auditd 8
generates warning messages.
.Pp
The default
.Nm
is a script whose first parameter is the type of warning; the script
appends its arguments to
.Pa /etc/security/audit_messages .
Administrators may replace this script: a more comprehensive one would take
different actions based on the type of warning.
For example, a low-space warning
could result in an email message being sent to the administrator.
