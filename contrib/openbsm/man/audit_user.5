.Dt AUDIT_USER 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm audit_user
.Nd "events to be audited for given users"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which audit event classes are to be audited for the given users.
If specified, these flags are combined with the system-wide audit flags in the
.Xr audit_control 5
file to determine which classes of events to audit for that user.
These settings take effect when the user logs in.
.Pp
Each line maps a user name to a list of classes that should be audited and a
list of classes that should not be audited.
Entries are of the form:
.Pp
.D1 Ar username Ns : Ns Ar alwaysaudit Ns : Ns Ar neveraudit
.Pp
In the format above,
.Ar alwaysaudit
is a set of event classes that are always audited, and
.Ar neveraudit
is a set of event classes that should not be audited.
These sets can indicate
the inclusion or exclusion of multiple classes, and whether to audit successful
or failed events.
See
.Xr audit_control 5
for more information about audit flags.
.Pp
Example entries in this file are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
root:lo,ad:no
jdoe:-fc,ad:+fw
.Ed
.Pp
These settings would cause login/logout and administrative events that
are performed on behalf of user
.Dq Li root
to be audited.
No failure events are audited.
For the user
.Dq Li jdoe ,
failed file creation events are audited, administrative events are
audited, and successful file write events are never audited.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Per-user and global audit preselection configuration are evaluated at time of
login, so users must log out and back in again for audit changes relating to
preselection to take effect.
.Pp
Audit record preselection occurs with respect to the audit identifier
associated with a process, rather than with respect to the UNIX user or group
ID.
The audit identifier is set as part of the user credential context as part of
login, and typically does not change as a result of running setuid or setgid
applications, such as
.Xr su 1 .
This has the advantage that events that occur after running
.Xr su 1
can be audited to the original authenticated user, as required by CAPP, but
may be surprising if not expected.

division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc.\& in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
