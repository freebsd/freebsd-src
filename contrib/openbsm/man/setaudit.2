.Sh NAME
.Nm setaudit ,
.Nm setaudit_addr
.Nd "set audit session state"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/audit.h
.Ft int
.Fn setaudit "auditinfo_t *auditinfo"
.Ft int
.Fn setaudit_addr "auditinfo_addr_t *auditinfo_addr" "u_int length"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setaudit
system call
sets the active audit session state for the current process via the
.Vt auditinfo_t
pointed to by
.Fa auditinfo .
The
.Fn setaudit_addr
system call
sets extended state via
.Fa auditinfo_addr
and
.Fa length .
.Pp
The
.Fa auditinfo_t
data structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct auditinfo {
	au_id_t        ai_auid;         /* Audit user ID */
	au_mask_t      ai_mask;         /* Audit masks */
	au_tid_t       ai_termid;       /* Terminal ID */
	au_asid_t      ai_asid;         /* Audit session ID */
};
typedef struct auditinfo        auditinfo_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa ai_auid
variable contains the audit identifier which is recorded in the audit log for
each event the process caused.
.Pp
The
.Fa au_mask_t
data structure defines the bit mask for auditing successful and failed events
out of the predefined list of event classes. It is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct au_mask {
	unsigned int    am_success;     /* success bits */
	unsigned int    am_failure;     /* failure bits */
};
typedef struct au_mask  au_mask_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa au_termid_t
data structure defines the Terminal ID recorded with every event caused by the
process. It is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct au_tid {
	dev_t           port;
	u_int32_t       machine;
};
typedef struct au_tid   au_tid_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa ai_asid
variable contains the audit session ID which is recorded with every event
caused by the process.
.Pp
The
.Fn setaudit_addr
system call
uses the expanded
.Fa auditinfo_addr_t
data structure supports Terminal IDs with larger addresses such as those used
in IP version 6.  It is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct auditinfo_addr {
	au_id_t         ai_auid;        /* Audit user ID. */
	au_mask_t       ai_mask;        /* Audit masks. */
	au_tid_addr_t   ai_termid;      /* Terminal ID. */
	au_asid_t       ai_asid;        /* Audit session ID. */
};
typedef struct auditinfo_addr   auditinfo_addr_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa au_tid_addr_t
data structure which includes a larger address storage field and an additional
field with the type of address stored:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
struct au_tid_addr {
	dev_t           at_port;
	u_int32_t       at_type;
	u_int32_t       at_addr[4];
};
typedef struct au_tid_addr      au_tid_addr_t;
.Ed
.Pp
These system calls require an appropriate privilege to complete.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std setaudit setaudit_addr
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
A failure occurred while data transferred to or from
the kernel failed.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Illegal argument was passed by a system call.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The process does not have sufficient permission to complete
the operation.

division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc.\& in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
