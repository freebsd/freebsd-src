OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 4

- Remove "audit" user example from audit_user, as it's not present on most
  systems.
- Add cannot_audit() function non-Darwin systems that wraps auditon();
  required by OpenSSH BSM support.  Convert Darwin cannot_audit() into a
  function rather than a macro.
- Library build fixed on Darwin following include file tweaks.  The native
  Darwin sys/audit.h conflicts with bsm/audit.h due to duplicate types, so
  for now we force bsm_wrappers.c to not perform a nested include of
  sys/audit.h.

OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 3

- Man page formatting, cross reference, mlinks, and accuracy improvements.
- auditd and tools now compile and run on FreeBSD/arm.
- auditd will now fchown() the trail file to the audit review group, if
  defined at compile-time.
- Added AUE_SYSARCH for FreeBSD.
- Definition of AUE_SETFSGID fixed for Linux.

OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 2

- Man page formatting improvements.
- A number of new audit event identifiers for FreeBSD, Linux, and POSIX.1b
  events.
- Remove 'tfm' class, unused in OpenBSM.

OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 1

- Import of Darwin74 BSM drop
- Use 'syslog' for audit log warnings, rather than echoing to a file in
  audit_warn.
- Compile using BSD make infrastructure.
- Integrate bsm/ include files from Darwin74 XNU drop into OpenBSM.
- Narrow set of symbols and defines that are exposed in user space: don't
  compile in code relying on kernel-only types such as 'struct socket'.
- Add README, including basic build documentation.
- Compilation of Apple-specific notify and Machroutines now #ifdef __APPLE__.
- Staticize libbsm global variables to avoid leakage into application.
- Add free_au_user_ent() so that au_user_ent's don't have to be leaked.
- Clean up bogus nul-termination checks in libbsm.
- Add libbsm API man pages: au_class.3 au_control.3 au_event.3
  au_free_token.3 au_io.3 au_mask.3 au_token.3 au_user.3 libbsm.3.
- Add man pages for BSM system calls: audit.2 auditctl.2 auditon.2 getaudit.2
  getauid.2 setaudit.2 setauid.2
- Modify various libbsm interfaces to more consistently return 'errno' values
  on failure.
- Break out au_close() into constituent parts, allowing records to be written
  to memory as well as files.
- Prefix various defines with 'BSM_' to reduce name space pollution.
- Added audit_internal.h, which can be used by a kernel audit implementation
  wanting to rely on libbsm components.
- Build with warnings, and eliminate warnings.
- Make libbsm endian-independent, storing and reading BSM are big endian
  (network byte order) rather than native byte order.  More consistently
  print IP addresses using the IP address print routine.  These changes
  make use of sys/endian.h from *BSD; since this isn't present on Darwin,
  add it to OpenBSM as compat/endian.h, which is used only on Darwin.
- Import of Darwin80 BSM drop, including 64-bit file IDs, better
  documentation of private APIs, and bug fixes.
- White space cleanup.
- Add audit.log.5, a first cut at a man page documenting the BSM file format.
- Teach au_read_rec() to recognize stand-alone file tokens, which are present
  at the beginning and end of Solaris audit trails.  Technically, these
  appear to violate the high level BSM spec, which suggests that all tokens
  are present in records, but need to be supported.
- Implement HEADER64, ATTR64, SUBJECT64 token types, which make it possible
  to run praudit(1) on basic Solaris BSM streams.
- Switched to Solaris spelling of token names; Darwin spellings are now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future version of OpenBSM.
- Adopt Solaris model for representing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Prefer C99 types.
- Attempt to universally adopt the BSD style(9) coding style for
  consistency.
- auditreduce(1) now has a usage message.
- Update support for auditctl(2) system call to support FreeBSD.
- Add support for /dev/audit as the trigger source on FreeBSD.
- Add additional event types for Darwin, FreeBSD, and Solaris.  Annotate
  conflicts (there are a few, unfortunately).  Correct spellings, comment,
  sort, etc.  These include {get,set}res[ug]id(), sendfile(), lchflags(),
  eaccess(), kqueue(), kevent(), poll(), lchmod().
- Relicensed under a BSD license, many thanks to Apple, Inc!
- Many bug fixes, cleanups, thread safety in the class, control, event,
  and user system audit databases.  Annotate some persisting atomicity
  bugs associated with the API and implementation.
- Add audump test tool.
- Adopt OpenSolaris BSM API memory semantics: caller allocates memory,
  or static memory is returned for non-_r() versions of API calls.
  _free() calls dropped as a result, and source code compatibility with
  OpenSolaris improved significantly.
- Annotate BSM events with origin OS and compatibility information.
- auditd(8), audit(8) added to the OpenBSM distribution.  auditd extended
  to support reloading of kernel event table.
- Allow comments in /etc/security configuration files.
