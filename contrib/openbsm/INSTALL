OpenBSM Build and Installation Instructions

OpenBSM is currently built using autoconf and automake, which should allow
for building on a range of operating systems, including FreeBSD, Mac OS X,
and Linux.  Some components are built only if appropriate kernel audit
support is found.  Typical builds will be performed using:

    ./configure
    make

On Linux systems, OpenSSL headers may have to be installed to support
encryption of on-the-wire audit streams using auditdistd; the following
appears to work on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

Similarly, Mac OS X systems will require OpenSSL support:

    brew install openssl

Mac OS X systems will similarly require setting CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to notify
configure of the location of the OpenSSL headers and library:

    CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include			\
    LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib			\
    configure

To install the library, binaries, and man pages, use:

    make install

The OpenBSM install will not install files in /etc; these have to be
manually installed or merged.  Currently, the locations of these files are
not configurable.

You may wish to specify that the OpenBSM components not be installed in the
base system, rather in a specific directory.  This may be done using the
--prefix argument to configure.  If installing to a specific directory,
remember to update your library path so that when running tools from that
directory the correct libbsm is used:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/rwatson/openbsm
    make
    make install
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/rwatson/openbsm/libbsm ; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
