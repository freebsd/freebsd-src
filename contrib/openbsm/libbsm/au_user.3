.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_user 5
database, which describes per-user audit configuration.
Audit user entries are described by a
.Vt au_user_ent ,
which stores the user's name in
.Va au_name ,
events to always audit in
.Va au_always ,
and events never to audit
.Va au_never .
.Pp
The
.Fn getauuserent
function
returns the next user found in the
.Xr audit_user 5
database, or the first if the function has not yet been called.
.Dv NULL
will be returned if no further records are available.
.Pp
The
.Fn getauusernam
function
looks up a user by name.
.Dv NULL
will be returned if no matching class can be found.
.Pp
The
.Fn setauuser
function
resets the iterator through the
.Xr audit_user 5
database, causing the next call to
.Fn getauuserent
to start again from the beginning of the file.
.Pp
The
.Fn endauuser
function
closes the
.Xr audit_user 5
database, if open.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_user_mask
function
calculates a new session audit mask to be returned via
.Fa mask_p
for the user identified by
.Fa username .
If the user audit configuration is not found, the default system audit
properties returned by
.Xr getacflg 3
are used.
The resulting mask may be set via a call to
.Xr setaudit 2
or related variants.
.Pp
The
.Fn getfauditflags
function generates a new process audit state by combining the audit masks
passed as parameters with the system audit masks.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.

.An -nosplit
This software was created by
.An Robert Watson ,
.An Wayne Salamon ,
and
.An Suresh Krishnaswamy
for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being found
and an error accessing the database.
The implementation should be changed to return an error via
.Va errno
when
.Dv NULL
is returned.
