.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_control 5
database, which contains various audit-related administrative parameters.
.Pp
The
.Fn setac
function
resets the database iterator to the beginning of the database; see the
.Sx BUGS
section for more information.
.Pp
The
.Fn endac
function
closes the
.Xr audit_control 5
database.
.Pp
The
.Fn getacdir
function
returns the name of the directory where log data is stored via the passed
character buffer
.Fa name
of length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The
.Fn getacdist
function returns a value that allows to decide if trail files distribution is
turned on or off.
.Pp
The
.Fn getacexpire
function
returns the audit trail file expiration parameters in the passed
.Vt int
buffer
.Fa andflg ,
.Vt time_t
buffer
.Fa age
and
.Vt size_t
buffer
.Fa size .
If the parameter is not specified in the
.Xr audit_control 5
file it is set to zero.
.Pp
The
.Fn getacfilesz
function
returns the audit trail rotation size in the passed
.Vt size_t
buffer
.Fa size_val .
.Pp
The
.Fn getacflg
function
returns the audit system flags via the the passed character buffer
.Fa auditstr
of length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The
.Fn getachost
function
returns the local systems's audit host information via the the passed character
buffer
.Fa auditstr
of length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The
.Fn getacmin
function
returns the minimum free disk space for the audit log target file system via
the passed
.Fa min_val
variable.
.Pp
The
.Fn getacna
function
returns the non-attributable flags via the passed character buffer
.Fa auditstr
of length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The
.Fn getacpol
function
returns the audit policy flags via the passed character buffer
.Fa auditstr
of length
.Fa len .
.Pp
The
.Fn getacqsize
function returns the size of the audit post-commit queue in the passed
.Fa size_val
buffer.
If the parameter is not specified in the
.Xr audit_control 5
file it is set to
.Dv -1 ,
indicating that the kernel's default queue size is being used.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_poltostr
function
converts a numeric audit policy mask,
.Fa policy ,
to a string in the passed character buffer
.Fa buf
of lenth
.Fa maxsize .
.Pp
The
.Fn au_strtopol
function
converts an audit policy flags string,
.Fa polstr ,
to a numeric audit policy mask returned via
.Fa policy .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getacfilesz ,
.Fn getacdir ,
.Fn getacexpire ,
.Fn getacflg ,
.Fn getachost ,
.Fn getacmin ,
.Fn getacna ,
.Fn getacpol ,
.Fn getacqsize ,
and
.Fn au_strtopol
functions
return 0 on success, or a negative value on failure, along with error
information in
.Va errno .
.Pp
The
.Fn au_poltostr
function
returns a string length of 0 or more on success, or a negative value on
if there is a failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn getacdist
function returns 1 if trail files distribution is turned on, 0 if it is turned
off or negative value on failure.
.Pp
Functions that return a string value will return a failure if there is
insufficient room in the passed character buffer for the full string.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
This software was created by
.An Robert Watson ,
.An Wayne Salamon ,
and
.An Suresh Krishnaswamy
for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being found
and an error accessing the database.
The implementation should be changed to return an error via
.Va errno
when
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
There is no reason for the
.Fn setac
interface to be exposed as part of the public API, as it is called implicitly
by other access functions and iteration is not supported.
.Pp
These interfaces inconsistently return various negative values depending on
the failure mode, and do not always set
.Va errno
on failure.
