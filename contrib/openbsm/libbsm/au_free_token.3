.Dt AU_FREE_TOKEN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm au_free_token
.Nd "deallocate a token_t created by any of the au_to_*() BSM API functions"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libbsm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/libbsm.h
.Ft void
.Fn au_free_token "token_t *tok"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The BSM API generally manages deallocation of
.Vt token_t
objects.
However, if
.Xr au_write 3
is passed a bad audit descriptor, the
.Vt "token_t *"
parameter will be left untouched.
In that case, the caller can deallocate the
.Vt token_t
using
.Fn au_free_token
if desired.
.Pp
The
.Fa tok
argument is a
.Vt "token_t *"
generated by one of the
.Fn au_to_*
BSM API calls.
For convenience,
.Fa tok
may be
.Dv NULL ,
in which case
.Fn au_free_token
returns immediately.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This is, in fact, what
.Xr audit_write 3
does, in keeping with the existing memory management model of the BSM API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr au_write 3 ,
.Xr audit_write 3 ,
.Xr libbsm 3
.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
