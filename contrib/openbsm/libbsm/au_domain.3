.Dt AU_BSM_TO_DOMAIN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm au_bsm_to_domain ,
.Nm au_domain_to_bsm
.Nd "convert between BSM and local protocol domains"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libbsm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/libbsm.h
.Ft int
.Fn au_bsm_to_domain "u_short bsm_domain" "int *local_domainp"
.Ft u_short
.Fn au_domain_to_bsm "int local_domain"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to convert between the local and BSM protocol
domains.
The
.Fn au_bsm_to_domain
function accepts a BSM domain,
.Fa bsm_domain ,
and converts it to a local domain, such as those passed to
.Xr socket 2 ,
that will be stored in the integer pointed to by
.Fa local_domainp
if successful.
This call will fail if the BSM domain cannot be mapped into a local domain,
which may occur if the socket token was generated on another operating
system.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_domain_to_bsm
function accepts a local domain, and returns the BSM domain for it.
This call cannot fail, and instead returns a BSM domain indicating to a later
decoder that the domain could not be encoded.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success,
.Fn au_bsm_to_domain
returns 0 and a converted domain; on failure, it returns -1 but does not set
.Xr errno 2 .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn au_bsm_to_domain
and
.Fn au_domain_to_bsm
were introduced in OpenBSM 1.1.
.Sh AUTHORS
These functions were implemented by
.An Robert Watson
under contract to Apple Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
