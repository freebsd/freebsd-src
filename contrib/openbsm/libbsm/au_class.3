.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_class 5
database, which describes audit event classes.
Audit event classes are described by
.Vt "struct au_class_ent" .
.Pp
The
.Fn getauclassent
function
will return the next class found in the
.Xr audit_class 5
database, or the first if the function has not yet been called.
.Dv NULL
will be returned if no further records are available.
.Pp
The
.Fn getauclassnam
function
looks up a class by name.
.Dv NULL
will be returned if no matching class can be found.
.Pp
The
.Fn setauclass
function
resets the iterator through the
.Xr audit_class 5
database, causing the next call to
.Fn getauclassent
to start again from the beginning of the file.
.Pp
The
.Fn endauclass
function
closes the
.Xr audit_class 5
database, if open.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
This software was created by
.An Robert Watson ,
.An Wayne Salamon ,
and
.An Suresh Krishnaswamy
for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being found
and an error accessing the database.
The implementation should be changed to return an error via
.Va errno
when
.Dv NULL
is returned.
