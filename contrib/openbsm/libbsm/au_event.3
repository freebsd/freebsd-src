.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
.Xr audit_event 5
database, which describes audit events.
Entries in the database are described by
.Vt "struct au_event_ent"
entries, which are returned by calls to
.Fn getauevent ,
.Fn getauevnam ,
or
.Fn getauevnum .
It is also possible to look up an event number via a call to
.Fn getauevnonam .
.Pp
The
.Fn setauevent
function
resets the database access session for
.Xr audit_event 5 ,
so that the next call to
.Fn getauevent
will start with the first entry in the database.
.Pp
The
.Fn endauevent
function
closes the
.Xr audit_event 5
database session.
.Pp
The
.Fn getauevent
function
returns a reference to the next entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database.
.Pp
The
.Fn getauevnam
function
returns a reference to the entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database with a name of
.Fa name .
.Pp
.Fn getauevnum
returns a reference to the entry in the
.Xr audit_event 5
database with an event number of
.Fa event_number .
.Pp
The
.Fn getauevnonam
function
returns a reference to an audit event number using the
.Xr audit_event 5
database.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions
.Fn getauevent ,
.Fn getauevent_r ,
.Fn getauevnam ,
.Fn getauevnam_r ,
.Fn getauevnum ,
.Fn getauevnum_r ,
and
.Fn getauevnonam
will return a reference to a
.Vt "struct au_event_ent"
or
.Vt au_event_t
on success, or
.Dv NULL
on failure, with
.Va errno
set to provide further error information.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
This software was created by

for McAfee Research, the security research division of McAfee,
Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Va errno
variable
is not always properly set following a failure.
.Pp
These routines are thread-safe, but not re-entrant, so simultaneous or
interleaved use of these functions will affect the iterator.
