.Sh NAME
.Nm auditdistd.conf
.Nd configuration file for the
.Xr auditdistd 8
daemon.

.Li ( e.g., 0600 ) .
.Pp
Every line starting with

.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
The general syntax of the

# Connection timeout.
# The default is 5.

# Path to pidfile.
# The default is "/var/run/auditdistd.pid".
pidfile "<path>"

.Ed
.Pp
Most of the various available configuration parameters are optional.
If a parameter is not defined in the particular section, it will be
inherited from the parent section if possible.
For example, if the
.Ic source
parameter is not defined in the
.Ic host
section, it will be inherited from the
.Ic sender
section.
In case the
.Ic global
section does not define the
.Ic source
parameter at all, the default value will be used.
.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTION DESCRIPTION
The following statements are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic xxxx"
.It Ic name Aq name
.Pp
This host's name.
It is sent to the receiver, so it can properly recognize us if there are
multiple senders coming from the same IP address.
.It Ic timeout Aq seconds
.Pp
Connection timeout in seconds.
The default value is
.Va 5 .
.It Ic pidfile Aq path
.Pp
File in which to store the process ID of the main
.Xr auditdistd 8
process.
.Pp
The default value is
.Pa /var/run/auditdistd.pid .
.It Ic source Aq addr
.Pp
Local address to bind to before connecting to the remote
.Nm auditdistd
daemon.
The format is the same as for the
.Ic listen
statement.
.It Ic directory Aq path
.Pp
The directory where to look for audit trail files in case of sender mode, or
the directory where to store received audit trail files.
The provided path has to be an absolute path.
The only exception is when the directory is provided in the
.Ic receiver
section; then the path provided in the
.Ic host
subsections can be relative to the directory in the
.Ic receiver
section.
The default value is
.Pa /var/audit/dist
for the entire
.Ic sender
section,
.Pa /var/audit/remote
for the non-host
.Ic receiver
section and
.Pa /var/audit/remote/<name>
for the
.Ic host
subsections in the
.Ic receiver
section where
.Aq name
is the host's name.
.\".It Ic checksum Aq algorithm
.\".Pp
.\"Checksum algorithm should be one of the following:
.\".Bl -tag -width ".Ic sha256"
.\".It Ic none
.\"No checksum will be calculated for the data being sent over the network.
.\"This is the default setting.
.\".It Ic crc32
.\"CRC32 checksum will be calculated.
.\".It Ic sha256
.\"SHA256 checksum will be calculated.
.\".El
.\".It Ic compression Aq algorithm
.\".Pp
.\"Compression algorithm should be one of the following:
.\".Bl -tag -width ".Ic none"
.\".It Ic none
.\"Data sent over the network will not be compressed.
.\"This is the default setting.
.\".It Ic lzf
.\"The
.\".Nm LZF
.\"algorithm by
.\".An Marc Alexander Lehmann
.\"will be used to compress the data sent over the network.
.\".Nm LZF
.\"is a very fast, general purpose compression algorithm.
.\".El
.It Ic remote Aq addr
.Pp
Address of the remote
.Nm auditdistd
daemon.
The format is the same as for the
.Ic listen
statement.
When operating in
.Ic sender
mode this address will be used to connect to the
.Ic receiver .
When operating in
.Ic receiver
mode only connections from this address will be accepted.
.It Ic listen Aq addr
.Pp
Address to listen on in form of:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
protocol://protocol-specific-address
.Ed
.Pp
Each of the following examples defines the same listen address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0.0.0.0
0.0.0.0:7878
tcp://0.0.0.0
tcp://0.0.0.0:7878
tcp4://0.0.0.0
tcp4://0.0.0.0:7878
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple listen addresses can be specified.
By default
.Nm auditdistd
listens on
.Pa tcp4://0.0.0.0:7878
and
.Pa tcp6://[::]:7878 ,
if the kernel supports IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
.It Ic keyfile Aq path
.Pp
Path to a file that contains the private key for TLS communication.
.It Ic certfile Aq path
.Pp
Path to a file that contains the certificate for TLS communication.
.It Ic fingerprint Aq algo=hash
.Pp
Fingerprint of the receiver's public key.
Currently only the SHA256 algorithm is supported.
The certificate public key's fingerprint ready to be pasted into the
.Nm auditdistd
configuration file can be obtained by running:
.Bd -literal
# openssl x509 -in /etc/security/auditdistd.cert.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256 | awk -F '[ =]' '{printf("%s=%s\\n", $1, $3)}'
.Ed
.It Ic password Aq password
.Pp
Password used to authenticate the sender in front of the receiver.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/security/auditdistd.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/security/auditdistd.conf
The default
.Nm auditdistd
configuration file.
