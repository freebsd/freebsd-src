.Dt AUDITD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm auditd
.Nd audit log management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm auditd
.Op Fl dhs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon responds to requests from the audit(1) utility and notifications
from the kernel.  It manages the resulting audit log files and specified
log file locations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Starts the daemon in debug mode - it will not daemonize.
.El
.Pp
The historical
.Fl h
and
.Fl s
flags are now configured using
.Xr audit_control 5
policy flags
.Dv ahlt
and
.Dv cnt ,
and are no longer available as arguments to
.Xr auditd 8 .
.Sh NOTE
.Pp
To assure uninterrupted audit support, the
.Nm auditd
daemon should not be started and stopped manually.
Instead, the
.Xr audit 8
command
should be used to inform the daemon to change state/configuration after altering
the
.Pa audit_control
file.
.Pp
.\" Sending a SIGHUP to a running
.\" .Nm auditd
.\" daemon will force it to exit.
Sending a SIGTERM to a running
.Nm auditd
daemon will force it to exit.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/audit" -compact
.It Pa /var/audit
Default directory for storing audit log files.
