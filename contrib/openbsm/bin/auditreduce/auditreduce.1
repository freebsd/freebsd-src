.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm 
utility selects records from the audit trail files based on the specified
criteria.
Matching audit records are printed to the standard output in
their raw binary form.
If no filename is specified, the standard input is used
by default.
Use the 
.Nm praudit
utility to print the selected audit records in human-readable form.
See
.Xr praudit 1
for more information.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Select all records.
.It Fl a Ar YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
Select records that occurred after or on the given datetime.
.It Fl b Ar YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
Select records that occurred before the given datetime.
.It Fl c Ar flags
Select records matching the given audit classes specified as a comma
separated list of audit flags.
See
.Xr audit_control 5
for a description of audit flags.
.It Fl d Ar YYYYMMDD
Select records that occurred on a given date.
This option cannot be used with
.Fl a
or
.Fl b .
.It Fl e Ar euid
Select records with the given effective user id or name.
.It Fl f Ar egid
Select records with the given effective group id or name.
.It Fl g Ar rgid
Select records with the given real group id or name.
.It Fl r Ar ruid
Select records with the given real user id or name.
.It Fl u Ar auid
Select records with the given audit id.
.It Fl j Ar id
Select records having a subject token with matching ID.
.It Fl m Ar event
Select records with the given event name or number.
See
.Xr audit_event 5
for a description of audit event names and numbers.
.It Fl o Ar object=value
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Nm file
Select records containing path tokens, where the pathname matches
one of the comma delimited extended regular expression contained in
given specification.
Regular expressions which are prefixed with a tilde (~) are excluded
from the search results.
These extended regular expressions are processed from left to right,
and a path will either be selected or deslected based on the first match.
.Pp
Since commas are used to delimit the regular expressions, a backslash (\\)
character should be used to escape the comma if it's a part of the search
pattern.
.It Nm msgqid
Select records containing the given message queue id.
.It Nm pid
Select records containing the given process id.
.It Nm semid
Select records containing the given semaphore id.
.It Nm shmid
Select records containing the given shared memory id.

.Sh Examples
.Pp
To select all records associated with effective user ID root from the audit
log
.Pa /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634 :
.Pp
.Nm
-e root /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

.Xr setlogin 2
events from that log:
.Pp
.Nm
-m AUE_SETLOGIN /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
.Pp
Output from the above command lines will typically be piped to a new trail
file, or via standard output to the
.Xr praudit 1
command.
.Pp
Select all records containing a path token where the pathname contains
.Pa /etc/master.passwd
.Pp
.Nm
-ofile="/etc/master.passwd" /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
