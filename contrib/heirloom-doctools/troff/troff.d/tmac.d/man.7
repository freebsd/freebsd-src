.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The
.B man
macros are used to generate
.I man\~pages
with
.I nroff
or
.IR troff .
.
This document provides a brief summary of the use of each macro in that
package.
.
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The
.B man
macros understand the following command line options (which define
various registers).
.
.
.TP
.BI \-dToc= filename
Generate table of contents, hyperlinks and PDF bookmarks.
Table of contents entries generated from
.B .SH
and
.B .SS
macros are output on
.B stderr
with
.RB \(lq Toc: \(rq
prepended.
See the
.B \TEXAMPLESEXAMPLES\T
section for example commands using this option.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rcR=1
This option (the default if in nroff mode) creates a single, very
long page instead of multiple pages.
.
Say
.B \-rcR=0
to disable it.
.
.
.ig
.TP
.B \-rC1
If more than one manual page is given on the command line, number the
pages continuously, rather than starting each at\~1.
..
.
.
.ig
.TP
.B \-rD1
Double-sided printing.
.
Footers for even and odd pages are formatted differently.
..
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rFT= dist
Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the page if
negative or relative to the top if positive.
.
The default is \-0.5i.
..
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rHY= flags
Set hyphenation flags.
.
Possible values are 1\~to hyphenate without restrictions, 2\~to not
hyphenate the last word on a page, 4\~to not hyphenate the last two
characters of a word, and 8\~to not hyphenate the first two characters
of a word.
.
These values are additive; the default is\~14.
..
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rIN= width
Set body text indentation to
.IR width .
.
The default is 7n for
.IR nroff ,
7.2n for
.IR troff .
.
For
.IR nroff ,
this value should always be an integer multiple of unit \[oq]n\[cq] to
get consistent indentation.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rLL= line-length
Set line length.
.
If this option is not given, the line length is set to respect any
value set by a prior \[oq].ll\[cq] request (which
.I must
be in effect when the \[oq].TH\[cq] macro is invoked),
if this differs from the built\-in default for the formatter;
otherwise it defaults to 78n in
.I nroff
mode and 6.5i in
.I troff
mode.
.
.
.IP
Note that the use of a \[oq].ll\[cq] request to initialize the line
length is supported for backward compatibility with some versions of
the
.B man
program;
direct initialization of the \[oq]LL\[cq] register should
.I always
be preferred to the use of such a request.
.
In particular, note that a \[oq].ll\ 65n\[cq] request does
.I not
preserve the normal
.I nroff
default line length,
(the
.B man
default initialization to 78n prevails), whereas, the
\[oq]\-rLL=65n\[cq] option, or an equivalent \[oq].nr\ LL\ 65n\[cq]
request preceding the use of the \[oq]TH\[cq] macro,
.I does
set a line length of 65n.
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rLT= title-length
Set title length.
.
If this option is not given, the title length defaults to the line
length.
..
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rP nnn
Enumeration of pages start with
.I nnn
rather than with\~1.
..
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rS xx
Base document font size is
.I xx
points
.RI ( xx
can be 10, 11, or\~12) rather than 10\~points.
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rSN= width
Set sub-subheading indentation to
.IR width .
The default is 3n.
..
.
.
.ig
.TP
.BI \-rX nnn
After page\~\c
.IR nnn ,
number pages as
.IR nnn a,
.IR nnn b,
.IR nnn c,
etc.
.
For example, the option \[oq]\-rX2\[cq] produces the following page
numbers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.
..

.SH USAGE
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
This section describes the available macros for manual pages.
.
.TP
.B .EX
.TQ
.B .EE
Example/End Example.
.
After
.BR .EX ,
filling is disabled and the font is set to constant-width.
.
This is useful for formatting code, command, and configuration-file
examples.
.
The
.B EE
macro restores filling and restores the previous font.
.
.
.TP
.BI .HP " \fR[\fPnnn\fR]\fP"
Set up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.
.
The indentation is set to
.I nnn
if that argument is supplied (the default unit is \[oq]n\[cq] if
omitted), otherwise it is set to the previous indentation value
specified with
.BR .TP ,
.BR .IP ,
or
.B .HP
(or to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
.
Font size and face are reset to its default values.
.
The following paragraph illustrates the effect of this macro with
hanging indentation set to\~4 (enclosed by
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
to set the left margin temporarily to the current indentation):
.
.
.RS
.HP 4
This is a paragraph following an invocation of the
.B HP
macro.
.
As you can see, it produces a paragraph where all lines but the first
are indented.
.RE
.
.
.IP
Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.
.
While it is universally portable to legacy Unix systems, a hanging
indentation cannot be expressed naturally under HTML, and many
HTML-based manual viewers simply interpret it as a starter for a
normal paragraph.
.
Thus, any information or distinction you tried to express with the
indentation may be lost.
.
.
.TP
.BI .IP " \fR[\fPdesignator\fR]\fP \fR[\fPnnn\fR]\fP"
Set up an indented paragraph, using
.I designator
as a tag to mark its beginning.
.
The indentation is set to
.I nnn
if that argument is supplied (the default unit is \[oq]n\[cq] if
omitted), otherwise it is set to the previous indentation value
specified with
.BR .TP ,
.BR .IP ,
or
.B .HP
(or to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
.
Font size and face of the paragraph (but not the designator) are reset
to its default values.
.
.
.IP
To start an indented paragraph with a particular indentation but
without a designator, use \[oq]""\[cq] (two doublequotes) as the
second argument.
.
.
.IP
For example, the following paragraphs were all set up with bullets as
the designator, using \[oq].IP\ \\(bu\ 4\[cq].
.
The whole block has been enclosed with
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
to set the left margin temporarily to the current indentation value.
.
.
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
.B IP
is one of the three macros used in the
.B man
package to format lists.
.
.
.IP \(bu 4
.B HP
is another.
.
This macro produces a paragraph with a left hanging indentation.
.
.
.IP \(bu 4
.B TP
is another.
.
This macro produces an unindented label followed by an indented
paragraph.
.RE
.
.
.TP
.B .LP
.TQ
.B .PP
.TQ
.B .P
These macros are mutual aliases.
.
Any of them causes a line break at the current position, followed by a
vertical space downwards by the amount specified by the
.B PD
macro.
.
The font size and shape are reset to the default value (normally 10pt
Roman).
.
Finally, the current left margin and the indentation is reset to the
default values.
.
.
.TP
.BI .RE " \fR[\fPnnn\fR]\fP"
This macro moves the left margin back to level
.IR nnn ,
restoring the previous left margin.
.
If no argument is given, it moves one level back.
.
The first level (i.e., no call to
.B .RS
yet) has number\~1, and each call to
.B .RS
increases the level by\~1.
.
.
.TP
.BI .RS " \fR[\fPnnn\fR]\fP"
This macro moves the left margin to the right by the value
.I nnn
if specified (default unit is \[oq]n\[cq]); otherwise it is set to the
previous indentation value specified with
.BR .TP ,
.BR .IP ,
or
.B .HP
(or to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
.
The indentation value is then set to the default.
.
.
.IP
Calls to the
.B RS
macro can be nested.
.
.
.TP
.BI .SH " \fR[\fPtext for a heading\fR]\fP"
Set up an unnumbered section heading sticking out to the left.
.
Prints out all the text following
.B .SH
up to the end of the line (or the text in the next input line if there
is no argument to
.BR .SH )
in bold face
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ),
one size larger than the base document size.
.
Additionally, the left margin and the indentation for the following
text is reset to the default values.
.
.
.TP
.BI .SS " \fR[\fPtext for a heading\fR]\fP"
Set up a secondary, unnumbered section heading.
.
Prints out all the text following
.B .SS
up to the end of the line (or the text in the next input line if there
is no argument to
.BR .SS )
in bold face
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ),
at the same size as the base document size.
.
Additionally, the left margin and the indentation for the following
text is reset to the default values.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TH " title section \fR[\fPextra1\fR]\fP \fR[\fPextra2\fR]\fP \fR[\fPextra3\fR]"
Set the title of the
.I man\~page
to
.I title
and the section to
.IR section ,
which must take on a value between 1 and\~8.
.
The value
.I section
may also have a string appended, e.g.\& \[oq].pm\[cq], to indicate a
specific subsection of the
.IR \%man\~pages .
.
Both
.I title
and
.I section
are positioned at the left and right in the header line (with
.I section
in parentheses immediately appended to
.IR title .
.
.I extra1
is positioned in the middle of the footer line.
.
.I extra2
is positioned at the left in the footer line (or at the left on
even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-sided printing is
active).
.
.I extra3
is centered in the header line.
.
.
.IP
For HTML output, headers and footers are completely suppressed.
.
.
.IP
Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the new line number is\~1
again (except if the \[oq]\-rC1\[cq] option is given on the command
line) -- this feature is intended only for formatting multiple
.IR \%man\~pages ;
a single
.I \%man\~page
should contain exactly one
.B TH
macro at the beginning of the file.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TP " \fR[\fPnnn\fR]\fP"
Set up an indented paragraph with label.
.
The indentation is set to
.I nnn
if that argument is supplied (the default unit is \[oq]n\[cq] if omitted),
otherwise it is set to the previous indentation value specified with
.BR .TP ,
.BR .IP ,
or
.B .HP
(or to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
.
.
.IP
The first input line of text following this macro is interpreted as a
string to be printed flush-left, as it is appropriate for a label.
.
It is not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is no attempt
to fill the first line with text from the following input lines.
.
Nevertheless, if the label is not as wide as the indentation the
paragraph starts at the same line (but indented), continuing on the
following lines.
.
If the label is wider than the indentation the descriptive part of the
paragraph begins on the line following the label, entirely indented.
.
Note that neither font shape nor font size of the label is set to a
default value; on the other hand, the rest of the text has default
font settings.
.
.
.IP
The
.B TP
macro is the macro used for the explanations you are just reading.
.
.
.TP
.B .TQ
The
.B TQ
macro sets up header continuation for a
.B TP
macro.
.
With it, you can stack up any number of labels (such as in a
glossary, or list of commands) before beginning the indented
paragraph.
.
For an example, look up the documentation of the
.BR LP ,
.BR PP ,
and
.BR P
macros.
.
.
.PP
To summarize, the following macros cause a line break with the
insertion of vertical space (which amount can be changed with the
.B PD
macro):
.BR SH ,
.BR SS ,
.BR TP ,
.BR TQ ,
.B LP
.RB ( PP ,
.BR P ),
.BR IP ,
and
.BR HP .
The macros
.BR RS ,
.BR RE ,
.BR EX ,
and
.B EE
also cause a break but no insertion of vertical space.

.SH "PORTABILITY AND TROFF REQUESTS"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.
Note that using raw troff requests is likely to make your
page render poorly on the (increasingly common) class of viewers that
render it to HTML.
.
Troff requests make implicit assumptions about things like character
and page sizes that may break in an HTML environment; also, many of
these viewers don\[aq]t interpret the full troff vocabulary, a problem
that can lead to portions of your text being silently dropped.
.
.
.PP
For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page
entirely in the requests described on this page.
.
Further, it is best to completely avoid those we have described as
\[oq]presentation-level\[cq]
.RB ( .HP ,
.BR .PD ,
and
.BR .DT ).
.
.
.PP
The macros we have described as extensions
.RB ( .EX / .EE ,
.BR .SY / .OP / .YS ,
.BR .UR / .UE ,
and
.BR .MT / .ME )
should be used with caution, as they may not yet be built in to
some viewer that is important to your audience.
.
If in doubt, copy the implementation onto your page.
