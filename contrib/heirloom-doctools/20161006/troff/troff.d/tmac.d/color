.de CL	\" Color selection macro
.	\"
.	\"	$1=color (e.g. .CL red) or
.	\"	$1=textcolor on backgroundcolor (e.g. .CL "red on blue")
.	\"	$1=red green blue rgb (e.g. .CL ".2 .3 .4 rgb") or
.	\"	$1=hue saturation brightness hsb (e.g. .CL ".5 .6 .7 hsb")
.	\"	$1=cyan magenta yellow black cmyk (e.g. .CL ".1 .2 .3 .4 cmyk")
.	\"	$1=arbitrary PostScript commands
.	\"	$2=text
.	\"
.	\" If no arguments are given the default color (usually black) will be
.	\" restored. If $2 is omitted the color selected by $1 remains in effect
.	\" until another color is selected. If two arguments are given $2 will be
.	\" printed in color $1 and then the default color will be restored.
.	\"
.	\" The color of the text and the background can be selected by setting $1
.	\" to "textcolor on backgroundcolor" where textcolor and backgroundcolor
.	\" can be any of the known colors. For example use .CL "white on black"
.	\" for reverse video printing. Changing color in a word can be accomplished
.	\" by preceeding the characters with a \X'SetColor:val' command, where val
.	\" is the color you wish to use. Named colors are case independent.
.	\"
.	\" Implementation details are device dependent and are handled in the
.	\" appropriate post-processor. Requesting a color that's not available
.	\" (eg. not defined in /usr/lib/postscript/color.ps) results in the use
.	\" of default colors - black or white on black for reverse video mode.
.	\"
.	\" All colors may not be supported on every output device, and the direct
.	\" specification of a color via an explicit rgb, hsb, or cmyk argument may also
.	\" be device dependent. In any case, to be safe on PostScript devices, all
.	\" numeric paramenters in the direct rgb, hsb or cmyk specifications should lie
.	\" between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The names of the currently available colors
.	\" on PostScript printers are listed in file /usr/lib/postscript/color.ps.
