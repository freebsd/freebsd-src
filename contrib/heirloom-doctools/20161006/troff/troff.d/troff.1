.SH DESCRIPTION
.I troff
formats text in the named
.I files
for printing on phototypesetter devices.
Its capabilities are described in the
.I Nroff/Troff user's manual.
.PP
.I troff
generates output in an intermediate ASCII format
which must be passed through a device-dependent post-processor
before it can be printed;
see the description of the
.I \-T
option
and the example
below.
.PP
If no
.I file
argument is present, the standard input is read.
An argument consisting of a single minus
.RB ( \- )
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
.TP "\w'\f3\-F\f1fontdir 'u"
.BI \-o list
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in
the comma-separated
.I list
of numbers and ranges.
A range
.IB N \- M
means pages
.I N
through
.IR M ;
an initial
.I \-N
means
from the beginning to page
.IR N ;
and a final
.IR N \-
means
from
.I N
to the end.
.TP
.BI \-n N
Number first generated page
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-s N
Stop every
.I N
pages.
.I Troff
will stop the phototypesetter every
.I N
pages,
produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and resume when the typesetter's start button is pressed.
.TP
.BI \-m name
Prepend the macro file
.BI /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/tmac. name
to the input
.IR files .
.TP
.BI \-r aN
Set register
.I a
(one-character) to
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-r a = N
Set register
.I a
(may be more than one character) to
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-d aS
Define string
.I a
(one-character) to
.IR S .
.TP
.BI \-d a = S
Define string
.I a
(may be more than one character) to
.IR S .
.TP
.B \-i
Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.TP
.B \-z
Check syntax only;
do not generate any output
except for error messages.
.TP
.BI \-F fontdir
Use the directory
.I fontdir
to locate font files.
.TP
.B \-u N
Set the emboldening amount,
i.e. the number of times a character is printed
to simulate bold output,
to
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-T device
Prepare output for the specified device.
Available
.I devices
are:
.RS
.TP 8n
.PD 0
.B ps
for PostScript output with 72,000\ dpi
and AFM fonts (default),
with
.I dpost
as post-processor
.TP
.B psmed
for PostScript output with 3,600\ dpi
and AFM fonts,
with
.I dpost
as post-processor
.TP
.B pslow
for PostScript output with 432\ dpi
and AFM fonts,
with
.I dpost
as post-processor
.TP
.B post
for PostScript output with 720\ dpi
and
.I ditroff
fonts,
with
.I dpost
as post-processor
.TP
.B html
for HTML output,
with
.I dhtml
as post-processor
.ig \" aps is not installed any longer
.TP
.B aps
for the Autologic APS-5,
with
.I daps
as post-processor
..
.PD
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping
phototypesetter at the end of the run.
.TP
.B \-a
Send a printable text-only approximation
of the results to the standard output.
.TP
.BI \-x N
Enable extensions to previous versions of
.I troff
at level
.IR N .
Level 0 disables any extensions;
level 1 enables all extensions
except for long requests and request arguments;
level 2 enables these in addition
but executes short requests which are prefixes of undefined long requests;
level 3 ignores undefined long requests.
.TP
.B \-V
Print troff version.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping
of bytes to characters.
.TP
.B TYPESETTER
Specifies a device name as with the
.I \-T
option.
.TP
.B TROFFONTS
A colon-separated list of directory names
to search for PostScript fonts
before the device font directory.
.TP
.B TROFFMACS
Specifies the location to search for macro files with the
.I \-m
option.
This string forms a prefix to which the macro package name
is immediately appended.
Thus to make `\-mname' work with a file `/path/to/tmac.name',
use `TROFFMACS=/path/to/tmac.'
.SH FILES
.ta \w'/usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/*  'u
/tmp/ta*	temporary file
.br
/usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/*	standard macro files
.br
/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/*	font width tables
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate a PostScript file
from input that contains equations and tables, use
.RS
.nf
.sp
<input tbl | eqn | troff | dpost >output.ps
.sp
.fi
.RE
The resulting file can then be sent to a printer,
displayed by a previewer,
or passed to further post-processing utilities,
such as a PDF distiller.
