_n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f are text processors under the  UNIX  Time‐Sharing
System1  that  format  text for typewriter‐like terminals and for
a typesetter/raster devices,  respectively.   They  accept  lines
of  text  interspersed  with  lines of format control information
and format the text into a  printable,  paginated  document  hav‐
ing  a  user‐designed style.  _n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f offer unusual free‐
dom in document styling, including:  arbitrary style headers  and
footers;  arbitrary  style footnotes; multiple automatic sequence
numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc; multiple column  output;
dynamic  font  and  point‐size  control; arbitrary horizontal and
vertical local motions at any point; and a  family  of  automatic
overstriking, bracket construction, and line drawing functions.
_t_r_o_f_f produces its output in a device‐independent form,  although
parameterized  for  a  specific device; _t_r_o_f_f output must be pro‐
cessed by a driver for that device to produce printed output.
_n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f are highly compatible with each other and  it  is
almost always possible to prepare input acceptable to both.  Con‐
ditional input is provided that enables the user to  embed  input
expressly  destined for either program.  _n_r_o_f_f can prepare output
directly for a variety of terminal types and is capable of  util‐
izing the full resolution of each terminal.

In Summer 2005, Sun Microsystems, Inc. released the  source  code
to  the  Solaris  system,6  including the System V Release 4 ver‐
sion of _t_r_o_f_f, a derivative of ATT _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_e_r’_s _W_o_r_k_b_e_n_c_h  _t_r_o_f_f,
version  2.   It  had  undergone few changes since the end of the
1980’s, so it could serve as a clean starting  point  for  a  new
version  of  _t_r_o_f_f which is intended to be highly compatible with
UNIX _t_r_o_f_f, but which also provides additional features desirable
for  a  high‐quality  typesetting application at the beginning of
the 21st century.
As with the other components of the _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m _P_r_o_j_e_c_t, the  origi‐
nal code, once it had been released under an Open Source license,
has been made portable such that it  compiles  and  runs  on  the
contemporary  UNIX‐style  systems,  including  Linux.  It contin‐
ues to be freely available under the same license  as  originally
released, including its complete source code.
PostScript and its close relative  PDF  are  now  the  only  dev‐
ice  languages which are relevant to high‐quality printing; actu‐
ally, PostScript itself is more and more becoming  an  intermedi‐
ate  language  for the generation of PDF documents.  The _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m

          version of _t_r_o_f_f is thus primarily  directed  towards  generating
          PostScript  output  for further processing by a PDF creator, such
          as Ghostscript or Adobe Distiller; it can  generate  PDF‐specific
          instructions  for prepress usage as well as for online navigation
          in PDF documents.
          The principal output device independence of _t_r_o_f_f  has  neverthe‐
          less been retained, and changes to the intermediate language have
          been minor.  Many _t_r_o_f_f post‐processors will thus continue to  be
          usable with no or little adaptions.
          PostScript Type 1, OpenType, and  TrueType  have  become  device‐
          independent font formats; virtually all commercial and free fonts
          are available in one of them.  There is thus no need for a _t_r_o_f_f‐
          specific  device‐independent  font format anymore; instead, _H_e_i_r_‐
          _l_o_o_m _t_r_o_f_f can read font metrics directly from Type 1,  OpenType,
          and  TrueType  font  files.   This  has greatly relieved the task
          of installing fonts—it suffices to copy the original files  to  a
          user‐selectable  font directory—, and makes it possible to access
          advanced typographic data, such as kerning tables or substitution
          instructions for old‐style numerals.
          _t_r_o_f_f provides convenient access to any character in a font  file
          either  by its PostScript name, by its Unicode position as speci‐
          fied in a font‐specific or a generic table, or by conversion from
          POSIX‐style locale‐specific characters to Unicode positions.  The
          last form allows direct input of international language texts  in
          almost any character encoding, including UTF‐8.
          Improvements to the line adjusting  mechanism  can  be  activated
          to  achieve  more  aesthetically pleasant output:  _t_r_o_f_f can com‐
          pute line breaks for a whole paragraph at once, using  a  variant
          of  an algorithm originally developed by Donald Knuth and Michael
          Plass for the TEX system7.  Interword spaces  can  be  shrunk  as
          an alternative to being expanded.  Inter‐letter spaces and letter
          shapes can be dynamically varied both for computing break  points
          and for adjusting output lines; this is sometimes called ‘‘micro‐
          typography’’, cf. e.g. the thesis by Hàn The´^ Thành8.   All  para‐
          graph formatting options can be arbitrarily combined.
          A  variety  of  international  paper  formats   and   hyphenation
          languages  are  supported by _t_r_o_f_f.  The algorithm for the latter
          is derived from the respective one developed for TEX by  Franklin
          Liang9;  _t_r_o_f_f  uses the implementation of _L_i_b_H_n_j by Raph Levien.
          TEX hyphenation patterns can be converted to the format  accepted
          by _t_r_o_f_f.
          Many internal limitations of _t_r_o_f_f have been removed;  most  not‐
          ably, _t_r_o_f_f can now set characters in fractional point sizes.
          The _t_r_o_f_f language has been extended similarly as in the GNU ver‐
          sion  of  _t_r_o_f_f, _g_r_o_f_f10; for example, names of requests, macros,
          strings, number registers, and fonts can consist of more than two
          characters.  Although _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m _t_r_o_f_f is not completely compatible
          with _g_r_o_f_f, a special compatibility mode is provided,  and  docu‐
          ments prepared for _g_r_o_f_f can usually be processed without altera‐
          tion.
          As even the most basic printing devices are now capable  of  ras‐
          tering  PostScript  documents  (at least using conversion tools),
          and as PostScript and PDF viewer programs allow an  accurate  on‐
          screen  display  of _t_r_o_f_f documents, there is only one area where

          _n_r_o_f_f is still useful:  the  formatting  of  UNIX  manual  pages.
          The  _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m version of _n_r_o_f_f is thus specifically aimed at this
          task; it remains a separate program, is much smaller than  _t_r_o_f_f,
          and is optionally able to run without external device description
          files.  This makes it possible to use it  to  view  manual  pages
          even  on small system distributions where the size of programs is
          an issue.
          The Solaris version of _n_r_o_f_f had already been updated to  support
          input characters in arbitrary locales.  The _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m version adds
          the ability to generate UTF‐8 output.   This  extends  the  _n_r_o_f_f
          character  set  by many mathematical and typographical characters
          on terminals capable of displaying them.
          Although _H_e_i_r_l_o_o_m _n_r_o_f_f does of course not provide the typograph‐
          ical  extensions  made  for  _t_r_o_f_f, it includes the same language
          extensions.  It is thus well able to  cope  with  the  tangle  of
          manual  page  code  which  has been produced by application writ‐
          ers who have unfortunately become increasingly unaware of how  to
          write well‐styled _n_r_o_f_f documents.
          This manual as well as some of the pre‐ and  post‐processor  com‐
          mands have been derived from UNIX code released by Caldera11, and
          from materials released by Lucent as parts  of  the  _P_l_a_n _9  sys‐
          tem12.

          _t_r_o_f_f was originally written by the late  Joe  Ossanna  in  about
          1973,  in  assembly language for the PDP‐11, to drive the Graphic
          Systems CAT typesetter.  It was rewritten in C around  1975,  and
          underwent slow but steady evolution until Ossanna’s death late in
          1977.
          In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified _t_r_o_f_f so that it would  produce
          output  for  a  variety of typesetters, while retaining its input
          specifications.  Over the decade from 1979 to 1989, the internals
          have been modestly revised, though much of the code remains as it
          was when Ossanna wrote it.
          _t_r_o_f_f reads parameter files each  time  it  is  invoked,  to  set
          values  for  machine  resolution, legal type sizes and fonts, and
          character names, character widths and  the  like.   _t_r_o_f_f  output
          is  ASCII  characters  in  a simple language that describes where
          each character is to be placed and in  what  size  and  font.   A
          post‐processor  must  be  written for each device to convert this
          typesetter‐independent language into  specific  instructions  for
          that device.
          The output language contains information  that  was  not  readily
          identifiable  in  the  older  output.  In the newer language, the
          beginning of each page,  line,  and  word  is  marked,  so  post‐
          processors  can  do device‐specific optimizations such as sorting
          the data vertically or printing it boustrophedonically,  indepen‐
          dent of _t_r_o_f_f.
          Capabilities for graphics have been added:  _t_r_o_f_f recognizes com‐
          mands  for  drawing  diagonal  lines, circles, ellipses, circular
          arcs, and quadratic B‐splines.  There are also ways to pass arbi‐
          trary information to the output, unprocessed by _t_r_o_f_f.
          A number of limitations have been eased or eliminated.   A  docu‐
          ment  may  have  an arbitrary number of fonts on any page (if the
          output device permits it, of  course).   Fonts  may  be  accessed

          merely  by  naming  them;  ‘‘mounting’’  is  no longer necessary.
          There are no limits  on  the  number  of  characters.   Character

          sequences, and pre‐defined number registers; a reference  manual;

          Joe Ossanna’s _t_r_o_f_f remains  a  remarkable  accomplishment.   For
          more  than  twenty  years,  it  has  proven a robust tool, taking
          unbelievable abuse from a  variety  of  preprocessors  and  being
          forced  into  uses  that  were never conceived of in the original
          design, all with considerable grace under fire.
          Recent versions of _t_r_o_f_f  have  profited  from  significant  code
          improvements by Jaap Akkerhuis, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and
          Molly Wagner.  Andrew Hume, Doug McIlroy, Peter Nelson, and  Ravi
          Sethi  made  valuable suggestions on the manual.  I fear that the
          remaining bugs are my fault.

          The _t_r_o_f_f program as written by Joseph  Ossanna  and  Brian  Ker‐
          nighan  turned out to be an excellent base for a typesetting sys‐
          tem containing approximately twice as many  lines  of  code.   As
          with  the  second  edition, the design and the principal parts of
          _t_r_o_f_f have remained the same, despite of additions and  modifica‐
          tions.   This  is particularly remarkable since much of it is now
          more than 40 years old, but serves its purpose as well as on  day
          one.
          I am grateful to Sun,  Caldera,  and  Lucent  for  releasing  the
          source code without which this project would not have been possi‐

          UUUUssssaaaaggggeeee
          The general form of invoking _n_r_o_f_f (or  _t_r_o_f_f)  at  UNIX  command
          level is
               nnnnrrrrooooffffffff  _o_p_t_i_o_n_s  _f_i_l_e_(sor  ttttrrrrooooffffffff  _o_p_t_i_o_n_s  _f_i_l_e_s)
          where _o_p_t_i_o_n_s represents any of a number of option arguments  and
          _f_i_l_e_s  represents the list of files containing the document to be
          formatted.  An argument consisting of a single minus (----) is taken
          to  be  a  file  name corresponding to the standard input.  If no
          file names are given input is taken from the standard input.  The
          options,  which  may  appear  in any order so long as they appear
          before the files, are:

            _OOOO_pppp_tttt_iiii_oooo_nnnn  _EEEE_ffff_ffff_eeee_cccc_tttt
             ----oooo_l_i_s_t Print only pages whose page numbers appear in  _l_i_s_t,
                    which consists of comma‐separated numbers and number
                    ranges.  A number range has the form _N-_M  and  means
                    pages  _N  through  _M;  a  initial  -_N means from the
                    beginning to page _N; and a final _N- means from _N  to
                    the end.
             ----nnnn_N    Number first generated page _N.
             ----ssss_N    Stop every _N pages.  _n_r_o_f_f will halt prior to  every
                    _N  pages  (default  _N=1)  to  allow paper loading or
                    changing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
                    _t_r_o_f_f  will  include a ‘‘pause’’ code every _N pages;
                    its meaning, if any, depends on the output device.
             ----mmmm_n_a_m_e Prepend           the           macro           file

                    used  instead of the default macro directory string,
                    and no  attempt  is  made  to  open  _n_a_m_e  with  the
                    ‘‘tmac.’’  prefix.   The  value is prepended to _n_a_m_e
                    without inserting an additional slash as a directory
                    separator, so it must either end with a slash itself
                    or can be used to specify a  file  name  prefix  (as
                    e.g. ‘‘tmac.’’).
             ----rrrr_a_N   Register _a (one‐character) is set to _N.
             ----rrrr_a====N  Register _a (may be more than one character)  is  set

                    A special name, llllooooccccaaaalllleeee, is also supported.  It  gen‐

             ----TTTT_n_a_m_e Specifies  the  output  device.   Currently  defined
                    names  are  ppppssss  for  (default)  PostScript output at
                    72000 dpi, ppppssssmmmmeeeedddd for PostScript output at 3600  dpi,
                    ppppsssslllloooowwww  for  PostScript  output  at 432 dpi, ppppoooosssstttt for

                    processor.
             ----uuuu_N    Set the emboldening amount, i.e. the number of times
                    a  character  is printed to simulate bold output, to
                    _N.
          Each option is invoked as a separate argument; for example,
               nnnnrrrrooooffffffff  ----oooo_4,_8-_1_0  ----TTTT_3_0_0_S  ----mmmm_a_b_c  _f_i_l_e_1  _f_i_l_e_2
          requests formatting of pages 4, 8, 9, and 10 of a  document  con‐
          tained  in  the files named _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, specifies the output
          terminal as a DASI‐300S, and invokes the macro package _a_b_c.
          Various pre‐ and post‐processors are available for use with _n_r_o_f_f
          and  _t_r_o_f_f.   These  include  the equation preprocessors _n_e_q_n and
          _e_q_n2 (for _n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f respectively),  the  table‐construction
          preprocessor  _t_b_l3,  and _p_i_c and _g_r_a_p for various forms of graph‐
          ics.  A reverse‐line postprocessor _c_o_l is available for multiple‐
          column  _n_r_o_f_f  output  on terminals without reverse‐line ability;
          _c_o_l expects the Model 37 Teletype  escape  sequences  that  _n_r_o_f_f
          produces  by  default.   _c_o_l can optionally also filter the back‐
          space sequences which _n_r_o_f_f emits for underlining and emboldening
          in  order to produce a plain text file.  Another option is the _u_l
          postprocessor which converts backspace sequences to underline and
          reverse video escape sequences for CRT terminals.
          The ddddppppoooosssstttt postprocessor has a special role as it translates _t_r_o_f_f
          intermediate  output  to  PostScript, which is currently the only
          relevant target device format.
          For example, in

          column  means  that  the forms _N, +_N, or -_N are permitted, to set

          _1._1._F_o_r_m _o_f _i_n_p_u_t. Input consists of _t_e_x_t _l_i_n_e_s, which  are  des‐
          tined  to  be printed, interspersed with _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _l_i_n_e_s, which set
          parameters or  otherwise  control  subsequent  processing.   Con‐
          trol  lines  begin  with  a _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r—normally .... (period)
          or ´´´´ (acute accent)—followed by a name  that  specifies  a  basic
          _r_e_q_u_e_s_t  or  the substitution of a user‐defined _m_a_c_r_o in place of
          the control line.  The control character ´´´´ suppresses  the  _b_r_e_a_k
          function—the  forced  output of a partially filled line—caused by
          certain requests.  The control character may  be  separated  from
          the  request/macro  name  by white space (spaces and/or tabs) for
          esthetic reasons.  Names must be followed by either space or new‐
          line.  Control lines with unrecognized names are ignored.
          Various special functions may be introduced anywhere in the input
          by  means  of  an _e_s_c_a_p_e character, normally \\\\.  For example, the
          function \\\\nnnn_R causes the interpolation  of  the  contents  of  the
          _n_u_m_b_e_r  _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r  _R  in place of the function; here _R is either a
          single character name as in \\\\nnnn_x,  a  left‐parenthesis‐introduced,
          two‐character  name  as  in  \\\\nnnn((((_x_x, or a left‐bracket‐introduced,
          multiple character name as in \\\\nnnn[[[[_x_x_x].
          In traditional _t_r_o_f_f, only one and two character names were  per‐
          mitted  for  request,  macro,  string,  number register, and font
          names.  Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f can accept  names  containing  a  (nearly)
          arbitrary  number  of ASCII characters.  Escape \\\\IIII'_s_t_r_i_n_g' can by
          used to test if _s_t_r_i_n_g is a valid identifier name.   By  default,
          request  and  macro  names  are still required to contain at most
          two characters for compatibility reasons.  The  ----xxxx  command  line
          option,  the  ddddoooo  request,  or  the xxxxffffllllaaaagggg request make the longer
          names available.  The current extension level is available in the
          ....XXXX register.
          Four levels of extension availability are currently defined:
          0 disables all extensions except for locale‐dependent  input  and
            Type 1/OpenType/TrueType font selection using ffffpppp.  Since the ddddoooo
            request is not available at this level, it is not  possible  to
            change  to another extension level again.  It is most useful to
            print unmaintained documents for which any  adaption  would  be
            too tedious.
          1 enables extensions except for  direct  access  to  long  names,
            i.e.,  ....aaaabbbbccccddddeeee  will  be interpreted as request aaaabbbb with argument
            ccccddddeeee, and \\\\****[[[[xxxxyyyyzzzz]]]] refers to the string named [[[[ followed  by  the
            text  xxxxyyyyzzzz]]]].   Long  names can be accessed using the ddddoooo request,
            e.g. ....ddddoooo ddddeeee aaaabbbbccccddddeeee,  ....ddddoooo  iiiiffff  1111  \\\\****[[[[xxxxyyyyzzzz]]]].   This  level  is  the
            default.
          2 enables direct access to long names on request lines and escape
            sequences, i.e., ....aaaabbbbccccddddeeee will be interpreted as macro aaaabbbbccccddddeeee, and
            \\\\****[[[[xxxxyyyyzzzz]]]] refers to the string named xxxxyyyyzzzz.  If an  undefined  long

            short request using the remaining characters as  argument.   So
            if a macro aaaabbbbccccddddeeee is defined, ....aaaabbbbccccddddeeee will execute it, but other‐
            wise, ....aaaabbbbccccddddeeee continues to execute aaaabbbb.  String and number regis‐
            ter  references are only interpreted if they start in the first
            two characters of a name, i.e. no string interpretation is per‐
            formed on input ....aaaabbbb\\\\****((((xxxxyyyy.
          3 ignores undefined long requests even if they form a prefix of a
            short request, and interprets string and number register refer‐
            ences in any position of a name.
          It is recommended to execute ....ddddoooo xxxxffffllllaaaagggg 3333 at the beginning of  new

          processes  dimensions  in  units  that correspond to the particu‐
          lar device for which output is being prepared;  values  from  300
          to  72000/inch  are  typical.   See  §27.   _n_r_o_f_f internally uses
          240 units/inch, corresponding to the  least  common  multiple  of
          the  horizontal  and  vertical resolutions of various typewriter‐
          like output devices.  _t_r_o_f_f rounds horizontal/vertical  numerical
          parameter  input  to the actual horizontal/vertical resolution of
          the output device indicated by the ----TTTT option (default ppppssss).  _n_r_o_f_f
          similarly  rounds numerical input to the actual resolution of the
          output device indicated by the −−−−TTTT option (default Model 37  Tele‐
          type).

          ical  input  with the appended scale indicators shown in the fol‐

          In _n_r_o_f_f, _b_o_t_h the em and the en are taken to  be  equal  to  the
          _C,  which  is output‐device dependent; common values are 1/10 and
          1/12 inch.  Actual character widths in _n_r_o_f_f need not be all  the
          same  and  constructed  characters such as −> (→) are often extra

          ignore  any  scale indicators.  When a number register containing
          an already appropriately scaled number is  interpolated  to  pro‐
          vide  numerical  input, the unit scale indicator uuuu may need to be
          appended to prevent an additional inappropriate default  scaling.
          The  number, _N, may be specified in decimal‐fraction form but the
          parameter finally stored is rounded to an integer number of basic
          units,  except for floating‐point computations with nnnnrrrrffff and iiiiffff ffff.
          Exponential notation as in ‘1eeee++++9’ or ‘1eeee----10’ is supported.

          to  generate  the distance to the vertical or horizontal place _N.
          For vertically‐oriented requests and functions,  ||||_N  becomes  the
          distance  in  basic  units from the current vertical place on the
          page or in a _d_i_v_e_r_s_i_o_n (§7.4) to the the vertical place  _N.   For

          scaling indicators if _c is omitted) may be  used.   Except  where
          controlled  by  parentheses,  evaluation  of expressions is left‐
          to‐right; there is no operator precedence.   Spaces  are  ignored
          if  they  occur within parentheses; any other non‐numeric charac‐
          ter terminates the expression.  In the case of certain  requests,
          an  initial  ++++  or  −−−− is stripped and interpreted as an increment
          or decrement indicator respectively.  In the presence of  default
          scaling,  the  desired  scale indicator must be attached to _e_v_e_r_y
          number in an expression for which the desired and default scaling
          differ.  For example, if the number register xxxx contains 2 and the
          current point size is 10, then

          a  description  file specific to each output device (§27).  There

          The characters ´´´´, ````, and ---- may be input by \\\\´´´´, \\\\````, and \\\\---- respec‐
          tively  or by their names (Table II).  The characters \\\\ and """" can
          also be referred to as \\\\((((rrrrssss and  \\\\((((ddddqqqq,  respectively;  this  form
          allows  to completely avoid their interpretation as argument del‐
          imiter or escape character.  In  traditional  _t_r_o_f_f,,  the  ASCII
          characters @@@@, ####, """", ´´´´, ````, <<<<, >>>>, \\\\, {{{{, }}}}, ~~~~, ^^^^, and ____ existed only
          on the Special Font and were printed as a 1‐em space if that Font
          was  not  mounted.  With the ppppsssslllloooowwww device, these characters print
          in the _T_i_m_e_s font by default regardless of the current font  (but
          see the ffffppppssss request below).  With other devices, these characters
          are taken from the current font.
          With Type 1, OpenType, and TrueType fonts, _t_r_o_f_f allows to access
          all  named PostScript characters of the current font and of those
          in the ffffaaaallllllllbbbbaaaacccckkkk sequence in the forms \\\\[[[[_n_a_m_e]]]] or \\\\CCCC''''_n_a_m_e''''.
          _t_r_o_f_f internally converts non‐ASCII  characters  of  the  current
          LC_CTYPE locale to named PostScript characters once they are read
          in regular (not _c_o_p_y) mode.  If the current font is  an  OpenType
          or  a  TrueType font and contains a custom Unicode mapping table,
          the input character is looked up in that table first.  Otherwise,
          a  default table is used.  A character that is not present in the
          current font is searched using the ffffaaaallllllllbbbbaaaacccckkkk sequence first,  then
          in  the  special  fonts.  If the character cannot be found, it is
          discarded.  Characters for which no name is known are replaced by
          spaces.
          The \\\\NNNN''''_n'''' escape sequence  has  historically  been  available  to
          refer  to character _n of the current font.  It is still accepted,
          but its use is discouraged with Type 1,  OpenType,  and  TrueType
          fonts  since  the arrangement of character in font tables is per‐
          formed at run‐time and may change with future versions of  _t_r_o_f_f.
          When  register  ....gggg  is set to 1111 8‐bit character codes can also be
          accessed with \\\\[[[[cccchhhhaaaarrrr_n]]]] where 32≤_n≤255.
          _n_r_o_f_f has an analogous, but  different,  mechanism  for  defining
          legal  characters  and how to print them.  By default all charac‐
          ters are valid.  There are such additional characters as  may  be
          available  on  the  output device, such characters as may be able
          to be constructed by overstriking or other combination, and those
          that  can  reasonably  be mapped into other printable characters.
          The exact behavior is determined by a driving table prepared  for
          each  device.   In  a UTF‐8 locale, combining characters are pro‐
          cessed.  The characters ´´´´, ````, and ____ print as themselves.
          Both _n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f allow references to specific  Unicode  char‐
          acters  with  the  \\\\UUUU''''_X'''' escape sequence; it causes the character
          at position U+_X to be printed (_X is a hexadecimal  number).   For
          _t_r_o_f_f,  it is required that this character is available in one of
          the fonts mounted at this point.  As an example, \U'20AC'  prints

          digit hexadecimal number.
          _2._2._F_o_n_t_s. _t_r_o_f_f begins execution by reading  information  for  a
          set  of  defaults  fonts, said to be _m_o_u_n_t_e_d; conventionally, the
          first four are Times Roman (RRRR), Times Italic (IIII), Times Bold (BBBB),
          and  Times  Bold  Italic (BBBBIIII), and the last is a Special font (SSSS)
          containing miscellaneous characters.  The set of fonts and  posi‐
          tions  is determined by the device description file, described in
          §27.
          The _c_u_r_r_e_n_t font, initially Roman,  may  be  changed  (among  the
          mounted  fonts)  by use of the fffftttt request, or by imbedding at any
          desired point either \\\\ffff_x, \\\\ffff((((_x_x, \\\\ffff[[[[_x_x_x]]]], or \\\\ffff_N where _x, _x_x, and
          _x_x_x  are  the  name  of  a mounted font and _N is a numerical font
          position.
          It is _n_o_t necessary to change to  the  Special  font;  characters
          on  that  font  are  automatically handled as if they were physi‐
          cally part of the current font.  The Special font may actually be
          several  fonts;  the name SSSS is reserved and is generally used for
          one of these.  The ffffaaaallllllllbbbbaaaacccckkkk request sets a font‐specific sequence
          of additional fonts that are searched for missing characters.
          _t_r_o_f_f can be informed that any  particular  font  is  mounted  by
          use  of  the  ffffpppp  request.   The list of known fonts is installa‐
          tion dependent.  In the  subsequent  discussion  of  font‐related
          requests,  _F  represents  either a one/two‐character font name or
          the numerical font position.  The current font is  available  (as
          numerical  position) in the read‐only number register ....ffff; the ....ffffpppp
          register holds the next unused position.
          A request for a named but not‐mounted  font  is  honored  if  the
          font  description  information  exists.  In this way, there is no
          limit on the number of fonts that may be printed in any  part  of
          a  document.   Mounted fonts may be handled more efficiently, and
          they may be referred to by their mount positions,  but  there  is
          no  other difference.  Mention of an unmounted font loads it tem‐
          porarily at font position zero, which serves as a one‐font cache.
          The function \\\\SSSS’±_N’ causes the current font to be slanted  by  ±_N
          degrees.  Not all devices support slanting.
          _n_r_o_f_f understands font control  and  normally  underlines  Italic
          characters (see §10.5).
          _2._3._C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _s_i_z_e. Character point sizes available depend on the
          specific  output  device; a typical (historical) set of values is
          6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18,  20,  22,  24,  28,  and  36.
          This  is  a  range  of 1/12 inch to 1/2 inch.  Modern output dev‐
          ices such as the default ddddeeeevvvvppppssss usually allow the  point  size  to
          be  set to arbitrary values, including fractional points.  The ppppssss
          request is used to change or restore the  point  size.   Alterna‐
          tively  the  point size may be changed between any two characters
          by imbedding a \\\\ssss_N at the desired point to set the size to _N,  or
          a \\\\ssss±_N (1≤_N≤8) to increment/decrement the size by _N; \\\\ssss0000 restores
          the _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s size.  On historical output devices, requested point
          size  values  that are between two valid sizes yielded the larger
          of the two.
          Note that through an accident of  history,  a  construction  like
          \\\\ssss33339999  is  parsed as size 39, and thus converted to size 36 (given

          Note  that  this  may  be a decimal fraction if the current point
          size is not an integer.  The ....ppppssss register stores the current size
          in  units.   The ....ssssrrrr and ....ppppssssrrrr registers store the requested point
          size in points and units, respectively; it is  identical  to  the

          The function \\\\HHHH´±_N’ sets the height of the current font to _N,  or
          increments  it  by +_N, or decrements it by -_N; if _N=0, the height
          is restored to the current point size.  In each case,  the  width
          is  unchanged.   Not  all  devices support independent height and
          width for characters.

                                       (1≤_N≤255).  If it is zero, the  font
                                       is mounted on the next free position
                                       (not on position zero).  At most 255
                                       fonts may be mounted simultaneously;
                                       it is possible to use more than  255
                                       fonts  in a document by reusing font
                                       registers.
                                       The font is then available with  ....fffftttt
                                       FFFF,   \\\\ffffFFFF,  etc.   FFFF  may  be  freely
                                       chosen, and may consist of more than
                                       two characters.
                                       _F  may  be  the  name  of  a  previ‐
                                       ously  mounted  font, such as RRRR.  In
                                       this case, the same _N register  must
                                       be  reused.   For best compatibility
                                       with conventional _t_r_o_f_f usage, it is
                                       recommended  that  the base fonts of
                                       a document are mounted  as  ‘‘1 R’’,
                                       ‘‘2 I’’,   ‘‘3 B’’,  ‘‘4 BI’’.   The
                                       initial fonts on  positions  9  (SSSS1111)
                                       and  10  (SSSS)  should not be changed,
                                       as they contain special metrics  for
                                       drawing commands.
                                       If the optional _s_u_p_p_l_y  argument  is
                                       present,  glyph  data is included in

          input  text  lines  and  assembled  into a output text line until
          some word does not fit.  An attempt  is  then  made  the  hyphen‐
          ate  the  word in effort to assemble a part of it into the output
          line.  The spaces between the words on the output line  are  then
          increased to spread out the line to the current _l_i_n_e _l_e_n_g_t_h minus
          any current _i_n_d_e_n_t.  A _w_o_r_d is any string of characters delimited
          by  the  _s_p_a_c_e  character or the beginning/end of the input line.
          Any adjacent pair of words that must be  kept  together  (neither
          split across output lines nor spread apart in the adjustment pro‐
          cess) can be tied together by separating them with the _u_n_p_a_d_d_a_b_l_e
          _s_p_a_c_e  character  "\\\\  " (backslash‐space).  The paddable no‐break
          space character \\\\∼∼∼∼ keeps words on the same output  line  but  may
          be spread during adjustment.  The adjusted word spacings are uni‐
          form in _t_r_o_f_f and the minimum interword spacing can be controlled
          with  the  ssssssss request (§2).  In _n_r_o_f_f, word spacings are normally
          nonuniform because of quantization to character‐size spaces; how‐
          ever, the command line option ----eeee causes uniform spacing with full
          output device resolution.  Filling, adjustment,  and  hyphenation
          (§13) can all be prevented or controlled.  The _t_e_x_t _l_e_n_g_t_h on the
          last line output is available in the ....nnnn register, and text  base‐
          line  position  on  the page for this line is in the nnnnllll register.
          The text base‐line high‐water mark (lowest place) on the  current
          page is in the ....hhhh register.*
          The current horizontal output position is  in  the  ....kkkk  register.
          The  ....xxxx  register indicates the remaining horizontal space on the
          current output line.
          Text lines beginning with space characters and empty  text  lines
          (blank  lines)  cause a break.  The filling of the line currently
          being collected is stopped and the line is output without adjust‐
          ment.   The  ....bbbbllllmmmm  request can be used to redefine the processing
          of blank input lines.  With the ....llllssssmmmm request the effect of  lines
          beginning  with spaces is changed.  The read‐only number register
          llllssssnnnn contains the number of leading spaces.  The read‐only  number
          register  llllssssssss  contains the horizontal space which corresponds to
          the leading spaces.  Both registers are set also if ....llllssssmmmm  is  not
          used.
          _t_r_o_f_f can optionally decrease word spacings,  change  the  letter
          spacing,  and reshape letters when adjusting lines to fit on both
          margins.  The interword spacing controlled with  the  ssssssss  request
          is  then  understood as the optimum setting.  Words are collected
          from input until the first word that would  require  to  condense

          spacing or letter shapings is encountered.  Between  the  end  of
          the  previous  word  and the end of this word, hyphenation points
          are additionally examined until the two possibilities to end  the
          line surrounding the optimum are found.  The point closest to the
          optimum is then chosen.  If the word spacing so determined  would
          fall  below the minimum allowed, letter spacings and shapings are
          condensed.  If it would exceed the threshold for expanded  letter
          spacing  and  letter shaping, it is attempted to compensate until
          the threshold is reached, up to the maximum allowed letter  spac‐
          ing and letter shaping.  Remaining space is distributed among the
          word spacings.  Distribution among letter spacings and shaping is
          equal  until one of the respective limits is reached.  Lines that
          terminate with a _b_r_e_a_k are normally set using  the  optimum  word
          and  line  spacings  unless  the last word collected is the first
          word that falls below the optimum spacing, which  may  result  in
          condensed  spacing  and shaping.  The horizontal positions in the
          ....kkkk and ....xxxx registers are always computed using  default  character
          and spacing widths.
          As an alternative to adjusting one line at a time  as  described,
          _t_r_o_f_f  also  supports  adjusting  one paragraph at once.  In this
          mode, words are collected from input lines and requests are  pro‐
          cessed until a _b_r_e_a_k occurs.  The words are then split into lines
          such that the interword spaces are closest to the optimum setting
          across the entire paragraph.  Ultimately, the lines so determined
          are printed.  Traps, page  breaks,  and  any  positioning  become
          effective  only  at this time.  It is thus well possible that the
          current page number as read on the input line  in  the  %%%%  regis‐
          ter is lower than the number of the page on which the correspond‐
          ing text is actually output.  Any reference to the page number or
          page  position  (e.g. writing an index entry) should thus be han‐
          dled using the output‐line trap mechanism instead of in‐line mac‐
          ros.  Likewise the ....kkkk and ....xxxx registers are not meaningful in this
          mode, except that ....kkkk is never zero when text is present in a par‐
          tial paragraph.
          An input text line ending with ...., ????, !!!!, or ::::, optionally followed
          by any number of """", ´´´´, )))), ]]]], ****, or ††††, is taken to be the end of a
          _s_e_n_t_e_n_c_e, and an additional space character is automatically pro‐
          vided  during  filling.  To prevent this at individual locations,
          add \\\\&&&& to the end of the input line; the second argument  to  the
          ssssssss  request (§2) changes the size of this space character and can
          also disable it globally.  Both the sentence‐ending and the tran‐
          sparent  characters are configurable.  The \\\\)))) character is always
          transparent but behaves like \\\\&&&& in all  other  respects.   Multi‐
          ple  inter‐word space characters found in the input are retained,
          although the second character in a sequence of spaces following a
          sentence‐ending  character  has the width of a sentence space; if
          the sentence space has been set to zero, any sequence  of  spaces
          following  a  sentence‐ending character has the width of a single
          space.  Trailing spaces are always discarded.  Initial spaces are
          always retained and also cause a _b_r_e_a_k.
          With the bbbbrrrrnnnnllll request, a _b_r_e_a_k occurs at the  end  of  each  text
          input  line  in  fill mode, except for lines interrupted with \\\\cccc.
          Contrasting to nofill mode, text is still adjusted  to  the  line
          length.

          When filling is in effect, a \\\\pppp may be imbedded or attached to  a
          word to cause a _b_r_e_a_k at the _e_n_d of the word and have the result‐
          ing output line _s_p_r_e_a_d _o_u_t to fill the current line length.
          When adjusting paragraphs at once, is possible to  specify  addi‐
          tional  _p_e_n_a_l_t_i_e_s for putting a line break after the current word
          (or part of a hyphenated word) by imbedding or attaching a \\\\jjjj´±_N´
          to  it.   A positive value of _N discourages a line break, a nega‐
          tive value encourages it.  Values of 1000000 and above are  taken
          as  infinitive  penalties and always prevent a line break; values
          of -1000000 always cause a line break.  A default penalty can  be
          set with the \\\\JJJJ´±_N´ escape sequence; this is useful to discourage
          line breaks within a certain group of words, e.g. a person’s name
          or a formula.  Relative values in the argument to \\\\jjjj refer to the
          default penalty.  The current default penalty is available in the
          ....ddddeeeeffffppppeeeennnnaaaallllttttyyyy number register.  Separate penalties can be specified
          for breaking a line after a hyphenated word part using  the  hhhhyyyypppppppp
          request (§13).
          With the bbbbrrrrppppnnnnllll request, each end of a text  input  line  in  fill
          mode  causes  a  _b_r_e_a_k and a spread, except for lines interrupted
          with \\\\cccc.  The meaning of \\\\pppp is then  changed  such  that  a  line
          that  it is attached to is _n_o_t spread; this is the only method to
          achieve a regular _b_r_e_a_k without a spread then.  Manually adjusted
          text  can  thus  be typed more comfortably since only the (fewer)
          lines that are not spread need to be marked.
          A text input line that happens to begin with a control  character
          can  be made to not look like a control line by prefacing it with
          the non‐printing, zero‐width filler character \\\\&&&&.  Still  another
          way is to specify output translation of some convenient character
          into the control character using ttttrrrr (§10.5).
          _4._2._I_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_e_d _t_e_x_t. The copying of a input line in _n_o_f_i_l_l (non‐
          fill)  mode  can  be  _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_e_d by terminating the partial line
          with a \\\\cccc.  The _n_e_x_t encountered input text  line  will  be  con‐
          sidered  to  be  a  continuation  of the same line of input text.
          Similarly, a word within _f_i_l_l_e_d text may be interrupted  by  ter‐
          minating  the  word (and line) with \\\\cccc; the next encountered text
          will be taken as a continuation of the interrupted word.  If  the
          intervening control lines cause a break, any partial line will be
          forced out along with any partial word.  The ....iiiinnnntttt  number  regis‐
          ter  is  set  to a non‐zero value if the previous line was inter‐
          rupted and to zero otherwise.  The length of a  partial  word  is
          ignored  for the value of the ....kkkk number register in _f_i_l_l mode; it
          is separately available with the ....kkkkcccc register.
          _4._3._K_e_r_n_i_n_g. _t_r_o_f_f reads kerning tables  from  Type 1,  OpenType,
          and  TrueType  font files.  These tables contain small horizontal
          spacing adjustments for pairs of individual characters, e.g., the
          pair ‘‘Vo’’ would print as ‘‘Vo’’ without kerning applied.  Plac‐
          ing \\\\&&&& between two characters disables kerning at that  location;
          the  kkkkeeeerrrrnnnn  request can disable it globally.  The kkkkeeeerrrrnnnnppppaaaaiiiirrrr request
          adds a kerning pair; in contrast to predefined pairs,  it  allows
          the characters to originate from different fonts.
          It is sometimes useful to  add  or  substact  a  constant  amount
          of  spacing  whenever  a specific character appears; for example,
          french quotation marks usually require some  additional  distance
          to  the  words  contained  in them.  The kkkkeeeerrrrnnnnaaaafffftttteeeerrrr and kkkkeeeerrrrnnnnbbbbeeeeffffoooorrrreeee

          requests allow to define such adjustments.  Again, a \\\\....  disables
          them  at individual points; they are generally not applied if the
          other character is a space.
          _4._4._H_a_n_g_i_n_g _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s. Characters can hang beyond  the  left  or
          right  margins  of  adjusted  text;  the llllhhhhaaaannnngggg and rrrrhhhhaaaannnngggg requests
          specify this.  Left margin adjustments are evaluated  before  the
          letters  that  fit on the current line are computed, and can thus
          principally be of any length.  In contrast, right margin  adjust‐
          ments  are  evaluated after this computation is finished, and the
          adjustment is simply added to the word space of the output  line.
          Thus a positive right adjustment that is large in relation to the
          line length will cause visible holes, and a  negative  adjustment
          will  ultimately  cause  the words on the line to be printed over
          each other.  This is not a problem for the typical application of

          greater  than the point size; _t_r_o_f_f default is 10‐point type on a

          struct  requiring  the  output  line  containing it to have extra
          vertical space before and/or after it, the _e_x_t_r_a‐_l_i_n_e‐_s_p_a_c_e func‐
          tion  \\\\xxxx´_N´ can be imbedded in or attached to that word.  If _N is
          negative, the output line containing the word will be preceded by
          _N  extra  vertical  space; if _N is positive, the output line con‐
          taining the word will be followed by _N extra vertical space.   If
          successive  requests  for extra space apply to the same line, the
          maximum values are used.  The most  recently  utilized  post‐line
          extra line‐space is available in the ....aaaa register.
          In \\\\xxxx´...´ and other functions having a pair of delimiters around
          their  parameter  (here  ´´´´),  the  delimiter choice is arbitrary,
          except that it can not look like the  continuation  of  a  number
          expression for _N.

          hold the indent that actually applies to the current line, taking

          ddddiiii and ddddaaaa cause normal output to be stored in a  macro.   Strings
          are  created  by  ddddssss  and  appended to by aaaassss.  A macro is invoked
          in the same way as a request; a control line beginning  ...._x_x  will
          interpolate  the contents of macro _x_x.  The remainder of the line
          may contain arbitrarily many _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.  The strings _x,  _x_x,  and
          _x_x_x  are  interpolated  at any desired point with \\\\∗∗∗∗_x, \\\\∗∗∗∗((((_x_x, and
          \\\\∗∗∗∗[[[[_x_x_x]]]] respectively; the form \\\\∗∗∗∗[[[[_x_x_x _a_r_g ...]]]]  allows to specify
          arguments  to  a string.  String references and macro invocations
          may be nested.

          extension  of  strings and macros (not by diversion) the input is
          read in _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e.  The input is  copied  without  interpretation
          _e_x_c_e_p_t that:
               • The contents of number registers indicated by \\\\nnnn are interpolated.
               • Strings indicated by \\\\∗∗∗∗ are interpolated.
               • Arguments indicated by \\\\$$$$ are interpolated.
               • Environment variables indicated by \\\\VVVV are interpolated.
               • Concealed newlines indicated by \\\\(newline) are eliminated.
               • Comments indicated by \\\\"""" or \\\\#### are eliminated.
               • \\\\tttt and \\\\aaaa are interpreted as ASCII horizontal tab and SOH respectively (§9).
               • \\\\\\\\ is interpreted as \\\\.
               • \\\\.... is interpreted as "....".
          These interpretations can be suppressed by prepending a  \\\\.   For
          example,  since  \\\\\\\\ maps into a \\\\, \\\\\\\\nnnn will copy as \\\\nnnn which will
          be interpreted as a number register indicator when the  macro  or
          string is reread.
          _7._3._A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s. When a macro is invoked by name, the remainder  of
          the  line  is  taken  to contain arguments.  The argument separa‐
          tor is the space  character,  and  arguments  may  be  surrounded
          by  double‐quotes  to  permit  imbedded  space characters.  Pairs
          of double‐quotes may be imbedded in  double‐quoted  arguments  to
          represent  a  single  double‐quote character.  The argument """""""" is
          explicitly null.  If the desired arguments won’t fit on  a  line,
          a  concealed newline may be used to continue on the next line.  A
          trailing double quote may be omitted.
          Similarly, arguments may be passed to strings with the  \\\\∗∗∗∗[[[[  syn‐
          tax,  separated  by spaces, until the argument list ends with the
          ]]]] character.  String arguments are otherwise handled exactly like
          macro arguments.
          When a macro is invoked  the  _i_n_p_u_t  _l_e_v_e_l  is  _p_u_s_h_e_d  _d_o_w_n  and
          any  arguments  available  at  the previous level become unavail‐
          able until the macro is completely read and  the  previous  level
          is  restored.  A macro’s own arguments can be interpolated at _a_n_y
          point within the macro with \\\\$$$$_n, \\\\$$$$((((_n_n, or \\\\$$$$[[[[_n_n_n]]]], which  inter‐
          polates  the  _nth,  _n_nth, or _n_n_nth argument, respectively.  If an
          invoked argument doesn’t exist, a null string results.  For exam‐
          ple, the macro _x_x may be defined by

          Note that the \\\\$$$$ was concealed in the definition with a prepended
          \\\\.
          The escape sequence \\\\$$$$∗∗∗∗ interpolates all arguments  to  a  macro,
          separated  by  spaces;  \\\\$$$$@@@@  interpolates all arguments, each one
          surrounded by double quotes, separated by spaces.   The  name  of
          the  current  macro  or  string  is available with the \\\\$$$$0000 escape
          sequence.  The number of currently available arguments is in  the
          ....$$$$ register.
          No arguments are available at the top (non‐macro) level or within
          a trap‐invoked macro.
          Arguments are copied in _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e onto a  stack  where  they  are
          available  for  reference.   It  is  advisable  to conceal string
          references (with an extra \\\\) to delay interpolation  until  argu‐
          ment reference time.
          _7._4._D_i_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_s. Processed output may be diverted into a macro for
          purposes such as footnote processing (see Tutorial §T5) or deter‐
          mining the horizontal and vertical size of some text  for  condi‐
          tional  changing  of  pages  or columns.  A single diversion trap
          may be set at a specified vertical position.  The  number  regis‐
          ters  ddddnnnn  and ddddllll respectively contain the vertical and horizontal
          size of the most recently ended diversion.  Processed  text  that
          is  diverted  into  a  macro retains the vertical size of each of
          its lines when reread in _n_o_f_i_l_l mode regardless  of  the  current
          _V.  Constant‐spaced (ccccssss) or emboldened (bbbbdddd) text that is diverted
          can be reread correctly only if these modes are  again  or  still
          in  effect at reread time.  One way to do this is to imbed in the
          diversion the appropriate ccccssss or bbbbdddd requests with the  _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t
          mechanism described in §10.6.
          Diversions may be nested and  certain  parameters  and  registers
          are  associated  with  the  current diversion level (the top non‐
          diversion level may be thought of as the  0th  diversion  level).
          These are the diversion trap and associated macro, no‐space mode,
          the internally‐saved marked place (see mmmmkkkk and  rrrrtttt),  the  current
          vertical  place  (....dddd register), the current high‐water text base‐
          line (....hhhh register), and the current diversion name (....zzzz register).
          The current diversion level is available in the ....ddddiiiilllleeeevvvv register.
          A previous partially filled line is  included  when  a  diversion
          begins.   A  partially  filled  line at the end of a diversion is
          not included but becomes part of the surrounding diversion level.
          With  the  bbbbooooxxxx  request,  a previous partially filled line is not
          included.  At the end of the  diversion,  this  partially  filled
          line  is  restored  at the surrounding level, discarding any par‐
          tially filled line from within the diversion.   The  behavior  is
          otherwise the same as with a standard diversion.
          _7._5._T_r_a_p_s. Five  types  of  trap  mechanisms  are  available—page
          traps,  output‐line  traps,  a  single  diversion  trap, multiple
          diversion traps, and an input‐line‐count trap.   Macro‐invocation
          traps  may be planted using wwwwhhhh at any page position including the
          top.  This trap position may be changed using cccchhhh.  Trap positions
          at or below the bottom of the page have no effect unless or until
          moved to within the page or rendered effective by an increase  in
          page  length.  Two traps may be planted at the _s_a_m_e position only
          by first planting them at different  positions  and  then  moving
          one  of the traps; the first planted trap will conceal the second

          unless and until the first one is moved  (see  Tutorial  Examples
          §T5).   If  the  first  one  is moved back, it again conceals the
          second trap.  The macro associated with a page trap is  automati‐
          cally  invoked  when a line of text is output whose vertical size
          _r_e_a_c_h_e_s or _s_w_e_e_p_s _p_a_s_t the trap position.  Reaching the bottom of
          a  page springs the top‐of‐page trap, if any, provided there is a
          next page.  The distance to the next trap position  is  available
          in  the  ....tttt  register;  if there are no traps between the current
          position and the bottom of the page, the distance returned is the
          distance to the page bottom.
          An output‐line trap is planted using  the  escape  sequence  \\\\PPPP_x,
          \\\\PPPP((((_x_x, or \\\\PPPP[[[[_x_x_x]]]].  It is converted to an internal character code
          that becomes part of the current text.  When the line  containing
          it  has  been physically output, the macro _x, _x_x, or _x_x_x, respec‐
          tively, is invoked.  A line may contain more than one output‐line
          trap;  they are invoked in the order they appear.  If a page trap
          becomes effective at the same point, it  is  invoked  immediately
          after  all  output‐line traps.  Output‐line traps are not invoked
          at the time they become part of a diversion.  They  can  thus  be
          used to determine e.g. the effective page number of the surround‐
          ing text, even when it had originally been  diverted  on  another
          page.
          A single macro‐invocation trap effective in  the  current  diver‐
          sion  may  be  planted  using  ddddtttt.   If another ddddtttt follows in the
          same diversion, the trap position is changed.  Multiple traps may
          be  planted  in  the current diversion using ddddwwwwhhhh and ddddcccchhhh.  The ....tttt
          register works in a diversion; if there  is  no  subsequent  trap
          a  _l_a_r_g_e  distance is returned.  For a description of input‐line‐
          count traps, see iiiitttt below.
          _7._6._R_e_c_u_r_s_i_o_n. _t_r_o_f_f macros can be invoked recursively.  In  gen‐
          eral, return information and arguments for macro calls are stored
          as _f_r_a_m_e_s on a _s_t_a_c_k.  Since the size of  the  stack  is  limited
          by  available memory, recursive calls cannot descend to arbitrary
          depths.  To avoid consumption of large amounts of memory in  case
          of  endless  loops, the depth is deliberately restricted further;
          the rrrreeeeccccuuuurrrrssssiiiioooonnnnlllliiiimmmmiiiitttt request allows to adjust that restriction.
          A macro call can be _t_a_i_l‐_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e, that  is,  the  re‐invocation
          of  the  current  macro  can  occur in its last statement.  _t_r_o_f_f
          can then replace the stack frame of the  current  macro  instance
          with  that  of the following one, and the stack size remains con‐
          stant.  The depth of tail‐recursive macro calls is  thus  princi‐
          pally  unlimited,  and is not artificially restricted by default.
          Since _t_r_o_f_f cannot determine the control character  at  the  time
          the  macro  is executed in advance, the recursive macro call must
          not only be the last statement of  a  macro,  but  must  actually
          occur  in  the last line for tail‐recursion elimination to become
          effective, although it may be prefixed by ....iiiiffff or ....eeeellll or  followed

          As long as a local string named _x_x  exists,  any  reference  with
          \\\\((((_x_x or \\\\[[[[_x_x]]]] retrieves the value of the local string; the global
          string _x_x, if any, becomes inaccessible by this method.  Calls to
          aaaassss,  ssssuuuubbbbssssttttrrrriiiinnnngggg,  iiiinnnnddddeeeexxxx,  and cccchhhhoooopppp modify the local string.  wwwwaaaattttcccchhhh
          with the name of a local string as argument notifies  on  modifi‐
          cations  of the local string.  rrrrmmmm removes a local string and pos‐
          sibly makes a global string visible again,  rrrrnnnn  renames  a  local
          string  to another local string, and aaaallllssss creates a local alias to
          a local string.
          It is not allowed to define local macros  or  diversions.   Calls
          to  ._x_x  or  ´´´´_x_x  reference a global macro or diversion even if a
          local string _x_x exists.  Traps and the \\\\YYYY escape sequence  always
          operate on global macros or diversions.

          ter  names  are  one  or  two characters long and _d_o _n_o_t conflict
          with request, macro, or string names.  Except for certain  prede‐
          fined  read‐only  registers, a number register can be read, writ‐
          ten, automatically incremented or decremented,  and  interpolated
          into  the  input  in  a  variety  of  formats.  One common use of
          user‐defined registers is to automatically number sections, para‐
          graphs,  lines,  etc.   A  number  register  may be used any time
          numerical input is expected or desired and may be used in numeri‐
          cal _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s (§1.4).
          Number  registers  are  created  and  modified  using  nnnnrrrr,  which
          specifies  the  name,  numerical  value,  and  the auto‐increment
          size.  Registers are also modified, if  accessed  with  an  auto‐
          incrementing  sequence.   If  the  registers  _x  and _x_x both con‐
          tain _N and have the auto‐increment size _M, the  following  access
          sequences have the effect shown:

          Floating‐point registers can be created and modified  using  nnnnrrrrffff.
          They  share  a  common  name  space  with integer registers; a nnnnrrrr
          request turns a floating‐point register into an integer register.
          Access and auto‐increment are as with integer registers.
          When interpolated, a number  register  is  converted  to  decimal
          (default),  decimal  with leading zeros, lower‐case Roman, upper‐
          case  Roman,  lower‐case  sequential  alphabetic,  or  upper‐case
          sequential alphabetic according to the format specified by aaaaffff.
          Local number registers can be created and modified using llllnnnnrrrr  and
          llllnnnnrrrrffff.   Like  local  strings, local registers are accessible only
          within the currently executing macro instance, are not  inherited
          to  macros  invoked  from  them, and are deleted when the current
          macro returns.
          The existence of a  local  number  register  _x_x  makes  the  glo‐
          bal  number  register  _x_x,  if any, completely inaccessible.  The
          sequences \\\\nnnn((((_x_x and \\\\nnnn[[[[_x_x]]]] retrieve the value of the local regis‐

          nnnnrrrrffff,  aaaaffff,  lllleeeennnnggggtttthhhh, and iiiinnnnddddeeeexxxx with _x_x as argument modify the local

          ter.   rrrrrrrr  removes  a  local register and possibly makes a global
          register visible again, rrrrnnnnnnnn renames a local register  to  another
          local  register,  and aaaallllnnnn creates a local alias to a local regis‐

          _9._1._T_a_b_s _a_n_d _l_e_a_d_e_r_s. The ASCII horizontal tab character and  the
          ASCII  SOH  (hereafter known as the _l_e_a_d_e_r character) can both be
          used to generate either horizontal motion or a string of repeated
          characters.   The  length  of the generated entity is governed by
          internal _t_a_b _s_t_o_p_s specifiable  with  ttttaaaa.   The  default  differ‐
          ence  is  that tabs generate motion and leaders generate a string
          of periods; ttttcccc and llllcccc offer the choice of repeated  character  or
          motion.  There are three types of internal tab stops—_l_e_f_t adjust‐
          ing, _r_i_g_h_t adjusting, and _c_e_n_t_e_r_i_n_g.   In  the  following  table,
          _D  is  the  distance  from the current position on the _i_n_p_u_t line
          (where a tab or leader was found) to the  next  tab  stop,  _n_e_x_t‐
          _s_t_r_i_n_g  consists  of  the  input characters following the tab (or
          leader) up to the next tab (or leader) or end of line, and  _W  is
          the width of _n_e_x_t‐_s_t_r_i_n_g.

          The length of generated motion is allowed  to  be  negative,  but
          that  of  a  repeated character string cannot be.  Repeated char‐
          acter strings contain an integer number of  characters,  and  any
          residual  distance is prepended as motion.  Tabs or leaders found
          after the last tab stop are ignored, but may  be  used  as  _n_e_x_t‐
          _s_t_r_i_n_g terminators.
          Tabs and leaders are not interpreted in _c_o_p_y  _m_o_d_e.   \\\\tttt  and  \\\\aaaa
          always  generate  a  non‐interpreted tab and leader respectively,
          and are equivalent to actual tabs and leaders in _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e.
          _9._2._F_i_e_l_d_s. A _f_i_e_l_d is contained between a _p_a_i_r of  _f_i_e_l_d  _d_e_l_i_m_‐
          _i_t_e_r  characters,  and  consists of sub‐strings separated by _p_a_d_‐
          _d_i_n_g indicator characters.  The field length is the  distance  on
          the  _i_n_p_u_t  line  from the position where the field begins to the
          next tab stop.  The difference between the total  length  of  all
          the  sub‐strings and the field length is incorporated as horizon‐
          tal padding space that is divided  among  the  indicated  padding
          places.  The incorporated padding is allowed to be negative.  For
          example, if the field delimiter is #### and the padding indicator is
          ^^^^, ####^^^^_x_x_x^^^^_r_i_g_h_t#### specifies a right‐adjusted string with the string

          following  character  to  mean  another character, or to indicate
          some function.  A complete list of such  sequences  is  given  in
          the  Summary.   \\\\  should  not be confused with the ASCII control
          character ESC of the same name.  The escape character  \\\\  can  be
          output  by  using  the  special character \\\\((((rrrrssss.  The escape char‐
          acter can be changed with eeeecccc, and all that has  been  said  about
          the  default \\\\ becomes true for the new escape character.  \\\\eeee can
          be used to print whatever the current escape character  is;  this
          escape sequence is interpreted in _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e.  \\\\EEEE evaluates to the
          current escape character but is not interpreted in _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e;  if
          it  is  put  into  a string or macro, it will introduce an escape
          sequence once the string is printed or  the  macro  is  executed,

          at the _e_n_d of any line by prefacing them with \\\\"""".  This form does
          not conceal the newline at the end of the comment.  A line begin‐
          ning  with  \\\\"""" will appear as a blank line and behave like ....sssspppp 1111;
          a comment can be on a line by itself by beginning the  line  with
          ....\\\\"""".   The  form  \\\\#### includes the newline as part of the comment.
          It thus effectively acts like a concealed newline in  concatenat‐
          ing the following line immediately to the current line.

          numerical  width  of  _s_t_r_i_n_g  (in  basic  units).   Size and font
          changes may be safely imbedded in _s_t_r_i_n_g, and will not affect the
          current environment.  For example, ....ttttiiii ----\\\\wwww´´´´\\\\ffffBBBB1111.... ´´´´uuuu could be used
          to temporarily indent leftward a distance equal to  the  size  of
          the string "1111.... " in font BBBB.
          The width function also sets five number registers.   The  regis‐
          ters  sssstttt  and  ssssbbbb  are set respectively to the highest and lowest
          extent of _s_t_r_i_n_g relative to the baseline; then, for example, the
          total  _h_e_i_g_h_t  of the string is \\\\nnnn((((ssssttttuuuu----\\\\nnnn((((ssssbbbbuuuu.  The registers rrrrsssstttt

          extent  of  _s_t_r_i_n_g  relative to the baseline, i.e. to the maximum
          and minimum extent of the _y value of  any  bounding  box  of  the
          characters  in _s_t_r_i_n_g.  In _t_r_o_f_f the number register cccctttt is set to
          a value between 0 and 3:  0 means that all of the  characters  in
          _s_t_r_i_n_g  were short lower case characters without descenders (like
          eeee); 1 means that at least one character  has  a  descender  (like
          yyyy);  2  means  that  at least one character is tall (like HHHH); and
          3 means that both tall characters and characters with  descenders
          are present.
          The ....wwww number register contains the width of the  previous  char‐
          acter  independently  of the width function.  Similarly, the ....cccchhhhtttt
          and ....ccccddddpppp registers are set respectively to the highest and lowest

          _1_2._4._L_i_n_e _d_r_a_w_i_n_g. The function \\\\llll´´´´_N_c´´´´ (backslash‐ell) will  draw
          a  string of repeated _c’s towards the right for a distance _N.  If
          _c looks like a continuation of an expression for _N, it may  insu‐
          lated  from  _N  with  a  \\\\&&&&.  If _c is not specified, the ⎽⎽⎽⎽ (base‐
          line rule) is used (underline character in _n_r_o_f_f).  If _N is nega‐
          tive, a backward horizontal motion of size _N is made _b_e_f_o_r_e draw‐
          ing the string.  Any space resulting from _N/(size  of  _c)  having
          a  remainder  is  put  at the beginning (left end) of the string.
          If _N is less than the width of _c,  a  single  _c  is  centered  on
          a  distance  _N.   In  the  case  of  characters that are designed
          to be connected such as baseline‐rule ⎽⎽⎽⎽, underrule ____,  and  root‐
          en ‾‾‾‾,  the remainder space is covered by over‐lapping; the set of
          these characters can be customized with the  ccccoooonnnnnnnneeeeccccttttcccchhhhaaaarrrr  request
          described below.  If _N is _l_e_s_s than the width of _c, a single _c is
          centered on a distance _N.  As an example, a macro to underscore a

          Numbers taken as horizontal (first, third,  etc.)   have  default
          scaling  of  mmmm;  vertical  numbers  (second,  fourth, etc.)  have
          default scaling of vvvv (§1.3).   The  position  after  a  graphical
          object  has  been  drawn is at its end; for circles and ellipses,
          the ‘‘end’’ is at the right side.

              Automatic sequence numbering of output lines may be requested
              with  nnnnmmmm.   When in effect, a three‐digit, arabic number plus
            3 a digit‐space is prepended to output text  lines.   The  text
              lines  are  thus  offset  by four digit‐spaces, and otherwise
              retain their line length; a reduction in line length  may  be
            6 desired to keep the right margin aligned with an earlier mar‐

                                       is  large.  Recursive macros (§10.6)
                                       do not suffer from this problem.  In
                                       contrast  to  recursive macro calls,
                                       there is no mechanism to terminate a

                                       limit has been reached.  In case  of
                                       doubt, an explicit limit termination
                                       condition should be added to prevent
                                       endless loops.

          If the condition _c is _t_r_u_e, or if the number _N  is  greater  than
          zero,  or  if  the strings compare identically (including motions
          and character size and font), _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g is accepted as input.   If
          a  !!!!  precedes  the  condition, number, or string comparison, the
          sense of the acceptance is reversed.
          Any spaces between the condition and the  beginning  of  _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g
          are skipped over.  The _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g can be either a single input line
          (text, macro, or whatever) or a number of input  lines.   In  the
          multi‐line  case, the first line must begin with a left delimiter
          \\\\{{{{ and the last line must end with a right delimiter \\\\}}}}.
          The request iiiieeee (if‐else) is  identical  to  iiiiffff  except  that  the
          acceptance  state  is  remembered.   A subsequent and matching eeeellll

          _2_1._3._E_r_r_o_r_s. Various _e_r_r_o_r conditions may occur during the opera‐
          tion of _n_r_o_f_f and _t_r_o_f_f.  Certain less serious errors having only
          local impact do not cause processing to terminate.  Two  examples
          are _w_o_r_d _o_v_e_r_f_l_o_w, caused by a word that is too large to fit into
          the word buffer (in fill mode), and _l_i_n_e _o_v_e_r_f_l_o_w, caused  by  an
          output  line  that  grew  too large to fit in the line buffer; in
          both cases, a message is printed, the offending  excess  is  dis‐
          carded,  and  the affected word or line is marked at the point of
          truncation with a ∗ in _n_r_o_f_f and a ☜ in _t_r_o_f_f.   Processing  con‐
          tinues  if possible, on the grounds that output useful for debug‐
          ging may be produced.  If a serious error occurs, processing ter‐
          minates, and an appropriate message is printed, along with a list
          of the macro names currently active.  Examples  are  the  inabil‐
          ity to create, read, or write files, and the exceeding of certain
          internal limits that make future output unlikely to be useful.
          _2_1._4._D_e_b_u_g_g_i_n_g. Strings, macros,  and  number  registers  can  be
          _w_a_t_c_h_e_d.   Whenever  a change of a watched object occurs, or when
          the object is renamed, removed, or aliased, a  notification  mes‐
          sage  is  printed.   It  is  formatted  like an error message and
          includes the name of the current (or last previous) request,  the
          name  of  the objects affected, and, in case of a change, the new
          contents of the object.
          When an object is removed, watching is disabled.  If an object of
          the same name is created later, it is not watched unless watching
          is explicitly enabled for it again.

          _2_4._1._T_h_e _b_a_s_i_c_s. _t_r_o_f_f does not directly generate PDF  documents;
          the  _d_p_o_s_t postprocessor generates PostScript output which can be
          converted to PDF by utilities like Ghostscript’s _p_s_2_p_d_f or  Adobe
          Distiller.   But  it  is  possible  to include special advices to
          this conversion program in PostScript using the ppppddddffffmmmmaaaarrrrkkkk operator.
          Such  advices are generated automatically by some _t_r_o_f_f requests,
          e.g. by ccccrrrrooooppppaaaatttt (§3).  Other advices can be given explicitly using
          the \\\\XXXX´´´´PPPPSSSS::::...´´´´ or \\\\XXXX´´´´PPPPDDDDFFFFMMMMaaaarrrrkkkk::::...´´´´ escape sequences.

          important  to  set  the  paper format using the mmmmeeeeddddiiiiaaaassssiiiizzzzeeee request
          (§3).  This is because calculations in  PDF  documents  are  gen‐
          erally  performed  in  relation  regard to the page bottom, while
          _t_r_o_f_f performs its calculations in  relation  to  the  page  top.
          Failing  to  set  the  paper  format  correctly will thus usually
          result in vertical displacements of PDF‐specific elements.

          longer than a few pages for viewing on  the  screen,  you  should
          include bookmarks for each chapter or section because they enable
          the reader to navigate much more conveniently.
          Start with a bookmark for the title page.  ‘‘0’’ is the level  of
          the  bookmark  in the tree structure, and the following arguments
          form the name of the bookmark:  \\\\XXXX´´´´PPPPDDDDFFFFMMMMaaaarrrrkkkk::::  BBBBooooooookkkkmmmmaaaarrrrkkkk  _0  _T_i_t_l_e´´´´.

          Unless the bookmark command occurs at the top  of  the  page,  it
          refers to the baseline of the text; this is why a \\\\vvvv´´´´----1111vvvv´´´´ command
          occurs before it in the section macro.  \\\\vvvv´´´´----1111vvvv----4444pppp´´´´ at the top  of
          the  page is a special value that causes the upper left corner to
          be shown.
          The level of the first bookmark in a document must be of level 0.
          The levels of following bookmarks must be either
          – one higher than the level of the previous  bookmark.   The  new
            bookmark then becomes a child of the previous bookmark.
          – equal to the level of the previous  bookmark.   In  this  case,
            both bookmarks are grouped below the first previous bookmark of
            the first higher level, or at the top level for level 0.
          – lower than the level of the previous bookmark.  This terminates
            the list of children of the higher levels.
          As an example, the following level structure is legal, and causes
          the PDF viewer to group the bookmarks as shown:
                     0       title page

          In case of an illegal structure in which the level of a  bookmark
          is  raised  by more than one above its predecessor, _d_p_o_s_t emits a
          warning and assigns the highest legal level.  However, a  garbled
          document structure may result:
                     0
                     •-2     ☜ the first level 2 is corrected to 1 by _d_p_o_s_t
                       •--2  so the second bookmark becomes a child of the first
          Thus such _d_p_o_s_t warnings should usually be taken  seriously,  and
          the document should be corrected.
          An alternate form of bookmarks, \\\\XXXX´´´´PPPPDDDDFFFFMMMMaaaarrrrkkkk:::: BBBBooooooookkkkmmmmaaaarrrrkkkkCCCClllloooosssseeeedddd  ...´´´´,
          is  available.   The  syntax is the same, but the initial view in
          the tree structure is collapsed, i.e. no children  are  shown  by
          default.  It the bookmark has no children, there is no difference
          to a regular bookmark.
          _2_4._6._L_i_n_k_s. PDF documents can contain links that cause the viewer
          to  jump to a certain location when the user clicks on an area of
          the page, as well as links to external documents in URI form.  In
          _t_r_o_f_f, such links can be built as follows:
          The \\\\AAAA´_s_t_r_i_n_g´ escape sequence defines an anchor,  i.e.  a  loca‐
          tion  to jump to, with the name _s_t_r_i_n_g (consisting of ASCII char‐
          acters).
          The actual link is built  using  two  \\\\TTTT  escape  sequences  sur‐
          rounding  the  text  that  forms  the  area  to  click  on, e.g.:
          \\\\TTTT´_s_t_r_i_n_g´_t_e_x_t _o_f _l_i_n_k\\\\TTTT.  _s_t_r_i_n_g must correspond  to  an  anchor
          anywhere in the document.
          An URI link is built likewise  using  two  \\\\WWWW  escape  sequences:
          \\\\WWWW´_u_r_i´_t_e_x_t   _o_f   _l_i_n_k\\\\WWWW.    The   _u_r_i   part   is   not  inter‐
          preted  by  _t_r_o_f_f,  but  just  written  to  the  generated   out‐
          put.   Typically,  this  will  be  a  link  to  a  web  page,  as
          in <\W’http://n‐t‐roff.github.io/heirloom/doctools.html’http://n‐
          t‐roff.github.io/heirloom/doctools.html\W>.
          The appearance of links can be changed; links are  normally  sur‐
          rounded  by  an  1  point  wide  blue  border.   The color can be
          set using \\\\XXXX’SSSSeeeettttLLLLiiiinnnnkkkkCCCCoooolllloooorrrr:::: _r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n  _b_l_u_e’,  where  _r_e_d,  _g_r_e_e_n,
          _a_n_d  _b_l_u_e  are  values  between  0  and 1.  The border can be set
          using \\\\XXXX’SSSSeeeettttLLLLiiiinnnnkkkkBBBBoooorrrrddddeeeerrrr:::: _b_x _b_y _w_i_d_t_h’, where _b_x and _b_y define  the
          horizontal  and  vertical  corner radius, respectively, and _w_i_d_t_h
          defines the width.
          The border style can be changed with the \\\\XXXX''''SSSSeeeettttBBBBoooorrrrddddeeeerrrrSSSSttttyyyylllleeee:::: _a_r_g_u_‐

          Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f provides most  of  the  extensions  to  the  _t_r_o_f_f
          language  introduced in _g_r_o_f_f10.  Consequently, it is possible to
          create documents, macro sets, and preprocessors that can be  used
          with  both  Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f and _g_r_o_f_f and use functionality beyond
          the features that were supported by traditional _t_r_o_f_f.
          Important differences to _g_r_o_f_f are:   The  concept  of  an  _i_n_p_u_t
          _l_e_v_e_l  regarding  delimiters  in escape sequences and macro argu‐
          ments is not supported.  Control characters are recognized at the
          beginning  of  a  line  even if preceded by escape sequences that
          do not result in formatting stream objects, such as  \\\\ffff,  \\\\ssss,  or
          \\\\;;;;.   Font  handling,  color  support, picture inclusion, and PDF
          structuring are realized using different mechanisms.   The  _d_p_o_s_t
          post‐processor  does not recognize the \\\\XXXX´´´´ppppssss::::...´´´´ escape sequence
          (or xxxx XXXX ppppssss:::: command, respectively) that is used for  pass‐through
          PostScript  with the _g_r_o_p_s post‐processor of _g_r_o_f_f (_d_p_o_s_t accepts
          \\\\XXXX’PPPPSSSS::::...´´´´ and xxxx XXXX PPPPSSSS::::); the PostScript output generated by _d_p_o_s_t
          is  very  different  to  that  generated by _g_r_o_p_s.  _d_p_o_s_t accepts
          the _g_r_o_f_f drawing command extensions and sets the horizontal  and
          vertical positions accordingly, but otherwise ignores line width,
          color, and fill specifications.

                                       activated.   If  _N=0,  compatibility
                                       with traditional _t_r_o_f_f is decreased,
                                       and  Heirloom  _t_r_o_f_f extension level
                                       3 is set.  If _N≠0 or  missing,  com‐
                                       patibility with traditional _t_r_o_f_f is
                                       improved, and Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f  exten‐
                                       sion  level  1  is  set.  Thus ....ccccpppp 0000
                                       results in maximum _g_r_o_f_f compatibil‐
                                       ity.
          The ccccpppp request sets the general number register ....gggg to 1 in  _g_r_o_f_f
          compatibility mode and to 0 otherwise.  The general number regis‐
          ter ....CCCC is only assigned by the ....ccccpppp request and corresponds to its
          argument.
          Any use of the xxxxffffllllaaaagggg request  disables  _g_r_o_f_f  compatibility  and
          accordingly sets the ....gggg register to 0.
          The ....XXXX read‐only number  register  holds  the  current  extension
          level  after  ccccpppp  as  usual.   It  can  thus be used to determine
          whether running under _g_r_o_f_f or in the _g_r_o_f_f compatibility mode of
          Heirloom  _t_r_o_f_f.  Since they are read‐write, any convenient value
          can then be assigned to the ....CCCC and ....gggg registers.
          Nevertheless it is not recommend to do so  without  reason.   For
          instance  macro packages read \n(.g to test if they are processed
          with groff.  Setting ....gggg to 1111 with the ....nnnnrrrr request also  has  some
          side effects in Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f:

              _w_o_r_d _c_o_n_t_a_i_n_e_s _d_a_s_h_e_s).  A problem in macro packages is  that
              it  cannot  be  guaranteed  that  no character is before word
              (e.g. quotes or parentheses).  _g_r_o_f_f  allows  to  force  that
              \\\\%%%%  acts  as a hyphenation suppression escape when it follows
              the zero‐width characters \\\\)))) or \\\\&&&&.  This does not work  with
              traditional _t_r_o_f_f, unfortunately.  The command ....nnnnrrrr....gggg1111 enables
              the _g_r_o_f_f behaviour.
            • The algorithm _g_r_o_f_f uses for the  three  part  title  request
              ....ttttllll  leads  to a different placement of the middle title ele‐
              ment with _n_r_o_f_f under certain conditions.  This  is  emulated
              by setting ....gggg to 1.
            • _g_r_o_f_f’s left italic correction escape \\\\,,,, is removed from  the
              input instead of producing a ‘,,,,’.
          The ....xxxx and ....yyyy registers are  read‐write  in  _g_r_o_f_f  compatibility
          mode;  they correspond to the emulated _g_r_o_f_f version number.  The
          ccccpppp request sets them to 1 and 18, respectively.
          The ....kkkk number register behaves differently in _g_r_o_f_f compatibility
          mode:   If  the preceding text character was a newline, the width
          of a space character is added to the value.  If the previous line
          was  interrupted  with  \\\\cccc, the length of the partially collected
          word (as in the ....kkkkcccc number register) is part of the value.
          The space width always defaults to the value  obtained  from  the
          font  metrics  file  in  _g_r_o_f_f compatibility mode; the ssssppppaaaacccceeeewwwwiiiiddddtttthhhh
          request is not effective.
          If the file specified with a ssssoooo request cannot  be  opened,  pro‐
          cessing  continues  with  the current file in _g_r_o_f_f compatibility
          mode.
          A control or escape character written in a diversion has no  spe‐
          cial  meaning  if the diversion is re‐read in _g_r_o_f_f compatibility
          mode.
          Unless a string is  interpolated  with  explicit  arguments,  the
          arguments  to  the  surrounding macro instance remain visible and
          can be referenced by the \\\\$$$$ escape sequence inside the string  in
          _g_r_o_f_f compatibility mode.
          Any call to the ccccpppp request activates the following  _g_r_o_f_f  compa‐
          tibility escape sequences; any call to the xxxxffffllllaaaagggg request disables
          them.
          The \\\\AAAA’_s_t_r_i_n_g’ escape sequence checks whether _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  accept‐
          able  as  the  name of a string, macro, number register, or font,
          and evaluates to ‘‘1’ if it does and  to  ‘‘0’’  otherwise.   The
          Heirloom  _t_r_o_f_f  anchoring escape sequence \\\\AAAA is not available in
          _g_r_o_f_f compatibility mode.
          The \\\\//// escape sequence inserts an italic correction, i.e. a small
          piece  of  horizontal  motion  (1/12em) that should be sufficient
          to separate an italic character from a  following  roman  charac‐
          ter.   Similarly, \\\\,,,, adds a left italic correction, always a zero
          motion, that should be sufficient to separate a  roman  character
          from  an  immediately  following italic character.  Both exist to
          provide basic _g_r_o_f_f compatibility only.  It is  otherwise  recom‐
          mended  that  the kkkkeeeerrrrnnnnppppaaaaiiiirrrr request is used for these purposes; it

          allows a more exact optical separation since the  shape  of  both
          characters can be taken into account and also does not need to be
          be positioned directly in the input text at every occasion.
          The \\\\DDDD´´´´pppp ...´´´´ polygon drawing escape  sequence  is  altered  such
          that  the  path is always closed, i.e. if the last line part does
          not return to the starting position, an additional line is  added
          that does.
          The escape sequences \\\\FFFF_x, \\\\FFFF((((_x_x, \\\\FFFF[[[[_x_x_x]]]],  \\\\mmmm_x,  \\\\mmmm((((_x_x,  \\\\mmmm[[[[_x_x_x]]]],

          ity mode since the corresponding concepts of  font  families  and
          built‐in  color  support  are  foreign to Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f.  All of
          them generate a warning of the eeeessssccccaaaappppeeee category.
          _2_5._2._g_r_o_f_f _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y _m_a_c_r_o_s. As an additional aid in  format‐
          ting  documents  that  had  originally been written with _g_r_o_f_f in
          mind, Heirloom _t_r_o_f_f provides the ----mmmmgggg compatibility  macro  pack‐
          age.  Specifically:
          ....ccccpppp 0000 is executed, so _t_r_o_f_f is operated  in  _g_r_o_f_f  compatibility
          mode at extension level 3.
          The locale is set to eeeennnn____UUUUSSSS; this assumes that input to  _g_r_o_f_f  is
          conventionally in the ISO‐8859‐1 encoding.
          The hyphenation language is set to eeeennnn____UUUUSSSS.  Since both  _g_r_o_f_f  and
          Heirloom  _t_r_o_f_f  then use the same hyphenation algorithm and pat‐
          terns derived from _T_E_X, it can be assumed that words are  subject
          to hyphenation at the same points.
          The ddddeeee1111, aaaammmm1111, ddddssss1111, and aaaassss1111 _g_r_o_f_f requests are emulated using  ddddeeee,
          aaaammmm,  ddddssss, and aaaassss, respectively.  It is not expected that the _g_r_o_f_f
          compatibility macros are used to format  documents  that  require
          compatibility with traditional _t_r_o_f_f.
          The ffffttttrrrr request is removed since the _g_r_o_f_f request with the  same
          name provides completely different semantics.
          ffffaaaallllllllbbbbaaaacccckkkk is used to emulate ffffssssppppeeeecccciiiiaaaallll; these  requests  should  be
          compatible.   No  emulation  is provided for the ssssppppeeeecccciiiiaaaallll request;
          all other fonts are searched for missing characters  in  Heirloom
          _t_r_o_f_f by default.
          ttttrrrraaaacccckkkk is used to emulate ttttkkkkffff.  These requests are not  completely
          compatible:   ttttrrrraaaacccckkkk  does not affect the last character on a line
          and thus does not alter the visual length of lines like ttttkkkkffff does;
          ttttrrrraaaacccckkkk  is applied when formatting an object defined with the cccchhhhaaaarrrr
          request; ttttrrrraaaacccckkkk needs to remain in effect until all affected char‐
          acters  have  been physically output.  Nevertheless, the replace‐
          ment should suffice for most applications.
          _g_r_o_f_f  characters  with  two‐character  names   are   mapped   to
          PostScript character names using the cccchhhhaaaarrrr request.
          The following macro is also provided  as  an  emulation  for  the

          _t_r_o_f_f produces its output in a language that  is  independent  of
          any  specific  output  device, except that the numbers in it have
          been computed on the basis of the resolution of the  device,  and
          the  sizes,  fonts,  and  characters  that that device can print.

          All position values are in units.  Sequences that end  in  digits
          must  be  followed by a non‐digit.  Blanks, tabs and newlines may
          occur as separators in the input, and are mandatory  to  separate
          constructions  that  would otherwise be confused.  Graphics func‐
          tions, device control functions, and comments extend to  the  end
          of the line they occur on.
          The device control and graphics commands are  intended  as  open‐
          ended families, to be expanded as needed.  The graphics functions
          coincide directly with the \\\\DDDD sequences:

          position  information  are not included unless needed.  Neverthe‐
          less, each page  is  normally  self‐contained,  for  the  benefit

          sion of _t_r_o_f_f usually reads font metrics  directly  from  Type 1,
          OpenType, or TrueType font files, as described for the ffffpppp request
          (§2) and in the separate fonts manual available from the  project
          home page.
          Each font is described by an analogous  description  file,  which
          begins  with  parameters  of  the font, one per line, followed by
          a list of  characters  and  widths.   The  file  for  font  _F  is

          character name is arbitrary, except that ------------ signifies an unnamed
          character.   If the width field contains """", the name is a synonym
          for the previous character.  The ascender/descender field is 1 if
          the character has a descender (hangs below the baseline, like yyyy),
          is 2 if it has an ascender (is tall, like YYYY), is 3 if  both,  and
          is  0  if  neither.  The value is returned in the cccctttt register, as
          computed by the \\\\wwww function (§11.2).
          Here are excerpts from a typical font description  file  for  the
          same Postscript printer.

               ---  36   0    221       centered dot \N’221’
          This says, for example, that the width of  the  letter  aaaa  is  44
          units  at point size 10, the value of uuuunnnniiiittttwwwwiiiiddddtttthhhh.  Point sizes are
          scaled linearly and rounded, so the width of aaaa will be 44 at size
          10, 40 at size 9, 35 at size 8, and so on.
