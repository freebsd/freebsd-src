.Dt FTPUSERS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ftpusers ,
.Nm ftpchroot
.Nd
.Xr ftpd 8
access control file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides user access control for
.Xr ftpd 8
by defining which users may login.
.Pp
If the
.Nm
file does not exist, all users are denied access.
.Pp
A
.Dq \e
is the escape character; it can be used to escape the meaning of the
comment character, or if it is the last character on a line, extends
a configuration directive across multiple lines.
A
.Dq #
is the comment character, and all characters from it to the end of
line are ignored (unless it is escaped with the escape character).
.Pp
The syntax of each line is:
.Dl userglob[:groupglob][@host] [directive [class]]
.Pp
These elements are:
.Bl -tag -width "groupglob" -offset indent
.It Sy userglob
matched against the user name, using
.Xr fnmatch 3
glob matching
(e.g,
.Sq f* ) .
.It Sy groupglob
matched against all the groups that the user is a member of, using
.Xr fnmatch 3
glob matching
(e.g,
.Sq *src ) .
.It Sy host
either a CIDR address (refer to
.Xr inet_net_pton 3 )
to match against the remote address
(e.g,
.Sq 1.2.3.4/24 ) ,
or an
.Xr fnmatch 3
glob to match against the remote hostname
(e.g,
.Sq *.netbsd.org ) .
.It Sy directive
If
.Dq allow
or
.Dq yes
the user is allowed access.
If
.Dq deny
or
.Dq no ,
or
.Sy directive
is not given, the user is denied access.
.It Sy class
defines the class to use in
.Xr ftpd.conf 5 .
.El
.Pp
If
.Sy class
is not given, it defaults to one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "chroot" -offset indent
.It Sy chroot
If there is a match in
.Sx /etc/ftpchroot
for the user.
.It Sy guest
If the user name is
.Dq anonymous
or
.Sq ftp .
.It Sy real
If neither of the above is true.
.El
.Pp
No further comparisons are attempted after the first successful match.
If no match is found, the user is granted access.
This syntax is backward-compatible with the old syntax.
.Pp
If a user requests a guest login, the
.Xr ftpd 8
server checks to see that
both
.Dq anonymous
and
.Dq ftp
have access, so if you deny all users by default, you will need to add both
.Dq "anonymous allow"
and
.Dq "ftp allow"
to
.Pa /etc/ftpusers
in order to allow guest logins.
.Ss /etc/ftpchroot
The file
.Pa /etc/ftpchroot
is used to determine which users will have their session's root directory
changed (using
.Xr chroot 2 ) ,
either to the directory specified in the
.Xr ftpd.conf 5
.Sy chroot
directive (if set),
or to the home directory of the user.
If the file does not exist, the root directory change is not performed.
.Pp
The syntax is similar to
.Nm ,
except that the
.Sy class
argument is ignored.
If there's a positive match, the session's root directory is changed.
No further comparisons are attempted after the first successful match.
This syntax is backward-compatible with the old syntax.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/examples/ftpd/ftpusers -compact
.It Pa /etc/ftpchroot
List of normal users who should have their ftp session's root directory
changed by using
.Xr chroot 2 .
.It Pa /etc/ftpusers
This file.
.It Pa /usr/share/examples/ftpd/ftpusers
A sample
.Nm
file.
