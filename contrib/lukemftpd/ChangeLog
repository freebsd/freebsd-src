	* released 1.1

Sat Apr 28 07:13:57 UTC 2001	lukem

	* released 1.1 beta 1

	* determine if crypt() and getusershell() need declarations

Wed Apr 25 06:27:08 UTC 2001	lukem

	* update to NetBSD-current 2001-04-25:
		- update copyrights
		- remove superfluous byte_count update in send_file_list
		- use own code instead of bothering with glob() to do ~
		  expansion in pathname; there's no need to support glob
		  wildcards in this case when it's not expanded here in the
		  non-~ case 
		- As threatened, handle OOB commands from within ftpcmd.y. 
		  This involved changing the yacc syntax to be line-oriented,
		  rather than having it run against the entire input at once,
		  and adding a flag to struct tab, to  indicate if or not
		  it's acceptable for a command to occur OOB.

Tue Apr 17 08:20:09 UTC 2001	lukem

	* look for <arpa/nameser.h>

Fri Apr 13 16:02:40 UTC 2001	lukem

	  use %q instead of %ll #if HAVE_PRINTF_QD

	* added NEWS file

	* support S/Key with add support for --with-skey

	* pull up changes made in NetBSD in ftpcmd.y revision 1.61:

	* only look for setproctitle in -lutil if fparseln wasn't found in it

	* only REPLACE_FUNC(fparseln) if it wasn't found in -lutil

	* always compile in local glob; it's the best way to ensure that
	  various security issues are fixed

	  GLOB_LIMIT and fixing various buffer overflows.

	* support --enable-builtinls (default) and --disable-builtinls

		- don't support t(erabyte) as a suffix in strsuftoll()
		  #ifdef NO_LONG_LONG

		- comment or delete text after CPP directives.

	* look for setproctitle in -lutil as well

	* pull in <paths.h> if it exists, but still check each _PATH_xxx and
	  define to something sane if not found; certain platforms have a
	  lobotomised <paths.h>

Fri Mar 16 08:27:09 EST 2001	lukem

	* in getusershell.c, remove __P() and const cruft
