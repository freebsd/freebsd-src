Bug reports:
 please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

When sending email, please do not encode or split the messages in any
way if at all possible; it's easier to deal with one large message than
many small ones.  GNU shar (http://www.gnu.org/software/sharutils/) is a
convenient way of packaging multiple and/or binary files for email.

See README.dev for information on the Texinfo development environment --
any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish to
contribute, this should get you started.  And if you're not a
programmer, you can still make significant contributions by writing test
cases, checking the documentation against the implementation, etc.

This distribution includes the following files, among others:
    README                      This file.
    README.dev                  Texinfo developer information.

    INSTALL                     Texinfo-specific installation notes.
    NEWS                        Summary of new features by release.
    INTRODUCTION                Brief introduction to the system, and
                                how to create readable files from the
                                Texinfo source files in this distribution.

Texinfo documentation files (in ./doc):
    texinfo.txi                 Describes the Texinfo language and many
                                of the associated tools.  It tells how
                                to use Texinfo to write documentation,
                                how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs,
                                TeX, makeinfo, and the Emacs Lisp
                                Texinfo formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document also comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as C
                                source (./info).

    doc/texinfo.tex             This TeX definitions file tells
                                the TeX program how to typeset a
                                Texinfo file into a DVI file ready for
                                printing.

    util/texindex.c             This file contains the source for
                                the `texindex' program that generates
                                sorted indices used by TeX when
                                typesetting a file for printing.

    util/texi2dvi               This is a shell script for
                                producing an indexed DVI file using
                                TeX and texindex.
