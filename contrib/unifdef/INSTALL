unifdef installation instructions
---------------------------------

Dependencies:
 * unifdef is mostly ANSI C, with a few unixisms
 * unifdefall is a Unix shell script
 * the manual uses the nroff mdoc macros
 * the support and test scripts are Unix shell scripts

To build on Unix, type `make`. You can adjust the compilation options
using the POSIX standard CFLAGS and LDFLAGS make variables.

To install in your home directory, type `make install`
or to install in /usr type `make prefix=/usr install`.
See the start of the Makefile for the install location
variables.

The win32 subdirectory contains build files for MinGW and Visual
Studio 2010 which make use of the FreeBSD code plus some other
portability wrappers.

To build with MinGW, type `mingw32-make -f win32/Makefile.mingw`.

Unlike the Unix Makefile, the Windows builds do not automatically
create or update version.h. The release tar and zip files include a
pre-generated version.h but the git repository does not. To build from
a git clone you need a Unix shell environment, which you can get as
part of GitHub for Windows - http://windows.github.com/
To update version.h, right-click on the fanf2/unifdef repository and
select "open a shell here", then type `sh scripts\reversion.sh`.

We assume Unix provides the BSD err.h functions and C99 stdbool.h. The
FreeBSD subdirectory has copies of err.c and getopt.c for systems such
as Windows that don't have them built in.
