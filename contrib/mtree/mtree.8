.Op Fl s Ar seed
.Op Fl X Ar exclude-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility compares a file hierarchy against a specification,
creates a specification for a file hierarchy, or modifies
a specification.
.Pp
The default action, if not overridden by command line options,
is to compare the file hierarchy rooted in the current directory
against a specification read from the standard input.
Messages are written to the standard output for any files whose
characteristics do not match the specification, or which are
missing from either the file hierarchy or the specification.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Xxxexcludexfilexx
.It Fl b
Suppress blank lines before entering and after exiting directories.
.It Fl C
Convert a specification into
a format that's easier to parse with various tools.
The input specification is read from standard input or
from the file given by
.Fl f Ar spec .
In the output, each file or directory is represented using a single line
(which might be very long).
The full path name
(beginning with
.Dq \&./ )
is always printed as the first field;
.Fl K ,
.Fl k ,
and
.Fl R
can be used to control which other keywords are printed;
.Fl E
and
.Fl I
can be used to control which files are printed;
and the
.Fl S
option can be used to sort the output.
.It Fl c
Print a specification for the file hierarchy originating at
the current working directory (or the directory provided by
.Fl p Ar path )
to the standard output.
The output is in a style using relative path names.
.It Fl D
As per
.Fl C ,
except that the path name is always printed as the last field instead of
the first.
.It Fl d
Ignore everything except directory type files.
.It Fl E Ar tags
Add the comma separated tags to the
.Dq exclusion
list.
Non-directories with tags which are in the exclusion list are not printed with
.Fl C
and
.Fl D .
.It Fl e
Don't complain about files that are in the file hierarchy, but not in the
specification.
.It Fl F Ar flavor
Set the compatibility flavor of the
.Nm
utility.
The
.Ar flavor
can be one of
.Sy mtree ,
.Sy freebsd9 ,
or
.Sy netbsd6 .
The default is
.Sy mtree .
The
.Sy freebsd9
and
.Sy netbsd6
flavors attempt to preserve output compatiblity and command line option
backward compatibility with
.Fx 9.0
and
.Nx 6.0
respectively.
.It Fl f Ar spec
Read the specification from
.Ar file  ,
instead of from the standard input.
.Pp
If this option is specified twice, the two specifications are compared
to each other rather than to the file hierarchy.
The specifications will be sorted like output generated using
.Fl c .
The output format in this case is somewhat reminiscent of
.Xr comm 1 ,
having "in first spec only", "in second spec only", and "different"
columns, prefixed by zero, one and two TAB characters respectively.
Each entry in the "different" column occupies two lines, one from each
specification.
.It Fl I Ar tags
Add the comma separated tags to the
.Dq inclusion
list.
Non-directories with tags which are in the inclusion list are printed with
.Fl C
and
.Fl D .
If no inclusion list is provided, the default is to display all files.
.It Fl i
If specified, set the schg and/or sappnd flags.
.It Fl j
Indent the output 4 spaces each time a directory level is descended when
creating a specification with the
.Fl c
option.
This does not affect either the /set statements or the comment before each
directory.
It does however affect the comment before the close of each directory.
This is the equivalent of the
.Fl i
option in the
.Fx
version of
.Nm .
.It Fl K Ar keywords
Add the specified (whitespace or comma separated) keywords to the current
set of keywords.
If
.Ql all
is specified, add all of the other keywords.
.It Fl k Ar keywords
Use the
.Sy type
keyword plus the specified (whitespace or comma separated)
keywords instead of the current set of keywords.
If
.Ql all
is specified, use all of the other keywords.
If the
.Sy type
keyword is not desired, suppress it with
.Fl R Ar type .
.It Fl L
Follow all symbolic links in the file hierarchy.
.It Fl l
Do
.Dq loose
permissions checks, in which more stringent permissions
will match less stringent ones.
For example, a file marked mode 0444
will pass a check for mode 0644.
.Dq Loose
checks apply only to read, write and execute permissions -- in
particular, if other bits like the sticky bit or suid/sgid bits are
set either in the specification or the file, exact checking will be
performed.
This option may not be set at the same time as the
.Fl U
or
.Fl u
option.
.It Fl M
Permit merging of specification entries with different types,
with the last entry taking precedence.
.It Fl m
If the schg and/or sappnd flags are specified, reset these flags.
Note that this is only possible with securelevel less than 1 (i.e.,
in single user mode or while the system is running in insecure
mode).
See
.Xr init 8
for information on security levels.
.It Fl n
Do not emit pathname comments when creating a specification.
Normally
a comment is emitted before each directory and before the close of that
directory when using the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl N Ar dbdir
Use the user database text file
.Pa master.passwd
and group database text file
.Pa group
from
.Ar dbdir ,
rather than using the results from the system's
.Xr getpwnam 3
and
.Xr getgrnam 3
(and related) library calls.
.It Fl O Ar onlypaths
Only include files included in this list of pathnames.
.It Fl P
Don't follow symbolic links in the file hierarchy, instead consider
the symbolic link itself in any comparisons.
This is the default.
.It Fl p Ar path
Use the file hierarchy rooted in
.Ar path  ,
instead of the current directory.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Do not complain when a
.Dq missing
directory cannot be created because it already exists.
This occurs when the directory is a symbolic link.
.It Fl R Ar keywords
Remove the specified (whitespace or comma separated) keywords from the current
set of keywords.
If
.Ql all
is specified, remove all of the other keywords.
.It Fl r
Remove any files in the file hierarchy that are not described in the
specification.
.It Fl S
When reading a specification into an internal data structure,
sort the entries.
Sorting will affect the order of the output produced by the
.Fl C
or
.Fl D
options, and will also affect the order in which
missing entries are created or reported when a directory tree is checked
against a specification.
.Pp
The sort order is the same as that used by the
.Fl c
option, which is that entries within the same directory are
sorted in the order used by
.Xr strcmp 3 ,
except that entries for subdirectories sort after other entries.
By default, if the
.Fl S
option is not used, entries within the same directory are collected
together (separated from entries for other directories), but not sorted.
.It Fl s Ar seed
Display a single checksum to the standard error output that represents all
of the files for which the keyword
.Sy cksum
was specified.
The checksum is seeded with the specified value.
.It Fl t
Modify the modified time of existing files, the device type of devices, and
symbolic link targets, to match the specification.
.It Fl U
Same as
.Fl u
except that a mismatch is not considered to be an error if it was corrected.
.It Fl u
Modify the owner, group, permissions, and flags of existing files,
the device type of devices, and symbolic link targets,
to match the specification.
Create any missing directories, devices or symbolic links.
User, group, and permissions must all be specified for missing directories
to be created.
Note that unless the
.Fl i
option is given, the schg and sappnd flags will not be set, even if
specified.
If
.Fl m
is given, these flags will be reset.
Exit with a status of 0 on success,
2 if the file hierarchy did not match the specification, and
1 if any other error occurred.
.It Fl W
Don't attempt to set various file attributes such as the
ownership, mode, flags, or time
when creating new directories or changing existing entries.
This option will be most useful when used in conjunction with
.Fl U
or
.Fl u .
.It Fl X Ar exclude-file
The specified file contains
.Xr fnmatch 3
patterns matching files to be excluded from
the specification, one to a line.
If the pattern contains a
.Ql \&/
character, it will be matched against entire pathnames (relative to
the starting directory); otherwise,
it will be matched against basenames only.
Comments are permitted in
the
.Ar exclude-list
file.
.It Fl x
Don't descend below mount points in the file hierarchy.
.El
.Pp
Specifications are mostly composed of
.Dq keywords ,
i.e. strings that
that specify values relating to files.
No keywords have default values, and if a keyword has no value set, no
checks based on it are performed.
.Pp
Currently supported keywords are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width sha384digestxx
.It Sy cksum
The checksum of the file using the default algorithm specified by
the
.Xr cksum 1
utility.
.It Sy device
The device number to use for
.Sy block
or
.Sy char
file types.
The argument must be one of the following forms:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ar format , Ns Ar major , Ns Ar minor
A device with
.Ar major
and
.Ar minor
fields, for an operating system specified with
.Ar format .
See below for valid formats.
.It Ar format , Ns Ar major , Ns Ar unit , Ns Ar subunit
A device with
.Ar major ,
.Ar unit ,
and
.Ar subunit
fields, for an operating system specified with
.Ar format .
(Currently this is only supported by the
.Sy bsdos
format.)
.It Ar number
Opaque number (as stored on the file system).
.El
.Pp
The following values for
.Ar format
are recognized:
.Sy native ,
.Sy 386bsd ,
.Sy 4bsd ,
.Sy bsdos ,
.Sy freebsd ,
.Sy hpux ,
.Sy isc ,
.Sy linux ,
.Sy netbsd ,

.Pp
See
.Xr mknod 8
for more details.
.It Sy flags
The file flags as a symbolic name.
See
.Xr chflags 1
for information on these names.
If no flags are to be set the string
.Ql none
may be used to override the current default.
Note that the schg and sappnd flags are treated specially (see the
.Fl i
and
.Fl m
options).
.It Sy ignore
Ignore any file hierarchy below this file.
.It Sy gid
The file group as a numeric value.
.It Sy gname
The file group as a symbolic name.
.It Sy link
The file the symbolic link is expected to reference.
.It Sy md5
The
.Tn MD5
cryptographic message digest of the file.
.It Sy md5digest
Synonym for
.Sy md5 .
.It Sy mode
The current file's permissions as a numeric (octal) or symbolic
value.
.It Sy nlink
The number of hard links the file is expected to have.
.It Sy nochange
Make sure this file or directory exists but otherwise ignore all attributes.
.It Sy optional
The file is optional; don't complain about the file if it's
not in the file hierarchy.
.It Sy ripemd160digest
Synonym for
.Sy rmd160 .
.It Sy rmd160

.Tn SHA-1
cryptographic message digest of the file.
.It Sy sha1digest
Synonym for
.Sy sha1 .
.It Sy sha256

.Tn SHA-2
cryptographic message digest of the file.
.It Sy sha256digest

.Tn SHA-2
cryptographic message digest of the file.
.It Sy sha384digest
Synonym for
.Sy sha384 .
.It Sy sha512
The 512-bits
.Tn SHA-2
cryptographic message digest of the file.
.It Sy sha512digest
Synonym for
.Sy sha512 .
.It Sy size
The size, in bytes, of the file.
.It Sy tags
Comma delimited tags to be matched with
.Fl E
and
.Fl I .
These may be specified without leading or trailing commas, but will be
stored internally with them.
.It Sy time
The last modification time of the file,
in second and nanoseconds.
The value should include a period character and exactly nine digits after
the period.
.It Sy type
The type of the file; may be set to any one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Sy -compact
.It Sy block
block special device
.It Sy char
character special device
.It Sy dir
directory
.It Sy fifo
fifo
.It Sy file
regular file
.It Sy link
symbolic link
.It Sy socket
socket
.El
.It Sy uid
The file owner as a numeric value.
.It Sy uname
The file owner as a symbolic name.
.El
.Pp
The default set of keywords are
.Sy flags ,
.Sy gid ,
.Sy link ,
.Sy mode ,
.Sy nlink ,
.Sy size ,
.Sy time ,
.Sy type ,
and
.Sy uid .
.Pp
There are four types of lines in a specification:
.Bl -enum
.It
Set global values for a keyword.
This consists of the string
.Ql /set
followed by whitespace, followed by sets of keyword/value
pairs, separated by whitespace.
Keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an equals sign
.Pq Ql = ,
followed by a value, without whitespace characters.
Once a keyword has been set, its value remains unchanged until either
reset or unset.
.It
Unset global values for a keyword.
This consists of the string
.Ql /unset ,
followed by whitespace, followed by one or more keywords,
separated by whitespace.
If
.Ql all
is specified, unset all of the keywords.
.It
A file specification, consisting of a path name, followed by whitespace,
followed by zero or more whitespace separated keyword/value pairs.
.Pp
The path name may be preceded by whitespace characters.
The path name may contain any of the standard path name matching
characters
.Po
.Ql \&[ ,
.Ql \&] ,
.Ql \&?
or
.Ql *
.Pc ,
in which case files
in the hierarchy will be associated with the first pattern that
they match.
.Nm
uses
.Xr strsvis 3
(in VIS_CSTYLE format) to encode path names containing
non-printable characters.
Whitespace characters are encoded as
.Ql \es
(space),
.Ql \et
(tab), and
.Ql \en
(new line).
.Ql #
characters in path names are escaped by a preceding backslash
.Ql \e
to distinguish them from comments.
.Pp
Each of the keyword/value pairs consist of a keyword, followed by an
equals sign
.Pq Ql = ,
followed by the keyword's value, without
whitespace characters.
These values override, without changing, the global value of the
corresponding keyword.
.Pp
The first path name entry listed must be a directory named
.Ql \&. ,
as this ensures that intermixing full and relative path names will
work consistently and correctly.
Multiple entries for a directory named
.Ql \&.
are permitted; the settings for the last such entry override those
of the existing entry.
.Pp
A path name that contains a slash
.Pq Ql /
that is not the first character will be treated as a full path
(relative to the root of the tree).
All parent directories referenced in the path name must exist.
The current directory path used by relative path names will be updated
appropriately.
Multiple entries for the same full path are permitted if the types
are the same (unless
.Fl M
is given, in which case the types may differ);
in this case the settings for the last entry take precedence.
.Pp
A path name that does not contain a slash will be treated as a relative path.
Specifying a directory will cause subsequent files to be searched
for in that directory hierarchy.
.It
A line containing only the string
.Ql \&..
which causes the current directory path (used by relative paths)
to ascend one level.
.El
.Pp
Empty lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is a hash
mark
.Pq Ql #
are ignored.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with a status of 0 on success, 1 if any error occurred,
and 2 if the file hierarchy did not match the specification.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/mtree -compact
.It Pa /etc/mtree
system specification directory
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To detect system binaries that have been
.Dq trojan horsed ,
it is recommended that
.Nm
be run on the file systems, and a copy of the results stored on a different
machine, or, at least, in encrypted form.
The seed for the
.Fl s
option should not be an obvious value and the final checksum should not be
stored on-line under any circumstances!
Then, periodically,
.Nm
should be run against the on-line specifications and the final checksum
compared with the previous value.
While it is possible for the bad guys to change the on-line specifications
to conform to their modified binaries, it shouldn't be possible for them
to make it produce the same final checksum value.
If the final checksum value changes, the off-line copies of the specification
can be used to detect which of the binaries have actually been modified.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
option can be used in combination with
.Fl U
or
.Fl u
to create directory hierarchies for, for example, distributions.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The compatibility shims provided by the
.Fl F
option are incomplete by design.
Known limitations are described below.
.Pp
The
.Sy freebsd9
flavor retains the default handling of lookup failures for the
.Sy uname
and
.Sy group
keywords by replacing them with appropriate
.Sy uid
and
.Sy gid
keywords rather than failing and reporting an error.
The related
.Fl w
flag is a no-op rather than causing a warning to be printed and no
keyword to be emitted.
The latter behavior is not emulated as it is potentially dangerous in
the face of /set statements.
.Pp
The
.Sy netbsd6
flavor does not replicate the historical bug that reported time as
seconds.nanoseconds without zero padding nanosecond values less than
100000000.
