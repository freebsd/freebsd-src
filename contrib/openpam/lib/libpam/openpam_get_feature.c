 *
 * The following features are recognized:
 *
 *	=OPENPAM_RESTRICT_SERVICE_NAME:
 *		Disallow path separators in service names.
 *		This feature is enabled by default.
 *		Disabling it allows the application to specify the path to
 *		the desired policy file directly.
 *
 *	=OPENPAM_VERIFY_POLICY_FILE:
 *		Verify the ownership and permissions of the policy file
 *		and the path leading up to it.
 *		This feature is enabled by default.
 *
 *	=OPENPAM_RESTRICT_MODULE_NAME:
 *		Disallow path separators in module names.
 *		This feature is disabled by default.
 *		Enabling it prevents the use of modules in non-standard
 *		locations.
 *
 *	=OPENPAM_VERIFY_MODULE_FILE:
 *		Verify the ownership and permissions of each loadable
 *		module and the path leading up to it.
 *		This feature is enabled by default.
