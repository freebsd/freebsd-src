/**
 * The =openpam_readlinev function reads a line from a file, splits it
 * into words according to the rules described in the =openpam_readword
 * manual page, and returns a list of those words.
 *
 * If =lineno is not =NULL, the integer variable it points to is
 * incremented every time a newline character is read.
 * This includes quoted or escaped newline characters and the newline
 * character at the end of the line.
 *
 * If =lenp is not =NULL, the number of words on the line is stored in the
 * variable to which it points.
 *
 * RETURN VALUES
 *
 * If successful, the =openpam_readlinev function returns a pointer to a
 * dynamically allocated array of pointers to individual dynamically
 * allocated NUL-terminated strings, each containing a single word, in the
 * order in which they were encountered on the line.
 * The array is terminated by a =NULL pointer.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for freeing both the array and the individual
 * strings by passing each of them to =!free.
 *
 * If the end of the line was reached before any words were read,
 * =openpam_readlinev returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated array
 * containing a single =NULL pointer.
 *
 * The =openpam_readlinev function can fail and return =NULL for one of
 * four reasons:
 *
 *  - The end of the file was reached before any words were read; :errno is
 *    zero, =!ferror returns zero, and =!feof returns a non-zero value.
 *
 *  - The end of the file was reached while a quote or backslash escape
 *    was in effect; :errno is set to =EINVAL, =!ferror returns zero, and
 *    =!feof returns a non-zero value.
 *
 *  - An error occurred while reading from the file; :errno is non-zero,
 *    =!ferror returns a non-zero value and =!feof returns zero.
 *
 *  - A =!malloc or =!realloc call failed; :errno is set to =ENOMEM,
 *    =!ferror returns a non-zero value, and =!feof may or may not return
 *    a non-zero value.
