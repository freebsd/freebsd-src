/**
 * The =openpam_subst function expands a string, substituting PAM item
 * values for all occurrences of specific substitution codes.
 * The =template argument points to the initial string.
 * The result is stored in the buffer pointed to by the =buf argument; the
 * =bufsize argument specifies the size of that buffer.
 * The actual size of the resulting string, including the terminating NUL
 * character, is stored in the location pointed to by the =bufsize
 * argument.
 *
 * If =buf is NULL, or if the buffer is too small to hold the expanded
 * string, =bufsize is updated to reflect the amount of space required to
 * hold the entire string, and =openpam_subst returns =PAM_TRY_AGAIN.
 *
 * If =openpam_subst fails for any other reason, the =bufsize argument is
 * untouched, but part of the buffer may still have been overwritten.
 *
 * Substitution codes are introduced by a percent character and correspond
 * to PAM items:
 *
 *	%H:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_RHOST item.
 *	%h:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_HOST item.
 *	%s:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_SERVICE item.
 *	%t:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_TTY item.
 *	%U:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_RUSER item.
 *	%u:
 *		Replaced by the current value of the =PAM_USER item.
