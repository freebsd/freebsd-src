/**
 * The =pam_get_user function returns the name of the target user, as
 * specified to =pam_start.
 * If no user was specified, nor set using =pam_set_item, =pam_get_user
 * will prompt for a user name.
 * Either way, a pointer to the user name is stored in the location
 * pointed to by the =user argument, and the corresponding PAM item is
 * updated.
 *
 * The =prompt argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is
 * cached.
 * If it is =NULL, the =PAM_USER_PROMPT item will be used.
 * If that item is also =NULL, a hardcoded default prompt will be used.
 * Additionally, when =pam_get_user is called from a service module, the
 * prompt may be affected by module options as described below.
 * The prompt is then expanded using =openpam_subst before it is passed to
 * the conversation function.
 *
 * MODULE OPTIONS
 *
 * When called by a service module, =pam_get_user will recognize the
 * following module options:
 *
 *	;user_prompt:
 *		Prompt to use when asking for the user name.
 *		This option overrides both the =prompt argument and the
 *		=PAM_USER_PROMPT item.
 *
 * >pam_conv
 * >pam_get_item
 * >pam_get_authtok
 * >openpam_get_option
 * >openpam_subst
