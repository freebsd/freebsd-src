/**
 * The =openpam_readword function reads the next word from a file, and
 * returns it in a NUL-terminated buffer allocated with =!malloc.
 *
 * A word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
 * However, whitespace characters can be included in a word if quoted or
 * escaped according to the following rules:
 *
 *  - An unescaped single or double quote introduces a quoted string,
 *    which ends when the same quote character is encountered a second
 *    time.
 *    The quotes themselves are stripped.
 *
 *  - Within a single- or double-quoted string, all whitespace characters,
 *    including the newline character, are preserved as-is.
 *
 *  - Outside a quoted string, a backslash escapes the next character,
 *    which is preserved as-is, unless that character is a newline, in
 *    which case it is discarded and reading continues at the beginning of
 *    the next line as if the backslash and newline had not been there.
 *    In all cases, the backslash itself is discarded.
 *
 *  - Within a single-quoted string, double quotes and backslashes are
 *    preserved as-is.
 *
 *  - Within a double-quoted string, a single quote is preserved as-is,
 *    and a backslash is preserved as-is unless used to escape a double
 *    quote.
 *
 * In addition, if the first non-whitespace character on the line is a
 * hash character (#), the rest of the line is discarded.
 * If a hash character occurs within a word, however, it is preserved
 * as-is.
 * A backslash at the end of a comment does cause line continuation.
 *
 * If =lineno is not =NULL, the integer variable it points to is
 * incremented every time a quoted or escaped newline character is read.
 *
 * If =lenp is not =NULL, the length of the word (after quotes and
 * backslashes have been removed) is stored in the variable it points to.
 *
 * RETURN VALUES
 *
 * If successful, the =openpam_readword function returns a pointer to a
 * dynamically allocated NUL-terminated string containing the first word
 * encountered on the line.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for releasing the returned buffer by passing
 * it to =!free.
 *
 * If =openpam_readword reaches the end of the line or file before any
 * characters are copied to the word, it returns =NULL.  In the former
 * case, the newline is pushed back to the file.
 *
 * If =openpam_readword reaches the end of the file while a quote or
 * backslash escape is in effect, it sets :errno to =EINVAL and returns
 * =NULL.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 *
 * The parsing rules are intended to be equivalent to the normal POSIX
 * shell quoting rules.
 * Any discrepancy is a bug and should be reported to the author along
 * with sample input that can be used to reproduce the error.
