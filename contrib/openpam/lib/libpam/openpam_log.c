/**
 * The =openpam_log function logs messages using =syslog.
 * It is primarily intended for internal use by the library and modules.
 *
 * The =level argument indicates the importance of the message.
 * The following levels are defined:
 *
 *	=PAM_LOG_LIBDEBUG:
 *		Debugging messages.
 *		For internal use only.
 *	=PAM_LOG_DEBUG:
 *		Debugging messages.
 *		These messages are normally not logged unless the global
 *		integer variable :openpam_debug is set to a non-zero
 *		value, in which case they are logged with a =syslog
 *		priority of =LOG_DEBUG.
 *	=PAM_LOG_VERBOSE:
 *		Information about the progress of the authentication
 *		process, or other non-essential messages.
 *		These messages are logged with a =syslog priority of
 *		=LOG_INFO.
 *	=PAM_LOG_NOTICE:
 *		Messages relating to non-fatal errors.
 *		These messages are logged with a =syslog priority of
 *		=LOG_NOTICE.
 *	=PAM_LOG_ERROR:
 *		Messages relating to serious errors.
 *		These messages are logged with a =syslog priority of
 *		=LOG_ERR.
 *
 * The remaining arguments are a =printf format string and the
 * corresponding arguments.
 *
 * The =openpam_log function does not modify the value of :errno.
