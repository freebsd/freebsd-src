/**
 * The =pam_vprompt function constructs a string from the =fmt and =ap
 * arguments using =vsnprintf, and passes it to the given PAM context's
 * conversation function.
 *
 * The =style argument specifies the type of interaction requested, and
 * must be one of the following:
 *
 *	=PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF:
 *		Display the message and obtain the user's response without
 *		displaying it.
 *	=PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON:
 *		Display the message and obtain the user's response.
 *	=PAM_ERROR_MSG:
 *		Display the message as an error message, and do not wait
 *		for a response.
 *	=PAM_TEXT_INFO:
 *		Display the message as an informational message, and do
 *		not wait for a response.
 *
 * A pointer to the response, or =NULL if the conversation function did
 * not return one, is stored in the location pointed to by the =resp
 * argument.
 *
 * The message and response should not exceed =PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE or
 * =PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE, respectively.
 * If they do, they may be truncated.
