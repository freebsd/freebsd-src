 * dialog with the user.
 * Such applications should set =PAM_AUTHTOK to whatever authentication
 * token they've obtained on their own before calling =pam_authenticate
 * and / or =pam_chauthtok, and their PAM configuration should specify the
 * ;use_first_pass option for all modules that require access to the
 * authentication token, to make sure they use =PAM_AUTHTOK rather than
 * try to query the user.
