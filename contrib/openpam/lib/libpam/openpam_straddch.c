/**
 * The =openpam_straddch function appends a character to a dynamically
 * allocated NUL-terminated buffer, reallocating the buffer as needed.
 *
 * The =str argument points to a variable containing either a pointer to
 * an existing buffer or =NULL.
 * If the value of the variable pointed to by =str is =NULL, a new buffer
 * is allocated.
 *
 * The =size and =len argument point to variables used to hold the size
 * of the buffer and the length of the string it contains, respectively.
 *
 * The final argument, =ch, is the character that should be appended to
 * the string.  If =ch is 0, nothing is appended, but a new buffer is
 * still allocated if =str is NULL.  This can be used to "bootstrap" the
 * string.
 *
 * If a new buffer is allocated or an existing buffer is reallocated to
 * make room for the additional character, =str and =size are updated
 * accordingly.
 *
 * The =openpam_straddch function ensures that the buffer is always
 * NUL-terminated.
 *
 * If the =openpam_straddch function is successful, it increments the
 * integer variable pointed to by =len (unless =ch was 0) and returns 0.
 * Otherwise, it leaves the variables pointed to by =str, =size and =len
 * unmodified, sets :errno to =ENOMEM and returns -1.
