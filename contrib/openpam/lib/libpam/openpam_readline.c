/**
 * DEPRECATED openpam_readlinev
 *
 * The =openpam_readline function reads a line from a file, and returns it
 * in a NUL-terminated buffer allocated with =!malloc.
 *
 * The =openpam_readline function performs a certain amount of processing
 * on the data it reads:
 *
 *  - Comments (introduced by a hash sign) are stripped.
 *
 *  - Blank lines are ignored.
 *
 *  - If a line ends in a backslash, the backslash is stripped and the
 *    next line is appended.
 *
 * If =lineno is not =NULL, the integer variable it points to is
 * incremented every time a newline character is read.
 *
 * If =lenp is not =NULL, the length of the line (not including the
 * terminating NUL character) is stored in the variable it points to.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for releasing the returned buffer by passing
 * it to =!free.
