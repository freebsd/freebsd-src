		  Release notes for OpenPAM Zingiber
		  ==================================

OpenPAM is developed primarily on FreeBSD, but is expected to work on
almost any POSIX-like platform that has GNU autotools, GNU make and
the GNU compiler suite installed.

The OpenPAM distribution consists of the following components:

 - The PAM library itself, with complete API documentation.

 - Sample modules (pam_permit, pam_deny and pam_unix) and a sample
   application (su) which demonstrate how to use the PAM library.

 - A test application (pamtest) which can be used to test policies and
   modules.

 - Unit tests for limited portions of the library.

Please direct bug reports and inquiries to <des@des.dev>.
