		Release notes for OpenPAM Micrampelis
		=====================================

This release corresponds to the code used in FreeBSD HEAD as of the
release date, and is also expected to work on almost any POSIX-like
platform that has GNU autotools, GNU make and the GNU compiler suite
installed.

The library itself is complete.  Documentation exists in the form of
man pages for the library functions.  These man pages are generated by
a Perl script from specially marked-up comments in the source files
themselves, which minimizes the chance that any of them should be out
of date.

The distribution also includes three sample modules (pam_deny,
pam_permit and pam_unix) and a sample application (su).  These are not
intended for actual use, but rather to serve as examples for module or
application developers.  It also includes a command-line application
(pamtest) which can be used to test policies and modules.

Unit tests for limited portions of the library can be found in the t
subdirectory.
