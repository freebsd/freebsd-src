.Sh NAME
.Nm openpam_readline
.Nd read a line from a file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpam
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In security/pam_appl.h
.In security/openpam.h
.Ft "char *"
.Fn openpam_readline "FILE *f" "int *lineno" "size_t *lenp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function reads a line from a file, and returns it
in a NUL-terminated buffer allocated with
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
function performs a certain amount of processing
on the data it reads.
Comments (introduced by a hash sign) are stripped, as is leading and
trailing whitespace.
Any amount of linear whitespace is collapsed to a single space.
Blank lines are ignored.
If a line ends in a backslash, the backslash is stripped and the next
line is appended.
.Pp
If
.Va lineno
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the integer variable it points to is
incremented every time a newline character is read.
.Pp
If
.Va lenp
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the length of the line (not including the
terminating NUL character) is stored in the variable it points to.
.Pp
The caller is responsible for releasing the returned buffer by passing
it to
.Xr free 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
function is an OpenPAM extension.
