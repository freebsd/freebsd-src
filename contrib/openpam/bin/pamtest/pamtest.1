.Dt PAMTEST 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pamtest
.Nd PAM policy tester
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dkMPsv
.Op Fl H Ar rhost
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl T Ar timeout
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl U Ar ruser
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Ar service
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers an easy way to test PAM modules and policies from the
command line.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility loads the PAM policy specified by the
.Ar service
argument, starts a PAM transaction by calling
.Xr pam_start 3 ,
then executes the primitives specified by the remaining command-line
arguments.
Finally, it ends the transaction by calling
.Xr pam_end 3 .
.Pp
The commands are:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Cm authenticate , Cm auth
Call
.Xr pam_authenticate 3 .
.It Cm acct_mgmt , Cm account
Call
.Xr pam_acct_mgmt 3 .
.It Cm chauthtok , Cm change
Call
.Xr pam_chauthtok 3
with the
.Dv PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK
flag set.
.It Cm forcechauthtok , Cm forcechange
Call
.Xr pam_chauthtok 3
with no flags set.
.It Cm setcred , Cm establish_cred
Call
.Xr pam_setcred 3
with the
.Dv PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
flag set.
.It Cm open_session , Cm open
Call
.Xr pam_open_session 3 .
.It Cm close_session , Cm close
Call
.Xr pam_close_session 3 .
.It Cm unsetcred , Cm delete_cred
Call
.Xr pam_setcred 3
with the
.Dv PAM_DELETE_CRED
flag set.
.It Cm listenv , Cm env
Call
.Xr pam_getenvlist 3
and print the contents of the list it returns.
.El
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Enables debug messages within the OpenPAM library.
See
.Xr openpam_log 3
for details.
.It Fl H Ar rhost
Specify the name of the fictitious remote host.
The default is to use the name of the local host.
.It Fl h Ar host
Specify the name of the local host.
The default is to use the result of calling
.Xr gethostname 3 .
.It Fl k
Keep going even if one of the commands fails.
.It Fl M
Disable path, ownership and permission checks on module files.
.It Fl P
Disable service name validation and path, ownership and permission
checks on policy files.
.It Fl s
Set the
.Dv PAM_SILENT
flag when calling the
.Xr pam_authenticate 3 ,
.Xr pam_acct_mgmt 3 ,
.Xr pam_chauthok 3 ,
.Xr pam_setcred 3 ,
.Xr pam_open_session 3
and
.Xr pam_close_session 3
primitives.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
Set the conversation timeout (in seconds) for
.Xr openpam_ttyconv 3 .
.It Fl t Ar tty
Specify the name of the tty.
The default is to use the result of calling
.Xr ttyname 3 .
.It Fl U Ar ruser
Specify the name of the supplicant (remote user).
.It Fl u Ar user
Specify the name of the principal (local user).
.It Fl v
Enables debug messages from
.Nm
itself.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Simulate a typical PAM transaction using the
.Dq system
policy:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pamtest -v system auth account change setcred open close unsetcred

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page were written by
.An Dag-Erling Sm\(/orgrav Aq Mt des@des.dev .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not (yet) support setting and getting individual PAM
items or environment variables.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not afford the user complete control over the flags
passed to the
.Xr pam_authenticate 3 ,
.Xr pam_acct_mgmt 3 ,
.Xr pam_chauthok 3 ,
.Xr pam_setcred 3 ,
.Xr pam_open_session 3
and
.Xr pam_close_session 3
primitives.
