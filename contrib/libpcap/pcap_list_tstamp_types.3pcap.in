.TH PCAP_LIST_TSTAMP_TYPES 3PCAP "8 September 2019"
.SH NAME
pcap_list_tstamp_types, pcap_free_tstamp_types \- get a list of time
stamp types supported by a capture device, and free that list
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <pcap/pcap.h>

.LP
.ft B
int pcap_list_tstamp_types(pcap_t *p, int **tstamp_typesp);
void pcap_free_tstamp_types(int *tstamp_types);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pcap_list_tstamp_types ()
is used to get a list of the supported time stamp types of the interface
associated with the pcap descriptor.
.BR pcap_list_tstamp_types ()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.I *tstamp_typesp
to point to the array.
See
.BR \%pcap-tstamp (@MAN_MISC_INFO@)
for a list of all the time stamp types.
.PP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR pcap_free_tstamp_types (),
which frees the list pointed to by
.IR tstamp_types .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR pcap_list_tstamp_types ()
returns the number of time stamp types in the array on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR
on failure.
A return value of one means that the only time stamp type supported is
the one in the list, which is the capture device's default time stamp
type.  A return value of zero means that the only time stamp type
supported is
.BR PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST ,
which is the capture device's default time stamp type (only older
versions of libpcap will return that; newer versions will always return
one or more types).
If
.B PCAP_ERROR
is returned,
.BR pcap_geterr (3PCAP)
or
.BR pcap_perror (3PCAP)
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.PP
These functions became available in libpcap release 1.2.1.  In previous
releases, the time stamp type cannot be set; only the default time stamp
type offered by a capture source is available.
