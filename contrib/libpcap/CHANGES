  comparison operators, while the code generator and optimizer assumed
  signed semantics in several places.  Thanks to Charlie Slater

  by Gary Veum (veum@boa.gsfc.nasa.gov).

  don't support live package capture. This feature resulting from a
  request from Jan van Oorschot (j.p.m.voorschot@et.tudelft.nl).

- Make bpf_compile() reentrant. Fix thanks to Pascal Hennequin
  (Pascal.Hennequin@hugo.int-evry.fr).

  Johansen (fsj@csd.cri.dk).

  Resulted from report by Daniel Ehrlich (ehrlich@cse.psu.edu).

- Fix pcap-dlpi.c to work in non-promiscuous mode. Resulted from report
  by Jeff Murphy (jcmurphy@acsu.buffalo.edu).

  Bertilson (scott@unet.umn.edu).

- Workaround for problems when pcap_read() returns 0 due to the timeout
  expiring.

v0.0.4 Thu Apr 20 20:41:48 PDT 1995

- Change configuration to not use gcc v2 flags with gcc v1.

- Fixed a bug in pcap_next(); if pcap_dispatch() returns 0, pcap_next()
  should also return 0. Thanks to Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu).

- Fixed configure to test for snoop before dlpi to avoid problems under
  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

- Fix two bugs related to the Solaris pre-5.3.2 bufmod bug; handle
  savefiles that have more than snapshot bytes of data in them (so we
  can read old savefiles) and avoid writing such files.

- Added checkioctl which is used with gcc to check that the
  "fixincludes" script has been run.

v0.0.3 Tue Oct 18 18:13:46 PDT 1994

- Fixed configure to test for snoop before dlpi to avoid problems under
  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

v0.0.2 Wed Oct 12 20:56:37 PDT 1994

- Implement timeout in the dlpi pcap_open_live(). Thanks to Richard
  Stevens.

  by Mahesh Jethanandani (mahesh@npix.com).

v0.0.1 Fri Jun 24 14:50:57 PDT 1994

- Fixed bug in nit_setflags() in pcap-snit.c. The streams ioctl timeout
  wasn't being initialized sometimes resulting in an "NIOCSFLAGS:
  Invalid argument" error under OSF/1. Reported by Matt Day
  (mday@artisoft.com) and Danny Mitzel (dmitzel@whitney.hitc.com).

- Turn on FDDI support by default.
