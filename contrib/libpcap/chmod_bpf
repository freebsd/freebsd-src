# Unfortunately, macOS's devfs is based on the old FreeBSD
# one, not the current one, so there's no way to configure it
# to create BPF devices with particular owners or groups.
# This startup item will make it owned by the admin group,
# with permissions rw-rw----, so that anybody in the admin
# group can use programs that capture or send raw packets.
#
# Change this as appropriate for your site, e.g. to make
# it owned by a particular user without changing the permissions,
# so only that user and the super-user can capture or send raw
# packets, or give it the permissions rw-r-----, so that
# only the super-user can send raw packets but anybody in the
# admin group can capture packets.
