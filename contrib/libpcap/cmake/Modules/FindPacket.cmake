# FindPacket
# ==========
#
# Find the Packet library and include files.
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# Packet_INCLUDE_DIR     - absolute path to the directory containing Packet32.h.
#
# Packet_LIBRARY         - relative or absolute path to the Packet library to
#                          link with. An absolute path is will be used if the
#                          Packet library is not located in the compiler's
#                          default search path.

# Packet_FOUND           - TRUE if the Packet library *and* header are found.
#
# Hints and Backward Compatibility
# ================================
#
# To tell this module where to look, a user may set the environment variable
# Packet_ROOT to point cmake to the *root* of a directory with include and
# lib subdirectories for packet.dll (e.g WpdPack or npcap-sdk).
# Alternatively, Packet_ROOT may also be set from cmake command line or GUI
# (e.g cmake -DPacket_ROOT=C:\path\to\packet [...])
#

# The 64-bit Packet.lib is located under /x64
if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
  #
  # For the WinPcap and Npcap SDKs, the Lib subdirectory of the top-level
  # directory contains 32-bit libraries; the 64-bit libraries are in the
  # Lib/x64 directory.
  #
  # The only way to *FORCE* CMake to look in the Lib/x64 directory
  # without searching in the Lib directory first appears to be to set
  # CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE to "x64".
  #
  # In newer versions of CMake, CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set according to
  # the language, e.g., CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE. So, set the new
  # variable, CMAKE_C_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE, so that CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
  # inherits the correct value.
  #

  #ifndef _M_ARM64
  #error Not ARM64

  int main() { return 0; }
