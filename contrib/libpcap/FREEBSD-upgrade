$FreeBSD$

This directory contains virgin copies of the original distribution files
on a "vendor" branch.  Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to upgrade
the files in this directory via patches and a cvs commit.

To upgrade to a newer version of libpcap, when it is available:
	1. Unpack the new version into an empty directory.
	   [Do not make ANY changes to the files.]

	2. Use the command:
		cvs import -m 'Virgin import of LBL libpcap v<version>' \
			-I SUNOS4 -I linux-include \
			src/contrib/libpcap LBL v<version>

	   For example, to do the import of version 0.2.1, I typed:
		cvs import -m 'Virgin import of LBL libpcap v0.2.1' \
			-I SUNOS4 -I linux-include \
			src/contrib/libpcap LBL v0_2_1

	3. Follow the instructions printed out in step 2 to resolve any
	   conflicts between local FreeBSD changes and the newer version.

	4. Update the shared library version number in
	   src/lib/libpcap/Makefile as described in the
	   handbook section 18.

Do not, under any circumstances, deviate from this procedure.

To make local changes to libpcap, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the LBL branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "tcpdump-workers@tcpdump.org" for
inclusion in the next vendor release of tcpdump and libpcap.
