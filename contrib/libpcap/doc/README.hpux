For HP-UX 11i (11.11) and later, there are no known issues with
promiscuous mode under HP-UX.  If you are using a earlier version of
HP-UX and cannot upgrade, please continue reading.

HP-UX patches to fix packet capture problems

Note that packet-capture programs such as tcpdump may, on HP-UX, not be
able to see packets sent from the machine on which they're running.

   Two things:
   1. You do need a late "LAN products cumulative patch" (e.g.  PHNE_18173
  for   s700/10.20).
   2. You must use
echo 'lanc_outbound_promisc_flag/W1' | /usr/bin/adb -w /stand/vmunix /dev/kmem
     You can insert this e.g. into /sbin/init.d/lan

  Search/Read the archives ?-)

  What you are seeing is expected, un-patched, behaviour for an HP-UX
  system.  On 11.00, you need to install the latest lancommon/DLPI
  patches, and then the latest driver patch for the interface(s) in use.
  At that point, a miracle happens and you should start seeing outbound
  traffic.

[That article also mentions the patch that appears below.]

  Thanks a lot.  I have this problem on several machines running HPUX
  10.20 and 11.00.  The machines where patched up before y2k so did not
  know what to think.  Anyway I have now installed PHNE_19766,
  PHNE_19826, PHNE_20008, PHNE_20735 on the C200 and now I can see the
  outbound traffic too.  Thanks again.

(although those patches may not be the ones to install - there may be
later patches).

And another message to tcpdump-workers@tcpdump.org, from Rick Jones:

	...

  http://itrc.hp.com/ would be one place to start in a search for the most
  up-to-date patches for DLPI and the lan driver(s) used on your system (I
  cannot guess because 9000/800 is too generic - one hs to use the "model"
  command these days and/or an ioscan command (see manpage) to guess what
  the drivers (btlan[3456], gelan, etc) might be involved in addition to
  DLPI.

  Another option is to upgrade to 11i as outbound promiscuous mode support
  is there in the base OS, no patches required.

Another posting:

	https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=7d6gvn%24b3%241%40ocean.cup.hp.com

indicates that you need to install the optional STREAMS product to do
captures on HP-UX 9.x:

  : Has anyone ported tcpdump (or something similar) to HP/UX 9.x?

  I'm reasonably confident that any port of tcpdump to 9.X would require
  the (then optional) STREAMS product.  This would bring DLPI, which is
  what one uses to access interfaces in promiscuous mode.

  I'm not sure that HP even sells the 9.X STREAMS product any longer,
  since HP-UX 9.X is off the pricelist (well, maybe 9.10 for the old 68K
  devices).

  Your best bet is to be up on 10.20 or better if that is at all
  possible.  If your hardware is supported by it, I'd go with HP-UX 11.
  If you want to see the system's own outbound traffic, you'll never get
  that functionality on 9.X, but it might happen at some point for 10.20
  and 11.X.

(as per other messages cited here, the ability to see the system's own
outbound traffic did happen).

Rick Jones reports that HP-UX 11i needs no patches for outbound
promiscuous mode support.

An additional note, from Jost Martin, for HP-UX 10.20:

	Q: How do I get [Wireshark] on HPUX to capture the _outgoing_ packets
	   of an interface
	A: You need to get PHNE_20892,PHNE_20725 and PHCO_10947 (or
	   newer, this is as of 4.4.00) and its dependencies.  Then you can
	   enable the feature as described below:

	Patch Name: PHNE_20892
	Patch Description: s700 10.20 PCI 100Base-T cumulative patch
		To trace the outbound packets, please do the following
		to turn on a global promiscuous switch before running
		the promiscuous applications like snoop or tcpdump:

		adb -w /stand/vmunix /dev/mem
		lanc_outbound_promisc_flag/W 1
		(adb will echo the result showing that the flag has
		been changed)
		$quit
	(Thanks for this part to HP-support, Ratingen)

		The attached hack does this and some security-related stuff
	(thanks to hildeb@www.stahl.bau.tu-bs.de (Ralf Hildebrandt) who
	posted the security-part some time ago)

		 <<hack_ip_stack>>

		(Don't switch IP-forwarding off, if you need it !)
		Install the hack as /sbin/init.d/hacl_ip_stack (adjust
	permissions !) and make a sequencing-symlink
	/sbin/rc2.d/S350hack_ip_stack pointing to this script.
		Now all this is done on every reboot.

According to Rick Jones, the global promiscuous switch also has to be
turned on for HP-UX 11.00, but not for 11i - and, in fact, the switch
doesn't even exist on 11i.
