.SH NAME
pcap_datalink_val_to_name, pcap_datalink_val_to_description,
pcap_datalink_val_to_description_or_dlt \- get a
name or description for a link-layer header type value
.SH SYNOPSIS

.ft B
const char *pcap_datalink_val_to_name(int dlt);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_name ()
translates a link-layer header type value to the corresponding
link-layer header type name, which is the
.B DLT_
name for the link-layer header type value with the
.B DLT_
removed.
.B NULL
is returned if the type value does not correspond to a known
.B DLT_
value.
.PP
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_description ()
translates a link-layer header type value to a short description of that
link-layer header type.
.B NULL
is returned if the type value does not correspond to a known
.B DLT_
value.
.PP
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_description_or_dlt ()
translates a link-layer header type value to a short description of that
link-layer header type just like
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_description ().
If the type value does not correspond to a known
.B DLT_
value, the string "DLT n" is returned, where n is the value of
the dlt argument.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
The
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_description_or_dlt ()
function first became available in libpcap release 1.9.1.  In previous
releases,
.BR pcap_datalink_val_to_description ()
would have to be called and, if it returned
.BR NULL ,
a default string would have to be constructed.
