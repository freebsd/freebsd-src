.Sh NAME
.Nm pf
.Nd packet filter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options PFIL_HOOKS"
.Cd "device pf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Packet filtering takes place in the kernel.
A pseudo-device,
.Pa /dev/pf ,
allows userland processes to control the
behavior of the packet filter through an
.Xr ioctl 2
interface.
There are commands to enable and disable the filter, load rulesets,
add and remove individual rules or state table entries,
and retrieve statistics.
The most commonly used functions are covered by
.Xr pfctl 8 .
.Pp
Manipulations like loading a ruleset that involve more than a single
ioctl call require a so-called ticket, which prevents the occurrence of
multiple concurrent manipulations.
.Pp
Fields of ioctl parameter structures that refer to packet data (like
addresses and ports) are generally expected in network byte-order.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/pf -compact
