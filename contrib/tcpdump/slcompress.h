/*
 * Compressed packet format:
 *
 * The first octet contains the packet type (top 3 bits), TCP
 * 'push' bit, and flags that indicate which of the 4 TCP sequence
 * numbers have changed (bottom 5 bits).  The next octet is a
 * conversation number that associates a saved IP/TCP header with
 * the compressed packet.  The next two octets are the TCP checksum
 * from the original datagram.  The next 0 to 15 octets are
 * sequence number changes, one change per bit set in the header
 * (there may be no changes and there are two special cases where
 * the receiver implicitly knows what changed -- see below).
 *
 * There are 5 numbers which can change (they are always inserted
 * in the following order): TCP urgent pointer, window,
 * acknowledgement, sequence number and IP ID.  (The urgent pointer
 * is different from the others in that its value is sent, not the
 * change in value.)  Since typical use of SLIP links is biased
 * toward small packets (see comments on MTU/MSS below), changes
 * use a variable length coding with one octet for numbers in the
 * range 1 - 255 and 3 octets (0, MSB, LSB) for numbers in the
 * range 256 - 65535 or 0.  (If the change in sequence number or
 * ack is more than 65535, an uncompressed packet is sent.)
 */

/*
 * Packet types (must not conflict with IP protocol version)
 *
 * The top nibble of the first octet is the packet type.  There are
 * three possible types: IP (not proto TCP or tcp with one of the
 * control flags set); uncompressed TCP (a normal IP/TCP packet but
 * with the 8-bit protocol field replaced by an 8-bit connection id --
 * this type of packet syncs the sender & receiver); and compressed
 * TCP (described above).
 *
 * LSB of 4-bit field is TCP "PUSH" bit (a worthless anachronism) and
 * is logically part of the 4-bit "changes" field that follows.  Top
 * three bits are actual packet type.  For backward compatibility
 * and in the interest of conserving bits, numbers are chosen so the
 * IP protocol version number (4) which normally appears in this nibble
 * means "IP packet".
