.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fITcpdump\fP prints out the headers of packets on a network interface
that match the boolean \fIexpression\fP.  It can also be run with the
.B \-w
flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later
analysis, and/or with the
.B \-r
flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to
read packets from a network interface.  In all cases, only packets that
match
.I expression
will be processed by
.IR tcpdump .
.LP
.I Tcpdump
will, if not run with the
.B \-c
flag, continue capturing packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT
signal (generated, for example, by typing your interrupt character,
typically control-C) or a SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the
.BR kill (1)
command); if run with the
.B \-c
flag, it will capture packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT or
SIGTERM signal or the specified number of packets have been processed.
.LP
When
.I tcpdump
finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of:
.IP
packets ``captured'' (this is the number of packets that
.I tcpdump
has received and processed);
.IP
packets ``received by filter'' (the meaning of this depends on the OS on
which you're running
.IR tcpdump ,
and possibly on the way the OS was configured - if a filter was
specified on the command line, on some OSes it counts packets regardless
of whether they were matched by the filter expression and, even if they
were matched by the filter expression, regardless of whether
.I tcpdump
has read and processed them yet, on other OSes it counts only packets that were
matched by the filter expression regardless of whether
.I tcpdump
has read and processed them yet, and on other OSes it counts only
packets that were matched by the filter expression and were processed by
.IR tcpdump );
.IP
packets ``dropped by kernel'' (this is the number of packets that were
dropped, due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism
in the OS on which
.I tcpdump
is running, if the OS reports that information to applications; if not,
it will be reported as 0).
.LP
On platforms that support the SIGINFO signal, such as most BSDs
(including Mac OS X) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those counts
when it receives a SIGINFO signal (generated, for example, by typing
your ``status'' character, typically control-T, although on some
platforms, such as Mac OS X, the ``status'' character is not set by
default, so you must set it with
.BR stty (1)
in order to use it) and will continue capturing packets.
.LP
Reading packets from a network interface may require that you have
special privileges:
.TP
.B Under SunOS 3.x or 4.x with NIT or BPF:
You must have read access to
.I /dev/nit
or
.IR /dev/bpf* .
.TP
.B Under Solaris with DLPI:
You must have read/write access to the network pseudo device, e.g.
.IR /dev/le .
On at least some versions of Solaris, however, this is not sufficient to
allow
.I tcpdump
to capture in promiscuous mode; on those versions of Solaris, you must
be root, or
.I tcpdump
must be installed setuid to root, in order to capture in promiscuous
mode.  Note that, on many (perhaps all) interfaces, if you don't capture
in promiscuous mode, you will not see any outgoing packets, so a capture
not done in promiscuous mode may not be very useful.
.TP
.B Under HP-UX with DLPI:
You must be root or
.I tcpdump
must be installed setuid to root.
.TP
.B Under IRIX with snoop:
You must be root or
.I tcpdump
must be installed setuid to root.
.TP
.B Under Linux:
You must be root or
.I tcpdump
must be installed setuid to root (unless your distribution has a kernel
that supports capability bits such as CAP_NET_RAW and code to allow
those capability bits to be given to particular accounts and to cause
those bits to be set on a user's initial processes when they log in, in
which case you  must have CAP_NET_RAW in order to capture and
CAP_NET_ADMIN to enumerate network devices with, for example, the
.B \-D
flag).
.TP
.B Under ULTRIX and Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX:
Any user may capture network traffic with
.IR tcpdump .
However, no user (not even the super-user) can capture in promiscuous
mode on an interface unless the super-user has enabled promiscuous-mode
operation on that interface using
.IR pfconfig (8),
and no user (not even the super-user) can capture unicast traffic
received by or sent by the machine on an interface unless the super-user
has enabled copy-all-mode operation on that interface using
.IR pfconfig ,
so
.I useful
packet capture on an interface probably requires that either
promiscuous-mode or copy-all-mode operation, or both modes of
operation, be enabled on that interface.
.TP
.B Under BSD (this includes Mac OS X):
You must have read access to
.IR /dev/bpf* .
On BSDs with a devfs (this includes Mac OS X), this might involve more
than just having somebody with super-user access setting the ownership
or permissions on the BPF devices - it might involve configuring devfs
to set the ownership or permissions every time the system is booted,
if the system even supports that; if it doesn't support that, you might
have to find some other way to make that happen at boot time.
.LP
Reading a saved packet file doesn't require special privileges.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Print each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII.  Handy for
capturing web pages.
.TP
.B \-c
Exit after receiving \fIcount\fP packets.
.TP
.B \-C
Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is
currently larger than \fIfile_size\fP and, if so, close the current
savefile and open a new one.  Savefiles after the first savefile will
have the name specified with the
.B \-w
flag, with a number after it, starting at 1 and continuing upward.
The units of \fIfile_size\fP are millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes,
not 1,048,576 bytes).
.TP
.B \-d
Dump the compiled packet-matching code in a human readable form to
standard output and stop.
.TP
.B \-dd
Dump packet-matching code as a
.B C
program fragment.
.TP
.B \-ddd
Dump packet-matching code as decimal numbers (preceded with a count).
.TP
.B \-D
Print the list of the network interfaces available on the system and on
which
.I tcpdump
can capture packets.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the
.B \-i
flag to specify an interface on which to capture.
.IP
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking
.BR "ifconfig \-a" );
the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the
interface name is a somewhat complex string.
.IP
The
.B \-D
flag will not be supported if
.I tcpdump
was built with an older version of
.I libpcap
that lacks the
.B pcap_findalldevs()
function.
.TP
.B \-e
Print the link-level header on each dump line.
.TP
.B \-E
Use \fIspi@ipaddr algo:secret\fP for decrypting IPsec ESP packets that
are addressed to \fIaddr\fP and contain Security Parameter Index value
\fIspi\fP. This combination may be repeated with comma or newline seperation.
.IP
Note that setting the secret for IPv4 ESP packets is supported at this time.
.IP
Algorithms may be
\fBdes-cbc\fP,
\fB3des-cbc\fP,
\fBblowfish-cbc\fP,
\fBrc3-cbc\fP,
\fBcast128-cbc\fP, or
\fBnone\fP.
The default is \fBdes-cbc\fP.
The ability to decrypt packets is only present if \fItcpdump\fP was compiled
with cryptography enabled.
.IP
\fIsecret\fP is the ASCII text for ESP secret key. 
If preceeded by 0x, then a hex value will be read.
.IP
The option assumes RFC2406 ESP, not RFC1827 ESP.
The option is only for debugging purposes, and
the use of this option with a true `secret' key is discouraged.
By presenting IPsec secret key onto command line
you make it visible to others, via
.IR ps (1)
and other occasions.
.IP
In addition to the above syntax, the syntax \fIfile name\fP may be used
to have tcpdump read the provided file in. The file is opened upon 
receiving the first ESP packet, so any special permissions that tcpdump
may have been given should already have been given up.
.TP
.B \-f
Print `foreign' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically
(this option is intended to get around serious brain damage in
Sun's NIS server \(em usually it hangs forever translating non-local
internet numbers).
.IP
The test for `foreign' IPv4 addresses is done using the IPv4 address and
netmask of the interface on which capture is being done.  If that
address or netmask are not available, available, either because the
interface on which capture is being done has no address or netmask or
because the capture is being done on the Linux "any" interface, which
can capture on more than one interface, this option will not work
correctly.
.TP
.B \-F
Use \fIfile\fP as input for the filter expression.
An additional expression given on the command line is ignored.
.TP
.B \-i
Listen on \fIinterface\fP.
If unspecified, \fItcpdump\fP searches the system interface list for the
lowest numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback).
Ties are broken by choosing the earliest match.
.IP
On Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, an
.I interface
argument of ``any'' can be used to capture packets from all interfaces.
Note that captures on the ``any'' device will not be done in promiscuous
mode.
.IP
If the
.B \-D
flag is supported, an interface number as printed by that flag can be
used as the
.I interface
argument.
.TP
.B \-l
Make stdout line buffered.
Useful if you want to see the data
while capturing it.
E.g.,
.br
``tcpdump\ \ \-l\ \ |\ \ tee dat'' or
``tcpdump\ \ \-l \ \ > dat\ \ &\ \ tail\ \ \-f\ \ dat''.
.TP
.B \-L
List the known data link types for the interface and exit.
.TP
.B \-m
Load SMI MIB module definitions from file \fImodule\fR.
This option
can be used several times to load several MIB modules into \fItcpdump\fP.
.TP
.B \-M
Use \fIsecret\fP as a shared secret for validating the digests found in
TCP segments with the TCP-MD5 option (RFC 2385), if present.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.
.TP
.B \-N
Don't print domain name qualification of host names.
E.g.,
if you give this flag then \fItcpdump\fP will print ``nic''
instead of ``nic.ddn.mil''.
.TP
.B \-O
Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer.
This is useful only
if you suspect a bug in the optimizer.
.TP
.B \-p
\fIDon't\fP put the interface
into promiscuous mode.
Note that the interface might be in promiscuous
mode for some other reason; hence, `-p' cannot be used as an abbreviation for
`ether host {local-hw-addr} or ether broadcast'.
.TP
.B \-q
Quick (quiet?) output.
Print less protocol information so output
lines are shorter.
.TP
.B \-R
Assume ESP/AH packets to be based on old specification (RFC1825 to RFC1829).
If specified, \fItcpdump\fP will not print replay prevention field.
Since there is no protocol version field in ESP/AH specification,
\fItcpdump\fP cannot deduce the version of ESP/AH protocol.
.TP
.B \-r
Read packets from \fIfile\fR (which was created with the
.B \-w
option).
Standard input is used if \fIfile\fR is ``-''.
.TP
.B \-S
Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.
.TP
.B \-s
Snarf \fIsnaplen\fP bytes of data from each packet rather than the
default of 68 (with SunOS's NIT, the minimum is actually 96).
68 bytes is adequate for IP, ICMP, TCP
and UDP but may truncate protocol information from name server and NFS
packets (see below).
Packets truncated because of a limited snapshot
are indicated in the output with ``[|\fIproto\fP]'', where \fIproto\fP
is the name of the protocol level at which the truncation has occurred.
Note that taking larger snapshots both increases
the amount of time it takes to process packets and, effectively,
decreases the amount of packet buffering.
This may cause packets to be
lost.
You should limit \fIsnaplen\fP to the smallest number that will
capture the protocol information you're interested in.
Setting
\fIsnaplen\fP to 0 means use the required length to catch whole packets.
.TP
.B \-T
Force packets selected by "\fIexpression\fP" to be interpreted the
specified \fItype\fR.
Currently known types are
\fBaodv\fR (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector protocol),
\fBcnfp\fR (Cisco NetFlow protocol),
\fBrpc\fR (Remote Procedure Call),
\fBrtp\fR (Real-Time Applications protocol),
\fBrtcp\fR (Real-Time Applications control protocol),
\fBsnmp\fR (Simple Network Management Protocol),
\fBtftp\fR (Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
\fBvat\fR (Visual Audio Tool),
and
\fBwb\fR (distributed White Board).
.TP
.B \-t
\fIDon't\fP print a timestamp on each dump line.
.TP
.B \-tt
Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line.
.TP
.B \-ttt
Print a delta (in micro-seconds) between current and previous line
on each dump line.
.TP
.B \-tttt
Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on each dump line.
.TP
.B \-u
Print undecoded NFS handles.
.TP
.B \-U
Make output saved via the
.B \-w
option ``packet-buffered''; i.e., as each packet is saved, it will be
written to the output file, rather than being written only when the
output buffer fills.
.IP
The
.B \-U
flag will not be supported if
.I tcpdump
was built with an older version of
.I libpcap
that lacks the
.B pcap_dump_flush()
function.
.TP
.B \-v
When parsing and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output.
For example, the time to live,
identification, total length and options in an IP packet are printed.
Also enables additional packet integrity checks such as verifying the
IP and ICMP header checksum.
.IP
When writing to a file with the
.B \-w
option, report, every 10 seconds, the number of packets captured.
.TP
.B \-vv
Even more verbose output.
For example, additional fields are
printed from NFS reply packets, and SMB packets are fully decoded.
.TP
.B \-vvv
Even more verbose output.
For example,
telnet \fBSB\fP ... \fBSE\fP options
are printed in full.
With
.B \-X
Telnet options are printed in hex as well.
.TP
.B \-w
Write the raw packets to \fIfile\fR rather than parsing and printing
them out.
They can later be printed with the \-r option.
Standard output is used if \fIfile\fR is ``-''.
.TP
.B \-W
Used in conjunction with the 
.I \-C 
option, this will limit the number
of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files
from the beginning, thus creating a 'rotating' buffer. 
In addition, it will name
the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum number of
files, allowing them to sort correctly.
.TP
.B \-x
Print each packet (minus its link level header) in hex.
The smaller of the entire packet or
.I snaplen
bytes will be printed.  Note that this is the entire link-layer
packet, so for link layers that pad (e.g. Ethernet), the padding bytes
will also be printed when the higher layer packet is shorter than the
required padding.
.TP
.B \-xx
Print each packet,
.I including
its link level header, in hex.
.TP
.B \-X
Print each packet (minus its link level header) in hex and ASCII.
This is very handy for analysing new protocols.
.TP
.B \-XX
Print each packet,
.I including
its link level header, in hex and ASCII.
.TP
.B \-y
Set the data link type to use while capturing packets to \fIdatalinktype\fP.
.TP
.B \-Z
Drops privileges (if root) and changes user ID to
.I user
and the group ID to the primary group of
.IR user .
.IP
This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time.
.IP "\fI expression\fP"
.RS
selects which packets will be dumped.
If no \fIexpression\fP
is given, all packets on the net will be dumped.
Otherwise,
only packets for which \fIexpression\fP is `true' will be dumped.
.LP
The \fIexpression\fP consists of one or more
.I primitives.
Primitives usually consist of an
.I id
(name or number) preceded by one or more qualifiers.
There are three
different kinds of qualifier:
.IP \fItype\fP
qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.
Possible types are
.BR host ,
.B net ,
.B port
and
.BR portrange .
E.g., `host foo', `net 128.3', `port 20', `portrange 6000-6008'.
If there is no type
qualifier,
.B host
is assumed.
.IP \fIdir\fP
qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from
.IR id .
Possible directions are
.BR src ,
.BR dst ,
.B "src or dst"
and
.B "src and"
.BR dst .
E.g., `src foo', `dst net 128.3', `src or dst port ftp-data'.
If
there is no dir qualifier,
.B "src or dst"
is assumed.
For some link layers, such as SLIP and the ``cooked'' Linux capture mode
used for the ``any'' device and for some other device types, the
.B inbound
and
.B outbound
qualifiers can be used to specify a desired direction.
.IP \fIproto\fP
qualifiers restrict the match to a particular protocol.
Possible
protos are:
.BR ether ,
.BR fddi ,
.BR tr ,
.BR wlan ,
.BR ip ,
.BR ip6 ,
.BR arp ,
.BR rarp ,
.BR decnet ,
.BR lat ,
.BR sca ,
.BR moprc ,
.BR mopdl ,
.BR iso ,
.BR esis ,
.BR isis ,
.BR icmp ,
.BR icmp6 ,
.B tcp
and
.BR udp .
E.g., `ether src foo', `arp net 128.3', `tcp port 21', `udp portrange
7000-7009'.
If there is
no proto qualifier, all protocols consistent with the type are
assumed.
E.g., `src foo' means `(ip or arp or rarp) src foo'
(except the latter is not legal syntax), `net bar' means `(ip or
arp or rarp) net bar' and `port 53' means `(tcp or udp) port 53'.
.LP
[`fddi' is actually an alias for `ether'; the parser treats them
identically as meaning ``the data link level used on the specified
network interface.''  FDDI headers contain Ethernet-like source
and destination addresses, and often contain Ethernet-like packet
types, so you can filter on these FDDI fields just as with the
analogous Ethernet fields.
FDDI headers also contain other fields,
but you cannot name them explicitly in a filter expression.
.LP
Similarly, `tr' and `wlan' are aliases for `ether'; the previous
paragraph's statements about FDDI headers also apply to Token Ring
and 802.11 wireless LAN headers.  For 802.11 headers, the destination
address is the DA field and the source address is the SA field; the
BSSID, RA, and TA fields aren't tested.]
.LP
In addition to the above, there are some special `primitive' keywords
that don't follow the pattern:
.BR gateway ,
.BR broadcast ,
.BR less ,
.B greater
and arithmetic expressions.
All of these are described below.
.LP
More complex filter expressions are built up by using the words
.BR and ,
.B or
and
.B not
to combine primitives.
E.g., `host foo and not port ftp and not port ftp-data'.
To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.
E.g.,
`tcp dst port ftp or ftp-data or domain' is exactly the same as
`tcp dst port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain'.
.LP
Allowable primitives are:
.IP "\fBdst host \fIhost\fR"
True if the IPv4/v6 destination field of the packet is \fIhost\fP,
which may be either an address or a name.
.IP "\fBsrc host \fIhost\fR"
True if the IPv4/v6 source field of the packet is \fIhost\fP.
.IP "\fBhost \fIhost\fP
True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination of the packet is \fIhost\fP.
.IP
Any of the above host expressions can be prepended with the keywords,
\fBip\fP, \fBarp\fP, \fBrarp\fP, or \fBip6\fP as in:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether proto \fI\\ip\fB and host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
If \fIhost\fR is a name with multiple IP addresses, each address will
be checked for a match.
.IP "\fBether dst \fIehost\fP
True if the Ethernet destination address is \fIehost\fP.
\fIEhost\fP
may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a number (see
.IR ethers (3N)
for numeric format).
.IP "\fBether src \fIehost\fP
True if the Ethernet source address is \fIehost\fP.
.IP "\fBether host \fIehost\fP
True if either the Ethernet source or destination address is \fIehost\fP.
.IP "\fBgateway\fP \fIhost\fP
True if the packet used \fIhost\fP as a gateway.
I.e., the Ethernet
source or destination address was \fIhost\fP but neither the IP source
nor the IP destination was \fIhost\fP.
\fIHost\fP must be a name and
must be found both by the machine's host-name-to-IP-address resolution
mechanisms (host name file, DNS, NIS, etc.) and by the machine's
host-name-to-Ethernet-address resolution mechanism (/etc/ethers, etc.).
(An equivalent expression is
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether host \fIehost \fBand not host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which can be used with either names or numbers for \fIhost / ehost\fP.)
This syntax does not work in IPv6-enabled configuration at this moment.
.IP "\fBdst net \fInet\fR"
True if the IPv4/v6 destination address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP.
\fINet\fP may be either a name from /etc/networks
or a network number (see \fInetworks(4)\fP for details).
.IP "\fBsrc net \fInet\fR"
True if the IPv4/v6 source address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR"
True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR \fBmask \fInetmask\fR"
True if the IPv4 address matches \fInet\fR with the specific \fInetmask\fR.
May be qualified with \fBsrc\fR or \fBdst\fR.
Note that this syntax is not valid for IPv6 \fInet\fR.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR/\fIlen\fR"
True if the IPv4/v6 address matches \fInet\fR with a netmask \fIlen\fR
bits wide.
May be qualified with \fBsrc\fR or \fBdst\fR.
.IP "\fBdst port \fIport\fR"
True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a
destination port value of \fIport\fP.
The \fIport\fP can be a number or a name used in /etc/services (see
.IR tcp (4P)
and
.IR udp (4P)).
If a name is used, both the port
number and protocol are checked.
If a number or ambiguous name is used,
only the port number is checked (e.g., \fBdst port 513\fR will print both
tcp/login traffic and udp/who traffic, and \fBport domain\fR will print
both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).
.IP "\fBsrc port \fIport\fR"
True if the packet has a source port value of \fIport\fP.
.IP "\fBport \fIport\fR"
True if either the source or destination port of the packet is \fIport\fP.
.IP "\fBdst portrange \fIport1\fB-\fIport2\fR"
True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a
destination port value between \fIport1\fP and \fIport2\fP.
.I port1
and
.I port2
are interpreted in the same fashion as the
.I port
parameter for
.BR port .
.IP "\fBsrc portrange \fIport1\fB-\fIport2\fR"
True if the packet has a source port value between \fIport1\fP and
\fIport2\fP.
.IP "\fBportrange \fIport1\fB-\fIport2\fR"
True if either the source or destination port of the packet is between
\fIport1\fP and \fIport2\fP.
.IP
Any of the above port or port range expressions can be prepended with
the keywords, \fBtcp\fP or \fBudp\fP, as in:
.in +.5i

\fBtcp src port \fIport\fR
.fi
.in -.5i

\fBlen <= \fIlength\fP.
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBgreater \fIlength\fR"

\fBlen >= \fIlength\fP.
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBip proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 packet (see
.IR ip (4P))

\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or one of the names
\fBicmp\fP, \fBicmp6\fP, \fBigmp\fP, \fBigrp\fP, \fBpim\fP, \fBah\fP,
\fBesp\fP, \fBvrrp\fP, \fBudp\fP, or \fBtcp\fP.
Note that the identifiers \fBtcp\fP, \fBudp\fP, and \fBicmp\fP are also
keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\\), which is \\\\ in the C-shell.
Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.
.IP "\fBip6 proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv6 packet of protocol type \fIprotocol\fP.
Note that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.
.IP "\fBip6 protochain \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is IPv6 packet,
and contains protocol header with type \fIprotocol\fR
in its protocol header chain.
For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip6 protochain 6\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
matches any IPv6 packet with TCP protocol header in the protocol header chain.
The packet may contain, for example,
authentication header, routing header, or hop-by-hop option header,
between IPv6 header and TCP header.
The BPF code emitted by this primitive is complex and
cannot be optimized by BPF optimizer code in \fItcpdump\fP,
so this can be somewhat slow.
.IP "\fBip protochain \fIprotocol\fR"
Equivalent to \fBip6 protochain \fIprotocol\fR, but this is for IPv4.
.IP "\fBether broadcast\fR"
True if the packet is an Ethernet broadcast packet.
The \fIether\fP
keyword is optional.
.IP "\fBip broadcast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 broadcast packet.
It checks for both the all-zeroes and all-ones broadcast conventions,
and looks up the subnet mask on the interface on which the capture is
being done.
.IP
If the subnet mask of the interface on which the capture is being done
is not available, either because the interface on which capture is being
done has no netmask or because the capture is being done on the Linux
"any" interface, which can capture on more than one interface, this
check will not work correctly.
.IP "\fBether multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an Ethernet multicast packet.
The \fBether\fP
keyword is optional.
This is shorthand for `\fBether[0] & 1 != 0\fP'.
.IP "\fBip multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv4 multicast packet.
.IP "\fBip6 multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an IPv6 multicast packet.
.IP  "\fBether proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is of ether type \fIprotocol\fR.
\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or one of the names
\fBip\fP, \fBip6\fP, \fBarp\fP, \fBrarp\fP, \fBatalk\fP, \fBaarp\fP,
\fBdecnet\fP, \fBsca\fP, \fBlat\fP, \fBmopdl\fP, \fBmoprc\fP,
\fBiso\fP, \fBstp\fP, \fBipx\fP, or \fBnetbeui\fP.

True if the relation holds, where \fIrelop\fR is one of >, <, >=, <=, =,
!=, and \fIexpr\fR is an arithmetic expression composed of integer
constants (expressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary operators
[+, -, *, /, &, |, <<, >>], a length operator, and special packet data
accessors.  Note that all comparisons are unsigned, so that, for example,
0x80000000 and 0xffffffff are > 0.
To access
data inside the packet, use the following syntax:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fIproto\fB [ \fIexpr\fB : \fIsize\fB ]\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
\fIProto\fR is one of \fBether, fddi, tr, wlan, ppp, slip, link,
ip, arp, rarp, tcp, udp, icmp, ip6\fR or \fBradio\fR, and
indicates the protocol layer for the index operation.
(\fBether, fddi, wlan, tr, ppp, slip\fR and \fBlink\fR all refer to the
link layer. \fBradio\fR refers to the "radio header" added to some
802.11 captures.)
Note that \fItcp, udp\fR and other upper-layer protocol types only
apply to IPv4, not IPv6 (this will be fixed in the future).
The byte offset, relative to the indicated protocol layer, is
given by \fIexpr\fR.
\fISize\fR is optional and indicates the number of bytes in the
field of interest; it can be either one, two, or four, and defaults to one.
The length operator, indicated by the keyword \fBlen\fP, gives the
length of the packet.

For example, `\fBether[0] & 1 != 0\fP' catches all multicast traffic.
The expression `\fBip[0] & 0xf != 5\fP'
catches all IPv4 packets with options.
The expression
`\fBip[6:2] & 0x1fff = 0\fP'
catches only unfragmented IPv4 datagrams and frag zero of fragmented
IPv4 datagrams.
This check is implicitly applied to the \fBtcp\fP and \fBudp\fP
index operations.
For instance, \fBtcp[0]\fP always means the first
byte of the TCP \fIheader\fP, and never means the first byte of an
intervening fragment.

Some offsets and field values may be expressed as names rather than
as numeric values.
The following protocol header field offsets are
available: \fBicmptype\fP (ICMP type field), \fBicmpcode\fP (ICMP
code field), and \fBtcpflags\fP (TCP flags field).

The following ICMP type field values are available: \fBicmp-echoreply\fP,
\fBicmp-unreach\fP, \fBicmp-sourcequench\fP, \fBicmp-redirect\fP,
\fBicmp-echo\fP, \fBicmp-routeradvert\fP, \fBicmp-routersolicit\fP,

\fBicmp-tstampreply\fP, \fBicmp-ireq\fP, \fBicmp-ireqreply\fP,
\fBicmp-maskreq\fP, \fBicmp-maskreply\fP.

The following TCP flags field values are available: \fBtcp-fin\fP,
\fBtcp-syn\fP, \fBtcp-rst\fP, \fBtcp-push\fP,
\fBtcp-ack\fP, \fBtcp-urg\fP.

Link Level Headers
.LP
If the '-e' option is given, the link level header is printed out.
On Ethernets, the source and destination addresses, protocol,
and packet length are printed.
.LP
On FDDI networks, the  '-e' option causes \fItcpdump\fP to print
the `frame control' field,  the source and destination addresses,
and the packet length.
(The `frame control' field governs the
interpretation of the rest of the packet.
Normal packets (such
as those containing IP datagrams) are `async' packets, with a priority
value between 0 and 7; for example, `\fBasync4\fR'.
Such packets
are assumed to contain an 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) packet;
the LLC header is printed if it is \fInot\fR an ISO datagram or a
so-called SNAP packet.
.LP
On Token Ring networks, the '-e' option causes \fItcpdump\fP to print
the `access control' and `frame control' fields, the source and
destination addresses, and the packet length.
As on FDDI networks,
packets are assumed to contain an LLC packet.
Regardless of whether
the '-e' option is specified or not, the source routing information is
printed for source-routed packets.
.LP
On 802.11 networks, the '-e' option causes \fItcpdump\fP to print
the `frame control' fields, all of the addresses in the 802.11 header,

As on FDDI networks,
packets are assumed to contain an LLC packet.

\fI(N.B.: The following description assumes familiarity with
the SLIP compression algorithm described in RFC-1144.)\fP
.LP
On SLIP links, a direction indicator (``I'' for inbound, ``O'' for outbound),
packet type, and compression information are printed out.
The packet type is printed first.
The three types are \fIip\fP, \fIutcp\fP, and \fIctcp\fP.
No further link information is printed for \fIip\fR packets.
For TCP packets, the connection identifier is printed following the type.
If the packet is compressed, its encoded header is printed out.
The special cases are printed out as
\fB*S+\fIn\fR and \fB*SA+\fIn\fR, where \fIn\fR is the amount by which
the sequence number (or sequence number and ack) has changed.
If it is not a special case,
zero or more changes are printed.
A change is indicated by U (urgent pointer), W (window), A (ack),
S (sequence number), and I (packet ID), followed by a delta (+n or -n),
or a new value (=n).
Finally, the amount of data in the packet and compressed header length
are printed.
.LP
For example, the following line shows an outbound compressed TCP packet,
with an implicit connection identifier; the ack has changed by 6,
the sequence number by 49, and the packet ID by 6; there are 3 bytes of

The first line says that tcp port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet
to port \fIlogin\fP
on csam.
The \fBS\fP indicates that the \fISYN\fP flag was set.
The packet sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data.
(The notation is `first:last(nbytes)' which means `sequence
numbers \fIfirst\fP
up to but not including \fIlast\fP which is \fInbytes\fP bytes of user data'.)
There was no piggy-backed ack, the available receive window was 4096
bytes and there was a max-segment-size option requesting an mss of
1024 bytes.
.LP
Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a piggy-backed
ack for rtsg's SYN.
Rtsg then acks csam's SYN.
The `.' means no
flags were set.
The packet contained no data so there is no data sequence number.
Note that the ack sequence
number is a small integer (1).
The first time \fItcpdump\fP sees a
tcp `conversation', it prints the sequence number from the packet.
On subsequent packets of the conversation, the difference between
the current packet's sequence number and this initial sequence number
is printed.
This means that sequence numbers after the
first can be interpreted
as relative byte positions in the conversation's data stream (with the
first data byte each direction being `1').
`-S' will override this
feature, causing the original sequence numbers to be output.
.LP
On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through 20
in the rtsg \(-> csam side of the conversation).
The PUSH flag is set in the packet.
On the 7th line, csam says it's received data sent by rtsg up to
but not including byte 21.
Most of this data is apparently sitting in the
socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19 bytes smaller.
Csam also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this packet.
On the 8th and 9th lines,
csam sends two bytes of urgent, pushed data to rtsg.
.LP
If the snapshot was small enough that \fItcpdump\fP didn't capture
the full TCP header, it interprets as much of the header as it can
and then reports ``[|\fItcp\fP]'' to indicate the remainder could not
be interpreted.
If the header contains a bogus option (one with a length
that's either too small or beyond the end of the header), \fItcpdump\fP
reports it as ``[\fIbad opt\fP]'' and does not interpret any further
options (since it's impossible to tell where they start).
If the header
length indicates options are present but the IP datagram length is not
long enough for the options to actually be there, \fItcpdump\fP reports
it as ``[\fIbad hdr length\fP]''.

.RE
.PP
Now we're interested in capturing packets that have only the
SYN bit set (Step 1).
Note that we don't want packets from step 2
(SYN-ACK), just a plain initial SYN.
What we need is a correct filter
expression for \fItcpdump\fP.
.PP
Recall the structure of a TCP header without options:

A TCP header usually holds 20 octets of data, unless options are
present.
The first line of the graph contains octets 0 - 3, the
second line shows octets 4 - 7 etc.
.PP
Starting to count with 0, the relevant TCP control bits are contained
in octet 13:
.PP
.nf
 0             7|             15|             23|             31

.fi
.PP
Let's have a closer look at octet no. 13:
.PP
.nf
                |               |
                |---------------|
                |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|
                |---------------|
                |7   5   3     0|
.fi
.PP
These are the TCP control bits we are interested
in.
We have numbered the bits in this octet from 0 to 7, right to
left, so the PSH bit is bit number 3, while the URG bit is number 5.
.PP
Recall that we want to capture packets with only SYN set.
Let's see what happens to octet 13 if a TCP datagram arrives
with the SYN bit set in its header:
.PP
.nf
                |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|
                |---------------|
                |0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|
                |---------------|
                |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|
.fi
.PP
Looking at the
control bits section we see that only bit number 1 (SYN) is set.
.PP
Assuming that octet number 13 is an 8-bit unsigned integer in
network byte order, the binary value of this octet is
.IP
00000010
.PP
and its decimal representation is
.PP
.nf
   7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2  =  2
.fi
.PP
We're almost done, because now we know that if only SYN is set,
the value of the 13th octet in the TCP header, when interpreted
as a 8-bit unsigned integer in network byte order, must be exactly 2.
.PP
This relationship can be expressed as
.RS
.B
tcp[13] == 2
.RE
.PP
We can use this expression as the filter for \fItcpdump\fP in order
to watch packets which have only SYN set:
.RS
.B
tcpdump -i xl0 tcp[13] == 2
.RE
.PP
The expression says "let the 13th octet of a TCP datagram have
the decimal value 2", which is exactly what we want.
.PP
Now, let's assume that we need to capture SYN packets, but we
don't care if ACK or any other TCP control bit is set at the
same time.
Let's see what happens to octet 13 when a TCP datagram
with SYN-ACK set arrives:
.PP
.nf
     |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|
     |---------------|
     |0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0|
     |---------------|
     |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|
.fi
.PP
Now bits 1 and 4 are set in the 13th octet.
The binary value of
octet 13 is
.IP
     00010010
.PP
which translates to decimal
.PP
.nf
   7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2   = 18
.fi
.PP
Now we can't just use 'tcp[13] == 18' in the \fItcpdump\fP filter
expression, because that would select only those packets that have
SYN-ACK set, but not those with only SYN set.
Remember that we don't care
if ACK or any other control bit is set as long as SYN is set.
.PP
In order to achieve our goal, we need to logically AND the
binary value of octet 13 with some other value to preserve
the SYN bit.
We know that we want SYN to be set in any case,
so we'll logically AND the value in the 13th octet with
the binary value of a SYN:
.PP
.nf

          00010010 SYN-ACK              00000010 SYN
     AND  00000010 (we want SYN)   AND  00000010 (we want SYN)
          --------                      --------
     =    00000010                 =    00000010
.fi
.PP
We see that this AND operation delivers the same result
regardless whether ACK or another TCP control bit is set.
The decimal representation of the AND value as well as
the result of this operation is 2 (binary 00000010),
so we know that for packets with SYN set the following
relation must hold true:
.IP
( ( value of octet 13 ) AND ( 2 ) ) == ( 2 )
.PP
This points us to the \fItcpdump\fP filter expression
.RS
.B

Other protocols just dump
the protocol name (or number if no name is registered for the
protocol) and packet size.

\fBNBP packets\fP are formatted like the following examples:
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
\s-2\f(CWicsd-net.112.220 > jssmag.2: nbp-lkup 190: "=:LaserWriter@*"
jssmag.209.2 > icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: "RM1140:LaserWriter@*" 250
techpit.2 > icsd-net.112.220: nbp-reply 190: "techpit:LaserWriter@*" 186\fR\s+2
.sp .5

.RE
The first line is a name lookup request for laserwriters sent by net icsd host
112 and broadcast on net jssmag.
The nbp id for the lookup is 190.
The second line shows a reply for this request (note that it has the
same id) from host jssmag.209 saying that it has a laserwriter
resource named "RM1140" registered on port 250.
The third line is
another reply to the same request saying host techpit has laserwriter
"techpit" registered on port 186.

\fBATP packet\fP formatting is demonstrated by the following example:

Jssmag.209 initiates transaction id 12266 with host helios by requesting
up to 8 packets (the `<0-7>').
The hex number at the end of the line
is the value of the `userdata' field in the request.
.LP
Helios responds with 8 512-byte packets.
The `:digit' following the
transaction id gives the packet sequence number in the transaction
and the number in parens is the amount of data in the packet,
excluding the atp header.
The `*' on packet 7 indicates that the
EOM bit was set.
.LP
Jssmag.209 then requests that packets 3 & 5 be retransmitted.
Helios
resends them then jssmag.209 releases the transaction.
Finally,
jssmag.209 initiates the next request.
The `*' on the request
indicates that XO (`exactly once') was \fInot\fP set.

IP Fragmentation
.LP
Fragmented Internet datagrams are printed as
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
\fB(frag \fIid\fB:\fIsize\fB@\fIoffset\fB+)\fR
\fB(frag \fIid\fB:\fIsize\fB@\fIoffset\fB)\fR
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
(The first form indicates there are more fragments.
The second
indicates this is the last fragment.)
.LP
\fIId\fP is the fragment id.
\fISize\fP is the fragment
size (in bytes) excluding the IP header.
\fIOffset\fP is this
fragment's offset (in bytes) in the original datagram.
.LP
The fragment information is output for each fragment.
The first
fragment contains the higher level protocol header and the frag
info is printed after the protocol info.
Fragments
after the first contain no higher level protocol header and the
frag info is printed after the source and destination addresses.
For example, here is part of an ftp from arizona.edu to lbl-rtsg.arpa
over a CSNET connection that doesn't appear to handle 576 byte datagrams:
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
\s-2\f(CWarizona.ftp-data > rtsg.1170: . 1024:1332(308) ack 1 win 4096 (frag 595a:328@0+)
arizona > rtsg: (frag 595a:204@328)
rtsg.1170 > arizona.ftp-data: . ack 1536 win 2560\fP\s+2
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
There are a couple of things to note here:  First, addresses in the
2nd line don't include port numbers.
This is because the TCP
protocol information is all in the first fragment and we have no idea
what the port or sequence numbers are when we print the later fragments.
Second, the tcp sequence information in the first line is printed as if there
were 308 bytes of user data when, in fact, there are 512 bytes (308 in
the first frag and 204 in the second).
If you are looking for holes
in the sequence space or trying to match up acks
with packets, this can fool you.
.LP
A packet with the IP \fIdon't fragment\fP flag is marked with a
trailing \fB(DF)\fP.
.HD
Timestamps
.LP
By default, all output lines are preceded by a timestamp.
The timestamp
is the current clock time in the form
.RS
.nf
\fIhh:mm:ss.frac\fP
.fi
.RE
and is as accurate as the kernel's clock.
The timestamp reflects the time the kernel first saw the packet.
No attempt
is made to account for the time lag between when the
Ethernet interface removed the packet from the wire and when the kernel
serviced the `new packet' interrupt.

NIT doesn't let you watch your own outbound traffic, BPF will.
We recommend that you use the latter.
.LP
On Linux systems with 2.0[.x] kernels:
.IP
packets on the loopback device will be seen twice;
.IP
packet filtering cannot be done in the kernel, so that all packets must
be copied from the kernel in order to be filtered in user mode;
.IP
all of a packet, not just the part that's within the snapshot length,
will be copied from the kernel (the 2.0[.x] packet capture mechanism, if
asked to copy only part of a packet to userland, will not report the
true length of the packet; this would cause most IP packets to get an
error from
.BR tcpdump );
.IP
capturing on some PPP devices won't work correctly.
.LP
We recommend that you upgrade to a 2.2 or later kernel.
.LP
Some attempt should be made to reassemble IP fragments or, at least
to compute the right length for the higher level protocol.
.LP
Name server inverse queries are not dumped correctly: the (empty)
question section is printed rather than real query in the answer
section.
Some believe that inverse queries are themselves a bug and
prefer to fix the program generating them rather than \fItcpdump\fP.
.LP
A packet trace that crosses a daylight savings time change will give
skewed time stamps (the time change is ignored).
.LP
Filter expressions on fields other than those in Token Ring headers will
not correctly handle source-routed Token Ring packets.
.LP
Filter expressions on fields other than those in 802.11 headers will not
correctly handle 802.11 data packets with both To DS and From DS set.
.LP
.BR "ip6 proto"
should chase header chain, but at this moment it does not.
.BR "ip6 protochain"
is supplied for this behavior.
.LP
Arithmetic expression against transport layer headers, like \fBtcp[0]\fP,
does not work against IPv6 packets.
It only looks at IPv4 packets.
