.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility extracts keywords from
.Ux
manuals and indexes them in a database for fast retrieval by
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.Xr whatis 1 ,
and
.Xr man 1 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
creates a database in each
.Ar dir
using the files
.Sm off
.Sy man Ar section Li /
.Op Ar arch Li /
.Ar title . section
.Sm on
and
.Sm off
.Sy cat Ar section Li /
.Op Ar arch Li /
.Ar title . Sy 0
.Sm on
in that directory.
Existing databases are replaced.
If a directory contains no manual pages, no database is created in that
directory.
If
.Ar dir
is not provided,
.Nm
uses the default paths stipulated by
.Xr man.conf 5 .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-C file"
.It Fl a
Use all directories and files found below
.Ar dir ... .
.It Fl C Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration
.Ar file
in
.Xr man.conf 5
format.
.It Fl D
Display all files added or removed to the index.
With a second
.Fl D ,
also show all keywords added for each file.
.It Fl d Ar dir
Merge (remove and re-add)
.Ar
to the database in
.Ar dir .
.It Fl n
Do not create or modify any database; scan and parse only,
and print manual page names and descriptions to standard output.
.It Fl p
Print warnings about potential problems with manual pages
to the standard error output.
.It Fl Q
Quickly build reduced-size databases
by reading only the NAME sections of manuals.
The resulting databases will usually contain names and descriptions only.
.It Fl T Cm utf8
Use UTF-8 encoding instead of ASCII for strings stored in the databases.
.It Fl t Ar
Check the given
.Ar files
for potential problems.
Implies
.Fl a ,
.Fl n ,
and
.Fl p .
All diagnostic messages are printed to the standard output;
the standard error output is not used.
.It Fl u Ar dir
Remove
.Ar
from the database in
.Ar dir .
If that causes the database to become empty, also delete the database file.
.El
.Pp
If fatal parse errors are encountered while parsing, the offending file
is printed to stderr, omitted from the index, and the parse continues
with the next input file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MANPATH
.It Ev MANPATH
A colon-separated list of directories to create databases in.
Ignored if a
.Ar dir
argument or the
.Fl t
option is specified.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa mandoc.db
A database of manpages relative to the directory of the file.
This file is portable across architectures and systems, so long as the
manpage hierarchy it indexes does not change.
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
The default
.Xr man 1
configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It 0
No errors occurred.
.It 5
Invalid command line arguments were specified.
No input files have been read.
.It 6
An operating system error occurred, for example memory exhaustion or an
error accessing input files.
Such errors cause
.Nm
to exit at once, possibly in the middle of parsing or formatting a file.
The output databases are corrupt and should be removed.

.Ox 2.7
and in C for
.Ox 5.6 .

.Ar dir
argument first appeared in
.Nx 1.0 ;
the options
.Fl dpt
