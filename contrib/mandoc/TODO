************************************************************************

Many issues are annotated for difficulty as follows:

 - loc = locality of the issue
    *    single file issue, affects file only, or very few
    **   single module issue, affects several files of one module
    ***  cross-module issue, significantly impacts multiple modules
         and may require substantial changes to internal interfaces
 - exist = difficulty of the existing code in this area
    *    affected code is straightforward and easy to read and change
    **   affected code is somewhat complex, but once you understand
         the design, not particularly difficult to understand
    ***  affected code uses a special, exceptionally tricky design
 - algo = difficulty of the new algorithm to be written
    *    the required logic and code is straightforward
    **   the required logic is somewhat complex and needs a careful design
    ***  the required logic is exceptionally tricky,
         maybe an approach to solve that is not even known yet
 - size = the amount of code to be written or changed
    *    a small number of lines (at most 100, usually much less)
    **   a considerable amount of code (several dozen to a few hundred)
    ***  a large amount of code (many hundreds, maybe thousands)
 - imp = importance of the issue
    *    mostly for completeness
    **   would be nice to have
    ***  issue causes considerable inconvenience

Obviously, as the issues have not been solved yet, these annotations
are mere guesses, and some may be wrong.

- .if n .ce in the middle of .TS data
  afl case f1/id:000103,sig:06,src:009024+009105,op:splice,rep:2 (jes@)
  While roff_parseln() prevents .ce and similar requests in the middle
  of a tbl, the guard is no longer effective when the .ce is wrapped
  in a roff block, for example a conditional.  The resulting assertion
  has never been seen in any real-world manual page.
  This is too dangerous to fix before release because it requires
  reorganizing the very delicate internals of roff_parseln(),
  which risks causing more severe bugs.

- wrong number of layout columns in tbl(7) code generated by -T man

  feature of not explicitly specifying the last table column.

  loc **  exist ***  algo ***  size *  imp ***

- .als only works for macros in mandoc, not for user-defined strings.
  Also, the "val" field in struct roffkv would have to be replaced
  with a pointer to a reference-counted wrapper, and an alias
  would have to point to the same wrapper as the original.
  .als to undefined does nothing; the alias is not created.
  .rm'ing the original leaves the alias to point to the old value.
  .de .als .de changes both, but
  .de .als .rm .de only changes the new value, not the alias.

  loc *  exist ***  algo ***  size **  imp *

- mandoc replaces all ASCII control characters except tab and line feed
  with '?' during input.  It would be better to replace them with
  Unicode escapes in preconv_encode() or somewhere in the vicinity,
  such that the already existing better replacement strings show
  up in the output.  Emulating groff is not desirable: groff replaces
  0x00, 0x0b, and 0x0d to 0x1f with the empty string (bad because
  that's easy to overlook for the document author), 0x01 with '.'
  (very confusing), and passes through 0x02 to 0x08, 0x0c, and 0x7f
  raw (bad because that is insecure output).  Remember that 0x07 may
  need special handling because it is sometimes used for certain
  delimiters, so it may need handling *after* roff.c rather than before.
  reminded by John Gardner 16 Jun 2020 14:26:28 +1000
  Actually, more ASCII control characters than just 0x07 may need
  later handling because they can for example be used in macro names.
  So they may need handling after roff(7) processing.

  loc *  exist ***  algo **  size *  imp **

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, punctuation is handled like normal
  text, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Fl x . Ta ...' should give "-x -."

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, TERMP_IGNDELIM handling by `Pf'
  is not safe, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Pf a b .' gives "ab."
  but should give "ab ."

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

- support translated section names
  e.g. x11/scrotwm scrotwm_es.1:21:2: error: NAME section must be first
  that one uses NOMBRE because it is spanish...
  deraadt tends to think that section-dependent macro behaviour
  is a bad idea in the first place, so this may be irrelevant
  loc **  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- When there is free text in the SYNOPSIS and that free text contains
  the .Nm macro, groff somehow understands to treat the .Nm as an in-line
  macro, while mandoc treats it as a block macro and breaks the line.
  No idea how the logic for distinguishing in-line and block instances
  should be, needs investigation.

--- missing eqn features -----------------------------------------------

- In a matrix, break the output line after each matrix line.
  Found in the discussion at CDBUG 2015.  Suggested by Avi Weinstock.
  This may not be the ideal solution after all: eqn(7) matrices
  are lists of columns, so Avi's proposal would show each *column*
  on its own *line*, which is likely to cause confusion.
  A better solution, but much harder to implement, would be to
  actually show the coordinates of column vectors on different
  terminal output lines, using the clumnated output facilities
  developed for .Bl -tag, .Bl -column, and also used for tbl(7).

- Mark and lineup are parsed and ignored,

  loc **  exist **  algo **  size **  imp **

- GNU eqn converts some operators to special characters, for example,
  input HYPHEN-MINUS becomes output \(mi, unless it is part of a
  quoted word.  mandoc(1) only does this when the operator is
  surrounded by blanks, not when it is part of an unquoted word.
  Also, check whether there are more such cases (e.g., +?).

- .%T can have trailing punctuation.  Currently, it puts the trailing
  punctuation into a trailing MDOC_TEXT element inside its own scope.
  That element should rather be outside its scope, such that the
  punctuation does not get underlines.  This is not trivial to
  implement because .%T then needs some features of in_line_eoln() -
  slurp all arguments into one single text element - and one feature
  of in_line() - put trailing punctuation out of scope.
  Found in mount_nfs(8) and exports(5), search for "Appendix".

- If the *first* line after .It is .Pp, break the line right after
  the tag, do not pad with space characters before breaking.
  See the description of the a, c, and i commands in sed(1).

- If the first line after .It is .D1, do not assert a blank line
  in between, see for example tmux(1).

- Trailing punctuation after .It should trigger EOS spacing.

  Probably, this should be fixed somewhere in termp_it_pre(), not sure.

- When the -width string contains macros, the macros must be rendered
  before measuring the width, for example
    .Bl -tag -width ".Dv message"
  in magic(5), located in src/usr.bin/file, is the same
  as -width 7n, not -width 11n.
  The same applies to .Bl -column column widths;

  An easy partial fix would be to just skip the first word if it starts
  with a dot, including any following white space, when measuring.
  loc *  exist *  algo *  size *  imp ***

- The \& zero-width character counts as output.
  That is, when it is alone on a line between two .Pp,
  we want three blank lines, not two as in mandoc.
  loc **  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- Sequences of multiple man(7) paragraphs (.PP, .IP) interspersed
  with .ps and .nf/.fi produce execessive blank lines, see libJudy
  and graphics/dcmtk.  The parser reorg may help with this.

- trailing whitespace must be ignored even when followed by a font escape,
  see for example
    makes
    \fBdig \fR
    operate in batch mode
  in dig(1).

  Note that formatting is inconsistent in groff.
  .Fn Po prints "Po()", .Ar Sh prints "file ..." and no "Sh".
  Relatively hard because the relevant code is scattered
  all over mdoc_macro.c and all subtly different.

  is allowed to be so large that it is a bad idea to use it
  for sizing static buffers.  So use dynamic buffers throughout.
