.Dt CATMAN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm catman
.Nd format all manual pages below a directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm catman
.Op Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
.Op Fl T Ar output
.Ar srcdir dstdir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility assumes that all files below
.Ar srcdir
are manual pages in
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr man 7
format and formats all of them, storing the formatted versions in
the same relative paths below
.Ar dstdir .
Subdirectories of
.Ar dstdir
are created as needed.
Existing files are not explicitly deleted, but possibly overwritten.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
Override the default operating system
.Ar name
for the
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ic \&Os
and for the
.Xr man 7
.Ic TH
macro.
.It Fl T Ar output
Output format.
The
.Ar output
argument can be
.Cm ascii ,
.Cm utf8 ,
or
.Cm html ;
see
.Xr mandoc 1 .
In
.Cm html
output mode, the
.Cm fragment
output option is implied.
Other output options are not supported.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Since this version avoids
.Xr fork 2
and
.Xr exec 3
overhead and uses the much faster
.Sy mandoc
parsers and formatters rather than
.Sy groff ,
it may be about one order of magnitude faster than other
.Nm
implementations.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
Possible errors include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
missing, invalid, or excessive command line arguments
.It
failure to change the current working directory to
.Ar srcdir
.It
failure to open
.Ar dstdir
.It
communication failure with
.Xr mandocd 8
.It
resource exhaustion, for example file descriptor, process table,
or memory exhaustion
.El
.Pp
Except for memory exhaustion and similar system-level failures,
failures while trying to open, read, parse, or format individual
manual pages, to save individual formatted files to the file system,
or even to create directories do not cause
.Nm
to return an error exit status.
In such cases,
.Nm
will simply continue with the next file or subdirectory.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 1.0 .
Other, incompatible implementations appeared in
.Nx 1.0
and in
.Sy man-db No 2.2 .
.Pp
This version appeared in version 1.14.1 of the
.Sy mandoc
toolkit.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The first
.Nm
implementation was a short shell script by
.An Christoph Robitschko
in July 1993.
.Pp
The
.Nx
implementations were written by
.An J. T. Conklin Aq Mt jtc@netbsd.org
in 1993,
.An Christian E. Hopps Aq Mt chopps@netbsd.org
in 1994,
and
.An Dante Profeta Aq Mt dante@netbsd.org
in 1999; the
.Sy man-db
implementation by
.An Graeme W. Wilford
in 1994; and the
.Fx
implementations by
.An Wolfram Schneider Aq Mt wosch@freebsd.org
in 1995 and
.An John Rochester Aq Mt john@jrochester.org
in 2002.
.Pp
The concept of the present version was designed and implemented by
.An Michael Stapelberg Aq Mt stapelberg@debian.org
in 2017.
Option and argument handling and directory iteration was added by
.An Ingo Schwarze Aq Mt schwarze@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
All versions of
.Nm
are incompatible with each other because each caters to the needs
of a specific operating system, for example regarding directory
structures and file naming conventions.
.Pp
This version is more flexible than the others in so far as it does
not assume any particular directory structure or naming convention.
That flexibility comes at the price of not being able to change the
names and relative paths of the source files when reusing them to
store the formatted files, of not supporting any configuration file
formats or environment variables, and of being unable to scan for
and remove junk files in
.Ar dstdir .
.Pp
Currently,
.Nm
always reformats each page, even if the formatted version is newer
than the source version.
