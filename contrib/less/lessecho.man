[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mlessecho[24m  is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard out-
       put.  But any metacharacter in the output is preceded  by  an  "escape"
       character, which by default is a backslash.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       A summary of options is included below.

       [1m-ex    [22mSpecifies  "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for
              metachars.  If x is "-", no escape char is  used  and  arguments
              containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.

       [1m-ox    [22mSpecifies  "x",  rather  than double-quote, to be the open quote
              character, which is used if the -e- option is specified.

       [1m-cx    [22mSpecifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       [1m-pn    [22mSpecifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer.

       [1m-dn    [22mSpecifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer.

       [1m-mx    [22mSpecifies "x" to be a metachar.  By default, no  characters  are
              considered metachars.

       [1m-nn    [22mSpecifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.

       [1m-fn    [22mSpecifies  "n"  to be the escape char for metachars, as an inte-
              ger.

       [1m-a     [22mSpecifies that all arguments are to be quoted.  The  default  is
              that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted
