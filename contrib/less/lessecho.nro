.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lessecho
.I "[-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B lessecho
is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.
But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape"
character, which by default is a backslash.
.B lessecho
is invoked internally by
.BR less ,
and is not intended to be used directly by humans.

If \fIx\fP is "-", no escape char is used and arguments containing metachars
are surrounded by quotes instead.
