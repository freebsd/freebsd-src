For the import files and directories were pruned by:

	tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -zxf hostapd-0.5.8.tar.gz

then imported by:

	cvs import -m 'Import of hostapd 0.5.8' \
		src/contrib/hostapd MALINEN v0_5_8

To make local changes to hostapd, simply patch and commit to the
main branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor
(MALINEN) branch.

All local changes should be submitted to Jouni Malinen for inclusion in
the next vendor release.
