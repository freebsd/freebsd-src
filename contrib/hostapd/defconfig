# Example hostapd build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# hostapd binary. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out complete, if they are not to be included, i.e.,
# just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cass, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.
