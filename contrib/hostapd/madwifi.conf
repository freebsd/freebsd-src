##### Integrated EAP server ###################################################

# Optionally, hostapd can be configured to use an integrated EAP server
# to process EAP authentication locally without need for an external RADIUS
# server. This functionality can be used both as a local authentication server
# for IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL and as a RADIUS server for other devices.

# Use integrated EAP server instead of external RADIUS authentication
# server. This is also needed if hostapd is configured to act as a RADIUS
# authentication server.

# Private key matching with the server certificate for EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS
# This may point to the same file as server_cert if both certificate and key
# are included in a single file. PKCS#12 (PFX) file (.p12/.pfx) can also be
# used by commenting out server_cert and specifying the PFX file as the
# private_key.

# Enable CRL verification.
# Note: hostapd does not yet support CRL downloading based on CDP. Thus, a

# This can be done by using PEM format for CA certificate and CRL and
# concatenating these into one file. Whenever CRL changes, hostapd needs to be
# restarted to take the new CRL into use.

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either

# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)

# WPA pre-shared keys for WPA-PSK. This can be either entered as a 256-bit
# secret in hex format (64 hex digits), wpa_psk, or as an ASCII passphrase
# (8..63 characters) that will be converted to PSK. This conversion uses SSID
# so the PSK changes when ASCII passphrase is used and the SSID is changed.
