@section Relocations
BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains
symbols: they are left alone until required, then read in
en-masse and translated into an internal form.  A common
routine @code{bfd_perform_relocation} acts upon the
canonical form to do the fixup.

Relocations are maintained on a per section basis,
while symbols are maintained on a per BFD basis.

All that a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create
a @code{struct reloc_cache_entry} for each relocation
in a particular section, and fill in the right bits of the structures.

This is the structure of a relocation entry:

@} arelent;
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Here is a description of each of the fields within an @code{arelent}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{sym_ptr_ptr}
@end itemize
The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
associated with the relocation request.  It is
the pointer into the table returned by the back end's
@code{get_symtab} action. @xref{Symbols}. The symbol is referenced
through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like the linker
can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only
one pointer. The relocation routine looks in the symbol and
uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to and the
value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the
symbol pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{address}
@end itemize
The @code{address} field gives the offset in bytes from the base of
the section data which owns the relocation record to the first
byte of relocatable information. The actual data relocated
will be relative to this point; for example, a relocation
type which modifies the bottom two bytes of a four byte word
would not touch the first byte pointed to in a big endian
world.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{addend}
@end itemize
The @code{addend} is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)
to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon
the howto. For example, on the 68k the code:

@example
        char foo[];
        main()
                @{
                return foo[0x12345678];
                @}
@end example

Could be compiled into:

@example
        linkw fp,#-4
        moveb @@#12345678,d0
        extbl d0
        unlk fp
        rts
@end example

This could create a reloc pointing to @code{foo}, but leave the
offset in the data, something like:

@example
RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
offset   type      value
00000006 32        _foo

00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @@#12345678,d0
0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
0000000e 4e75               ; rts
@end example

Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough
space in them to represent the full address range, and
pointers have to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:

@example
        or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
        ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
        jmp      r1
@end example

This should create two relocs, both pointing to @code{_foo}, and with
0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:

@example
RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
offset   type      value
00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1
@end example

The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds
it to the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the
value of @code{_foo}. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around
somewhere, to cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The
sparc has a similar problem to the 88k, in that some
instructions don't have room for an entire offset, but on the
sparc the parts are created in odd sized lumps. The designers of
the a.out format chose to not use the data within the section
for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept within
the reloc. Anything in the data should be ignored.

@example
        save %sp,-112,%sp
        sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
        ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
        ret
        restore
@end example

Both relocs contain a pointer to @code{foo}, and the offsets
contain junk.

@example
RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
offset   type      value
00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678

00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
00000010 81e80000     ; restore
@end example

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{howto}
@end itemize
The @code{howto} field can be imagined as a
relocation instruction. It is a pointer to a structure which
contains information on what to do with all of the other
information in the reloc record and data section. A back end
would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input -
but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

@subsubsection @code{enum complain_overflow}
Indicates what sort of overflow checking should be done when
performing a relocation.


@example

enum complain_overflow
@{
       /* Do not complain on overflow. */
  complain_overflow_dont,

       /* Complain if the bitfield overflows, whether it is considered
          as signed or unsigned. */
  complain_overflow_bitfield,

       /* Complain if the value overflows when considered as signed
          number. */
  complain_overflow_signed,

       /* Complain if the value overflows when considered as an
          unsigned number. */

@subsubsection @code{reloc_howto_type}
The @code{reloc_howto_type} is a structure which contains all the
information that libbfd needs to know to tie up a back end's data.

          addend is recorded with the section contents; when performing a

If @var{output_bfd} is supplied to this function, the
generated image will be relocatable; the relocations are
copied to the output file after they have been changed to
reflect the new state of the world. There are two ways of
reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file:
by modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the
relocation record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and
basic coff) have no way of specifying an addend in the
relocation type, so the addend has to go in the output data.
This is no big deal since in these formats the output data
slot will always be big enough for the addend. Complex reloc
types with addends were invented to solve just this problem.
The @var{error_message} argument is set to an error message if
this return @code{bfd_reloc_dangerous}.

@end deffn
@deffn {} BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol or
"addend" in some special way.
For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp") relocations, the symbol is ignored when
writing; when reading, it will be the absolute section symbol.  The
addend is the displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from
the "ldah" instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).
@end deffn
@deffn {} BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
reading, for convenience.
@end deffn

@deffn {} BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
@deffnx {} BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_ELF_LITERAL
@deffnx {} BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol reference;
the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load the address of
the symbol, and then fills in a register in the real instruction.

The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction, refers to the .lita
section symbol.  The addend is ignored when writing, but is filled
in with the file's GP value on reading, for convenience, as with the
GPDISP_LO16 reloc.

The ELF_LITERAL reloc is somewhere between 16_GOTOFF and GPDISP_LO16.
It should refer to the symbol to be referenced, as with 16_GOTOFF,
but it generates output not based on the position within the .got
section, but relative to the GP value chosen for the file during the
final link stage.

The LITUSE reloc, on the instruction using the loaded address, gives
information to the linker that it might be able to use to optimize
away some literal section references.  The symbol is ignored (read
as the absolute section symbol), and the "addend" indicates the type
of instruction using the register:
1 - "memory" fmt insn
2 - byte-manipulation (byte offset reg)
3 - jsr (target of branch)

The GNU linker currently doesn't do any of this optimizing.

@deffn {} BFD_RELOC_VTABLE_INHERIT
@deffnx {} BFD_RELOC_VTABLE_ENTRY
These two relocations are used by the linker to determine which of
the entries in a C++ virtual function table are actually used.  When
the --gc-sections option is given, the linker will zero out the entries
that are not used, so that the code for those functions need not be
included in the output.

VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
linker the inheritence tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
relocation should be located at the child vtable.

VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of a
virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer to the
table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that base, an offset
describes the entry that is being used.  For Rela hosts, this offset
is stored in the reloc's addend.  For Rel hosts, we are forced to put
this offset in the reloc's section offset.
