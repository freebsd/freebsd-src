To get a copy of the Binutils source from the Sourceware CVS repository
this command line was used:

	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src login
	#	password is "anoncvs"

	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src \
		co -rbinutils-2_10-branch -l src
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src \
		co -rbinutils-2_10-branch \
		src/bfd src/binutils src/config src/etc src/gas src/include \
		src/ld src/libiberty src/opcodes


To strip down a new version of GNU binutils for import (starting with a
checked out copy from the Sourceware anoncvs repo), prune files like this:

	for F in `cat FREEBSD-deletelist`
		do find . -name "$F" -exec rm -rfv {} \; 
	done

This command should be repeated until no files are shown as being deleted.

If you decide to bring in more of the files, import them -- don't use
``cvs add''.  And please remember to adjust the contents of "FREEBSD-Xlist"
and "FREEBSD-deletelist" so that it reflects what is really imported from
the vendor.


The vendor import was done by:

	cvs import src/contrib/binutils GNU \
		sourceware_binutils-2_10-branch_anoncvs_20000512


Note that many of the files generated by GNU configure are present pre-built
in the "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils" tree.  These can be regenerated for a new
version of binutils by running the "update.sh" script in that directory.

When upgrading to a new version, you also need to update the VERSION
definition in "src/gnu/usr.bin/binutils/Makefile.inc0".
