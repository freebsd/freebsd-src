LibDOM -- an implementation of the W3C DOM
==========================================

Overview
--------

  LibDOM is an implementation of the W3C DOM API in C.

Requirements
------------

  libdom requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Perl (for the testcases)

  LibDOM also requires the following libraries to be installed:

    +  LibParserUtils
    +  LibWapcaplet

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the library is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
