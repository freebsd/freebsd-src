  Build Instructions for GTK NetSurf                             16 March 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides instructions for building the GTK version of NetSurf
  and provides guidance on obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies.

  GTK NetSurf has been tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora 8, FreeBSD, NetBSD and
  Solaris 10.  NetSurf requires at minimum GTK 2.12.


  Quick Start
=============

  See the QUICK-START document, which provides a simple environment with
  which you can fetch, build and install NetSurf and its dependencies.

  The QUICK-START is the recommended way to build NetSurf.


  Manual building
=================

  If you can't follow the quick start instructions, you will have to build
  NetSurf manually.  The instructions for doing this are given below.


  Obtaining the build dependencies
----------------------------------

  Many of NetSurf's dependencies are packaged on various operating systems.
  The remainder must be installed manually.  Currently, some of the libraries
  developed as part of the NetSurf project have not had official releases.
  Hopefully they will soon be released with downloadable tarballs and packaged
  in common distros.  For now, you'll have to make do with Git checkouts.

  Package installation
  --------------------

  Debian-like OS:

      $ apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libcurl3-dev libpng-dev 
      $ apt-get install librsvg2-dev libjpeg-dev

  If you want to build with gtk 3 replace libgtk2.0-dev with libgtk-3-dev 

  Recent OS versions might need libcurl4-dev instead of libcurl3-dev but
  note that when it has not been built with OpenSSL, the SSL_CTX is not
  available and results that certification details won't be presented in case
  they are invalid.  But as this is currently unimplemented in the GTK
  flavour of NetSurf, this won't make a difference at all.

  For experimental javascript support the mozilla spiermonkey library
  is required:

      $ apt-get install libmozjs-dev

  Fedora:

      $ yum install curl-devel libpng-devel
      $ yum install librsvg2-devel expat-devel

  Other:

  You'll need to install the development resources for libglade2, libcurl3,
  libpng and librsvg.

  Libharu
  -------

  NetSurf can use Haru PDF to enable PDF export.  Haru PDF can be obtained
  from http://libharu.org/.  We require libharu 2.2 or later.

  | Note: libharu cannot be auto-detected by the Makefile.  If you wish to
  |       enable it, do so by creating a Makefile.config file.


  Preparing your workspace
--------------------------

  NetSurf has a number of libraries which must be built in-order and
  installed into your workspace. Each library depends on a core build
  system which NetSurf projects use. This build system relies on the
  presence of things like pkg-config to find libraries and also certain
  environment variables in order to work correctly.

  Assuming you are preparing a workspace in /home/netsurf/workspace then
  the following steps will set you up:

  Make the workspace directory and change to it
  ---------------------------------------------

  $ mkdir -p ${HOME}/netsurf/workspace
  $ cd ${HOME}/netsurf/workspace

  Make the temporary install space
  --------------------------------

  $ mkdir inst

  Make an environment script
  --------------------------
  $ cat > env.sh <<'EOF'
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${HOME}/netsurf/workspace/inst/lib/pkgconfig::
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/netsurf/workspace/inst/lib
    export PREFIX=${HOME}/netsurf/workspace/inst
    EOF

  Change to workspace and source the environment
  ----------------------------------------------

  Whenever you wish to start development in a new shell, run the following:

  $ cd ${HOME}/netsurf/workspace
  $ source env.sh

  From here on, any commands in this document assume you have sourced your
  shell environment.


  The NetSurf project's libraries
---------------------------------

  The NetSurf project has developed several libraries which are required by
  the browser. These are:

  BuildSystem     --  Shared build system, needed to build the other libraries
  LibParserUtils  --  Parser building utility functions
  LibWapcaplet    --  String internment
  Hubbub          --  HTML5 compliant HTML parser
  LibCSS          --  CSS parser and selection engine
  LibNSGIF        --  GIF format image decoder
  LibNSBMP        --  BMP and ICO format image decoder
  LibROSprite     --  RISC OS Sprite format image decoder

  To fetch each of these libraries, run the appropriate commands from the
  Docs/LIBRARIES file, from within your workspace directory.

  To build and install these libraries, simply enter each of their directories
  and run:
  
      $ make install

  | Note: We advise enabling iconv() support in libparserutils, which vastly
  |       increases the number of supported character sets.  To do this,
  |       create a file called Makefile.config.override in the libparserutils
  |       directory, containing the following line:
  |
  |           CFLAGS += -DWITH_ICONV_FILTER
  |
  |       For more information, consult the libparserutils README file.

  Now you should have all the NetSurf project libraries built and installed.


  Getting the NetSurf source
----------------------------

  From your workspace directory, run the following command to get the NetSurf
  source:

     $ git clone git://git.netsurf-browser.org/netsurf.git

  And change to the 'netsurf' directory:

     $ cd netsurf

  Building and executing NetSurf
--------------------------------

  First of all, you should examine the contents of Makefile.defaults
  and enable and disable relevant features as you see fit by creating
  a Makefile.config file.  Some of these options can be automatically
  detected and used, and where this is the case they are set to such.
  Others cannot be automatically detected from the Makefile, so you
  will either need to install the dependencies, or set them to NO.

  You should then obtain NetSurf's dependencies, keeping in mind which options
  you have enabled in the configuration file.  See the next section for
  specifics.

  Once done, to build GTK NetSurf on a UNIX-like platform, simply run:

      $ make

  If that produces errors, you probably don't have some of NetSurf's
  build dependencies installed. See "Obtaining NetSurf's dependencies"
  below. Or turn off the complaining features in a Makefile.config
  file. You may need to "make clean" before attempting to build after
  installing the dependencies.

  Run NetSurf by executing the "test-nsgtk" shell script:

      $ ./test-nsgtk

  This script makes it easy to run the nsgtk binary from the build tree. It
  sets up some environment variables which enable NetSurf to find its
  resources.


  Note for packagers
====================

  If you are packaging NetSurf, see the PACKAGING-GTK document.
