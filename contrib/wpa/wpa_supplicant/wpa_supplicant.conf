##### Example wpa_supplicant configuration file ###############################
#
# This file describes configuration file format and lists all available option.
# Please also take a look at simpler configuration examples in 'examples'
# subdirectory.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

# NOTE! This file may contain password information and should probably be made
# readable only by root user on multiuser systems.

# Note: All file paths in this configuration file should use full (absolute,
# not relative to working directory) path in order to allow working directory
# to be changed. This can happen if wpa_supplicant is run in the background.

# Whether to allow wpa_supplicant to update (overwrite) configuration
#
# This option can be used to allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration
# file whenever configuration is changed (e.g., new network block is added with
# wpa_cli or wpa_gui, or a password is changed). This is required for
# wpa_cli/wpa_gui to be able to store the configuration changes permanently.
# Please note that overwriting configuration file will remove the comments from
# it.
#update_config=1

# global configuration (shared by all network blocks)
#
# Parameters for the control interface. If this is specified, wpa_supplicant
# will open a control interface that is available for external programs to
# manage wpa_supplicant. The meaning of this string depends on which control
# interface mechanism is used. For all cases, the existence of this parameter
# in configuration is used to determine whether the control interface is
# enabled.
#
# For UNIX domain sockets (default on Linux and BSD): This is a directory that
# will be created for UNIX domain sockets for listening to requests from
# external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and configuration.
# The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so multiple
# wpa_supplicant processes can be run at the same time if more than one
# interface is used.
# /var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended directory for sockets and by
# default, wpa_cli will use it when trying to connect with wpa_supplicant.
#
# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the
# directory to allow only members of a group to use sockets. This way, it is
# possible to run wpa_supplicant as root (since it needs to change network
# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, wpa_supplicant is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the control interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group. If this variable is commented out or
# not included in the configuration file, group will not be changed from the
# value it got by default when the directory or socket was created.
#
# When configuring both the directory and group, use following format:
# DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wheel
# DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=0
# (group can be either group name or gid)
#
# For UDP connections (default on Windows): The value will be ignored. This
# variable is just used to select that the control interface is to be created.
# The value can be set to, e.g., udp (ctrl_interface=udp)
#
# For Windows Named Pipe: This value can be used to set the security descriptor
# for controlling access to the control interface. Security descriptor can be
# set using Security Descriptor String Format (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/
# library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/
# security_descriptor_string_format.asp). The descriptor string needs to be
# prefixed with SDDL=. For example, ctrl_interface=SDDL=D: would set an empty
# DACL (which will reject all connections). See README-Windows.txt for more
# information about SDDL string format.
#
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version
# wpa_supplicant is implemented based on IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 which defines
# EAPOL version 2. However, there are many APs that do not handle the new
# version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely). In order
# to make wpa_supplicant interoperate with these APs, the version number is set
# to 1 by default. This configuration value can be used to set it to the new
# version (2).
# Note: When using MACsec, eapol_version shall be set to 3, which is
# defined in IEEE Std 802.1X-2010.
eapol_version=1

# AP scanning/selection
# By default, wpa_supplicant requests driver to perform AP scanning and then
# uses the scan results to select a suitable AP. Another alternative is to
# allow the driver to take care of AP scanning and selection and use
# wpa_supplicant just to process EAPOL frames based on IEEE 802.11 association
# information from the driver.
# 1: wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection; if no APs matching to
#    the currently enabled networks are found, a new network (IBSS or AP mode
#    operation) may be initialized (if configured) (default)
# 0: This mode must only be used when using wired Ethernet drivers
#    (including MACsec).
# 2: like 0, but associate with APs using security policy and SSID (but not
#    BSSID); this can be used, e.g., with ndiswrapper and NDIS drivers to
#    enable operation with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; in this mode,
#    the network blocks in the configuration file are tried one by one until
#    the driver reports successful association; each network block should have
#    explicit security policy (i.e., only one option in the lists) for
#    key_mgmt, pairwise, group, proto variables
# Note: ap_scan=0/2 should not be used with the nl80211 driver interface (the
# current Linux interface). ap_scan=1 is the only option working with nl80211.
# For finding networks using hidden SSID, scan_ssid=1 in the network block can
# be used with nl80211.
# When using IBSS or AP mode, ap_scan=2 mode can force the new network to be
# created immediately regardless of scan results. ap_scan=1 mode will first try
# to scan for existing networks and only if no matches with the enabled
# networks are found, a new IBSS or AP mode network is created.
ap_scan=1

# Whether to force passive scan for network connection
#
# By default, scans will send out Probe Request frames on channels that allow
# active scanning. This advertise the local station to the world. Normally this
# is fine, but users may wish to do passive scanning where the radio should only
# listen quietly for Beacon frames and not send any Probe Request frames. Actual
# functionality may be driver dependent.
#
# This parameter can be used to force only passive scanning to be used
# for network connection cases. It should be noted that this will slow
# down scan operations and reduce likelihood of finding the AP. In
# addition, some use cases will override this due to functional
# requirements, e.g., for finding an AP that uses hidden SSID
# (scan_ssid=1) or P2P device discovery.
#
# 0:  Do normal scans (allow active scans) (default)
# 1:  Do passive scans.
#passive_scan=0

# MPM residency
# By default, wpa_supplicant implements the mesh peering manager (MPM) for an
# open mesh. However, if the driver can implement the MPM, you may set this to
# 0 to use the driver version. When AMPE is enabled, the wpa_supplicant MPM is
# always used.
# 0: MPM lives in the driver
# 1: wpa_supplicant provides an MPM which handles peering (default)
#user_mpm=1

# Maximum number of peer links (0-255; default: 99)
# Maximum number of mesh peering currently maintained by the STA.
#max_peer_links=99

# Timeout in seconds to detect STA inactivity (default: 300 seconds)
#
# This timeout value is used in mesh STA to clean up inactive stations.
#mesh_max_inactivity=300

# Enable 802.11s layer-2 routing and forwarding (dot11MeshForwarding)
#mesh_fwding=1

# cert_in_cb - Whether to include a peer certificate dump in events
# This controls whether peer certificates for authentication server and
# its certificate chain are included in EAP peer certificate events. This is
# enabled by default.
#cert_in_cb=1

# EAP fast re-authentication
# By default, fast re-authentication is enabled for all EAP methods that
# support it. This variable can be used to disable fast re-authentication.
# Normally, there is no need to disable this.
fast_reauth=1

# OpenSSL Engine support
# These options can be used to load OpenSSL engines in special or legacy
# modes.
# The two engines that are supported currently are shown below:
# They are both from the opensc project (http://www.opensc.org/)
# By default the PKCS#11 engine is loaded if the client_cert or
# private_key option appear to be a PKCS#11 URI, and these options
# should not need to be used explicitly.

# OpenSSL cipher string
#
# This is an OpenSSL specific configuration option for configuring the default
# ciphers. If not set, the value configured at build time ("DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW"
# by default) is used.
# See https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html for OpenSSL documentation
# on cipher suite configuration. This is applicable only if wpa_supplicant is
# built to use OpenSSL.
#openssl_ciphers=DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW

# Dynamic EAP methods

# Default is 2.
#bss_expiration_scan_count=2

# Automatic scan
# This is an optional set of parameters for automatic scanning
# within an interface in following format:
#autoscan=<autoscan module name>:<module parameters>
# autoscan is like bgscan but on disconnected or inactive state.
# For instance, on exponential module parameters would be <base>:<limit>
#autoscan=exponential:3:300
# Which means a delay between scans on a base exponential of 3,
# up to the limit of 300 seconds (3, 9, 27 ... 300)
# For periodic module, parameters would be <fixed interval>
#autoscan=periodic:30
# So a delay of 30 seconds will be applied between each scan.
# Note: If sched_scan_plans are configured and supported by the driver,
# autoscan is ignored.

# filter_ssids - SSID-based scan result filtering
# 0 = do not filter scan results (default)
# 1 = only include configured SSIDs in scan results/BSS table
#filter_ssids=0

# Password (and passphrase, etc.) backend for external storage
# format: <backend name>[:<optional backend parameters>]
# Test backend which stores passwords in memory. Should only be used for
# development purposes.
#ext_password_backend=test:pw1=password|pw2=testing
# File-based backend which reads passwords from a file. The parameter
# identifies the file to read passwords from. The password file follows the
# format of wpa_supplicant.conf and accepts simple `key=passphrase` formatted
# passwords.
#ext_password_backend=file:/path/to/passwords.conf


# Disable P2P functionality
# p2p_disabled=1

# Timeout in seconds to detect STA inactivity (default: 300 seconds)
#
# This timeout value is used in P2P GO mode to clean up
# inactive stations.
#p2p_go_max_inactivity=300

# Passphrase length (8..63) for P2P GO
#
# This parameter controls the length of the random passphrase that is
# generated at the GO. Default: 8.
#p2p_passphrase_len=8

# Extra delay between concurrent P2P search iterations
#
# This value adds extra delay in milliseconds between concurrent search
# iterations to make p2p_find friendlier to concurrent operations by avoiding
# it from taking 100% of radio resources. The default value is 500 ms.
#p2p_search_delay=500

# Opportunistic Key Caching (also known as Proactive Key Caching) default
# This parameter can be used to set the default behavior for the
# proactive_key_caching parameter. By default, OKC is disabled unless enabled
# with the global okc=1 parameter or with the per-network
# proactive_key_caching=1 parameter. With okc=1, OKC is enabled by default, but
# can be disabled with per-network proactive_key_caching=0 parameter.
#okc=0

# Protected Management Frames default
# This parameter can be used to set the default behavior for the ieee80211w
# parameter for RSN networks. By default, PMF is disabled unless enabled with
# the global pmf=1/2 parameter or with the per-network ieee80211w=1/2 parameter.
# With pmf=1/2, PMF is enabled/required by default, but can be disabled with the
# per-network ieee80211w parameter. This global default value does not apply
# for non-RSN networks (key_mgmt=NONE) since PMF is available only when using
# RSN.
#pmf=0

# sae_check_mfp: Require PMF support to select SAE key_mgmt
# 0 = Do not check PMF for SAE (default)
# 1 = Limit SAE when PMF is not enabled
#
# When enabled SAE will not be selected if PMF will not be used
# for the connection.
# Scenarios where this check will limit SAE:
#  1) ieee80211w=0 is set for the network
#  2) The AP does not have PMF enabled.
#  3) ieee80211w is unset, pmf=1 is enabled globally, and
#     the device does not support the BIP cipher.
# Consider the configuration of global parameterss sae_check_mfp=1, pmf=1 and a
# network configured with ieee80211w unset and key_mgmt=SAE WPA-PSK.
# In the example WPA-PSK will be used if the device does not support
# the BIP cipher or the AP has PMF disabled.
# Limiting SAE with this check can avoid failing to associate to an AP
# that is configured with sae_requires_mfp=1 if the device does
# not support PMF due to lack of the BIP cipher.
#
# Enabling this check helps with compliance of the WPA3
# specification for WPA3-Personal transition mode.
# The WPA3 specification section 2.3 "WPA3-Personal transition mode" item 8
# states "A STA shall negotiate PMF when associating to an AP using SAE".
# With this check WPA3 capable devices when connecting
# to transition mode APs that do not advertise PMF support
# will not use SAE and instead fallback to PSK.
#sae_check_mfp=0

# Enabled SAE finite cyclic groups in preference order
# By default (if this parameter is not set), the mandatory group 19 (ECC group
# defined over a 256-bit prime order field, NIST P-256) is preferred and groups
# 20 (NIST P-384) and 21 (NIST P-521) are also enabled. If this parameter is
# set, the groups will be tried in the indicated order.
# The group values are listed in the IANA registry:
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipsec-registry/ipsec-registry.xml#ipsec-registry-9
# Note that groups 1, 2, 5, 22, 23, and 24 should not be used in production
# purposes due limited security (see RFC 8247). Groups that are not as strong as

# client_cert: File path to client certificate file (PEM/DER)
#	This field is used with Interworking networking selection for a case
#	where client certificate/private key is used for authentication
#	(EAP-TLS). Full path to the file should be used since working
#	directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#
#	Certificates from PKCS#11 tokens can be referenced by a PKCS#11 URI.
#
#	For example: private_key="pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01"
#
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting
#	this to blob://blob_name.
#
# private_key: File path to client private key file (PEM/DER/PFX)
#	When PKCS#12/PFX file (.p12/.pfx) is used, client_cert should be
#	commented out. Both the private key and certificate will be read
#	from the PKCS#12 file in this case. Full path to the file should be
#	used since working directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run
#	in the background.
#
#	Keys in PKCS#11 tokens can be referenced by a PKCS#11 URI.
#	For example: private_key="pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01"
#
#	Windows certificate store can be used by leaving client_cert out and
#	configuring private_key in one of the following formats:
#
#	cert://substring_to_match
#
#	hash://certificate_thumbprint_in_hex
#
#	For example: private_key="hash://63093aa9c47f56ae88334c7b65a4"
#
#	Note that when running wpa_supplicant as an application, the user
#	certificate store (My user account) is used, whereas computer store
#	(Computer account) is used when running wpasvc as a service.
#
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting
#	this to blob://blob_name.

#
# eap: Pre-configured EAP method
#	This optional field can be used to specify which EAP method will be

#	This optional field can be used to configure preferences between roaming
#	partners. The field is a string in following format:
#	<FQDN>,<0/1 exact match>,<priority>,<* or country code>
#	(non-exact match means any subdomain matches the entry; priority is in

#
# update_identifier: PPS MO ID
#	(Hotspot 2.0 PerProviderSubscription/UpdateIdentifier)
#
# provisioning_sp: FQDN of the SP that provisioned the credential

#
# Minimum backhaul threshold (PPS/<X+>/Policy/MinBackhauldThreshold/*)
#	These fields can be used to specify minimum download/upload backhaul

# Scheduled scan plans
#
# A space delimited list of scan plans. Each scan plan specifies the scan
# interval and number of iterations, delimited by a colon. The last scan plan
# will run infinitely and thus must specify only the interval and not the number
# of iterations.
#
# The driver advertises the maximum number of scan plans supported. If more scan
# plans than supported are configured, only the first ones are set (up to the
# maximum supported). The last scan plan that specifies only the interval is
# always set as the last plan.
#
# If the scan interval or the number of iterations for a scan plan exceeds the
# maximum supported, it will be set to the maximum supported value.
#
# Format:
# sched_scan_plans=<interval:iterations> <interval:iterations> ... <interval>
#
# Example:
# sched_scan_plans=10:100 20:200 30

# Multi Band Operation (MBO) non-preferred channels
# A space delimited list of non-preferred channels where each channel is a colon

# MBO Cellular Data Capabilities
# 1 = Cellular data connection available
# 2 = Cellular data connection not available
# 3 = Not cellular capable (default)
#mbo_cell_capa=3

# Optimized Connectivity Experience (OCE)
# oce: Enable OCE features (bitmap)

#	does not indicate support for OCE in STA mode)
# Set BIT(1) to Enable OCE in STA-CFON mode
#oce=1

# Extended Key ID support for Individually Addressed frames
# 0 = force off: Do not use Extended Key ID (default)
# 1 = auto: Activate Extended Key ID support if the driver supports it
#extended_key_id=0

# network block
#
# Each network (usually AP's sharing the same SSID) is configured as a separate
# block in this configuration file. The network blocks are in preference order
# (the first match is used).
#
# network block fields:
#
# disabled:
#	0 = this network can be used (default)
#	1 = this network block is disabled (can be enabled through ctrl_iface,
#	    e.g., with wpa_cli or wpa_gui)
#
# id_str: Network identifier string for external scripts. This value is passed
#	to external action script through wpa_cli as WPA_ID_STR environment
#	variable to make it easier to do network specific configuration.
#
# ssid: SSID (mandatory); network name in one of the optional formats:
#	- an ASCII string with double quotation
#	- a hex string (two characters per octet of SSID)
#	- a printf-escaped ASCII string P"<escaped string>"
#
# scan_ssid:
#	0 = do not scan this SSID with specific Probe Request frames (default)
#	1 = scan with SSID-specific Probe Request frames (this can be used to
#	    find APs that do not accept broadcast SSID or use multiple SSIDs;
#	    this will add latency to scanning, so enable this only when needed)
#
# bssid: BSSID (optional); if set, this network block is used only when
#	associating with the AP using the configured BSSID
#
# ignore_broadcast_ssid: SSID broadcast behavior
# Send empty SSID in beacons and ignore probe request frames that do not
# specify full SSID, i.e., require stations to know SSID.
# default: disabled (0)
# 1 = send empty (length=0) SSID in beacon and ignore probe request for
#     broadcast SSID
# 2 = clear SSID (ASCII 0), but keep the original length (this may be required
#     with some clients that do not support empty SSID) and ignore probe
#     requests for broadcast SSID
#
# priority: priority group (integer)
# By default, all networks will get same priority group (0). If some of the
# networks are more desirable, this field can be used to change the order in
# which wpa_supplicant goes through the networks when selecting a BSS. The
# priority groups will be iterated in decreasing priority (i.e., the larger the
# priority value, the sooner the network is matched against the scan results).
# Within each priority group, networks will be selected based on security
# policy, signal strength, etc.
# Please note that AP scanning with scan_ssid=1 and ap_scan=2 mode are not
# using this priority to select the order for scanning. Instead, they try the
# networks in the order that used in the configuration file.
#
# mode: IEEE 802.11 operation mode
# 0 = infrastructure (Managed) mode, i.e., associate with an AP (default)
# 1 = IBSS (ad-hoc, peer-to-peer)
# 2 = AP (access point)
# Note: IBSS can only be used with key_mgmt NONE (plaintext and static WEP) and
# WPA-PSK (with proto=RSN). In addition, key_mgmt=WPA-NONE (fixed group key
# TKIP/CCMP) is available for backwards compatibility, but its use is
# deprecated. WPA-None requires following network block options:
# proto=WPA, key_mgmt=WPA-NONE, pairwise=NONE, group=TKIP (or CCMP, but not
# both), and psk must also be set.
#
# frequency: Channel frequency in megahertz (MHz) for IBSS, e.g.,
# 2412 = IEEE 802.11b/g channel 1. This value is used to configure the initial
# channel for IBSS (adhoc) networks. It is ignored in the infrastructure mode.
# In addition, this value is only used by the station that creates the IBSS. If
# an IBSS network with the configured SSID is already present, the frequency of
# the network will be used instead of this configured value.
#
# pbss: Whether to use PBSS. Relevant to IEEE 802.11ad networks only.
# 0 = do not use PBSS
# 1 = use PBSS
# 2 = don't care (not allowed in AP mode)
# Used together with mode configuration. When mode is AP, it means to start a
# PCP instead of a regular AP. When mode is infrastructure it means connect
# to a PCP instead of AP. In this mode you can also specify 2 (don't care)
# which means connect to either PCP or AP.
# P2P_GO and P2P_GROUP_FORMATION modes must use PBSS in IEEE 802.11ad network.
# For more details, see IEEE Std 802.11ad-2012.
#
# scan_freq: List of frequencies to scan
# Space-separated list of frequencies in MHz to scan when searching for this
# BSS. If the subset of channels used by the network is known, this option can
# be used to optimize scanning to not occur on channels that the network does
# not use. Example: scan_freq=2412 2437 2462
#
# freq_list: Array of allowed frequencies
# Space-separated list of frequencies in MHz to allow for selecting the BSS. If
# set, scan results that do not match any of the specified frequencies are not
# considered when selecting a BSS.
#
# This can also be set on the outside of the network block. In this case,
# it limits the frequencies that will be scanned.
#
# bgscan: Background scanning
# wpa_supplicant behavior for background scanning can be specified by
# configuring a bgscan module. These modules are responsible for requesting
# background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a
# single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). The bgscan
# parameter uses following format: "<bgscan module name>:<module parameters>"
# Following bgscan modules are available:
# simple - Periodic background scans based on signal strength
# send_btm_query > 0 means do this many BTM queries before attempting a scan.
# bgscan="simple:<short bgscan interval in seconds>:<signal strength threshold>:
# <long interval>[:<send_btm_query>]"
# bgscan="simple:30:-45:300"
# bgscan="simple:30:-45:300:3"
# learn - Learn channels used by the network and try to avoid bgscans on other
# channels (experimental)
# bgscan="learn:<short bgscan interval in seconds>:<signal strength threshold>:
# <long interval>[:<database file name>]"
# bgscan="learn:30:-45:300:/etc/wpa_supplicant/network1.bgscan"

# enforce rekeying of PTK to mitigate some attacks against TKIP deficiencies.
#
# wpa_deny_ptk0_rekey: Workaround for PTK rekey issues
# PTK0 rekeys (using only one Key ID value for pairwise keys) can degrade the
# security and stability with some cards.
# To avoid the issues wpa_supplicant can replace those PTK rekeys (including
# EAP reauthentications) with fast reconnects.
#
# Available options:
# 0 = always rekey when configured/instructed (default)
# 1 = only rekey when the local driver is explicitly indicating it can perform
#	this operation without issues
# 2 = never allow problematic PTK0 rekeys
#
# group_rekey: Group rekeying time in seconds. This value, if non-zero, is used
# as the dot11RSNAConfigGroupRekeyTime parameter when operating in
# Authenticator role in IBSS, or in AP and mesh modes.
#
# Following fields are only used with internal EAP implementation.
# eap: space-separated list of accepted EAP methods
#	MD5 = EAP-MD5 (insecure and does not generate keying material ->
#			cannot be used with WPA; to be used as a Phase 2 method
#			with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       MSCHAPV2 = EAP-MSCHAPv2 (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       OTP = EAP-OTP (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       GTC = EAP-GTC (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#	TLS = EAP-TLS (client and server certificate)
#	PEAP = EAP-PEAP (with tunnelled EAP authentication)
#	TTLS = EAP-TTLS (with tunnelled EAP or PAP/CHAP/MSCHAP/MSCHAPV2
#			 authentication)
#	If not set, all compiled in methods are allowed.
#
# identity: Identity string for EAP
#	This field is also used to configure user NAI for
#	EAP-PSK/PAX/SAKE/GPSK.
# anonymous_identity: Anonymous identity string for EAP (to be used as the
#	unencrypted identity with EAP types that support different tunnelled
#	identity, e.g., EAP-TTLS). This field can also be used with
#	EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA' to store the pseudonym identity.
# password: Password string for EAP. This field can include either the
#	plaintext password (using ASCII or hex string) or a NtPasswordHash
#	(16-byte MD4 hash of password) in hash:<32 hex digits> format.
#	NtPasswordHash can only be used when the password is for MSCHAPv2 or
#	MSCHAP (EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, EAP-TTLS/MSCHAP, LEAP).
#	EAP-PSK (128-bit PSK), EAP-PAX (128-bit PSK), and EAP-SAKE (256-bit
#	PSK) is also configured using this field. For EAP-GPSK, this is a
#	variable length PSK. ext:<name of external password field> format can
#	be used to indicate that the password is stored in external storage.
# ca_cert: File path to CA certificate file (PEM/DER). This file can have one
#	or more trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert and ca_path are not
#	included, server certificate will not be verified. This is insecure and
#	a trusted CA certificate should always be configured when using
#	EAP-TLS/TTLS/PEAP. Full path should be used since working directory may
#	change when wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#
#	Alternatively, this can be used to only perform matching of the server
#	certificate (SHA-256 hash of the DER encoded X.509 certificate). In
#	this case, the possible CA certificates in the server certificate chain
#	are ignored and only the server certificate is verified. This is
#	configured with the following format:
#	hash:://server/sha256/cert_hash_in_hex
#	For example: "hash://server/sha256/
#	5a1bc1296205e6fdbe3979728efe3920798885c1c4590b5f90f43222d239ca6a"
#
#	On Windows, trusted CA certificates can be loaded from the system
#	certificate store by setting this to cert_store://<name>, e.g.,
#	ca_cert="cert_store://CA" or ca_cert="cert_store://ROOT".
#	Note that when running wpa_supplicant as an application, the user
#	certificate store (My user account) is used, whereas computer store
#	(Computer account) is used when running wpasvc as a service.
# ca_path: Directory path for CA certificate files (PEM). This path may
#	contain multiple CA certificates in OpenSSL format. Common use for this
#	is to point to system trusted CA list which is often installed into
#	directory like /etc/ssl/certs. If configured, these certificates are
#	added to the list of trusted CAs. ca_cert may also be included in that
#	case, but it is not required.
# client_cert: File path to client certificate file (PEM/DER)
#	Full path should be used since working directory may change when
#	wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting this
#	to blob://<blob name>.
# private_key: File path to client private key file (PEM/DER/PFX)
#	When PKCS#12/PFX file (.p12/.pfx) is used, client_cert should be
#	commented out. Both the private key and certificate will be read from
#	the PKCS#12 file in this case. Full path should be used since working
#	directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#	Windows certificate store can be used by leaving client_cert out and
#	configuring private_key in one of the following formats:
#	cert://substring_to_match
#	hash://certificate_thumbprint_in_hex
#	for example: private_key="hash://63093aa9c47f56ae88334c7b65a4"
#	Note that when running wpa_supplicant as an application, the user
#	certificate store (My user account) is used, whereas computer store
#	(Computer account) is used when running wpasvc as a service.
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting this
#	to blob://<blob name>.
# private_key_passwd: Password for private key file (if left out, this will be
#	asked through control interface)
# subject_match: Substring to be matched against the subject of the
#	authentication server certificate. If this string is set, the server
#	certificate is only accepted if it contains this string in the subject.
#	The subject string is in following format:
#	/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/CN=Test AS/emailAddress=as@example.com
#	Note: Since this is a substring match, this cannot be used securely to
#	do a suffix match against a possible domain name in the CN entry. For
#	such a use case, domain_suffix_match or domain_match should be used
#	instead.
# altsubject_match: Semicolon separated string of entries to be matched against
#	the alternative subject name of the authentication server certificate.
#	If this string is set, the server certificate is only accepted if it
#	contains one of the entries in an alternative subject name extension.
#	altSubjectName string is in following format: TYPE:VALUE
#	Example: EMAIL:server@example.com
#	Example: DNS:server.example.com;DNS:server2.example.com
#	Following types are supported: EMAIL, DNS, URI
# domain_suffix_match: Constraint for server domain name. If set, this FQDN is
#	used as a suffix match requirement for the AAA server certificate in
#	SubjectAltName dNSName element(s). If a matching dNSName is found, this
#	constraint is met. If no dNSName values are present, this constraint is
#	matched against SubjectName CN using same suffix match comparison.
#
#	Suffix match here means that the host/domain name is compared one label
#	at a time starting from the top-level domain and all the labels in
#	domain_suffix_match shall be included in the certificate. The
#	certificate may include additional sub-level labels in addition to the
#	required labels.
#
#	More than one match string can be provided by using semicolons to
#	separate the strings (e.g., example.org;example.com). When multiple
#	strings are specified, a match with any one of the values is considered
#	a sufficient match for the certificate, i.e., the conditions are ORed
#	together.
#
#	For example, domain_suffix_match=example.com would match
#	test.example.com but would not match test-example.com.
# domain_match: Constraint for server domain name
#	If set, this FQDN is used as a full match requirement for the
#	server certificate in SubjectAltName dNSName element(s). If a
#	matching dNSName is found, this constraint is met. If no dNSName
#	values are present, this constraint is matched against SubjectName CN
#	using same full match comparison. This behavior is similar to
#	domain_suffix_match, but has the requirement of a full match, i.e.,
#	no subdomains or wildcard matches are allowed. Case-insensitive
#	comparison is used, so "Example.com" matches "example.com", but would
#	not match "test.Example.com".
#
#	More than one match string can be provided by using semicolons to
#	separate the strings (e.g., example.org;example.com). When multiple
#	strings are specified, a match with any one of the values is considered
#	a sufficient match for the certificate, i.e., the conditions are ORed
#	together.
# phase1: Phase1 (outer authentication, i.e., TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "peapver=0" or
#	"peapver=1 peaplabel=1")
#	'peapver' can be used to force which PEAP version (0 or 1) is used.
#	'peaplabel=1' can be used to force new label, "client PEAP encryption",
#	to be used during key derivation when PEAPv1 or newer. Most existing
#	PEAPv1 implementation seem to be using the old label, "client EAP
#	encryption", and wpa_supplicant is now using that as the default value.
#	Some servers, e.g., Radiator, may require peaplabel=1 configuration to
#	interoperate with PEAPv1; see eap_testing.txt for more details.
#	'peap_outer_success=0' can be used to terminate PEAP authentication on
#	tunneled EAP-Success. This is required with some RADIUS servers that
#	implement draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-05.txt (e.g.,
#	Lucent NavisRadius v4.4.0 with PEAP in "IETF Draft 5" mode)
#	include_tls_length=1 can be used to force wpa_supplicant to include
#	TLS Message Length field in all TLS messages even if they are not
#	fragmented.
#	sim_min_num_chal=3 can be used to configure EAP-SIM to require three
#	challenges (by default, it accepts 2 or 3)
#	result_ind=1 can be used to enable EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA to use
#	protected result indication.
#	'crypto_binding' option can be used to control PEAPv0 cryptobinding
#	behavior:
#	 * 0 = do not use cryptobinding (default)
#	 * 1 = use cryptobinding if server supports it
#	 * 2 = require cryptobinding
#	'phase2_auth' option can be used to control Phase 2 (i.e., within TLS
#	tunnel) behavior for PEAP:
#	 * 0 = do not require Phase 2 authentication
#	 * 1 = require Phase 2 authentication when client certificate
#	   (private_key/client_cert) is no used and TLS session resumption was
#	   not used (default)
#	 * 2 = require Phase 2 authentication in all cases
#	EAP-WSC (WPS) uses following options: pin=<Device Password> or
#	pbc=1.
#
#	For wired IEEE 802.1X authentication, "allow_canned_success=1" can be
#	used to configure a mode that allows EAP-Success (and EAP-Failure)
#	without going through authentication step. Some switches use such
#	sequence when forcing the port to be authorized/unauthorized or as a
#	fallback option if the authentication server is unreachable. By default,
#	wpa_supplicant discards such frames to protect against potential attacks
#	by rogue devices, but this option can be used to disable that protection
#	for cases where the server/authenticator does not need to be
#	authenticated.
# phase2: Phase2 (inner authentication with TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "auth=MSCHAPV2" for EAP-PEAP or
#	"autheap=MSCHAPV2 autheap=MD5" for EAP-TTLS). "mschapv2_retry=0" can be
#	used to disable MSCHAPv2 password retry in authentication failure cases.
#
# TLS-based methods can use the following parameters to control TLS behavior
# (these are normally in the phase1 parameter, but can be used also in the
# phase2 parameter when EAP-TLS is used within the inner tunnel):
# tls_allow_md5=1 - allow MD5-based certificate signatures (depending on the
#	TLS library, these may be disabled by default to enforce stronger
#	security)
# tls_disable_time_checks=1 - ignore certificate validity time (this requests
#	the TLS library to accept certificates even if they are not currently
#	valid, i.e., have expired or have not yet become valid; this should be
#	used only for testing purposes)
# tls_disable_session_ticket=1 - disable TLS Session Ticket extension
# tls_disable_session_ticket=0 - allow TLS Session Ticket extension to be used
#	Note: If not set, this is automatically set to 1 for EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS
#	as a workaround for broken authentication server implementations unless
#	EAP workarounds are disabled with eap_workaround=0.
#	For EAP-FAST, this must be set to 0 (or left unconfigured for the
#	default value to be used automatically).
# tls_disable_tlsv1_0=1 - disable use of TLSv1.0
# tls_disable_tlsv1_0=0 - explicitly enable use of TLSv1.0 (this allows
#	systemwide TLS policies to be overridden)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_1=1 - disable use of TLSv1.1 (a workaround for AAA servers
#	that have issues interoperating with updated TLS version)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_1=0 - explicitly enable use of TLSv1.1 (this allows
#	systemwide TLS policies to be overridden)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_2=1 - disable use of TLSv1.2 (a workaround for AAA servers
#	that have issues interoperating with updated TLS version)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_2=0 - explicitly enable use of TLSv1.2 (this allows
#	systemwide TLS policies to be overridden)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_3=1 - disable use of TLSv1.3 (a workaround for AAA servers
#	that have issues interoperating with updated TLS version)
# tls_disable_tlsv1_3=0 - enable TLSv1.3 (experimental - disabled by default)
# tls_ext_cert_check=0 - No external server certificate validation (default)
# tls_ext_cert_check=1 - External server certificate validation enabled; this
#	requires an external program doing validation of server certificate
#	chain when receiving CTRL-RSP-EXT_CERT_CHECK event from the control
#	interface and report the result of the validation with
#	CTRL-RSP_EXT_CERT_CHECK.
# tls_suiteb=0 - do not apply Suite B 192-bit constraints on TLS (default)
# tls_suiteb=1 - apply Suite B 192-bit constraints on TLS; this is used in
#	particular when using Suite B with RSA keys of >= 3K (3072) bits
# allow_unsafe_renegotiation=1 - allow connection with a TLS server that does
#	not support safe renegotiation (RFC 5746); please note that this
#	workaround should be only when having to authenticate with an old
#	authentication server that cannot be updated to use secure TLS
#	implementation.
#
# Following certificate/private key fields are used in inner Phase2
# authentication when using EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP.
# ca_cert2: File path to CA certificate file. This file can have one or more
#	trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert2 and ca_path2 are not included,
#	server certificate will not be verified. This is insecure and a trusted
#	CA certificate should always be configured.
# ca_path2: Directory path for CA certificate files (PEM)
# client_cert2: File path to client certificate file
# private_key2: File path to client private key file
# private_key2_passwd: Password for private key file
# dh_file2: File path to DH/DSA parameters file (in PEM format)
# subject_match2: Substring to be matched against the subject of the
#	authentication server certificate. See subject_match for more details.
# altsubject_match2: Semicolon separated string of entries to be matched
#	against the alternative subject name of the authentication server
#	certificate. See altsubject_match documentation for more details.
# domain_suffix_match2: Constraint for server domain name. See
#	domain_suffix_match for more details.
# ocsp2: See ocsp for more details.
#
# Separate machine credentials can be configured for EAP-TEAP Phase 2 with
# "machine_" prefix (e.g., "machine_identity") in the configuration parameters.
# See the parameters without that prefix for more details on the meaning and
# format of each such parameter.
#
# fragment_size: Maximum EAP fragment size in bytes (default 1398).
#	This value limits the fragment size for EAP methods that support
#	fragmentation (e.g., EAP-TLS and EAP-PEAP). This value should be set
#	small enough to make the EAP messages fit in MTU of the network
#	interface used for EAPOL. The default value is suitable for most
#	cases.
#
# ocsp: Whether to use/require OCSP to check server certificate
#	0 = do not use OCSP stapling (TLS certificate status extension)
#	1 = try to use OCSP stapling, but not require response
#	2 = require valid OCSP stapling response
#	3 = require valid OCSP stapling response for all not-trusted
#	    certificates in the server certificate chain
#
# openssl_ciphers: OpenSSL specific cipher configuration
#	This can be used to override the global openssl_ciphers configuration
#	parameter (see above).
#
# erp: Whether EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) is enabled
#
# EAP-FAST variables:
# pac_file: File path for the PAC entries. wpa_supplicant will need to be able
#	to create this file and write updates to it when PAC is being
#	provisioned or refreshed. Full path to the file should be used since
#	working directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run in the
#	background. Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by
#	setting this to blob://<blob name>
# phase1: fast_provisioning option can be used to enable in-line provisioning
#         of EAP-FAST credentials (PAC):
#         0 = disabled,
#         1 = allow unauthenticated provisioning,
#         2 = allow authenticated provisioning,
#         3 = allow both unauthenticated and authenticated provisioning
#	fast_max_pac_list_len=<num> option can be used to set the maximum
#		number of PAC entries to store in a PAC list (default: 10)
#	fast_pac_format=binary option can be used to select binary format for
#		storing PAC entries in order to save some space (the default
#		text format uses about 2.5 times the size of minimal binary
#		format)
#
# wpa_supplicant supports number of "EAP workarounds" to work around
# interoperability issues with incorrectly behaving authentication servers.
# These are enabled by default because some of the issues are present in large
# number of authentication servers. Strict EAP conformance mode can be
# configured by disabling workarounds with eap_workaround=0.

# update_identifier: PPS MO ID
#	(Hotspot 2.0 PerProviderSubscription/UpdateIdentifier)
#
# roaming_consortium_selection: Roaming Consortium Selection
#	The matching Roaming Consortium OI that was used to generate this
#	network profile.

# Station inactivity limit
#
# If a station does not send anything in ap_max_inactivity seconds, an
# empty data frame is sent to it in order to verify whether it is
# still in range. If this frame is not ACKed, the station will be
# disassociated and then deauthenticated. This feature is used to
# clear station table of old entries when the STAs move out of the
# range.
#
# The station can associate again with the AP if it is still in range;
# this inactivity poll is just used as a nicer way of verifying
# inactivity; i.e., client will not report broken connection because
# disassociation frame is not sent immediately without first polling
# the STA with a data frame.
# default: 300 (i.e., 5 minutes)

# OWE DH Group
# 0: use default (19) first and then try all supported groups one by one if AP

# OWE PTK derivation workaround
# Initial OWE implementation used SHA256 when deriving the PTK for all
# OWE groups. This was supposed to change to SHA384 for group 20 and
# SHA512 for group 21. This parameter can be used to enable older
# behavior mainly for testing purposes. There is no impact to group 19
# behavior, but if enabled, this will make group 20 and 21 cases use

# OWE implementation on the AP side.
#owe_ptk_workaround=0

# Transition Disable indication
# The AP can notify authenticated stations to disable transition mode
# in their network profiles when the network has completed transition
# steps, i.e., once sufficiently large number of APs in the ESS have
# been updated to support the more secure alternative. When this
# indication is used, the stations are expected to automatically

##### Fast Session Transfer (FST) support #####################################
#
# The options in this section are only available when the build configuration
# option CONFIG_FST is set while compiling wpa_supplicant. They allow this
# interface to be a part of FST setup.

# FST is the transfer of a session from a channel to another channel, in the
# same or different frequency bands.
#
# For details, see IEEE Std 802.11ad-2012.

# Identifier of an FST Group  the interface belongs to.
#fst_group_id=bond0

# Interface priority within the FST Group.
# Announcing a higher priority for an interface means declaring it more
# preferable for FST switch.
# fst_priority is in 1..255 range with 1 being the lowest priority.
#fst_priority=100

# Default LLT value for this interface in milliseconds. The value used in case
# no value provided during session setup. Default is 50 msec.
# fst_llt is in 1..4294967 range (due to spec limitation, see 10.32.2.2
# Transitioning between states).
#fst_llt=100

# BSS Transition Management
# disable_btm - Disable BSS transition management in STA
# Set to 0 to enable BSS transition management (default behavior)
# Set to 1 to disable BSS transition management
#disable_btm=0

# Enable EDMG capability in STA/AP mode, default value is false
#enable_edmg=1

# This value is used to configure the channel bonding feature.
# Default value is 0.
# Relevant only if enable_edmg is true
# In AP mode it defines the EDMG channel to use for AP operation.
# In STA mode it defines the EDMG channel for connection (if supported by AP).
#edmg_channel=9

# BSS max idle period to request
# If nonzero, request the specified number of 1000 TU (i.e., 1.024 s)
# as the maximum idle period for the STA during association.
#max_idle=600
