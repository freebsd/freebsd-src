.SH NAME
wpa_supplicant \- Wi-Fi Protected Access client and IEEE 802.1X supplicant
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBwpa_supplicant\fR [ \fB-BddfhKLqqtuvW\fR ] [ \fB-i\fIifname\fB\fR ] [ \fB-c\fIconfig file\fB\fR ] [ \fB-D\fIdriver\fB\fR ] [ \fB-P\fIPID_file\fB\fR ] [ \fB-f\fIoutput file\fB\fR ]

.SH "OVERVIEW"
.PP
Wireless networks do not require physical access to the network equipment
in the same way as wired networks. This makes it easier for unauthorized
users to passively monitor a network and capture all transmitted frames.
In addition, unauthorized use of the network is much easier. In many cases,
this can happen even without user's explicit knowledge since the wireless
LAN adapter may have been configured to automatically join any available
network.
.PP
Link-layer encryption can be used to provide a layer of security for
wireless networks. The original wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11,
included a simple encryption mechanism, WEP. However, that proved to
be flawed in many areas and network protected with WEP cannot be consider
secure. IEEE 802.1X authentication and frequently changed dynamic WEP keys
can be used to improve the network security, but even that has inherited
security issues due to the use of WEP for encryption. Wi-Fi Protected
Access and IEEE 802.11i amendment to the wireless LAN standard introduce
a much improvement mechanism for securing wireless networks. IEEE 802.11i
enabled networks that are using CCMP (encryption mechanism based on strong
cryptographic algorithm AES) can finally be called secure used for
applications which require efficient protection against unauthorized
access.
.PP
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR is an implementation of
the WPA Supplicant component, i.e., the part that runs in the
client stations. It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA
Authenticator and EAP authentication with Authentication
Server. In addition, it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association of the wireless LAN driver.
.PP
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR is designed to be a
"daemon" program that runs in the background and acts as the
backend component controlling the wireless
connection. \fBwpa_supplicant\fR supports separate
frontend programs and an example text-based frontend,
\fBwpa_cli\fR, is included with
wpa_supplicant.
.PP
Before wpa_supplicant can do its work, the network interface
must be available.  That means that the physical device must be
present and enabled, and the driver for the device must be
loaded. The daemon will exit immediately if the device is not already
available.
.PP
After \fBwpa_supplicant\fR has configured the
network device, higher level configuration such as DHCP may
proceed.  There are a variety of ways to integrate wpa_supplicant
into a machine's networking scripts, a few of which are described
in sections below.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
In most common cases, \fBwpa_supplicant\fR is
started with:
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0
.fi
.RE
.PP
This makes the process fork into background.
.PP
The easiest way to debug problems, and to get debug log for
bug reports, is to start \fBwpa_supplicant\fR on
foreground with debugging enabled:
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0 -d
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the specific driver wrapper is not known beforehand, it is
possible to specify multiple comma separated driver wrappers on the command
line. \fBwpa_supplicant\fR will use the first driver
wrapper that is able to initialize the interface.
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211,wext -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR can control multiple
interfaces (radios) either by running one process for each
interface separately or by running just one process and list of
options at command line. Each interface is separated with -N
argument. As an example, following command would start
wpa_supplicant for two interfaces:
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant \\
	-c wpa1.conf -i wlan0 -D nl80211 -N \\
	-c wpa2.conf -i ath0 -D wext
.fi
.RE
.SH "OS REQUIREMENTS"
.PP
Current hardware/software requirements:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Linux kernel 2.4.x or 2.6.x with Linux Wireless
Extensions v15 or newer
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
FreeBSD 6-CURRENT
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Microsoft Windows with WinPcap (at least WinXP, may work
with other versions)
.SH "SUPPORTED DRIVERS"
.TP
\fBLinux wireless extensions\fR
In theory, any driver that supports Linux wireless
extensions can be used with IEEE 802.1X (i.e., not WPA) when
using ap_scan=0 option in configuration file.
.TP
\fBWired Ethernet drivers\fR
Use ap_scan=0.
.TP
\fBBSD net80211 layer (e.g., Atheros driver)\fR
At the moment, this is for FreeBSD 6-CURRENT branch.
.TP
\fBWindows NDIS\fR
The current Windows port requires WinPcap
(http://winpcap.polito.it/).  See README-Windows.txt for more
information.
.PP
wpa_supplicant was designed to be portable for different
drivers and operating systems. Hopefully, support for more wlan
cards and OSes will be added in the future. See developer.txt for
more information about the design of wpa_supplicant and porting to
other drivers. One main goal is to add full WPA/WPA2 support to
Linux wireless extensions to allow new drivers to be supported
without having to implement new driver-specific interface code in
wpa_supplicant.
.SH "ARCHITECTURE"
.PP
The
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR system consists of the following
components:
.TP
\fB\fIwpa_supplicant.conf\fB \fR
the configuration file describing all networks that the
user wants the computer to connect to.  
.TP
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR
the program that directly interacts with the
network interface.  
.TP
\fBwpa_cli\fR
the
client program that provides a high-level interface to the
functionality of the daemon.  
.TP
\fBwpa_passphrase\fR
a utility needed to construct
\fIwpa_supplicant.conf\fR files that include
encrypted passwords.
.SH "QUICK START"
.PP
First, make a configuration file, e.g.
\fI/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\fR, that describes the networks
you are interested in.  See \fBwpa_supplicant.conf\fR(5)
for details.
.PP
Once the configuration is ready, you can test whether the
configuration works by running \fBwpa_supplicant\fR
with following command to start it on foreground with debugging
enabled:
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -d
    
.fi
.RE
.PP
Assuming everything goes fine, you can start using following
command to start \fBwpa_supplicant\fR on background
without debugging:
.sp
.RS

.nf
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
    
.fi
.RE
.PP
Please note that if you included more than one driver
interface in the build time configuration (.config), you may need
to specify which interface to use by including -D<driver
name> option on the command line.
.SH "INTERFACE TO PCMCIA-CS/CARDMRG"
.PP
For example, following small changes to pcmcia-cs scripts
can be used to enable WPA support:
.PP
Add MODE="Managed" and WPA="y" to the network scheme in
\fI/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts\fR\&.
.PP
Add the following block to the end of \fBstart\fR
action handler in \fI/etc/pcmcia/wireless\fR:
.sp
.RS

.nf
if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
    /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i$DEVICE
fi
    
.fi
.RE
.PP
Add the following block to the end of \fBstop\fR
action handler (may need to be separated from other actions) in
\fI/etc/pcmcia/wireless\fR:
.sp
.RS

.nf
if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
    killall wpa_supplicant
fi
    
.fi
.RE
.PP
This will make \fBcardmgr\fR start
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR when the card is plugged
in.
