	  [Bug 355]
	* fixed issue with early D-Bus signals during initialization
	* fixed X.509 name handling in internal TLS
	* fixed WPS ER to use corrent Enrollee MAC Address in Credential
	* fixed scanning routines ot improve AP selection for WPS
	* added WPS workaround for open networks
	* fixed WPS Diffie-Hellman derivation to use correct public key length
	* fixed wpa_supplicant AP mode operations to ignore Supplicant and
	  scan result events
	* improved SME operations with nl80211
	* fixed WPS ER event_id handling in some cases
	* fixed some issues with bgscan simple to avoid unnecessary scans
	* fixed issue with l2_packet_ndis overlapped writes corrupting stack
	  [Bug 328]
	* updated WinPcap to the latest stable version 4.1.2 in Windows
	  installer

2010-04-18 - v0.7.2
	* nl80211: fixed number of issues with roaming
	* avoid unnecessary roaming if multiple APs with similar signal
	  strength are present in scan results
	* add TLS client events and server probing to ease design of
	  automatic detection of EAP parameters
	* add option for server certificate matching (SHA256 hash of the
	  certificate) instead of trusted CA certificate configuration
	* bsd: Cleaned up driver wrapper and added various low-level
	  configuration options
	* wpa_gui-qt4: do not show too frequent WPS AP available events as
	  tray messages
	* TNC: fixed issues with fragmentation
	* EAP-TNC: add Flags field into fragment acknowledgement (needed to
	  interoperate with other implementations; may potentially breaks
	  compatibility with older wpa_supplicant/hostapd versions)
	* wpa_cli: added option for using a separate process to receive event
	  messages to reduce latency in showing these
	  (CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_WPA_CLI_FORK=y in .config to enable this)
	* maximum BSS table size can now be configured (bss_max_count)
	* BSSes to be included in the BSS table can be filtered based on
	  configured SSIDs to save memory (filter_ssids)
	* fix number of issues with IEEE 802.11r/FT; this version is not
	  backwards compatible with old versions
	* nl80211: add support for IEEE 802.11r/FT protocol (both over-the-air
	  and over-the-DS)
	* add freq_list network configuration parameter to allow the AP
	  selection to filter out entries based on the operating channel
	* add signal strength change events for bgscan; this allows more
	  dynamic changes to background scanning interval based on changes in
	  the signal strength with the current AP; this improves roaming within
	  ESS quite a bit, e.g., with bgscan="simple:30:-45:300" in the network
	  configuration block to request background scans less frequently when
	  signal strength remains good and to automatically trigger background
	  scans whenever signal strength drops noticeably
	  (this is currently only available with nl80211)
	* add BSSID and reason code (if available) to disconnect event messages
	* wpa_gui-qt4: more complete support for translating the GUI with
	  linguist and add German translation
	* fix DH padding with internal crypto code (mainly, for WPS)
	* do not trigger initial scan automatically anymore if there are no
	  enabled networks

2010-01-16 - v0.7.1
	* cleaned up driver wrapper API (struct wpa_driver_ops); the new API
	  is not fully backwards compatible, so out-of-tree driver wrappers
	  will need modifications
	* cleaned up various module interfaces
	* merge hostapd and wpa_supplicant developers' documentation into a
	  single document
	* nl80211: use explicit deauthentication to clear cfg80211 state to
	  avoid issues when roaming between APs
	* dbus: major design changes in the new D-Bus API
	  (fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1)
	* nl80211: added support for IBSS networks
	* added internal debugging mechanism with backtrace support and memory
	  allocation/freeing validation, etc. tests (CONFIG_WPA_TRACE=y)
	* added WPS ER unsubscription command to more cleanly unregister from
	  receiving UPnP events when ER is terminated
	* cleaned up AP mode operations to avoid need for virtual driver_ops
	  wrapper
	* added BSS table to maintain more complete scan result information
	  over multiple scans (that may include only partial results)
	* wpa_gui-qt4: update Peers dialog information more dynamically while
	  the dialog is kept open
	* fixed PKCS#12 use with OpenSSL 1.0.0
	* driver_wext: Added cfg80211-specific optimization to avoid some
	  unnecessary scans and to speed up association

2009-11-21 - v0.7.0
	* increased wpa_cli ping interval to 5 seconds and made this
	  configurable with a new command line options (-G<seconds>)
	* fixed scan buffer processing with WEXT to handle up to 65535
	  byte result buffer (previously, limited to 32768 bytes)
	* allow multiple driver wrappers to be specified on command line
	  (e.g., -Dnl80211,wext); the first one that is able to initialize the
	  interface will be used
	* added support for multiple SSIDs per scan request to optimize
	  scan_ssid=1 operations in ap_scan=1 mode (i.e., search for hidden
	  SSIDs); this requires driver support and can currently be used only
	  with nl80211
	* added support for WPS USBA out-of-band mechanism with USB Flash
	  Drives (UFD) (CONFIG_WPS_UFD=y)
	* driver_ndis: add PAE group address to the multicast address list to
	  fix wired IEEE 802.1X authentication
	* fixed IEEE 802.11r key derivation function to match with the standard
	  (note: this breaks interoperability with previous version) [Bug 303]
	* added better support for drivers that allow separate authentication
	  and association commands (e.g., mac80211-based Linux drivers with
	  nl80211; SME in wpa_supplicant); this allows over-the-air FT protocol
	  to be used (IEEE 802.11r)
	* fixed SHA-256 based key derivation function to match with the
	  standard when using CCMP (for IEEE 802.11r and IEEE 802.11w)
	  (note: this breaks interoperability with previous version) [Bug 307]
	* use shared driver wrapper files with hostapd
	* added AP mode functionality (CONFIG_AP=y) with mode=2 in the network
	  block; this can be used for open and WPA2-Personal networks
	  (optionally, with WPS); this links in parts of hostapd functionality
	  into wpa_supplicant
	* wpa_gui-qt4: added new Peers dialog to show information about peers
	  (other devices, including APs and stations, etc. in the neighborhood)
	* added support for WPS External Registrar functionality (configure APs
	  and enroll new devices); can be used with wpa_gui-qt4 Peers dialog
	  and wpa_cli commands wps_er_start, wps_er_stop, wps_er_pin,
	  wps_er_pbc, wps_er_learn
	  (this can also be used with a new 'none' driver wrapper if no
	  wireless device or IEEE 802.1X on wired is needed)
	* driver_nl80211: multiple updates to provide support for new Linux
	  nl80211/mac80211 functionality
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE Std 802.11w-2009
	* fixed number of small WPS issues and added workarounds to
	  interoperate with common deployed broken implementations
	* added support for NFC out-of-band mechanism with WPS
	* driver_ndis: fixed wired IEEE 802.1X authentication with PAE group
	  address frames
	* added preliminary support for IEEE 802.11r RIC processing
	* added support for specifying subset of enabled frequencies to scan
	  (scan_freq option in the network configuration block); this can speed
	  up scanning process considerably if it is known that only a small
	  subset of channels is actually used in the network (this is currently
	  supported only with -Dnl80211)
	* added a workaround for race condition between receiving the
	  association event and the following EAPOL-Key
	* added background scan and roaming infrastructure to allow
	  network-specific optimizations to be used to improve roaming within
	  an ESS (same SSID)
	* added new DBus interface (fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1)

2009-01-06 - v0.6.7
	* added support for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
	  (wpa_supplicant can now be configured to act as a WPS Enrollee to
	  enroll credentials for a network using PIN and PBC methods; in
	  addition, wpa_supplicant can act as a wireless WPS Registrar to
	  configure an AP); WPS support can be enabled by adding CONFIG_WPS=y
	  into .config and setting the runtime configuration variables in
	  wpa_supplicant.conf (see WPS section in the example configuration
	  file); new wpa_cli commands wps_pin, wps_pbc, and wps_reg are used to
	  manage WPS negotiation; see README-WPS for more details
	* added support for EAP-AKA' (draft-arkko-eap-aka-kdf)
	* added support for using driver_test over UDP socket
	* fixed PEAPv0 Cryptobinding interoperability issue with Windows Server
	  2008 NPS; optional cryptobinding is now enabled (again) by default
	* fixed PSK editing in wpa_gui
	* changed EAP-GPSK to use the IANA assigned EAP method type 51
	* added a Windows installer that includes WinPcap and all the needed
	  DLLs; in addition, it set up the registry automatically so that user
	  will only need start wpa_gui to get prompted to start the wpasvc
	  servide and add a new interface if needed through wpa_gui dialog
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE 802.11w/D7.0

2008-11-23 - v0.6.6
	* added Milenage SIM/USIM emulator for EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA
	  (can be used to simulate test SIM/USIM card with a known private key;
	  enable with CONFIG_SIM_SIMULATOR=y/CONFIG_USIM_SIMULATOR=y in .config
	  and password="Ki:OPc"/password="Ki:OPc:SQN" in network configuration)
	* added a new network configuration option, wpa_ptk_rekey, that can be
	  used to enforce frequent PTK rekeying, e.g., to mitigate some attacks
	  against TKIP deficiencies
	* added an optional mitigation mechanism for certain attacks against
	  TKIP by delaying Michael MIC error reports by a random amount of time
	  between 0 and 60 seconds; this can be enabled with a build option
	  CONFIG_DELAYED_MIC_ERROR_REPORT=y in .config
	* fixed EAP-AKA to use RES Length field in AT_RES as length in bits,
	  not bytes
	* updated OpenSSL code for EAP-FAST to use an updated version of the
	  session ticket overriding API that was included into the upstream
	  OpenSSL 0.9.9 tree on 2008-11-15 (no additional OpenSSL patch is
	  needed with that version anymore)
	* updated userspace MLME instructions to match with the current Linux
	  mac80211 implementation; please also note that this can only be used
	  with driver_nl80211.c (the old code from driver_wext.c was removed)
	* added support (Linux only) for RoboSwitch chipsets (often found in
	  consumer grade routers); driver interface 'roboswitch'
	* fixed canceling of PMKSA caching when using drivers that generate
	  RSN IE and refuse to drop PMKIDs that wpa_supplicant does not know
	  about

2008-11-01 - v0.6.5
	* added support for SHA-256 as X.509 certificate digest when using the
	  internal X.509/TLSv1 implementation
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE 802.11w/D6.0
	* added support for using SHA256-based stronger key derivation for WPA2
	  (IEEE 802.11w)
	* fixed FT (IEEE 802.11r) authentication after a failed association to
	  use correct FTIE
	* added support for configuring Phase 2 (inner/tunneled) authentication
	  method with wpa_gui-qt4

2008-08-10 - v0.6.4
	* added support for EAP Sequences in EAP-FAST Phase 2
	* added support for using TNC with EAP-FAST
	* added driver_ps3 for the PS3 Linux wireless driver
	* added support for optional cryptobinding with PEAPv0
	* fixed the OpenSSL patches (0.9.8g and 0.9.9) for EAP-FAST to
	  allow fallback to full handshake if server rejects PAC-Opaque
	* added fragmentation support for EAP-TNC
	* added support for parsing PKCS #8 formatted private keys into the
	  internal TLS implementation (both PKCS #1 RSA key and PKCS #8
	  encapsulated RSA key can now be used)
	* added option of using faster, but larger, routines in the internal
	  LibTomMath (for internal TLS implementation) to speed up DH and RSA
	  calculations (CONFIG_INTERNAL_LIBTOMMATH_FAST=y)
	* fixed race condition between disassociation event and group key
	  handshake to avoid getting stuck in incorrect state [Bug 261]
	* fixed opportunistic key caching (proactive_key_caching)

2008-02-22 - v0.6.3
	* removed 'nai' and 'eappsk' network configuration variables that were
	  previously used for configuring user identity and key for EAP-PSK,
	  EAP-PAX, EAP-SAKE, and EAP-GPSK. 'identity' field is now used as the
	  replacement for 'nai' (if old configuration used a separate
	  'identity' value, that would now be configured as
	  'anonymous_identity'). 'password' field is now used as the
	  replacement for 'eappsk' (it can also be set using hexstring to
	  present random binary data)
	* removed '-w' command line parameter (wait for interface to be added,
	  if needed); cleaner way of handling this functionality is to use an
	  external mechanism (e.g., hotplug scripts) that start wpa_supplicant
	  when an interface is added
	* updated FT support to use the latest draft, IEEE 802.11r/D9.0
	* added ctrl_iface monitor event (CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS) for
	  indicating when new scan results become available
	* added new ctrl_iface command, BSS, to allow scan results to be
	  fetched without hitting the message size limits (this command
	  can be used to iterate through the scan results one BSS at the time)
	* fixed EAP-SIM not to include AT_NONCE_MT and AT_SELECTED_VERSION
	  attributes in EAP-SIM Start/Response when using fast reauthentication
	* fixed EAPOL not to end up in infinite loop when processing dynamic
	  WEP keys with IEEE 802.1X
	* fixed problems in getting NDIS events from WMI on Windows 2000

2008-01-01 - v0.6.2
	* added support for Makefile builds to include debug-log-to-a-file
	  functionality (CONFIG_DEBUG_FILE=y and -f<path> on command line)
	* fixed EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA message parser to validate attribute
	  lengths properly to avoid potential crash caused by invalid messages
	* added data structure for storing allocated buffers (struct wpabuf);
	  this does not affect wpa_supplicant usage, but many of the APIs
	  changed and various interfaces (e.g., EAP) is not compatible with old
	  versions
	* added support for protecting EAP-AKA/Identity messages with
	  AT_CHECKCODE (optional feature in RFC 4187)
	* added support for protected result indication with AT_RESULT_IND for
	  EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA (phase1="result_ind=1")
	* added driver_wext workaround for race condition between scanning and
	  association with drivers that take very long time to scan all
	  channels (e.g., madwifi with dual-band cards); wpa_supplicant is now
	  using a longer hardcoded timeout for the scan if the driver supports
	  notifications for scan completion (SIOCGIWSCAN event); this helps,
	  e.g., in cases where wpa_supplicant and madwifi driver ended up in
	  loop where the driver did not even try to associate
	* stop EAPOL timer tick when no timers are in use in order to reduce
	  power consumption (no need to wake up the process once per second)
	  [Bug 237]
	* added support for privilege separation (run only minimal part of
	  wpa_supplicant functionality as root and rest as unprivileged,
	  non-root process); see 'Privilege separation' in README for details;
	  this is disabled by default and can be enabled with CONFIG_PRIVSEP=y
	  in .config
	* changed scan results data structure to include all information
	  elements to make it easier to support new IEs; old get_scan_result()
	  driver_ops is still supported for backwards compatibility (results
	  are converted internally to the new format), but all drivers should
	  start using the new get_scan_results2() to make them more likely to
	  work with new features
	* Qt4 version of wpa_gui (wpa_gui-qt4 subdirectory) is now native Qt4
	  application, i.e., it does not require Qt3Support anymore; Windows
	  binary of wpa_gui.exe is now from this directory and only requires
	  QtCore4.dll and QtGui4.dll libraries
	* updated Windows binary build to use Qt 4.3.3 and made Qt DLLs
	  available as a separate package to make wpa_gui installation easier:
	  http://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/qt4/wpa_gui-qt433-windows-dll.zip
	* added support for EAP-IKEv2 (draft-tschofenig-eap-ikev2-15.txt);
	  only shared key/password authentication is supported in this version

2007-11-24 - v0.6.1
	* added support for configuring password as NtPasswordHash
	  (16-byte MD4 hash of password) in hash:<32 hex digits> format
	* added support for fallback from abbreviated TLS handshake to
	  full handshake when using EAP-FAST (e.g., due to an expired
	  PAC-Opaque)
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-07.txt)
	* added support for drivers that take care of RSN 4-way handshake
	  internally (WPA_DRIVER_FLAGS_4WAY_HANDSHAKE in get_capa flags and
	  WPA_ALG_PMK in set_key)
	* added an experimental port for Mac OS X (CONFIG_DRIVER_OSX=y in
	  .config); this version supports only ap_scan=2 mode and allow the
	  driver to take care of the 4-way handshake
	* fixed a buffer overflow in parsing TSF from scan results when using
	  driver_wext.c with a driver that includes the TSF (e.g., iwl4965)
	  [Bug 232]
	* updated FT support to use the latest draft, IEEE 802.11r/D8.0
	* fixed an integer overflow issue in the ASN.1 parser used by the
	  (experimental) internal TLS implementation to avoid a potential
	  buffer read overflow
	* fixed a race condition with -W option (wait for a control interface
	  monitor before starting) that could have caused the first messages to
	  be lost
	* added support for processing TNCC-TNCS-Messages to report
	  recommendation (allow/none/isolate) when using TNC [Bug 243]

2007-05-28 - v0.6.0
	* added network configuration parameter 'frequency' for setting
	  initial channel for IBSS (adhoc) networks
	* added experimental IEEE 802.11r/D6.0 support
	* updated EAP-SAKE to RFC 4763 and the IANA-allocated EAP type 48
	* updated EAP-PSK to use the IANA-allocated EAP type 47
	* fixed EAP-PAX key derivation
	* fixed EAP-PSK bit ordering of the Flags field
	* fixed EAP-PEAP/TTLS/FAST to use the correct EAP identifier in
	  tunnelled identity request (previously, the identifier from the outer
	  method was used, not the tunnelled identifier which could be
	  different)
	* added support for fragmentation of outer TLS packets during Phase 2
	  of EAP-PEAP/TTLS/FAST
	* fixed EAP-TTLS AVP parser processing for too short AVP lengths
	* added support for EAP-FAST authentication with inner methods that
	  generate MSK (e.g., EAP-MSCHAPv2 that was previously only supported
	  for PAC provisioning)
	* added support for authenticated EAP-FAST provisioning
	* added support for configuring maximum number of EAP-FAST PACs to
	  store in a PAC list (fast_max_pac_list_len=<max> in phase1 string)
	* added support for storing EAP-FAST PACs in binary format
	  (fast_pac_format=binary in phase1 string)
	* fixed dbus ctrl_iface to validate message interface before
	  dispatching to avoid a possible segfault [Bug 190]
	* fixed PeerKey key derivation to use the correct PRF label
	* updated Windows binary build to link against OpenSSL 0.9.8d and
	  added support for EAP-FAST
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-04.txt)
	* fixed EAP-AKA Notification processing to allow Notification to be
	  processed after AKA Challenge response has been sent
	* updated to use IEEE 802.11w/D2.0 for management frame protection
	  (still experimental)
	* fixed EAP-TTLS implementation not to crash on use of freed memory
	  if TLS library initialization fails
	* added support for EAP-TNC (Trusted Network Connect)
	  (this version implements the EAP-TNC method and EAP-TTLS changes
	  needed to run two methods in sequence (IF-T) and the IF-IMC and
	  IF-TNCCS interfaces from TNCC)

2006-11-24 - v0.5.6
	* added experimental, integrated TLSv1 client implementation with the
	  needed X.509/ASN.1/RSA/bignum processing (this can be enabled by
	  setting CONFIG_TLS=internal and CONFIG_INTERNAL_LIBTOMMATH=y in
	  .config); this can be useful, e.g., if the target system does not
	  have a suitable TLS library and a minimal code size is required
	  (total size of this internal TLS/crypto code is bit under 50 kB on
	  x86 and the crypto code is shared by rest of the supplicant so some
	  of it was already required; TLSv1/X.509/ASN.1/RSA added about 25 kB)
	* removed STAKey handshake since PeerKey handshake has replaced it in
	  IEEE 802.11ma and there are no known deployments of STAKey
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-01.txt)
	* added preliminary implementation of IEEE 802.11w/D1.0 (management
	  frame protection)
	  (Note: this requires driver support to work properly.)
	  (Note2: IEEE 802.11w is an unapproved draft and subject to change.)
	* fixed Windows named pipes ctrl_iface to not stop listening for
	  commands if client program opens a named pipe and closes it
	  immediately without sending a command
	* fixed USIM PIN status determination for the case that PIN is not
	  needed (this allows EAP-AKA to be used with USIM cards that do not
	  use PIN)
	* added support for reading 3G USIM AID from EF_DIR to allow EAP-AKA to
	  be used with cards that do not support file selection based on
	  partial AID
	* added support for matching the subjectAltName of the authentication
	  server certificate against multiple name components (e.g.,
	  altsubject_match="DNS:server.example.com;DNS:server2.example.com")
	* fixed EAP-SIM/AKA key derivation for re-authentication case (only
	  affects IEEE 802.1X with dynamic WEP keys)
	* changed ctrl_iface network configuration 'get' operations to not
	  return password/key material; if these fields are requested, "*"
	  will be returned if the password/key is set, but the value of the
	  parameter is not exposed

2006-08-27 - v0.5.5
	* added support for building Windows version with UNICODE defined
	  (wide-char functions)
	* driver_ndis: fixed static WEP configuration to avoid race condition
	  issues with some NDIS drivers between association and setting WEP
	  keys
	* driver_ndis: added validation for IELength value in scan results to
	  avoid crashes when using buggy NDIS drivers [Bug 165]
	* fixed Release|Win32 target in the Visual Studio project files
	  (previously, only Debug|Win32 target was set properly)
	* changed control interface API call wpa_ctrl_pending() to allow it to
	  return -1 on error (e.g., connection lost); control interface clients
	  will need to make sure that they verify that the value is indeed >0
	  when determining whether there are pending messages
	* added an alternative control interface backend for Windows targets:
	  Named Pipe (CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE=named_pipe); this is now the default
	  control interface mechanism for Windows builds (previously, UDP to
	  localhost was used)
	* changed ctrl_interface configuration for UNIX domain sockets:
	  - deprecated ctrl_interface_group variable (it may be removed in
	    future versions)
	  - allow both directory and group be configured with ctrl_interface
	    in following format: DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wheel
	  - ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant is still supported for the
	    case when group is not changed
	* added support for controlling more than one interface per process in
	  Windows version
	* added a workaround for a case where the AP is using unknown address
	  (e.g., MAC address of the wired interface) as the source address for
	  EAPOL-Key frames; previously, that source address was used as the
	  destination for EAPOL-Key frames and in key derivation; now, BSSID is
	  used even if the source address does not match with it
	  (this resolves an interoperability issue with Thomson SpeedTouch 580)
	* added a workaround for UDP-based control interface (which was used in
	  Windows builds before this release) to prevent packets with forged
	  addresses from being accepted as local control requests
	* removed ndis_events.cpp and possibility of using external
	  ndis_events.exe; C version (ndis_events.c) is fully functional and
	  there is no desire to maintain two separate versions of this
	  implementation
	* ndis_events: Changed NDIS event notification design to use WMI to
	  learn the adapter description through Win32_PnPEntity class; this
	  should fix some cases where the adapter name was not recognized
	  correctly (e.g., with some USB WLAN adapters, e.g., Ralink RT2500
	  USB) [Bug 113]
	* fixed selection of the first network in ap_scan=2 mode; previously,
	  wpa_supplicant could get stuck in SCANNING state when only the first
	  network for enabled (e.g., after 'wpa_cli select_network 0')
	* winsvc: added support for configuring ctrl_interface parameters in
	  registry (ctrl_interface string value in
	  HKLM\SOFTWARE\wpa_supplicant\interfaces\0000 key); this new value is
	  required to enable control interface (previously, this was hardcoded
	  to be enabled)
	* allow wpa_gui subdirectory to be built with both Qt3 and Qt4
	* converted wpa_gui-qt4 subdirectory to use Qt4 specific project format

2006-06-20 - v0.5.4
	* fixed build with CONFIG_STAKEY=y [Bug 143]
	* added support for doing MLME (IEEE 802.11 management frame
	  processing) in wpa_supplicant when using Devicescape IEEE 802.11
	  stack (wireless-dev.git tree)
	* added a new network block configuration option, fragment_size, to
	  configure the maximum EAP fragment size
	* driver_ndis: Disable WZC automatically for the selected interface to
	  avoid conflicts with two programs trying to control the radio; WZC
	  will be re-enabled (if it was enabled originally) when wpa_supplicant
	  is terminated
	* added an experimental TLSv1 client implementation
	  (CONFIG_TLS=internal) that can be used instead of an external TLS
	  library, e.g., to reduce total size requirement on systems that do
	  not include any TLS library by default (this is not yet complete;
	  basic functionality is there, but certificate validation is not yet
	  included)
	* added PeerKey handshake implementation for IEEE 802.11e
	  direct link setup (DLS) to replace STAKey handshake
	* fixed WPA PSK update through ctrl_iface for the case where the old
	  PSK was derived from an ASCII passphrase and the new PSK is set as
	  a raw PSK (hex string)
	* added new configuration option for identifying which network block
	  was used (id_str in wpa_supplicant.conf; included on
	  WPA_EVENT_CONNECT monitor event and as WPA_ID_STR environmental
	  variable in wpa_cli action scripts; in addition WPA_ID variable is
	  set to the current unique identifier that wpa_supplicant assigned
	  automatically for the network and that can be used with
	  GET_NETWORK/SET_NETWORK ctrl_iface commands)
	* wpa_cli action script is now called only when the connect/disconnect
	  status changes or when associating with a different network
	* fixed configuration parser not to remove CCMP from group cipher list
	  if WPA-None (adhoc) is used (pairwise=NONE in that case)
	* fixed integrated NDIS events processing not to hang the process due
	  to a missed change in eloop_win.c API in v0.5.3 [Bug 155]
	* added support for EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK,
	  draft-clancy-emu-eap-shared-secret-00.txt)
	* added Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 solution and project files for
	  build wpa_supplicant for Windows (see vs2005 subdirectory)
	* eloop_win: fixed unregistration of Windows events
	* l2_packet_winpcap: fixed a deadlock in deinitializing l2_packet
	  at the end of RSN pre-authentication and added unregistration of
	  a Windows event to avoid getting eloop_win stuck with an invalid
	  handle
	* driver_ndis: added support for selecting AP based on BSSID
	* added new environmental variable for wpa_cli action scripts:
	  WPA_CTRL_DIR is the current control interface directory
	* driver_ndis: added support for using NDISUIO instead of WinPcap for
	  OID set/query operations (CONFIG_USE_NDISUIO=y in .config); with new
	  l2_packet_ndis (CONFIG_L2_PACKET=ndis), this can be used to build
	  wpa_supplicant without requiring WinPcap; note that using NDISUIO
	  requires that WZC is disabled (net stop wzcsvc) since NDISUIO allows
	  only one application to open the device
	* changed NDIS driver naming to only include device GUID, e.g.,
	  {7EE3EFE5-C165-472F-986D-F6FBEDFE8C8D}, instead of including WinPcap
	  specific \Device\NPF_ prefix before the GUID; the prefix is still
	  allowed for backwards compatibility, but it is not required anymore
	  when specifying the interface
	* driver_ndis: re-initialize driver interface is the adapter is removed
	  and re-inserted [Bug 159]
	* driver_madwifi: fixed TKIP and CCMP sequence number configuration on
	  big endian hosts [Bug 146]

2006-04-27 - v0.5.3
	* fixed EAP-GTC response to include correct user identity when run as
	  phase 2 method of EAP-FAST (i.e., EAP-FAST did not work in v0.5.2)
	* driver_ndis: Fixed encryption mode configuration for unencrypted
	  networks (some NDIS drivers ignored this, but others, e.g., Broadcom,
	  refused to associate with open networks) [Bug 106]
	* driver_ndis: use BSSID OID polling to detect when IBSS network is
	  formed even when ndis_events code is included since some NDIS drivers
	  do not generate media connect events in IBSS mode
	* config_winreg: allow global ctrl_interface parameter to be configured
	  in Windows registry
	* config_winreg: added support for saving configuration data into
	  Windows registry
	* added support for controlling network device operational state
	  (dormant/up) for Linux 2.6.17 to improve DHCP processing (see
	  http://www.flamewarmaster.de/software/dhcpclient/ for a DHCP client
	  that can use this information)
	* driver_wext: added support for WE-21 change to SSID configuration
	* driver_wext: fixed privacy configuration for static WEP keys mode
	  [Bug 140]
	* added an optional driver_ops callback for MLME-SETPROTECTION.request
	  primitive
	* added support for EAP-SAKE (no EAP method number allocated yet, so
	  this is using the same experimental type 255 as EAP-PSK)
	* added support for dynamically loading EAP methods (.so files) instead
	  of requiring them to be statically linked in; this is disabled by
	  default (see CONFIG_DYNAMIC_EAP_METHODS in defconfig for information
	  on how to use this)

2006-03-19 - v0.5.2
	* do not try to use USIM APDUs when initializing PC/SC for SIM card
	  access for a network that has not enabled EAP-AKA
	* fixed EAP phase 2 Nak for EAP-{PEAP,TTLS,FAST} (this was broken in
	  v0.5.1 due to the new support for expanded EAP types)
	* added support for generating EAP Expanded Nak
	* try to fetch scan results once before requesting new scan when
	  starting up in ap_scan=1 mode (this can speed up initial association
	  a lot with, e.g., madwifi-ng driver)
	* added support for receiving EAPOL frames from a Linux bridge
	  interface (-bbr0 on command line)
	* fixed EAPOL re-authentication for sessions that used PMKSA caching
	* changed EAP method registration to use a dynamic list of methods
	  instead of a static list generated at build time
	* fixed PMKSA cache deinitialization not to use freed memory when
	  removing PMKSA entries
	* fixed a memory leak in EAP-TTLS re-authentication
	* reject WPA/WPA2 message 3/4 if it does not include any valid
	  WPA/RSN IE
	* driver_wext: added fallback to use SIOCSIWENCODE for setting auth_alg
	  if the driver does not support SIOCSIWAUTH

2006-01-29 - v0.5.1
	* driver_test: added better support for multiple APs and STAs by using
	  a directory with sockets that include MAC address for each device in
	  the name (driver_param=test_dir=/tmp/test)
	* added support for EAP expanded type (vendor specific EAP methods)
	* added AP_SCAN command into ctrl_iface so that ap_scan configuration
	  option can be changed if needed
	* wpa_cli/wpa_gui: skip non-socket files in control directory when
	  using UNIX domain sockets; this avoids selecting an incorrect
	  interface (e.g., a PID file could be in this directory, even though
	  use of this directory for something else than socket files is not
	  recommended)
	* fixed TLS library deinitialization after RSN pre-authentication not
	  to disable TLS library for normal authentication
	* driver_wext: Remove null-termination from SSID length if the driver
	  used it; some Linux drivers do this and they were causing problems in
	  wpa_supplicant not finding matching configuration block. This change
	  would break a case where the SSID actually ends in '\0', but that is
	  not likely to happen in real use.
	* fixed PMKSA cache processing not to trigger deauthentication if the
	  current PMKSA cache entry is replaced with a valid new entry
	* fixed PC/SC initialization for ap_scan != 1 modes (this fixes
	  EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA with real SIM/USIM card when using ap_scan=0 or
	  ap_scan=2)

2005-12-18 - v0.5.0 (beginning of 0.5.x development releases)
	* added experimental STAKey handshake implementation for IEEE 802.11e
	  direct link setup (DLS); note: this is disabled by default in both
	  build and runtime configuration (can be enabled with CONFIG_STAKEY=y
	  and stakey=1)
	* fixed EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA pseudonym and fast re-authentication to
	  decrypt AT_ENCR_DATA attributes correctly
	* fixed EAP-AKA to allow resynchronization within the same session
	* made code closer to ANSI C89 standard to make it easier to port to
	  other C libraries and compilers
	* started moving operating system or C library specific functions into
	  wrapper functions defined in os.h and implemented in os_*.c to make
	  code more portable
	* wpa_supplicant can now be built with Microsoft Visual C++
	  (e.g., with the freely available Toolkit 2003 version or Visual
	  C++ 2005 Express Edition and Platform SDK); see nmake.mak for an
	  example makefile for nmake
	* added support for using Windows registry for command line parameters
	  (CONFIG_MAIN=main_winsvc) and configuration data
	  (CONFIG_BACKEND=winreg); see win_example.reg for an example registry
	  contents; this version can be run both as a Windows service and as a
	  normal application; 'wpasvc.exe app' to start as applicant,
	  'wpasvc.exe reg <full path to wpasvc.exe>' to register a service,
	  'net start wpasvc' to start the service, 'wpasvc.exe unreg' to
	  unregister a service
	* made it possible to link ndis_events.exe functionality into
	  wpa_supplicant.exe by defining CONFIG_NDIS_EVENTS_INTEGRATED
	* added better support for multiple control interface backends
	  (CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE option); currently, 'unix' and 'udp' are supported
	* fixed PC/SC code to use correct length for GSM AUTH command buffer
	  and to not use pioRecvPci with SCardTransmit() calls; these were not
	  causing visible problems with pcsc-lite, but Windows Winscard.dll
	  refused the previously used parameters; this fixes EAP-SIM and
	  EAP-AKA authentication using SIM/USIM card under Windows
	* added new event loop implementation for Windows using
	  WaitForMultipleObject() instead of select() in order to allow waiting
	  for non-socket objects; this can be selected with
	  CONFIG_ELOOP=eloop_win in .config
	* added support for selecting l2_packet implementation in .config
	  (CONFIG_L2_PACKET; following options are available now: linux, pcap,
	  winpcap, freebsd, none)
	* added new l2_packet implementation for WinPcap
	  (CONFIG_L2_PACKET=winpcap) that uses a separate receive thread to
	  reduce latency in EAPOL receive processing from about 100 ms to about
	  3 ms
	* added support for EAP-FAST key derivation using other ciphers than
	  RC4-128-SHA for authentication and AES128-SHA for provisioning
	* added support for configuring CA certificate as DER file and as a
	  configuration blob
	* fixed private key configuration as configuration blob and added
	  support for using PKCS#12 as a blob
	* tls_gnutls: added support for using PKCS#12 files; added support for
	  session resumption
	* added support for loading trusted CA certificates from Windows
	  certificate store: ca_cert="cert_store://<name>", where <name> is
	  likely CA (Intermediate CA certificates) or ROOT (root certificates)
	* added C version of ndis_events.cpp and made it possible to build this
	  with MinGW so that CONFIG_NDIS_EVENTS_INTEGRATED can be used more
	  easily on cross-compilation builds
	* added wpasvc.exe into Windows binary release; this is an alternative
	  version of wpa_supplicant.exe with configuration backend using
	  Windows registry and with the entry point designed to run as a
	  Windows service
	* integrated ndis_events.exe functionality into wpa_supplicant.exe and
	  wpasvc.exe and removed this additional tool from the Windows binary
	  release since it is not needed anymore
	* load winscard.dll functions dynamically when building with MinGW
	  since MinGW does not yet include winscard library

2005-11-20 - v0.4.7 (beginning of 0.4.x stable releases)
	* l2_packet_pcap: fixed wired IEEE 802.1X authentication with libpcap
	  and WinPcap to receive frames sent to PAE group address
	* disable EAP state machine when IEEE 802.1X authentication is not used
	  in order to get rid of bogus "EAP failed" messages
	* fixed OpenSSL error reporting to go through all pending errors to
	  avoid confusing reports of old errors being reported at later point
	  during handshake
	* fixed configuration file updating to not write empty variables
	  (e.g., proto or key_mgmt) that the file parser would not accept
	* fixed ADD_NETWORK ctrl_iface command to use the same default values
	  for variables as empty network definitions read from config file
	  would get
	* fixed EAP state machine to not discard EAP-Failure messages in many
	  cases (e.g., during TLS handshake)
	* fixed a infinite loop in private key reading if the configured file
	  cannot be parsed successfully
	* driver_madwifi: added support for madwifi-ng
	* wpa_gui: do not display password/PSK field contents
	* wpa_gui: added CA certificate configuration
	* driver_ndis: fixed scan request in ap_scan=2 mode not to change SSID
	* driver_ndis: include Beacon IEs in AssocInfo in order to notice if
	  the new AP is using different WPA/RSN IE
	* use longer timeout for IEEE 802.11 association to avoid problems with
	  drivers that may take more than five second to associate

2005-10-27 - v0.4.6
	* allow fallback to WPA, if mixed WPA+WPA2 networks have mismatch in
	  RSN IE, but WPA IE would match with wpa_supplicant configuration
	* added support for named configuration blobs in order to avoid having
	  to use file system for external files (e.g., certificates);
	  variables can be set to "blob://<blob name>" instead of file path to
	  use a named blob; supported fields: pac_file, client_cert,
	  private_key
	* fixed RSN pre-authentication (it was broken in the clean up of WPA
	  state machine interface in v0.4.5)
	* driver_madwifi: set IEEE80211_KEY_GROUP flag for group keys to make
	  sure the driver configures broadcast decryption correctly
	* added ca_path (and ca_path2) configuration variables that can be used
	  to configure OpenSSL CA path, e.g., /etc/ssl/certs, for using the
	  system-wide trusted CA list
	* added support for starting wpa_supplicant without a configuration
	  file (-C argument must be used to set ctrl_interface parameter for
	  this case; in addition, -p argument can be used to provide
	  driver_param; these new arguments can also be used with a
	  configuration to override the values from the configuration)
	* added global control interface that can be optionally used for adding
	  and removing network interfaces dynamically (-g command line argument
	  for both wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli) without having to restart
	  wpa_supplicant process
	* wpa_gui:
	  - try to save configuration whenever something is modified
	  - added WEP key configuration
	  - added possibility to edit the current network configuration
	* driver_ndis: fixed driver polling not to increase frequency on each
	  received EAPOL frame due to incorrectly cancelled timeout
	* added simple configuration file examples (in examples subdirectory)
	* fixed driver_wext.c to filter wireless events based on ifindex to
	  avoid interfaces receiving events from other interfaces
	* delay sending initial EAPOL-Start couple of seconds to speed up
	  authentication for the most common case of Authenticator starting
	  EAP authentication immediately after association

2005-09-25 - v0.4.5
	* added a workaround for clearing keys with ndiswrapper to allow
	  roaming from WPA enabled AP to plaintext one
	* added docbook documentation (doc/docbook) that can be used to
	  generate, e.g., man pages
	* l2_packet_linux: use socket type SOCK_DGRAM instead of SOCK_RAW for
	  PF_PACKET in order to prepare for network devices that do not use
	  Ethernet headers (e.g., network stack with native IEEE 802.11 frames)
	* use receipt of EAPOL-Key frame as a lower layer success indication
	  for EAP state machine to allow recovery from dropped EAP-Success
	  frame
	* cleaned up internal EAPOL frame processing by not including link
	  layer (Ethernet) header during WPA and EAPOL/EAP processing; this
	  header is added only when transmitted the frame; this makes it easier
	  to use wpa_supplicant on link layers that use different header than
	  Ethernet
	* updated EAP-PSK to use draft 9 by default since this can now be
	  tested with hostapd; removed support for draft 3, including
	  server_nai configuration option from network blocks
	* driver_wired: add PAE address to the multicast address list in order
	  to be able to receive EAPOL frames with drivers that do not include
	  these multicast addresses by default
	* driver_wext: add support for WE-19
	* added support for multiple configuration backends (CONFIG_BACKEND
	  option); currently, only 'file' is supported (i.e., the format used
	  in wpa_supplicant.conf)
	* added support for updating configuration ('wpa_cli save_config');
	  this is disabled by default and can be enabled with global
	  update_config=1 variable in wpa_supplicant.conf; this allows wpa_cli
	  and wpa_gui to store the configuration changes in a permanent store
	* added GET_NETWORK ctrl_iface command
	  (e.g., 'wpa_cli get_network 0 ssid')

2005-08-21 - v0.4.4
	* replaced OpenSSL patch for EAP-FAST support
	  (openssl-tls-extensions.patch) with a more generic and correct
	  patch (the new patch is not compatible with the previous one, so the
	  OpenSSL library will need to be patched with the new patch in order
	  to be able to build wpa_supplicant with EAP-FAST support)
	* added support for using Windows certificate store (through CryptoAPI)
	  for client certificate and private key operations (EAP-TLS)
	  (see wpa_supplicant.conf for more information on how to configure
	  this with private_key)
	* ported wpa_gui to Windows
	* added Qt4 version of wpa_gui (wpa_gui-qt4 directory); this can be
	  built with the open source version of the Qt4 for Windows
	* allow non-WPA modes (e.g., IEEE 802.1X with dynamic WEP) to be used
	  with drivers that do not support WPA
	* ndis_events: fixed Windows 2000 support
	* added support for enabling/disabling networks from the list of all
	  configured networks ('wpa_cli enable_network <network id>' and
	  'wpa_cli disable_network <network id>')
	* added support for adding and removing network from the current
	  configuration ('wpa_cli add_network' and 'wpa_cli remove_network
	  <network id>'); added networks are disabled by default and they can
	  be enabled with enable_network command once the configuration is done
	  for the new network; note: configuration file is not yet updated, so
	  these new networks are lost when wpa_supplicant is restarted
	* added support for setting network configuration parameters through
	  the control interface, for example:
	  wpa_cli set_network 0 ssid "\"my network\""
	* fixed parsing of strings that include both " and # within double
	  quoted area (e.g., "start"#end")
	* added EAP workaround for PEAP session resumption: allow outer,
	  i.e., not tunneled, EAP-Success to terminate session since; this can
	  be disabled with eap_workaround=0
	  (this was allowed for PEAPv1 before, but now it is also allowed for
	  PEAPv0 since at least one RADIUS authentication server seems to be
	  doing this for PEAPv0, too)
	* wpa_gui: added preliminary support for adding new networks to the
	  wpa_supplicant configuration (double click on the scan results to
	  open network configuration)

2005-06-26 - v0.4.3
	* removed interface for external EAPOL/EAP supplicant (e.g.,
	  Xsupplicant), (CONFIG_XSUPPLICANT_IFACE) since it is not required
	  anymore and is unlikely to be used by anyone
	* driver_ndis: fixed WinPcap 3.0 support
	* fixed build with CONFIG_DNET_PCAP=y on Linux
	* l2_packet: moved different implementations into separate files
	  (l2_packet_*.c)

2005-06-12 - v0.4.2
	* driver_ipw: updated driver structures to match with ipw2200-1.0.4
	  (note: ipw2100-1.1.0 is likely to require an update to work with
	  this)
	* added support for using ap_scan=2 mode with multiple network blocks;
	  wpa_supplicant will go through the networks one by one until the
	  driver reports a successful association; this uses the same order for
	  networks as scan_ssid=1 scans, i.e., the priority field is ignored
	  and the network block order in the file is used instead
	* fixed a potential issue in RSN pre-authentication ending up using
	  freed memory if pre-authentication times out
	* added support for matching alternative subject name extensions of the
	  authentication server certificate; new configuration variables
	  altsubject_match and altsubject_match2
	* driver_ndis: added support for IEEE 802.1X authentication with wired
	  NDIS drivers
	* added support for querying private key password (EAP-TLS) through the
	  control interface (wpa_cli/wpa_gui) if one is not included in the
	  configuration file
	* driver_broadcom: fixed couple of memory leaks in scan result
	  processing
	* EAP-PAX is now registered as EAP type 46
	* fixed EAP-PAX MAC calculation
	* fixed EAP-PAX CK and ICK key derivation
	* added support for using password with EAP-PAX (as an alternative to
	  entering key with eappsk); SHA-1 hash of the password will be used as
	  the key in this case
	* added support for arbitrary driver interface parameters through the
	  configuration file with a new driver_param field; this adds a new
	  driver_ops function set_param()
	* added possibility to override l2_packet module with driver interface
	  API (new send_eapol handler); this can be used to implement driver
	  specific TX/RX functions for EAPOL frames
	* fixed ctrl_interface_group processing for the case where gid is
	  entered as a number, not group name
	* driver_test: added support for testing hostapd with wpa_supplicant
	  by using test driver interface without any kernel drivers or network
	  cards

2005-05-22 - v0.4.1
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WPA/WPA2 mode configuration to allow EAPOL
	  packets to be encrypted; this was apparently broken by the changed
	  ioctl order in v0.4.0
	* driver_madwifi: added preliminary support for compiling against 'BSD'
	  branch of madwifi CVS tree
	* added support for EAP-MSCHAPv2 password retries within the same EAP
	  authentication session
	* added support for password changes with EAP-MSCHAPv2 (used when the
	  password has expired)
	* added support for reading additional certificates from PKCS#12 files
	  and adding them to the certificate chain
	* fixed association with IEEE 802.1X (no WPA) when dynamic WEP keys
	  were used
	* fixed a possible double free in EAP-TTLS fast-reauthentication when
	  identity or password is entered through control interface
	* display EAP Notification messages to user through control interface
	  with "CTRL-EVENT-EAP-NOTIFICATION" prefix
	* added GUI version of wpa_cli, wpa_gui; this is not build
	  automatically with 'make'; use 'make wpa_gui' to build (this requires
	  Qt development tools)
	* added 'disconnect' command to control interface for setting
	  wpa_supplicant in state where it will not associate before
	  'reassociate' command has been used
	* added support for selecting a network from the list of all configured
	  networks ('wpa_cli select_network <network id>'; this disabled all
	  other networks; to re-enable, 'wpa_cli select_network any')
	* added support for getting scan results through control interface
	* added EAP workaround for PEAPv1 session resumption: allow outer,
	  i.e., not tunneled, EAP-Success to terminate session since; this can
	  be disabled with eap_workaround=0

2005-04-25 - v0.4.0 (beginning of 0.4.x development releases)
	* added a new build time option, CONFIG_NO_STDOUT_DEBUG, that can be
	  used to reduce the size of the wpa_supplicant considerably if
	  debugging code is not needed
	* fixed EAPOL-Key validation to drop packets with invalid Key Data
	  Length; such frames could have crashed wpa_supplicant due to buffer
	  overflow
	* added support for wired authentication (IEEE 802.1X on wired
	  Ethernet); driver interface 'wired'
	* obsoleted set_wpa() handler in the driver interface API (it can be
	  replaced by moving enable/disable functionality into init()/deinit())
	  (calls to set_wpa() are still present for backwards compatibility,
	  but they may be removed in the future)
	* driver_madwifi: fixed association in plaintext mode
	* modified the EAP workaround that accepts EAP-Success with incorrect
	  Identifier to be even less strict about verification in order to
	  interoperate with some authentication servers
	* added support for sending TLS alerts
	* added support for 'any' SSID wildcard; if ssid is not configured or
	  is set to an empty string, any SSID will be accepted for non-WPA AP
	* added support for asking PIN (for SIM) from frontends (e.g.,
	  wpa_cli); if a PIN is needed, but not included in the configuration
	  file, a control interface request is sent and EAP processing is
	  delayed until the PIN is available
	* added support for using external devices (e.g., a smartcard) for
	  private key operations in EAP-TLS (CONFIG_SMARTCARD=y in .config);
	  new wpa_supplicant.conf variables:
	  - global: opensc_engine_path, pkcs11_engine_path, pkcs11_module_path
	  - network: engine, engine_id, key_id
	* added experimental support for EAP-PAX
	* added monitor mode for wpa_cli (-a<path to a program to run>) that
	  allows external commands (e.g., shell scripts) to be run based on
	  wpa_supplicant events, e.g., when authentication has been completed
	  and data connection is ready; other related wpa_cli arguments:
	  -B (run in background), -P (write PID file); wpa_supplicant has a new
	  command line argument (-W) that can be used to make it wait until a
	  control interface command is received in order to avoid missing
	  events
	* added support for opportunistic WPA2 PMKSA key caching (disabled by
	  default, can be enabled with proactive_key_caching=1)
	* fixed RSN IE in 4-Way Handshake message 2/4 for the case where
	  Authenticator rejects PMKSA caching attempt and the driver is not
	  using assoc_info events
	* added -P<pid file> argument for wpa_supplicant to write the current
	  process id into a file

2005-02-12 - v0.3.7 (beginning of 0.3.x stable releases)
	* added new phase1 option parameter, include_tls_length=1, to force
	  wpa_supplicant to add TLS Message Length field to all TLS messages
	  even if the packet is not fragmented; this may be needed with some
	  authentication servers
	* fixed WPA/RSN IE verification in message 3 of 4-Way Handshake when
	  using drivers that take care of AP selection (e.g., when using
	  ap_scan=2)
	* fixed reprocessing of pending request after ctrl_iface requests for
	  identity/password/otp
	* fixed ctrl_iface requests for identity/password/otp in Phase 2 of
	  EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS
	* all drivers using driver_wext: set interface up and select Managed
	  mode when starting wpa_supplicant; set interface down when exiting
	* renamed driver_ipw2100.c to driver_ipw.c since it now supports both
	  ipw2100 and ipw2200; please note that this also changed the
	  configuration variable in .config to CONFIG_DRIVER_IPW

2005-01-24 - v0.3.6
	* fixed a busy loop introduced in v0.3.5 for scan result processing
	  when no matching AP is found

2005-01-23 - v0.3.5
	* added a workaround for an interoperability issue with a Cisco AP
	  when using WPA2-PSK
	* fixed non-WPA IEEE 802.1X to use the same authentication timeout as
	  WPA with IEEE 802.1X (i.e., timeout 10 -> 70 sec to allow
	  retransmission of dropped frames)
	* fixed issues with 64-bit CPUs and SHA1 cleanup in previous version
	  (e.g., segfault when processing EAPOL-Key frames)
	* fixed EAP workaround and fast reauthentication configuration for
	  RSN pre-authentication; previously these were disabled and
	  pre-authentication would fail if the used authentication server
	  requires EAP workarounds
	* added support for blacklisting APs that fail or timeout
	  authentication in ap_scan=1 mode so that all APs are tried in cases
	  where the ones with strongest signal level are failing authentication
	* fixed CA certificate loading after a failed EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS
	  authentication attempt
	* allow EAP-PEAP/TTLS fast reauthentication only if Phase 2 succeeded
	  in the previous authentication (previously, only Phase 1 success was
	  verified)

2005-01-09 - v0.3.4
	* added preliminary support for IBSS (ad-hoc) mode configuration
	  (mode=1 in network block); this included a new key_mgmt mode
	  WPA-NONE, i.e., TKIP or CCMP with a fixed key (based on psk) and no
	  key management; see wpa_supplicant.conf for more details and an
	  example on how to configure this (note: this is currently implemented
	  only for driver_hostapd.c, but the changes should be trivial to add
	  in associate() handler for other drivers, too (assuming the driver
	  supports WPA-None)
	* added preliminary port for native Windows (i.e., no cygwin) using
	  mingw

2005-01-02 - v0.3.3
	* added optional support for GNU Readline and History Libraries for
	  wpa_cli (CONFIG_READLINE)
	* cleaned up EAP state machine <-> method interface and number of
	  small problems with error case processing not terminating on
	  EAP-Failure but waiting for timeout
	* added couple of workarounds for interoperability issues with a
	  Cisco AP when using WPA2
	* added support for EAP-FAST (draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-00.txt);
	  Note: This requires a patch for openssl to add support for TLS
	  extensions and number of workarounds for operations without
	  certificates. Proof of concept type of experimental patch is
	  included in openssl-tls-extensions.patch.

2004-12-19 - v0.3.2
	* fixed private key loading for cases where passphrase is not set
	* fixed Windows/cygwin L2 packet handler freeing; previous version
	  could cause a segfault when RSN pre-authentication was completed
	* added support for PMKSA caching with drivers that generate RSN IEs
	  (e.g., NDIS); currently, this is only implemented in driver_ndis.c,
	  but similar code can be easily added to driver_ndiswrapper.c once
	  ndiswrapper gets full support for RSN PMKSA caching
	* improved recovery from PMKID mismatches by requesting full EAP
	  authentication in case of failed PMKSA caching attempt
	* driver_ndis: added support for NDIS NdisMIncidateStatus() events
	  (this requires that ndis_events is ran while wpa_supplicant is
	  running)
	* driver_ndis: use ADD_WEP/REMOVE_WEP when configuring WEP keys
	* added support for driver interfaces to replace the interface name
	  based on driver/OS specific mapping, e.g., in case of driver_ndis,
	  this allows the beginning of the adapter description to be used as
	  the interface name
	* added support for CR+LF (Windows-style) line ends in configuration
	  file
	* driver_ndis: enable radio before starting scanning, disable radio
	  when exiting
	* modified association event handler to set portEnabled = FALSE before
	  clearing port Valid in order to reset EAP state machine and avoid
	  problems with new authentication getting ignored because of state
	  machines ending up in AUTHENTICATED/SUCCESS state based on old
	  information
	* added support for driver events to add PMKID candidates in order to
	  allow drivers to give priority to most likely roaming candidates
	* driver_hostap: moved PrivacyInvoked configuration to associate()
	  function so that this will not be set for plaintext connections
	* added KEY_MGMT_802_1X_NO_WPA as a new key_mgmt type so that driver
	  interface can distinguish plaintext and IEEE 802.1X (no WPA)
	  authentication
	* fixed static WEP key configuration to use broadcast/default type for
	  all keys (previously, the default TX key was configured as pairwise/
	  unicast key)
	* driver_ndis: added legacy WPA capability detection for non-WPA2
	  drivers
	* added support for setting static WEP keys for IEEE 802.1X without
	  dynamic WEP keying (eapol_flags=0)

2004-12-12 - v0.3.1
	* added support for reading PKCS#12 (PFX) files (as a replacement for
	  PEM/DER) to get certificate and private key (CONFIG_PKCS12)
	* fixed compilation with CONFIG_PCSC=y
	* added new ap_scan mode, ap_scan=2, for drivers that take care of
	  association, but need to be configured with security policy and SSID,
	  e.g., ndiswrapper and NDIS driver; this mode should allow such
	  drivers to work with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; when
	  ap_scan=2 is used, only the first network block in the configuration
	  file is used and this configuration should have explicit security
	  policy (i.e., only one option in the lists) for key_mgmt, pairwise,
	  group, proto variables
	* added experimental port of wpa_supplicant for Windows
	  - driver_ndis.c driver interface (NDIS OIDs)
	  - currently, this requires cygwin and WinPcap
	  - small utility, win_if_list, can be used to get interface name
	* control interface can now be removed at build time; add
	  CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE=y to .config to maintain old functionality
	* optional Xsupplicant interface can now be removed at build time;
	  (CONFIG_XSUPPLICANT_IFACE=y in .config to bring it back)
	* added auth_alg to driver interface associate() parameters to make it
	  easier for drivers to configure authentication algorithm as part of
	  the association

2004-12-05 - v0.3.0 (beginning of 0.3.x development releases)
	* driver_broadcom: added new driver interface for Broadcom wl.o driver
	  (a generic driver for Broadcom IEEE 802.11a/g cards)
	* wpa_cli: fixed parsing of -p <path> command line argument
	* PEAPv1: fixed tunneled EAP-Success reply handling to reply with TLS
	  ACK, not tunneled EAP-Success (of which only the first byte was
	  actually send due to a bug in previous code); this seems to
	  interoperate with most RADIUS servers that implements PEAPv1
	* PEAPv1: added support for terminating PEAP authentication on tunneled
	  EAP-Success message; this can be configured by adding
	  peap_outer_success=0 on phase1 parameters in wpa_supplicant.conf
	  (some RADIUS servers require this whereas others require a tunneled
	  reply
	* PEAPv1: changed phase1 option peaplabel to use default to 0, i.e., to
	  the old label for key derivation; previously, the default was 1,
	  but it looks like most existing PEAPv1 implementations use the old
	  label which is thus more suitable default option
	* added support for EAP-PSK (draft-bersani-eap-psk-03.txt)
	* fixed parsing of wep_tx_keyidx
	* added support for configuring list of allowed Phase 2 EAP types
	  (for both EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS) instead of only one type
	* added support for configuring IEEE 802.11 authentication algorithm
	  (auth_alg; mainly for using Shared Key authentication with static
	  WEP keys)
	* added support for EAP-AKA (with UMTS SIM)
	* fixed couple of errors in PCSC handling that could have caused
	  random-looking errors for EAP-SIM
	* added support for EAP-SIM pseudonyms and fast re-authentication
	* added support for EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS fast re-authentication (TLS
	  session resumption)
	* added support for EAP-SIM with two challanges
	  (phase1="sim_min_num_chal=3" can be used to require three challenges)
	* added support for configuring DH/DSA parameters for an ephemeral DH
	  key exchange (EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS) using new configuration parameters
	  dh_file and dh_file2 (phase 2); this adds support for using DSA keys
	  and optional DH key exchange to achieve forward secracy with RSA keys
	* added support for matching subject of the authentication server
	  certificate with a substring when using EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS; new
	  configuration variables subject_match and subject_match2
	* changed SSID configuration in driver_wext.c (used by many driver
	  interfaces) to use ssid_len+1 as the length for SSID since some Linux
	  drivers expect this
	* fixed couple of unaligned reads in scan result parsing to fix WPA
	  connection on some platforms (e.g., ARM)
	* added driver interface for Intel ipw2100 driver
	* added support for LEAP with WPA
	* added support for larger scan results report (old limit was 4 kB of
	  data, i.e., about 35 or so APs) when using Linux wireless extensions
	  v17 or newer
	* fixed a bug in PMKSA cache processing: skip sending of EAPOL-Start
	  only if there is a PMKSA cache entry for the current AP
	* fixed error handling for case where reading of scan results fails:
	  must schedule a new scan or wpa_supplicant will remain waiting
	  forever
	* changed debug output to remove shared password/key material by
	  default; all key information can be included with -K command line
	  argument to match the previous behavior
	* added support for timestamping debug log messages (disabled by
	  default, can be enabled with -t command line argument)
	* set pairwise/group cipher suite for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X to WEP-104
	  if keys are not configured to be used; this fixes IEEE 802.1X mode
	  with drivers that use this information to configure whether Privacy
	  bit can be in Beacon frames (e.g., ndiswrapper)
	* avoid clearing driver keys if no keys have been configured since last
	  key clear request; this seems to improve reliability of group key
	  handshake for ndiswrapper & NDIS driver which seems to be suffering
	  of some kind of timing issue when the keys are cleared again after
	  association
	* changed driver interface API:
	  - WPA_SUPPLICANT_DRIVER_VERSION define can be used to determine which
	    version is being used (now, this is set to 2; previously, it was
	    not defined)
	  - pass pointer to private data structure to all calls
	  - the new API is not backwards compatible; all in-tree driver
	    interfaces has been converted to the new API
	* added support for controlling multiple interfaces (radios) per
	  wpa_supplicant process; each interface needs to be listed on the
	  command line (-c, -i, -D arguments) with -N as a separator
	  (-cwpa1.conf -iwlan0 -Dhostap -N -cwpa2.conf -iath0 -Dmadwifi)
	* added a workaround for EAP servers that incorrectly use same Id for
	  sequential EAP packets
	* changed libpcap/libdnet configuration to use .config variable,
	  CONFIG_DNET_PCAP, instead of requiring Makefile modification
	* improved downgrade attack detection in IE verification of msg 3/4:
	  verify both WPA and RSN IEs, if present, not only the selected one;
	  reject the AP if an RSN IE is found in msg 3/4, but not in Beacon or
	  Probe Response frame, and RSN is enabled in wpa_supplicant
	  configuration
	* fixed WPA msg 3/4 processing to allow Key Data field contain other
	  IEs than just one WPA IE
	* added support for FreeBSD and driver interface for the BSD net80211
	  layer (CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y in .config); please note that some of the
	  required kernel mods have not yet been committed
	* made EAP workarounds configurable; enabled by default, can be
	  disabled with network block option eap_workaround=0

2004-07-17 - v0.2.4 (beginning of 0.2.x stable releases)
	* resolved couple of interoperability issues with EAP-PEAPv1 and
	  Phase 2 (inner EAP) fragment reassembly
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WEP key configuration for IEEE 802.1X when the
	  AP is using non-zero key index for the unicast key and key index zero
	  for the broadcast key
	* driver_hostap: fixed IEEE 802.1X WEP key updates and
	  re-authentication by allowing unencrypted EAPOL frames when not using
	  WPA
	* added a new driver interface, 'wext', which uses only standard,
	  driver independent functionality in Linux wireless extensions;
	  currently, this can be used only for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X mode, but
	  eventually, this is to be extended to support full WPA/WPA2 once
	  Linux wireless extensions get support for this
	* added support for mode in which the driver is responsible for AP
	  scanning and selection; this is disabled by default and can be
	  enabled with global ap_scan=0 variable in wpa_supplicant.conf;
	  this mode can be used, e.g., with generic 'wext' driver interface to
	  use wpa_supplicant as IEEE 802.1X Supplicant with any Linux driver
	  supporting wireless extensions.
	* driver_madwifi: fixed WPA2 configuration and scan_ssid=1 (e.g.,
	  operation with an AP that does not include SSID in the Beacon frames)
	* added support for new EAP authentication methods:
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-OTP, EAP-PEAPv0/OTP, EAP-PEAPv1/OTP, EAP-OTP
	* added support for asking one-time-passwords from frontends (e.g.,
	  wpa_cli); this 'otp' command works otherwise like 'password' command,
	  but the password is used only once and the frontend will be asked for
	  a new password whenever a request from authenticator requires a
	  password; this can be used with both EAP-OTP and EAP-GTC
	* changed wpa_cli to automatically re-establish connection so that it
	  does not need to be re-started when wpa_supplicant is terminated and
	  started again
	* improved user data (identity/password/otp) requests through
	  frontends: process pending EAPOL packets after getting new
	  information so that full authentication does not need to be
	  restarted; in addition, send pending requests again whenever a new
	  frontend is attached
	* changed control frontends to use a new directory for socket files to
	  make it easier for wpa_cli to automatically select between interfaces
	  and to provide access control for the control interface;
	  wpa_supplicant.conf: ctrl_interface is now a path
	  (/var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended path) and
	  ctrl_interface_group can be used to select which group gets access to
	  the control interface;
	  wpa_cli: by default, try to connect to the first interface available
	  in /var/run/wpa_supplicant; this path can be overriden with -p option
	  and an interface can be selected with -i option (i.e., in most common
	  cases, wpa_cli does not need to get any arguments)
	* added support for LEAP
	* added driver interface for Linux ndiswrapper
	* added priority option for network blocks in the configuration file;
	  this allows networks to be grouped based on priority (the scan
	  results are searched for matches with network blocks in this order)

2004-06-20 - v0.2.3
	* sort scan results to improve AP selection
	* fixed control interface socket removal for some error cases
	* improved scan requesting and authentication timeout
	* small improvements/bug fixes for EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-PEAP, and
	  TLS processing
	* PEAP version can now be forced with phase1="peapver=<ver>"
	  (mostly for testing; by default, the highest version supported by
	  both the Supplicant and Authentication Server is selected
	  automatically)
	* added support for madwifi driver (Atheros ar521x)
	* added a workaround for cases where AP sets Install Tx/Rx bit for
	  WPA Group Key messages when pairwise keys are used (without this,
	  the Group Key would be used for Tx and the AP would drop frames
	  from the station)
	* added GSM SIM/USIM interface for GSM authentication algorithm for
	  EAP-SIM; this requires pcsc-lite
	* added support for ATMEL AT76C5XXx driver
	* fixed IEEE 802.1X WEP key derivation in the case where Authenticator
	  does not include key data in the EAPOL-Key frame (i.e., part of
	  EAP keying material is used as data encryption key)
	* added support for using plaintext and static WEP networks
	  (key_mgmt=NONE)

2004-05-31 - v0.2.2
	* added support for new EAP authentication methods:
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-MD5-Challenge
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-GTC
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-MSCHAPv2
	  EAP-TTLS/EAP-TLS
	  EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2
	  EAP-TTLS/MSCHAP
	  EAP-TTLS/PAP
	  EAP-TTLS/CHAP
	  EAP-PEAP/TLS
	  EAP-PEAP/GTC
	  EAP-PEAP/MD5-Challenge
	  EAP-GTC
	  EAP-SIM (not yet complete; needs GSM/SIM authentication interface)
	* added support for anonymous identity (to be used when identity is
	  sent in plaintext; real identity will be used within TLS protected
	  tunnel (e.g., with EAP-TTLS)
	* added event messages from wpa_supplicant to frontends, e.g., wpa_cli
	* added support for requesting identity and password information using
	  control interface; in other words, the password for EAP-PEAP or
	  EAP-TTLS does not need to be included in the configuration file since
	  a frontand (e.g., wpa_cli) can ask it from the user
	* improved RSN pre-authentication to use a candidate list and process
	  all candidates from each scan; not only one per scan
	* fixed RSN IE and WPA IE capabilities field parsing
	* ignore Tx bit in GTK IE when Pairwise keys are used
	* avoid making new scan requests during IEEE 802.1X negotiation
	* use openssl/libcrypto for MD5 and SHA-1 when compiling wpa_supplicant
	  with TLS support (this replaces the included implementation with
	  library code to save about 8 kB since the library code is needed
	  anyway for TLS)
	* fixed WPA-PSK only mode when compiled without IEEE 802.1X support
	  (i.e., without CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y in .config)

2004-05-06 - v0.2.1
	* added support for internal IEEE 802.1X (actually, IEEE 802.1aa/D6.1)
	  Supplicant
	  - EAPOL state machines for Supplicant [IEEE 802.1aa/D6.1]
	  - EAP peer state machine [draft-ietf-eap-statemachine-02.pdf]
	  - EAP-MD5 (cannot be used with WPA-RADIUS)
	    [draft-ietf-eap-rfc2284bis-09.txt]
	  - EAP-TLS [RFC 2716]
	  - EAP-MSCHAPv2 (currently used only with EAP-PEAP)
	  - EAP-PEAP/MSCHAPv2 [draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-07.txt]
	    [draft-kamath-pppext-eap-mschapv2-00.txt]
	    (PEAP version 0, 1, and parts of 2; only 0 and 1 are enabled by
	    default; tested with FreeRADIUS, Microsoft IAS, and Funk Odyssey)
	  - new configuration file options: eap, identity, password, ca_cert,
	    client_cert, privatekey, private_key_passwd
	  - Xsupplicant is not required anymore, but it can be used by
	    disabling the internal IEEE 802.1X Supplicant with -e command line
	    option
	  - this code is not included in the default build; Makefile need to
	    be edited for this (uncomment lines for selected functionality)
	  - EAP-TLS and EAP-PEAP require openssl libraries
	* use module prefix in debug messages (WPA, EAP, EAP-TLS, ..)
	* added support for non-WPA IEEE 802.1X mode with dynamic WEP keys
	  (i.e., complete IEEE 802.1X/EAP authentication and use IEEE 802.1X
	   EAPOL-Key frames instead of WPA key handshakes)
	* added support for IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2)
	  - improved PTK Key Handshake
	  - PMKSA caching, pre-authentication
	* fixed wpa_supplicant to ignore possible extra data after WPA
	  EAPOL-Key packets (this fixes 'Invalid EAPOL-Key MIC when using
	  TPTK' error from message 3 of 4-Way Handshake in case the AP
	  includes extra data after the EAPOL-Key)
	* added interface for external programs (frontends) to control
	  wpa_supplicant
	  - CLI example (wpa_cli) with interactive mode and command line
	    mode
	  - replaced SIGUSR1 status/statistics with the new control interface
	* made some feature compile time configurable
	  - .config file for make
	  - driver interfaces (hostap, hermes, ..)
	  - EAPOL/EAP functions

2004-02-15 - v0.2.0
	* Initial version of wpa_supplicant
