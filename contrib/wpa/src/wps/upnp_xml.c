/*
 * XML parsing and formatting
 *
 * XML is a markup language based on unicode; usually (and in our case,
 * always!) based on utf-8. utf-8 uses a variable number of bytes per
 * character. utf-8 has the advantage that all non-ASCII unicode characters are
 * represented by sequences of non-ascii (high bit set) bytes, whereas ASCII
 * characters are single ascii bytes, thus we can use typical text processing.
 *
 * (One other interesting thing about utf-8 is that it is possible to look at
 * any random byte and determine if it is the first byte of a character as
 * versus a continuation byte).
 *
 * The base syntax of XML uses a few ASCII punctionation characters; any
 * characters that would appear in the payload data are rewritten using
 * sequences, e.g., &amp; for ampersand(&) and &lt for left angle bracket (<).
 * Five such escapes total (more can be defined but that does not apply to our
 * case). Thus we can safely parse for angle brackets etc.
 *
 * XML describes tree structures of tagged data, with each element beginning
 * with an opening tag <label> and ending with a closing tag </label> with
 * matching label. (There is also a self-closing tag <label/> which is supposed
 * to be equivalent to <label></label>, i.e., no payload, but we are unlikely
 * to see it for our purpose).
 *
 * Actually the opening tags are a little more complicated because they can
 * contain "attributes" after the label (delimited by ascii space or tab chars)
 * of the form attribute_label="value" or attribute_label='value'; as it turns
 * out we do not have to read any of these attributes, just ignore them.
 *
 * Labels are any sequence of chars other than space, tab, right angle bracket
 * (and ?), but may have an inner structure of <namespace><colon><plain_label>.
 * As it turns out, we can ignore the namespaces, in fact we can ignore the
 * entire tree hierarchy, because the plain labels we are looking for will be
 * unique (not in general, but for this application). We do however have to be
 * careful to skip over the namespaces.
 *
 * In generating XML we have to be more careful, but that is easy because
 * everything we do is pretty canned. The only real care to take is to escape
 * any special chars in our payload.

 * Note that angle brackets present in the original data must have been encoded
 * as &lt; and &gt; so they will not trouble us.

 *     11xxxxxx(2) -- 1st byte of multi-byte char w/ unicode value >= 0x80
 *         110xxxxx(2) -- 1st byte of 2 byte sequence (5 payload bits here)
 *         1110xxxx(2) -- 1st byte of 3 byte sequence (4 payload bits here)
 *         11110xxx(2) -- 1st byte of 4 byte sequence (3 payload bits here)
 *      10xxxxxx(2) -- extension byte (6 payload bits per byte)
 *      Some values implied by the above are however illegal because they
 *      do not represent unicode chars or are not the shortest encoding.
 * Actually, we can almost entirely ignore the above and just do
 * text processing same as for ascii text.
 *
 * XML is written with arbitrary unicode characters, except that five
 * characters have special meaning and so must be escaped where they
 * appear in payload data... which we do here.
