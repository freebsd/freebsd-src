Arm Optimized Routines
----------------------

This repository contains implementations of library functions
provided by Arm. The outbound license is available under a dual
license, at the userâ€™s election, as reflected in the LICENSE file.
Contributions to this project are accepted, but Contributors have
to sign an Assignment Agreement, please follow the instructions in
contributor-agreement.pdf. This is needed so upstreaming code
to projects that require copyright assignment is possible. Further
contribution requirements are documented in README.contributors of
the appropriate subdirectory.

Regular quarterly releases are tagged as vYY.MM, the latest
release is v25.01.

Source code layout:

build/          - build directory (created by make).
math/           - math subproject sources for generic scalar
                  subroutines and sources shared with
                  subdirectories of math/.
                  All math routines should meet the quality
                  requirements stated in math/README.contributors,
                  routines that fail to do so are located in an
                  experimental/ directory.
math/aarch64/   - math subproject AArch64-specific sources
                  and sources shared with subdirectories.
math/aarch64/advsimd      - AdvSIMD-specific math sources.
math/aarch64/experimental - Experimental math sources do not
                            meet quality requirements stated in
                            math/README.contributors.
math/aarch64/sve          - SVE-specific math sources.
math/include/   - math library public headers.
math/test/      - math test and benchmark related sources.
math/tools/     - tools used for designing the algorithms.
networking/     - networking subproject sources.
networking/include/ - networking library public headers.
networking/test/ - networking test and benchmark related sources.
string/         - string routines subproject sources.
                  All string routines should meet the quality
                  requirements stated in string/README.contributors,
                  routines that fail to do so are located in an
                  experimental/ directory.
string/<arch>   - <arch>-specific string routines sources for
                  <arch>=aarch64, and arm.
string/aarch64/experimental - Experimental string routines which
                              may not be fully optimized yet.
string/include/ - string library public headers.
string/test/    - string test and benchmark related sources.

The steps to build the target libraries and run the tests:

cp config.mk.dist config.mk
# edit config.mk if necessary ...
make
make check

Or building outside of the source directory:

ln -s path/to/src/Makefile Makefile
cp path/to/src/config.mk.dist config.mk
echo 'srcdir = path/to/src' >> config.mk
# further edits to config.mk
make
make check

Or building and testing the math subproject only:

make all-math
make check-math

Note on compiler compability/requirement:

SVE routines are always built by default - this means that on AArch64
GCC >= 10 or LLVM >= 5 are always required for SVE ACLE compatibility.
There is no explicit check for compatible compiler, therefore the SVE
routines will fail to build if CC is too old.

The test system requires libmpfr and libmpc.
For example on debian linux they can be installed as:

sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev

For cross build, CROSS_COMPILE should be set in config.mk and EMULATOR
should be set for cross testing (e.g. using qemu-user or remote access
to a target machine), see the examples in config.mk.dist.
