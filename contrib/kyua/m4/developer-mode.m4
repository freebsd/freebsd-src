dnl
dnl "Developer mode" is a mode in which the build system reports any
dnl build-time warnings as fatal errors.  This helps in minimizing the
dnl amount of trivial coding problems introduced in the code.
dnl Unfortunately, this is not bullet-proof due to the wide variety of
dnl compilers available and their different warning diagnostics.
dnl
dnl When developer mode support is added to a package, the compilation will
dnl gain a bunch of extra warning diagnostics.  These will NOT be enforced
dnl unless developer mode is enabled.
dnl
dnl Developer mode is enabled when the user requests it through the
dnl configure command line, or when building from the repository.  The
dnl latter is to minimize the risk of committing new code with warnings
dnl into the tree.


dnl Adds "developer mode" support to the package.
dnl
dnl This macro performs the actual definition of the --enable-developer
dnl flag and implements all of its logic.  See the file-level comment for
dnl details as to what this implies.
