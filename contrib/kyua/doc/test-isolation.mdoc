The test programs and test cases run by
.Nm
are all executed in a deterministic environment.
This known, clean environment serves to make the test execution as
reproducible as possible and also to prevent clashes between tests that may,
for example, create auxiliary files with overlapping names.
.Pp
For plain test programs and for TAP test programs, the whole test program
is run under a single instance of the environment described in this page.
For ATF test programs (see
.Xr atf 7 ) ,
each individual test case
.Em and
test cleanup routine are executed in separate environments.
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Process space
Each test is executed in an independent processes.
Corollary: the test can do whatever it wants to the current process (such
as modify global variables) without having to undo such changes.
.It Session and process group
The test is executed in its own session and its own process group.
There is no controlling terminal attached to the session.
.Pp
Should the test spawn any children, the children should maintain the same
session and process group.
Modifying any of these settings prevents
.Nm
from being able to kill any stray subprocess as part of the cleanup phase.
If modifying these settings is necessary, or if any subprocess started by
the test decides to use a different process group or session, it is the
responsibility of the test to ensure those subprocesses are forcibly
terminated during cleanup.
.It Work directory
The test is executed in a temporary directory automatically created by the
runtime engine.
Corollary: the test can write to its current directory
without needing to clean any files and/or directories it creates.
The runtime engine takes care to recursively delete the temporary directories
after the execution of a test case.
Any file systems mounted within the temporary directory are also unmounted.
.It Home directory
The
.Va HOME
environment variable is set to the absolute path of the work directory.
.It Umask
The value of the umask is set to 0022.
.It Environment
The
.Va LANG ,
.Va LC_ALL ,
.Va LC_COLLATE ,
.Va LC_CTYPE ,
.Va LC_MESSAGES ,
.Va LC_MONETARY ,
.Va LC_NUMERIC
and
.Va LC_TIME
variables are unset.
.Pp
The
.Va TZ
variable is set to
.Sq UTC .
.Pp
The
.Va TMPDIR
variable is set to the absolute path of the work directory.
This is to prevent the test from mistakenly using a temporary directory
outside of the automatically-managed work directory, should the test use the
.Xr mktemp 3
familiy of functions.
.It Process limits
The maximum soft core size limit is raised to its corresponding hard limit.
This is a simple, best-effort attempt at allowing tests to dump core for
further diagnostic purposes.
.It Configuration varibles
The test engine may pass run-time configuration variables to the test program
via the environment.
The name of the configuration variable is prefixed with
.Sq TEST_ENV_
so that a configuration variable of the form
.Sq foo=bar
becomes accessible in the environment as
.Sq TEST_ENV_foo=bar .
