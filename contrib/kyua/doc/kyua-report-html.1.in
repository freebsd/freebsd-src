.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua report-html"
.Nd Generates an HTML report with the results of a test suite run
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -force
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a simple mechanism to generate HTML reports of the
execution of a test suite.
The command processes a results file and then populates a directory with
multiple HTML and supporting files to describe the results recorded in that
results file.
.Pp
The HTML output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be served by
any simple web server.
The command expects the target directory to not exist, because it would
overwrite any contents if not careful.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -force
Forces the deletion of the output directory if it exists.
Use care, as this effectively means a
.Sq rm -rf .
.It Fl -output Ar directory
Specifies the target directory into which to generate the HTML files.
The directory must not exist unless the
.Fl -force
option is provided.
The default is
.Pa ./html .
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path
__include__ results-file-flag-read.mdoc
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.
Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with too much
information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.El
.Ss Results files
__include__ results-files.mdoc
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
__include__ results-files-report-example.mdoc REPORT_COMMAND=report-html
