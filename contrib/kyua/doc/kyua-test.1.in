.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

command loads a test suite definition from a
.Xr kyuafile 5 ,
runs the tests defined in it, and records the results into a new results
file.
By default, all tests in the test suite are executed but the optional
arguments to
.Nm
can be used to select which test programs or test cases to run.
These are filters and are described below in
.Sx Test filters .

Every test executed by

is run under a controlled environment as described in
.Sx Test isolation .

The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
