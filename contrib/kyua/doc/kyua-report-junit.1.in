.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua report-junit"
.Nd Generates a JUnit report with the results of a test suite run
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a simple mechanism to generate JUnit reports of the
execution of a test suite.
The command processes a results file and then generates a single XML file
that complies with the JUnit XSchema.
.Pp
The JUnit output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be plugged
into any continuous integration system, like Jenkins.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -output Ar directory
Specifies the file into which to store the JUnit report.
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path
__include__ results-file-flag-read.mdoc
.El
.Ss Caveats
Because of limitations in the JUnit XML schema, not all the data collected by
Kyua can be properly represented in JUnit reports.
However, because test data are extremely useful for debugging purposes, the
.Nm
command shovels these data into the JUnit output.
In particular:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The test case metadata values are prepended to the test case's standard error
output.
.It
Test cases that report expected failures as their results are recorded as
passed.
The fact that they failed as expected is recorded in the test case's standard
error output along with the corresponding reason.
.El
.Ss Results files
__include__ results-files.mdoc
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
