.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua db-exec"
.Nd Executes a SQL statement in a results file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -no-headers
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Ar statement
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a way to execute an arbitrary SQL statement within the
database.
This command is mostly intended to aid in debugging, but can also be used to
extract information from the database when the current interfaces do not
provide the desired functionality.
.Pp
The input database must exist.
It makes no sense to use
.Nm
on a nonexistent or empty database.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command takes one or more arguments, all of which are concatenated to form
a single SQL statement.
Once the statement is executed,
.Nm
prints the resulting table on the screen, if any.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -no-headers
Avoids printing the headers of the table in the output of the command.
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path
__include__ results-file-flag-read.mdoc
.El
.Ss Results files
__include__ results-files.mdoc
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 on success or 1 if the SQL statement is invalid or fails
to run.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
