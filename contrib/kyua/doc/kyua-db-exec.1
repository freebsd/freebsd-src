.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua db-exec"
.Nd Executes a SQL statement in a results file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -no-headers
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Ar statement
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a way to execute an arbitrary SQL statement within the
database.
This command is mostly intended to aid in debugging, but can also be used to
extract information from the database when the current interfaces do not
provide the desired functionality.
.Pp
The input database must exist.
It makes no sense to use
.Nm
on a nonexistent or empty database.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command takes one or more arguments, all of which are concatenated to form
a single SQL statement.
Once the statement is executed,
.Nm
prints the resulting table on the screen, if any.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -no-headers
Avoids printing the headers of the table in the output of the command.
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path

Specifies the results file to operate on.
Defaults to
.Sq LATEST ,
which causes
.Nm
to automatically load the latest results file from the current test suite.
.Pp
The following values are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Sq LATEST
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the current directory.
.It Directory
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the given directory.
.It Test suite name
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.
.It Results identifier
Requests the load of a specific results file.
.It Explicit file name (aka everything else)
Load the specified results file.

Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.
Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.
The differences between the two are described below.
.Pp
The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for
identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
generated it and the time the test suite was run.
Kyua can later look up results files by these fields.
.Pp
The identifier follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYYYMMDD\*(Gt-\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt-\*(Ltuuuuuu\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Sq test_suite
is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced
by underscores and
.Sq YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu
is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.
.Pp
When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
.Pa ~/.kyua/store/
subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.\*(Ltidentifier\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql
files.
For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 on success or 1 if the SQL statement is invalid or fails
to run.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
