Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.
Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.
The differences between the two are described below.
.Pp
The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for
identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
generated it and the time the test suite was run.
Kyua can later look up results files by these fields.
.Pp
The identifier follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYYYMMDD\*(Gt-\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt-\*(Ltuuuuuu\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Sq test_suite
is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced
by underscores and
.Sq YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu
is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.
.Pp
When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
.Pa ~/.kyua/store/
subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.\*(Ltidentifier\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa __STOREDIR__/schema_v?.sql
files.
For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.
