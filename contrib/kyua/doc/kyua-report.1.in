.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua report"
.Nd Generates reports with the results of a test suite run
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Op Fl -verbose
.Op Ar test_filter1 .. test_filterN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command parses a results file and generates a user-friendly, plaintext
report for user consumption on the terminal.
By default, these reports only display a summary of the execution of the full
test suite to highlight where problems may lie.
.Pp
The output of
.Nm
can be customized to display full details on all executed test cases.
Additionally, the optional arguments to
.Nm
are used to select which test programs or test cases to display.
These are filters and are described below in
.Sx Test filters .
.Pp
Reports generated by
.Nm
are
.Em not intended to be machine-parseable .
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -output Ar path
Specifies the path to which the report should be written to.
The special values
.Pa /dev/stdout
and
.Pa /dev/stderr
can be used to specify the standard output and the standard error,
respectively.
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path
__include__ results-file-flag-read.mdoc
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.
Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with too much
information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.It Fl -verbose
Prints a detailed report of the execution.
In addition to all the information printed by default, verbose reports
include the runtime context of the test suite run, the metadata of each
test case, and the verbatim output of the test cases.
.El
.Ss Results files
__include__ results-files.mdoc
.Ss Test filters
__include__ test-filters.mdoc
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 if no filters were specified or if all filters match one
or more test cases.
If any filter fails to match any test case, the command returns 1.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
