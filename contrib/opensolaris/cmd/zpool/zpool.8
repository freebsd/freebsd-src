.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBzpool\fR command configures \fBZFS\fR storage pools. A storage pool is a collection of devices that provides physical storage and data replication for \fBZFS\fR datasets.
.LP
All datasets within a storage pool share the same space. See \fBzfs\fR(1M) for information on managing datasets. 
.SS Virtual Devices (vdevs)

.LP
A "virtual device" describes a single device or a collection of devices organized according to certain performance and fault characteristics. The following virtual devices are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBdisk\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A block device, typically located under "/dev/dsk". \fBZFS\fR can use individual slices or partitions, though the recommended mode of operation is to use whole disks. A disk can be specified by a full path, or it can be a shorthand name (the relative portion
of the path under "/dev/dsk"). A whole disk can be specified by omitting the slice or partition designation. For example, "c0t0d0" is equivalent to "/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2". When given a whole disk, \fBZFS\fR automatically labels the disk, if necessary.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBfile\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A regular file. The use of files as a backing store is strongly discouraged. It is designed primarily for experimental purposes, as the fault tolerance of a file is only as good as the file system of which it is a part. A file must be specified by a full path.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBmirror\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A mirror of two or more devices. Data is replicated in an identical fashion across all components of a mirror. A mirror with \fIN\fR disks of size \fIX\fR can hold \fIX\fR bytes and can withstand (\fIN-1\fR)
devices failing before data integrity is compromised.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBraidz\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fBraidz1\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fBraidz2\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A variation on \fBRAID-5\fR that allows for better distribution of parity and eliminates the "\fBRAID-5\fR write hole" (in which data and parity become inconsistent after a power loss). Data and parity is striped across all disks within a \fBraidz\fR group.
.sp
A \fBraidz\fR group can have either single- or double-parity, meaning that the \fBraidz\fR group can sustain one or two failures respectively without losing any data. The \fBraidz1\fR \fBvdev\fR type specifies a single-parity \fBraidz\fR group
and the \fBraidz2\fR \fBvdev\fR type specifies a double-parity \fBraidz\fR group. The \fBraidz\fR \fBvdev\fR type is an alias for \fBraidz1\fR.
.sp
A \fBraidz\fR group with \fIN\fR disks of size \fIX\fR with \fIP\fR parity disks can hold approximately (\fIN-P\fR)*\fIX\fR bytes and can withstand one device failing before
data integrity is compromised. The minimum number of devices in a \fBraidz\fR group is one more than the number of parity disks. The recommended number is between 3 and 9.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBspare\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
.rt  
A special pseudo-\fBvdev\fR which keeps track of available hot spares for a pool. For more information, see the "Hot Spares" section.
.RE

.LP
Virtual devices cannot be nested, so a mirror or \fBraidz\fR virtual device can only contain files or disks. Mirrors of mirrors (or other combinations) are not allowed.
.LP
A pool can have any number of virtual devices at the top of the configuration (known as "root vdevs"). Data is dynamically distributed across all top-level devices to balance data among devices. As new virtual devices are added, \fBZFS\fR automatically places data
on the newly available devices.
.LP
Virtual devices are specified one at a time on the command line, separated by whitespace. The keywords "mirror" and "raidz" are used to distinguish where a group ends and another begins. For example, the following creates two root vdevs, each a mirror of two disks:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# zpool create mypool mirror c0t0d0 c0t1d0 mirror c1t0d0 c1t1d0\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS Device Failure and Recovery

.LP
\fBZFS\fR supports a rich set of mechanisms for handling device failure and data corruption. All metadata and data is checksummed, and \fBZFS\fR automatically repairs bad data from a good copy when corruption is detected.
.LP
In order to take advantage of these features, a pool must make use of some form of redundancy, using either mirrored or \fBraidz\fR groups. While \fBZFS\fR supports running in a non-redundant configuration, where each root vdev is simply a disk or file, this is
strongly discouraged. A single case of bit corruption can render some or all of your data unavailable.
.LP
A pool's health status is described by one of three states: online, degraded, or faulted. An online pool has all devices operating normally. A degraded pool is one in which one or more devices have failed, but the data is still available due to a redundant configuration. A faulted pool has
one or more failed devices, and there is insufficient redundancy to replicate the missing data.
.SS Hot Spares

.LP
\fBZFS\fR allows devices to be associated with pools as "hot spares". These devices are not actively used in the pool, but when an active device fails, it is automatically replaced by a hot spare. To create a pool with hot spares, specify a "spare" \fBvdev\fR with any number of devices. For example, 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# zpool create pool mirror c0d0 c1d0 spare c2d0 c3d0
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
Spares can be shared across multiple pools, and can be added with the "zpool add" command and removed with the "zpool remove" command. Once a spare replacement is initiated, a new "spare" \fBvdev\fR is created within the configuration that
will remain there until the original device is replaced. At this point, the hot spare becomes available again if another device fails.
.LP
An in-progress spare replacement can be cancelled by detaching the hot spare. If the original faulted device is detached, then the hot spare assumes its place in the configuration, and is removed from the spare list of all active pools.
.SS Alternate Root Pools

.LP
The "zpool create -R" and "zpool import -R" commands allow users to create and import a pool with a different root path. By default, whenever a pool is created or imported on a system, it is permanently added so that it is available whenever the system boots. For
removable media, or when in recovery situations, this may not always be desirable. An alternate root pool does not persist on the system. Instead, it exists only until exported or the system is rebooted, at which point it will have to be imported again.
.LP
In addition, all mount points in the pool are prefixed with the given root, so a pool can be constrained to a particular area of the file system. This is most useful when importing unknown pools from removable media, as the mount points of any file systems cannot be trusted.
.LP
When creating an alternate root pool, the default mount point is "/", rather than the normal default "/\fIpool\fR".
.SS Subcommands

.LP
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their original form.
.LP
The \fBzpool\fR command provides subcommands to create and destroy storage pools, add capacity to storage pools, and provide information about the storage pools. The following subcommands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBzpool\fR \fB-?\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays a help message.
.RE

.sp

.na
\fB\fBzpool create\fR [\fB-fn\fR] [\fB-R\fR \fIroot\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fImountpoint\fR] \fIpool\fR \fIvdev ...\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Creates a new storage pool containing the virtual devices specified on the command line. The pool name must begin with a letter, and can only contain alphanumeric characters as well as underscore ("_"), dash ("-"), and period ("."). The pool
names "mirror", "raidz", and "spare" are reserved, as are names beginning with the pattern "c[0-9]". The \fBvdev\fR specification is described in the "Virtual Devices" section.
.sp
The command verifies that each device specified is accessible and not currently in use by another subsystem. There are some uses, such as being currently mounted, or specified as the dedicated dump device, that prevents a device from ever being used by \fBZFS\fR. Other uses,
such as having a preexisting \fBUFS\fR file system, can be overridden with the \fB-f\fR option.
.sp
The command also checks that the replication strategy for the pool is consistent. An attempt to combine redundant and non-redundant storage in a single pool, or to mix disks and files, results in an error unless \fB-f\fR is specified. The use of differently sized devices within
a single \fBraidz\fR or mirror group is also flagged as an error unless \fB-f\fR is specified.
.sp
Unless the \fB-R\fR option is specified, the default mount point is "/\fIpool\fR". The mount point must not exist or must be empty, or else the root dataset cannot be mounted. This can be overridden with the \fB-m\fR option.

This command reports actual physical space available to the storage pool. The physical space can be different from the total amount of space that any contained datasets can actually use. The amount of space used in a \fBraidz\fR configuration depends on the characteristics of
the data being written. In addition, \fBZFS\fR reserves some space for internal accounting that the \fBzfs\fR(1M) command takes into account, but the \fBzpool\fR command does not. For non-full pools of a reasonable size, these effects should be invisible. For small pools, or pools that are close to being completely full, these discrepancies may become more noticeable.

Begins a scrub. The scrub examines all data in the specified pools to verify that it checksums correctly. For replicated (mirror or \fBraidz\fR) devices, \fBZFS\fR automatically repairs any damage discovered during the scrub. The "\fBzpool
status\fR" command reports the progress of the scrub and summarizes the results of the scrub upon completion.
.sp
Scrubbing and resilvering are very similar operations. The difference is that resilvering only examines data that \fBZFS\fR knows to be out of date (for example, when attaching a new device to a mirror or replacing an existing device), whereas scrubbing examines all data to
discover silent errors due to hardware faults or disk failure.
.sp
Because scrubbing and resilvering are \fBI/O\fR-intensive operations, \fBZFS\fR only allows one at a time. If a scrub is already in progress, the "\fBzpool scrub\fR" command terminates it and starts a new scrub.
