1. Export from OpenBSD's nc(1) into an empty directory (say "v-nc").
2. while read pattern; do rm ${pattern} ; done < FREEBSD-Xlist
3. Checkout our contrib/netcat to another directory (say "f-nc"),
   with -rOPENBSD, and usr.bin/nc to its ../../
4. copy the files from v-nc to f-nc
5. do cvs up -A in f-nc
6. If there is conflicits, try to resolve them.
7. do build in f-nc/../../usr.bin/nc
8. If everything seems ok, do the actual import in v-nc:
	cvs -n import src/contrib/netcat OPENBSD OPENBSD_<date>
   Everything appears be Ok? Do:
	cvs import src/contrib/netcat OPENBSD OPENBSD_<date>
9. Resolve the conflicits with the patchset obtained in step 6.
