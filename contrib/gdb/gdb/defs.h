   While old code can continue to refer to these macros, new code is

   and ``strcmp() != 0''.

   This is because modern compilers can directly inline strcmp()
   making the original justification for these macros - avoid function
   call overhead by pre-testing the first characters
   (``*X==*Y?...:0'') - redundant.

   signals (insofar as various unices use the same numbers, anyway).
   It is also the numbering of the GDB remote protocol.  Other remote
   protocols, if they use a different numbering, should make sure to
   translate appropriately.

   Since these numbers have actually made it out into other software
   (stubs, etc.), you mustn't disturb the assigned numbering.  If you
   need to add new signals here, add them to the end of the explicitly
   numbered signals.

   This is based strongly on Unix/POSIX signals for several reasons:
   (1) This set of signals represents a widely-accepted attempt to
   represent events of this sort in a portable fashion, (2) we want a
   signal to make it from wait to child_wait to the user intact, (3) many
   remote protocols use a similar encoding.  However, it is
   recognized that this set of signals has limitations (such as not
   distinguishing between various kinds of SIGSEGV, or not
   distinguishing hitting a breakpoint from finishing a single step).
   So in the future we may get around this either by adding additional
   signals for breakpoint, single-step, etc., or by adding signal
   codes; the latter seems more in the spirit of what BSD, System V,
   etc. are doing to address these issues.  */
