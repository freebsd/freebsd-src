 	nullify instruction bit from IPSW only when we are not in a system
 	call.
	(STRCAT_REGISTER, pa_do_strcat_registers_info): Additional
 	parameter -- precision.

	* Makefile.in (BUILD_TUI): To build the tui, only when configured
	with --enable-tui.
	(YLWRAP): Use ylwrap to avoid problems on systems w/o bison.
	(gdb$(EXEEXT)): Make it dependent on BUILD_TUI.
	(all-tui): Remove dependency from phony target.

	(jv-exp.tab.c): Ditto.
	(f-exp.tab.c): Ditto.
	(m2-exp.tab.c): Ditto.

	* configure.in (ENABLE_CFLAGS): Define and export BUILD_TUI.
	
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* c-typeprint.c (c_type_print_base): Get to the method name by
	skipping over all the namespaces,  classes and '::'.

	shared libraries; restore test of IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE
	removed by HP.
	
	* Makefile.in (ALLDEPFILES): Add somread.c, hp-psymtab-read.c,
	hp-symtab-read.c.
	(SFILES): Remove the above files
	(COMMON_OBS): Remove somread.o

	Also, for TARGET_WAITKIND_STOPPED, check to see if expecting a trap
	from the parent of a vfork (ignorable) otherwise break as usual.

	catchpoints.

	the child exec'd before gdb saw the parent's vfork event
	then call follow_exec.
	(follow_exec): If the exec occured after a vfork, then follow
	the vfork as well. Do it before following the exec.
	Make sure to update breakpoints after and exec

	resume?)
	(proceed): When proceeded at location that does not have a breakpoint
	set thread_step_needed=0 to indicate that it is not necessary to

	more complicated code in here. 
	Moved the code to resume threads to after the large case statement that processes the events.
	Additional processing for stop_signal=TARGET_SIGNAL_TRAP. 
	Cleanup code at process_event_stop_test label.

	string.  Indent GNU style.
	(gdb_fopen): Gdb_fopen is called if the GDB_FILE object is
	actually afile rather than astring. The routine now allocates space
	for a GDB_FILE object and initializes its fields in addition to 
	performing an fopen.
	(gdb_flush): Fix the parameter passed into fflush. It's now
 	stream->ts_filestream.
	(gdb_fclose): Pass in an object of type GDB_FILE **. Fix parameter

 	the GDB_FILE object and set the GDB_FILE * object to NULL.
	(gdb_adjust_strbuf): New function. Determine if the current
 	ts_strbuf field contains sufficient space to concatenate a string
 	of length n on the end.  If not, then reallocate the ts_strbuf.

 	astring. If it is astring, then adjust the size of the ts_strbuf
 	field and concatenate the correct number of spaces onto the end of
 	the buffer. Otherwise continue to use fputc.
	(gdb_file_get_strbuf): New function. return a ptr to the ts_strbuf
 	field in a GDB_FILE object.
	(gdb_file_init_astring): New function to allocate space for and

	(query): Tui changes.
	(init_page_info, set_width): New functions.
	(set_width_command): Call set_width.
	(_initialize_utils): Replace termcap stuff with call to
	init_page_info; if xdb_commands set, define am and sm commands;

	use the gcc_compiled variable.

	* valops.c (value_cast): Take case of the enclosing_type and 
	pointer_to_offset fields.

	pointed_to_offset fields.
	(value_repeat): Use VALUE_CONTENTS_ALL_RAW and VALUE_ENCLOSING_TYPE.

 	SOLIB_UNLOADED_LIBRARY_PATHNAME.
	(watch_command_1): Don't require a run before a watch command
 	unless we're on HP [it's an HP OS bug, not a generic limitation]

	* c-valprint.c (c_val_print): Add new parameter embedded_offset.

 	call to check_typedef out of conditional.  add embedded offset
 	param to val_print call.

	(c_value_print): Add new parameter to call to val_print.  Handle

	(mips32_next_pc): Major debugging, bit pattern interpretation
	(print_unpack): debugging printf
	(fetch_mips_16): new funtion, key on PC low bit, not symbol table

        (CONFIG_OBS): Include gdbres.o on Windows.
        * gdbtool.ico: New file.
        * gdb.rc: New file.

        * ser-unix.c
        - Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
        (wait_for): Don't reset the timeout_remaining for CYGWIN32,
        since we now effectively poll the serial port.
        Don't reset the current_timeout, either, since this member is used
        by hardwire_readchar to track the timeout and call the ui_loop_hook.
	(hardwire_readchar): Poll the serial port for Cygwin32. We timeout
 	every second, update the UI, and loop around doing this until we
 	have hit the real timeout or we get data or an error. This will
 	allow the UI to stay active while gdb is "blocked" talking to the
 	target.
       	- Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	(wait_for): Do reset current_timeout because it is only used to
 	keep track of what the current timeout for the scb is.

        * top.c
        - Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
        (quit_confirm): Change exit message again

        (find_methods): Comment out an apparently
        bogus error message because it messes up Foundry.

        * serial.c
        - Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
        (_initialize_serial): Add a description of
        "set remotelogbase".

        don't dump core, instead print out an error message.

        * breakpoint.c
        - Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
        Make set_raw_breakpoint, set_breakpoint_count,
        and breakpoint_count non-static so they are accessible from
        elsewhere.
        (enable_breakpoint): Enable breakpoint
        with same disposition instead of changing all breakpoints
        to donttouch.

        * annotate.h
	- Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
        Add declarations for annotation hooks.
 
        * annotate.c
	- Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
        Add hooks: annotate_starting_hook, annotate_stopped_hook,
        annotate_signalled_hook, annotate_exited_hook.
        (annotate_starting): If hook exists, call it instead.
        (annotate_stopped): If hook exists, call it instead.
        (annotate_exited): If hook exists, call it instead.

	so that gdbserver can be built with the m32r simulator.
