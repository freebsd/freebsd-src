This document contains a collection of notes specific to the import
of pjdfstest into head.  These notes are built on the instructions in
the FreeBSD Subversion Primer that detail how to deal with vendor
branches and you are supposed to follow those:

	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/committers-guide/subversion-primer.html

The pjdfstest source code is hosted on GitHub:

	https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest

and is imported into the pjdfstest vendor branch (see base/vendor/pjdfstest/).

To merge the vendor branch into head do something like this:

	cd .../base/head/contrib/pjdfstest
	svn merge --accept=postpone \
	    svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/pjdfstest/dist .

and resolve any conflicts that may arise at this point.

Lastly, with the list of old and new files in this import, make sure
to update the reachover Makefiles accordingly.
