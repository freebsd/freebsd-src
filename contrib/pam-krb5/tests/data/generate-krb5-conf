# Generate a krb5.conf file in the current directory for testing purposes.
# Takes one command-line argument: the default realm to use.  Strips out the
# entire [appdefaults] section to avoid picking up any local configuration and
# sets the default realm as indicated.
#
# The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
# which can be found at <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
