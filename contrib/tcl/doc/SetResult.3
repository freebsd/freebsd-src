.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures described here are utilities for manipulating the
result value in a Tcl interpreter.
The interpreter result may be either a Tcl object or a string.
For example, \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR and \fBTcl_SetResult\fR
set the interpreter result to, respectively, an object and a string.
Similarly, \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR and \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR
return the interpreter result as an object and as a string.
The procedures always keep the string and object forms
of the interpreter result consistent.
For example, if \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR is called to set
the result to an object,
then \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR is called,
it will return the object's string value.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR
arranges for \fIobjPtr\fR to be the result for \fIinterp\fR,
replacing any existing result.
The result is left pointing to the object
referenced by \fIobjPtr\fR.
\fIobjPtr\fR's reference count is incremented
since there is now a new reference to it from \fIinterp\fR.
The reference count for any old result object
is decremented and the old result object is freed if no
references to it remain.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR returns the result for \fIinterp\fR as an object.
The object's reference count is not incremented;
if the caller needs to retain a long-term pointer to the object
they should use \fBTcl_IncrRefCount\fR to increment its reference count
in order to keep it from being freed too early or accidently changed.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR
arranges for \fIstring\fR to be the result for the current Tcl
command in \fIinterp\fR, replacing any existing result.
The \fIfreeProc\fR argument specifies how to manage the storage
for the \fIstring\fR argument;
it is discussed in the section
\fBTHE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT\fR below.
If \fIstring\fR is \fBNULL\fR, then \fIfreeProc\fR is ignored
and \fBTcl_SetResult\fR
re-initializes \fIinterp\fR's result to point to an empty string.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR returns the result for \fIinterp\fR as an string.
If the result was set to an object by a \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR call,
the object form will be converted to a string and returned.
If the object's string representation contains null bytes,
this conversion will lose information.
For this reason, programmers are encouraged to
write their code to use the new object API procedures
and to call \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR instead.
.PP
\fBTcl_ResetResult\fR clears the result for \fIinterp\fR
and leaves the result in its normal empty initialized state.
If the result is an object,
its reference count is decremented and the result is left
pointing to an unshared object representing an empty string.
If the result is a dynamically allocated string, its memory is free*d
and the result is left as a empty string.
\fBTcl_ResetResult\fR also clears the error state managed by
\fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR, \fBTcl_AddObjErrorInfo\fR,
and \fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR.

.SH OLD STRING PROCEDURES
.PP
Use of the following procedures is deprecated
since they manipulate the Tcl result as a string.
Procedures such as \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR
that manipulate the result as an object
can be significantly more efficient.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR makes it easy to build up Tcl results in pieces.
It takes each of its \fIstring\fR arguments and appends them in order
to the current result associated with \fIinterp\fR.
If the result is in its initialized empty state (e.g. a command procedure
was just invoked or \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR was just called),
then \fBTcl_AppendResult\fR sets the result to the concatenation of
its \fIstring\fR arguments.
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR may be called repeatedly as additional pieces
of the result are produced.
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR takes care of all the
storage management issues associated with managing \fIinterp\fR's
result, such as allocating a larger result area if necessary.
It also converts the current interpreter result from an object
to a string, if necessary, before appending the argument strings.
Any number of \fIstring\fR arguments may be passed in a single
call; the last argument in the list must be a NULL pointer.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendElement\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendResult\fR in
that it allows results to be built up in pieces.
However, \fBTcl_AppendElement\fR takes only a single \fIstring\fR
argument and it appends that argument to the current result
as a proper Tcl list element.
\fBTcl_AppendElement\fR adds backslashes or braces if necessary
to ensure that \fIinterp\fR's result can be parsed as a list and that
\fIstring\fR will be extracted as a single element.
Under normal conditions, \fBTcl_AppendElement\fR will add a space
character to \fIinterp\fR's result just before adding the new
list element, so that the list elements in the result are properly
separated.
However if the new list element is the first in a list or sub-list
(i.e. \fIinterp\fR's current result is empty, or consists of the
single character ``{'', or ends in the characters `` {'') then no
space is added.
.PP
\fBTcl_FreeResult\fR performs part of the work
of \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR.
It frees up the memory associated with \fIinterp\fR's result.
It also sets \fIinterp->freeProc\fR to zero, but doesn't
change \fIinterp->result\fR or clear error state.
\fBTcl_FreeResult\fR is most commonly used when a procedure
is about to replace one result value with another.

.SH DIRECT ACCESS TO INTERP->RESULT IS DEPRECATED
.PP
It used to be legal for programs to
directly read and write \fIinterp->result\fR
to manipulate the interpreter result.
Direct access to \fIinterp->result\fR is now strongly deprecated
because it can make the result's string and object forms inconsistent.
Programs should always read the result
using the procedures \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR or \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR,
and write the result using \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR or \fBTcl_SetResult\fR.

.SH THE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT
.PP
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR's \fIfreeProc\fR argument specifies how 
the Tcl system is to manage the storage for the \fIstring\fR argument.
If \fBTcl_SetResult\fR or \fBTcl_SetObjResult\fR are called
at a time when \fIinterp\fR holds a string result,
they do whatever is necessary to dispose of the old string result
(see the \fBTcl_Interp\fR manual entry for details on this).
.PP
If \fIfreeProc\fR is \fBTCL_STATIC\fR it means that \fIstring\fR
refers to an area of static storage that is guaranteed not to be
modified until at least the next call to \fBTcl_Eval\fR.
If \fIfreeProc\fR
is \fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR it means that \fIstring\fR was allocated with a call
to \fBTcl_Alloc\fR and is now the property of the Tcl system.
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR will arrange for the string's storage to be
released by calling \fBTcl_Free\fR when it is no longer needed.
If \fIfreeProc\fR is \fBTCL_VOLATILE\fR it means that \fIstring\fR
points to an area of memory that is likely to be overwritten when
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR returns (e.g. it points to something in a stack frame).
In this case \fBTcl_SetResult\fR will make a copy of the string in
dynamically allocated storage and arrange for the copy to be the
result for the current Tcl command.
.PP
If \fIfreeProc\fR isn't one of the values \fBTCL_STATIC\fR,
\fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR, and \fBTCL_VOLATILE\fR, then it is the address
of a procedure that Tcl should call to free the string.
This allows applications to use non-standard storage allocators.
When Tcl no longer needs the storage for the string, it will
call \fIfreeProc\fR. \fIFreeProc\fR should have arguments and
result that match the type \fBTcl_FreeProc\fR:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *\fIblockPtr\fR);
.CE
When \fIfreeProc\fR is called, its \fIblockPtr\fR will be set to
the value of \fIstring\fR passed to \fBTcl_SetResult\fR.
