#
# This shell script provides a wrapper for ld under AIX in order to
# create the .exp file required for linking.  Its arguments consist
# of the name and arguments that would normally be provided to the
# ld command.  This script extracts the names of the object files
# from the argument list, creates a .exp file describing all of the
# symbols exported by those files, and then invokes "ldCmd" to
# perform the real link.

# Create the export file from all of the object files, using nm followed
# by sed editing.  Here are some tricky aspects of this:
#
# 1. Nm produces different output under AIX 4.1 than under AIX 3.2.5;
#    the following statements handle both versions.
# 2. Use the -g switch to nm instead of -e under 4.1 (this shows just
#    externals, not statics;  -g isn't available under 3.2.5, though).
# 3. Eliminate lines that end in ":": these are the names of object
#    files (relevant in 4.1 only).
# 4. Eliminate entries with the "U" key letter;  these are undefined
#    symbols (relevant in 4.1 only).
# 5. Eliminate lines that contain the string "0|extern" preceded by space;
#    in 3.2.5, these are undefined symbols (address 0).
# 6. Eliminate lines containing the "unamex" symbol.  In 3.2.5, these
#    are also undefined symbols.
# 7. If a line starts with ".", delete the leading ".", since this will
#    just cause confusion later.
# 8. Eliminate everything after the first field in a line, so that we're
#    left with just the symbol name.
