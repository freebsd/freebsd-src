.Dt LIBXO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libxo
.Nd library for emitting text, XML, JSON, or HTML output
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libxo
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libxo/xo.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions defined in
.Lb libxo
are used to generate a choice of
.Em TEXT ,
.Em XML ,
.Em JSON ,
or
.Em HTML
output.  A common set of functions are used, with
command line switches passed to the library to control the details of
the output.
.Pp
Most commands emit text output aimed at humans.  It is designed
to be parsed and understood by a user.  Humans are gifted at extracted
details and pattern matching.  Often programmers need to extract
information from this human-oriented output.  Programmers use tools
like grep, awk, and regular expressions to ferret out the pieces of
information they need.  Such solutions are fragile and require
updates when output contents change or evolve, requiring testing and
validation.
.Pp
Modern tool developers favors encoding schemes like XML and JSON,
which allow trivial parsing and extraction of data.  Such formats are
simple, well understood, hierarchical, easily parsed, and often
integrate easier with common tools and environments.
.Pp
In addition, modern reality means that more output ends up in web
browsers than in terminals, making HTML output valuable.
.Pp
.Em libxo
allows a single set of function calls in source code to generate
traditional text output, as well as XML and JSON formatted data.  HTML
can also be generated; "<div>" elements surround the traditional text
output, with attributes that detail how to render the data.
.Pp
There are four encoding styles supported by libxo: TEXT, HTML, JSON,
and XML.  JSON and XML are suitable for encoding data, while TEXT and
HTML are suited for display to the user.  TEXT output can be display
on a terminal session, allowing compatibility with traditional usage.
HTML can be matched with a small CSS file to permit rendering in any
HTML5 browser.  XML output is suitable for tools like XPath and
protocols like NETCONF.  JSON output can be used for RESTful APIs.
.Pp
The
.Em libxo
library allows an application to generate text, XML, JSON,
and HTML output using a common set of function calls.  The application
decides at run time which output style should be produced.  The
application calls a function
.Fn xo_emit
to product output that is
described in a format string.  A "field descriptor" tells libxo what
the field is and what it means.  Each field descriptor is placed in
braces with a printf-like format string:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    xo_emit(" {:lines/%7ju} {:words/%7ju} "
            "{:characters/%7ju}{d:filename/%s}\\n",
            linect, wordct, charct, file);
.Ed
.Pp
Each field can have a role, with the 'value' role being the default,
and the role tells libxo how and when to render that field, as well as
a
.Xr printf 3 -like
format string.
.Pp
Output
can then be generated in various style, using the "--libxo" option.
.Sh DEFAULT HANDLE
Handles give an abstraction for libxo that encapsulates the state of a
stream of output.  Handles have the data type "xo_handle_t" and are
opaque to the caller.

The library has a default handle that is automatically initialized.
By default, this handle will send text style output to standard output.
The xo_set_style and xo_set_flags functions can be used to change this
behavior.

Many libxo functions take a handle as their first parameter; most that
do not use the default handle.  Any function taking a handle can
be passed NULL to access the default handle.

For the typical command that is generating output on standard output,
there is no need to create an explicit handle, but they are available
when needed, e.g. for daemons that generate multiple streams of
output.
