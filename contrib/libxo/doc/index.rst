libxo - A Library for Generating Text, XML, JSON, and HTML Output
===================================================================

The libxo library allows an application to generate text, XML, JSON,
and HTML output, suitable for both command line use and for web
applications.  The application decides at run time which output style
should be produced.  By using libxo, a single source code path can
emit multiple styles of output using command line options to select
the style, along with optional behaviors.  libxo includes support for
multiple output streams, pluralization, color, syslog,
:manpage:`humanized(3)` output, internationalization, and UTF-8.  The
library aims to minimize the cost of migrating code to libxo.

libxo ships as part of FreeBSD.
