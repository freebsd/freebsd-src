.Dt DERDUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm derdump
.Nd dumping contents of DER encoded files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar file1
.Oo Ar fileN ... Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility dumps the contents of one or more DER encoded
Ar file
in a more human readable format.
This is similar to the
.Xr asn1parse 1
utility distributed with OpenSSL when used with the
.Fl inform
.Ar DER
option.
.Pp
A representation of the object will be output to
.Em stdout ,
with indentation to denote objects that are encoded within other constructed
objects.
Note that
.Nm
does not make much attempt to interpret the contents of any particular object.
If an object uses one of the universal types, then a friendly name will be
displayed for that object.
If an object uses any other type, then
.Nm
will display the raw hex value of the type used.
Values of primitive objects are output as raw hex, and no effort is made to
try and print a friendly representation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr asn1parse 1 ,
.Xr libder 3
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
does not currently make any attempt to render a type that uses the long encoded
format.
Instead, it will render as
.Dq { ... } .
