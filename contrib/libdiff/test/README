The test produces a diff, which is successful if it is able to reconstruct the
original source files from it. It is not tested whether diff output is optimal
or beautiful.

Since different diff algorithms can produce different diff outputs, the
expect*.diff files are merely provided for reference and are not part of the
tests.
