.Sh NAME
.Nm hv_kvp_daemon
.Nd Hyper-V Key Value Pair Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dn
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon provides the ability to store, retrieve, modify and delete 
Key Value pairs for
.Fx
guest partitions running on Hyper-V.
.Pp
Hyper-V allows administrators to store custom metadata in the form
of Key Value pairs inside the
.Fx
guest partition.
Administrators can
use Windows Powershell scripts to add, read, modify and delete such
Key Value pairs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
accepts Key Value pair management requests from the
.Xr hv_utils 4
driver and performs the actual metadata management on the file-system.
.Pp
The same daemon and driver combination is also used to set and get
IP addresses from a
.Fx
guest. 
.Pp
The set functionality is particularly
useful when the
.Fx
guest is assigned a static IP address and is failed
over from one Hyper-V host to another.
After failover, Hyper-V uses the set IP
functionality to automatically
update the
.Fx
guest's IP address to its original static value.
.Pp
On the other hand, the get IP functionality is used to update the guest IP
address in the Hyper-V management console window.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Run as regular process instead of a daemon for debugging purpose.
.It Fl n
Generate debugging output.
