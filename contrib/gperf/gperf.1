.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIgperf\fP reads a set of ``keys'' from \fIkeyfile\fP (or, by
default, from the standard input) and attempts to find a non-minimal
perfect hashing function that recognizes a member of the key set in
constant, i.e., O(1), time.  If such a function is found the program
generates a pair of \fIC\fP source code routines that perform the
hashing and table lookup.  All generated code is directed to the
standard output.

Please refer to the \fIgperf.texinfo\fP file for more information.
