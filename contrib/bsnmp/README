This is a mini-SNMP daemon. The basic daemon implements the system group
and a number of private extensions to manage the UDP transport mapping,
communities, trap destinations and loadable modules. In this form it can
be used to provide remote access to arbitrary data that can be described in
the form as required by the SMI. The daemon speaks both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.

One basic loadable module is provided together with the daemon:

- snmp_mibII provides the information groups for ip, tcp, and udp.

Installation
------------

As usual by doing:

	configure [--with-libbegemot[=path]]
	make
	make install

This does not install a configuration file. The standard location for the
configuration is /etc/snmpd.config, but can be overwritten on the command
line. An example configuration file is provided. Use --with-libbegemot
to use libbegemot instead of libisc.

Running
-------

	snmpd [-m name[=value]] [-p pid-file] [-c config-file] [-d] [-l prefix]
	      [-D debug-flags] [-I path]

	-m	defines a configuration macro. If no value is given it
		is set to the empty string.

	-p	specify the file where to store the PID. Default is
		/var/run/{prefix}.pid.

	-c	specify the configuration file. Default is /etc/{prefix}.config.

	-d	don't go into daemon mode.

	-l	specify the prefix. This is used for the default config and
		pid file names and for the syslog. Default is "snmpd".

	-D	specify debug flags:

		d	dump all PDUs.

		e	debug event library.

	-I	specify the include path for system configuration files.
		Default is /etc:/usr/etc:/usr/local/etc.

The directory snmpd contains a snmpd.sh script, which can be copied to
/usr/local/etc/rc.d to automatically start and stop the daemon. snmpd.config
is an example config script.
