$FreeBSD: src/contrib/bsnmp/FREEBSD-upgrade,v 1.2.32.1 2010/02/10 00:26:20 kensmith Exp $

This is the Begemot micro-SNMP daemon. It is the base for the ILMI daemon
for ngATM. Be careful to feed changes back to the maintainer
<harti@freebsd.org>, because the code here is actually shared with other
environments besides FreeBSD.

Import should be done by:

	1. unpack distribution into clean directory

	2. remove all unneeded files

	3. cvs import \
		-m "Virgin import of bsnmpd X.Y" \
		src/contrib/bsnmp BEGEMOT BSNMP_X_Y

	4. resolve conflicts

	5. check the makefile in lib/libbsnmp and usr.sbin/bsnmp
