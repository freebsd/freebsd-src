.Sh NAME
.Nm gensnmpdef
.Nd "generate a MIB description file from MIBs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hEe
.Op Fl c Ar cut
.Ar name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to create an initial MIB description file from
one or more MIBs.
The description file must be edited to be actually useful
for feeding it into
.Xr gensnmptree 1 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar cut
Specify the number of initial sub-oids that should be omitted
from the tree in the output.
.Xr gensnmptree 1
automatically adds 1.3.6 in front of all OIDs so the default value
of 3 is just correct in most cases.
.It Fl E
Generate typedefs for named enumerations.
These are enumerations defined via the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro.
The normal tree output is suppressed.
.It Fl e
Generate typedefs for unnamed enumerations.
These are enumerations defined in the SYNTAX clause of an OBJECT-TYPE macro.
The name of the enumeration is formed by appending the string
.Ql Type
to the name of the object.
The normal tree output is suppressed.
.It Fl h
Print a short help text and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
does no attempt on sorting the OID tree so in case of complex and
non-standard MIBs it is necessary to sort the tree in the resulting definition
file by hand.

.Sh BUGS
The utility is by no means bullet-proof and may fail for complex
or non-standard MIBs.
Its output is expected to be edited by hand.
