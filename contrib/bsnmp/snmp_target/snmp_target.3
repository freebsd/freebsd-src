.Sh NAME
.Nm snmp_target
.Nd "Target addresses and notifications module for"
.Xr bsnmpd 1
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pq begemotSnmpdModulePath."target" = "/usr/lib/snmp_target.so"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm snmp_target
module implements SNMPv3 Management Target MIB and basic functionality from
Notification MIB as defined in RFC 3413. The module is used to manage the
internal list of SNMPv3 notification target addresses in
.Nm bsnmpd
and their associated transport and encapsulation parameters.
The module must be loaded for
.Nm bsnmpd
to send SNMPv3 Trap-PDUs to the configured notification target addresses.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
A short description of the objects implemented in the module follows.
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXX"
.It Va snmpTargetSpinLock
An advisory lock used to coordinate several Command Generator Applications when
altering the SNMP Target addresses and their associated parameters.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrTable
The table contains the transport addresses to be used in generation of SNMP
messages.
The table contains the following objects
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va snmpTargetAddrName"
.It Va snmpTargetAddrName
A unique local identifier used as entry key. Not accessible for GET or SET
operations.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrTDomain
The transport domain of the target address. Currently only UDP over IPv4 is
supported and any attempt to SET the value of this object will return an
"inconsistentValue" error. Additional transport domains will be supported
in future via the object definitions in TRANSPORT-ADDRESS-MIB (RFC 3419).
.It Va snmpTargetAddrTAddress
The transport address of this entry interpreted within the context of the value
of
.Va snmpTargetAddrTDomain .
For UDP over IPv4, this is a 6-byte long octetstring, with the first 4 bytes
representing the IPv4 address and the last 2 bytes the UDP port number in
network-byte order.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrTimeout
The value of this object is only relevant when the receiver of the SNMP
message is to send an acknowledgment that the message was received, i.e
for SNMP notifications it is relevant if the notification is SNMP Inform
rather than SNMP Trap. Currently
.Nm bsnmpd
supports only SNMP Trap notifications, so the value of this object is
meaningless.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrRetryCount
As with
.Va snmpTargetAddrTimeout
the value of this object currently is meaningless.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrTagList
A list of human-readable tag values used to select target addresses for a
particular operation. Recognized ASCII delimiting characters between tags are
space (0x20), tab (0x20), carriage return (0xOD) and line feed (0x0A).
.It Va snmpTargetAddrParams
The value of this object contains the value of a key in snmpTargetParamsTable
containing SNMP parameters used when generating messages to this transport
address.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrStorageType
This column always has either of two values. Entries created via
.Nm bsnmpd's
configuration file always have this column set to readOnly (5) and
it is not possible to modify those entries. Entries created by Command Generator
Applications always have this column set to volatile(2) and such entries are
lost when the module is restarted. A SET operation on this column is not
allowed.
.It Va snmpTargetAddrRowStatus
This column is used to create new target address entries or delete existing ones
from the table.
.El
.It Va snmpTargetParamsTable
The table contains the target information to be used in generation of SNMP
messages.
The table contains the following objects
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va snmpTargetParamsName"
.It Va snmpTargetParamsName
A unique local identifier used as entry key. Not accessible for GET or SET
operations.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsMPModel
The Message Processing Model to be used when generating SNMP PDUs using this
entry. Supported values are 0 for SNMPv1, 1 for SNMPv2c and 3 for SNMPv3.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel
The Security Model to be used when generating SNMP PDUs using this entry.
Supported values are 1  for SNMPv1, 2 for SNMPv2c and 3 for SNMPv3 User-Based
Security Model.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsSecurityName
The securityName which identifies the Principal on whose behalf SNMP PDUs
will be generated using this entry. For SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c this is the
name of a community configured in
.Nm bsnmpd ,
and for SNMPv3 USM, this is the name of an existing user configured via the
.Nm snmp_usm
module.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel
The Security Level to be used when generating SNMP PDUs using this entry.
Supported values are noAuthNoPriv(1) for plain-text PDUs with no authentication,
authNoPriv(2) for authenticated plain-text PDUs and authPriv(3) for encrypted
PDUs.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsStorageType
As with
.Va snmpTargetAddrStorageType
this column always has either of two values. Entries created via
.Nm bsnmpd's
configuration file always have this column set to readOnly (5), while entries
created by Command Generator Applications always have this column set to
volatile(2). A SET operation on this column is not allowed.
.It Va snmpTargetParamsRowStatus
This column is used to create new target address parameters entries or delete
existing ones from the table.
.El
.It Va snmpNotifyTable
The table is used to select the management targets which should receive SNMP
notifications.
The table contains the following objects
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va snmpNotifyName"
.It Va snmpNotifyName
A unique local identifier used as entry key. Not accessible for GET or SET
operations.
.It Va snmpNotifyTag
This object contains a single tag value used to select target addresses from
the
.Va snmpTargetAddrTable
to which the notifications will be send.
.It Va snmpNotifyType
The type of SNMP notifications that will be send to the target addresses
matching the corresponding
.Va snmpNotifyTag .
Possible values are Trap (1) or Inform (2). Currently only SNMP Traps are
supported and any attempt to SET the value of this object will return an
"inconsistentValue" error.
.It Va snmpNotifyStorageType
Again this column always has either of two values. Entries created via
.Nm bsnmpd's
configuration file always have this column set to readOnly (5), while entries
created by Command Generator Applications always have this column set to
volatile(2). A SET operation on this column is not allowed.
.It Va snmpNotifyRowStatus
This column is used to create new notification target entries or delete existing
ones from the table.
.El
.El
.Pp
The
.Va snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable
and
.Va snmpNotifyFilterTable
tables from the SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB are not supported by the module.
Notification filtering is supported via the
.Xr snmp_vacm 3
module instead.
