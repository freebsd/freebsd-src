This file documents the OID assignments under BSNMP's private OID.

While I was at Fraunhofer Fokus (www.fokus.fraunhofer.de) I registered
an official OID for Fokus: enterprises 12325 and assigned the sub-OID 1
to the software I develop. Under this OID there are:

enterprises
  12325		FOKUS
    1		BEGEMOT
      1		BEGEMOT-SNMPD
      2		BEGEMOT-NETGRAPH	snmpd netgraph module
      100	BEGEMOT-ILMID		snmpd ILMID module
      101	BEGEMOT-ATM		snmpd ATM module
      200	BEGEMOT-PF		snmpd PF module (phillip@freebsd.org)

If you need an OID and don't know where to stuck it in, I can assign you one -
just drop me a mail.
