.SH NAME
tcpdchk \- tcp wrapper configuration checker
.SH SYNOPSYS
tcpdchk [-a] [-d] [-i inet_conf] [-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fItcpdchk\fR examines your tcp wrapper configuration and reports all
potential and real problems it can find. The program examines the
\fItcpd\fR access control files (by default, these are
\fI/etc/hosts.allow\fR and \fI/etc/hosts.deny\fR), and compares the
entries in these files against entries in the \fIinetd\fR or \fItlid\fR
network configuration files.
.PP
\fItcpdchk\fR reports problems such as non-existent pathnames; services
that appear in \fItcpd\fR access control rules, but are not controlled
by \fItcpd\fR; services that should not be wrapped; non-existent host
names or non-internet address forms; occurrences of host aliases
instead of official host names; hosts with a name/address conflict;
inappropriate use of wildcard patterns; inappropriate use of NIS
netgroups or references to non-existent NIS netgroups; references to
non-existent options; invalid arguments to options; and so on.
.PP
Where possible, \fItcpdchk\fR provides a helpful suggestion to fix the
problem.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -a
Report access control rules that permit access without an explicit
ALLOW keyword. This applies only when the extended access control
language is enabled (build with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS).
.IP -d
Examine \fIhosts.allow\fR and \fIhosts.deny\fR files in the current
directory instead of the default ones.
.IP "-i inet_conf"
Specify this option when \fItcpdchk\fR is unable to find your
\fIinetd.conf\fR or \fItlid.conf\fR network configuration file, or when
you suspect that the program uses the wrong one.
.IP -v
Display the contents of each access control rule.  Daemon lists, client
lists, shell commands and options are shown in a pretty-printed format;
this makes it easier for you to spot any discrepancies between what you
want and what the program understands.
.SH FILES
.PP
The default locations of the \fItcpd\fR access control tables are:

/etc/hosts.allow
