 /*
  * This module determines the type of socket (datagram, stream), the client
  * socket address and port, the server socket address and port. In addition,
  * it provides methods to map a transport address to a printable host name
  * or address. Socket address information results are in static memory.
  * 
  * The result from the hostname lookup method is STRING_PARANOID when a host
  * pretends to have someone elses name, or when a host name is available but
  * could not be verified.
  * 
  * When lookup or conversion fails the result is set to STRING_UNKNOWN.
  * 
  * Diagnostics are reported through syslog(3).
