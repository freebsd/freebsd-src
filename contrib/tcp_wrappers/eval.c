 /*
  * Routines for controlled evaluation of host names, user names, and so on.
  * They are, in fact, wrappers around the functions that are specific for
  * the sockets or TLI programming interfaces. The request_info and host_info
  * structures are used for result cacheing.
  * 
  * These routines allows us to postpone expensive operations until their
  * results are really needed. Examples are hostname lookups and double
  * checks, or username lookups. Information that cannot be retrieved is
  * given the value "unknown" ("paranoid" in case of hostname problems).
  * 
  * When ALWAYS_HOSTNAME is off, hostname lookup is done only when required by
  * tcpd paranoid mode, by access control patterns, or by %letter expansions.
  * 
  * When ALWAYS_RFC931 mode is off, user lookup is done only when required by
  * access control patterns or %letter expansions.
