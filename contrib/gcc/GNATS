                      Submitting Bug Reports using GNATS

gnatsweb and gccbug

   GNATS,  the GNU bug tracking system, is used to track GCC bug reports.
   Before   submitting   a   bug   report,  please  read  the  [1]general
   instructions.

   The  preferred  way  to  submit  a  bug  report  is  by  means  of the
   [2]gnatsweb  interface. Make sure you include an e-mail address, so we
   can inform you when the status of your report changes.

   Another  way  is  to  use  the  gccbug  program  that is automatically
   installed  with  current versions of GCC, which submits the bug report
   by e-mail.

   Both techniques use the same GNATS bug database.

Filling out a report

   The  bug  report  form  provides  a  number  of fields; you'll need to
   fill-out  most  of  those  (as  indicated below) to provide a complete
   report. The fields have the following purpose:

   Originator
          Your name.

   Organization
          Your organization. You can leave this field blank.

   Confidential
          This  field  is  unused  and  set  to  'no'.  All  bug reports,
          including sample code, are publicly accessible.

   Synopsis
          A one-line description of the problem; something like "GCC 2.95
          does not foo", "objc crashes when doing bar".

   Severity
          Can be one of

        critical
                GCC is completely not operational; no work-around known.

        serious
                GCC is not working properly; a work-around is possible.

        non-critical
                Report indicates minor problem.

   Priority
          Can be one of

        high
                A  solution  is  necessary  as  soon as possible. This is
                reserved to GCC maintainers.

        medium
                The problem should be solved in the next release.

        low
                The problem should be solved in a future release.

   Category
          This  indicates  the  GCC  subproject  which is affected by the
          problem. Currently, it can be one of

        ada
                A problem with the Ada compiler, libraries or tools.

        bootstrap
                GCC  fails  to  bootstrap. This should be filed only if a
                bootstrap failure prevails for an extended period of time
                (at  least  one  week)  on  any  platform  (and  possibly
                not-so-common  conditions  like  a  read-only srcdir), or
                non-mainstream platforms.

        c++
                A problem with the C++ compiler.

        c
                A problem with the C compiler.

        debug
                A problem with generating debugging information.

        fortran
                A problem with the Fortran compiler.

        java
                A problem with the Java compiler.

        libf2c
                A problem in the Fortran runtime library.

        libgcj
                A problem in the Java runtime library.

        libobjc
                A problem in the Objective C runtime library.

        libstdc++
                A problem in the Standard C++ runtime library.

        middle-end
                A problem in the internal compiler passes.

        objc
                A problem with the Objective C compiler.

        optimization
                A problem only occurring under optimization.

        preprocessor
                A problem with the C preprocessor.

        target
                The problem depends on the specific target architecture.

        web
                There is an error or omission on the Web pages.

        other
                The problem is in none of these categories.

   Class
          A classification of the problem; one of

        doc-bug
                The documentation is incorrect.

        accepts-illegal
                GCC fails to reject erroneous code.

        rejects-legal
                GCC gives an error message for correct code.

        wrong-code
                The machine code generated by GCC is incorrect.

        ice-on-legal-code
                GCC  gives  an  Internal Compiler Error (ICE) for correct
                code.

        ice-on-illegal-code
                GCC gives an ICE instead of reporting an error.

        pessimizes-code
                GCC misses an important optimization opportunity.

        sw-bug
                Software bug of some other class than above.

        change-request
                A feature in GCC is missing.

        support
                I need help with GCC.

   Release
          GCC version, as obtained from 'gcc -v' (one line).

   Environment
          Information  about  your  operating  system  version,  hardware
          architecture, and environment settings that affect GCC.

   Description
          Precise  description  of  the problem. You should put the error
          messages  printed  by  GCC here; source code should go into the
          next section.

   How-To-Repeat
          Please  put  the  complete source code to reproduce the problem
          here.  The  gccbug  script  currently  does  not  support  file
          attachments.  Instead, if you have multiple files, include them
          uuencoded  (compressing  them before if they are large). If you
          use gnatsweb, you can use the file attachments button instead.

   Fix
          How  to  correct or work around the problem, if known (multiple
          lines).
