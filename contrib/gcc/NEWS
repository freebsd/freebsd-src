                                  GCC 3.2

   November 19, 2002

   The  [1]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.2.1.

   The links below still apply to GCC 3.2.1.

   August 14, 2002

   The  [2]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC 3.2.

   GCC  used  to  stand  for  the  GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports  several  other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   A  list  of [3]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The  GCC  developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed  [4]new  features,  improvements,  bug  fixes,  and  other
   changes  as  well  as  test  results  to GCC. This [5]amazing group of
   volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   For  additional  information  about  GCC  please  refer  to the [6]GCC
   project web site or contact the [7]GCC development mailing list.

   To obtain GCC please use [8]our mirror sites, one of the [9]GNU mirror
   sites, or [10]our CVS server.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.2/changes.html

                            Changes in GCC 3.2.1

C/C++/Objective-C

     * The  method of constructing the list of directories to be searched
       for  header  files  has been revised. If a directory named by a -I
       option  is  a  standard  system  include  directory, the option is
       ignored  to  ensure  that  the  default  search  order  for system
       directories  and  the special treatment of system header files are
       not defeated.
     * The  C  and  Objective-C  compilers  no  longer accept the "Naming
       Types"  extension  (typedef foo = bar); it was already unavailable
       in  C++.  Code  which  uses  it will need to be changed to use the
       "typeof"  extension  instead:  typedef  typeof(bar)  foo. (We have
       removed  this extension without a period of deprecation because it
       has  caused  the  compiler  to  crash since version 3.0 and no one
       noticed  until  very  recently.  Thus  we  conclude  it  is not in
       widespread use.)

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

  IA-32

     * Fixed a number of bugs in SSE and MMX intrinsics.
     * Fixed  common  compiler  crashes  with SSE instruction set enabled
       (implied by -march=pentium3, pentium4, athlon-xp)
     * __m128 and __m128i is not 128bit aligned when used in structures.

  x86-64

     * A  bug  whereby the compiler could generate bad code for bzero has
       been fixed.
     * ABI fixes (implying ABI incompatibilities with previous version in
       some corner cases)
     * Fixed prefetch code generation

Bug Fixes

   See [1]this message for a list of bugs fixed in this release.

                             Changes in GCC 3.2

Bug Fixes

   See [2]this message for a list of bugs fixed in this release.

Caveats

     * The    C++    compiler    does   not   correctly   zero-initialize
       pointers-to-data members. You must explicitly initialize them. For
       example:
           int S::*m(0);

       will  work,  but  depending on default-initialization to zero will
       not  work.  This  bug  cannot be fixed in GCC 3.2 without inducing
       unacceptable risks. It will be fixed in GCC 3.3.
     * This  GCC release is based on the GCC 3.1 sourcebase, and thus has
       all the [3]changes in the GCC 3.1 series. In addition, GCC 3.2 has
       a  number  of  C++  ABI fixes which make its C++ compiler generate
       binary  code which is incompatible with the C++ compilers found in
       earlier GCC releases, including GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.1.1.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

  C++

     * There are now no known differences between the C++ ABI implemented
       in  GCC and the multi-vendor standard. We believe that the ABI for
       the  C++  standard  library  is  now stable and will not change in
       future  versions  of  the  compiler.  However, hard experience has
       taught  us  to be cautious; it is possible that more problems will
       be  found.  It is our intention to make changes to the ABI only if
       they  are  necessary for correct compilation of C++, as opposed to
       conformance to the ABI documents.
     * For  details  on  how  to  build  an  ABI  compliant  compiler for
       GNU/Linux systems, check the [4]common C++ ABI page.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.1/changes.html

                  GCC 3.1 Changes, New Features, and Fixes

Additional changes in GCC 3.1.1

     * A  bug  related to how structures and unions are returned has been
       fixed for powerpc-*-netbsd*.
     * An  important  bug in the implementation of -fprefetch-loop-arrays
       has  been  fixed.  Previously  the  optimization prefetched random
       blocks of memory for most targets except for i386.
     * The  Java compiler now compiles Java programs much faster and also
       works with parallel make.
     * Nested functions have been fixed for mips*-*-netbsd*.
     * Some  missing  floating point support routines have beed added for
       mips*-*-netbsd*.
     * This  [1]message gives additional information about the bugs fixed
       in this release.

Caveats

     * The -traditional C compiler option has been deprecated and will be
       removed  in GCC 3.3. (It remains possible to preprocess non-C code
       with the traditional preprocessor.)
     * The  default  debugging  format  for most ELF platforms (including
       GNU/Linux  and  FreeBSD; notable exception is Solaris) has changed
       from stabs to DWARF2. This requires GDB 5.1.1 or later.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * Jan  Hubicka, SuSE Labs, together with Richard Henderson, Red Hat,
       and  Andreas  Jaeger, SuSE Labs, has contributed [2]infrastructure
       for profile driven optimizations.
       Options  -fprofile-arcs and -fbranch-probabilities can now be used
       to  improve  speed  of  the generated code by profiling the actual
       program  behaviour on typical runs. In the absence of profile info
       the compiler attempts to guess the profile statically.
     * [3]SPEC2000  and  [4]SPEC95 benchmark suites are now used daily to
       monitor performance of the generated code.
       According  to  the  SPECInt2000  results on an AMD Athlon CPU, the
       code generated by GCC 3.1 is 6% faster on the average (8.2% faster
       with  profile  feedback) compared to GCC 3.0. The code produced by
       GCC  3.0  is about 2.1% faster compared to 2.95.3. Tests were done
       using the -O2 -march=athlon command-line options.
     * Alexandre  Oliva, of [5]Red Hat, has generalized the tree inlining
       infrastructure developed by [6]CodeSourcery, LLC for the C++ front
       end,  so  that  it  is  now  used in the C front end too. Inlining
       functions as trees exposes them earlier to the compiler, giving it
       more opportunities for optimization.
     * Support  for  data  prefetching instructions has been added to the
       GCC  back  end  and  several  targets.  A  new  __builtin_prefetch
       intrinsic  is available to explicitly insert prefetch instructions
       and experimental support for loop array prefetching has been added
       (see -fprefetch-loop-array documentation).
     * Support  for  emitting  debugging  information for macros has been
       added for DWARF2. It is activated using -g3.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

  C/C++

     * A few more [7]ISO C99 features.
     * The  preprocessor  is  10-50%  faster than the preprocessor in GCC
       3.0.
     * The  preprocessor's  symbol  table has been merged with the symbol
       table of the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.
     * The preprocessor consumes less memory than the preprocessor in GCC
       3.0,  often  significantly so. On normal input files, it typically
       consumes less memory than pre-3.0 cccp-based GCC, too.

  C++

     * -fhonor-std  and  -fno-honor-std have been removed. -fno-honor-std
       was  a  workaround  to  allow  std compliant code to work with the
       non-std compliant libstdc++-v2. libstdc++-v3 is std compliant.
     * The  C++ ABI has been fixed so that void (A::*)() const is mangled
       as  "M1AKFvvE", rather than "MK1AFvvE" as before. This change only
       affects pointer to cv-qualified member function types.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed to correctly handle this code:
    struct A {
      void operator delete[] (void *, size_t);
    };

    struct B : public A {
    };

    new B[10];

       The amount of storage allocated for the array will be greater than
       it  was  in  3.0,  in order to store the number of elements in the
       array, so that the correct size can be passed to operator delete[]
       when  the  array  is  deleted.  Previously,  the  value  passed to
       operator delete[] was unpredictable.
       This  change  will  only  affect code that declares a two-argument
       operator delete[] with a second parameter of type size_t in a base
       class, and does not override that definition in a derived class.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed so that:
    struct A {
      void operator delete[] (void *, size_t);
      void operator delete[] (void *);
    };

       does  not  cause unnecessary storage to be allocated when an array
       of A objects is allocated.
       This  change  will  only  affect  code that declares both of these
       forms  of  operator  delete[],  and declared the two-argument form
       before the one-argument form.
     * The C++ ABI has been changed so that when a parameter is passed by
       value,  any cleanup for that parameter is performed in the caller,
       as  specified by the ia64 C++ ABI, rather than the called function
       as  before. As a result, classes with a non-trivial destructor but
       a  trivial  copy  constructor  will  be  passed  and  returned  by
       invisible reference, rather than by bitwise copy as before.
     * G++  now  supports the "named return value optimization": for code
       like
    A f () {
      A a;
      ...
      return a;
    }

       G++  will  allocate a in the return value slot, so that the return
       becomes  a  no-op.  For this to work, all return statements in the
       function must return the same variable.
     * Improvements  to the C++ library are listed in [8]the libstdc++-v3
       FAQ.

  Objective-C

     * Annoying  linker  warnings (due to incorrect code being generated)
       have been fixed.
     * If a class method cannot be found, the compiler no longer issues a
       warning  if  a  corresponding  instance  method exists in the root
       class.
     * Forward @protocol declarations have been fixed.
     * Loading  of  categories  has been fixed in certain situations (GNU
       run time only).
     * The  class  lookup  in  the run-time library has been rewritten so
       that  class  method dispatch is more than twice as fast as it used
       to be (GNU run time only).

  Java

     * libgcj   now  includes  RMI,  java.lang.ref.*,  javax.naming,  and
       javax.transaction.
     * Property  files  and  other  system resources can be compiled into
       executables which use libgcj using the new gcj --resource feature.
     * libgcj  has  been ported to more platforms. In particular there is
       now a mostly-functional mingw32 (Windows) target port.
     * JNI   and   CNI   invocation   interfaces   were  implemented,  so
       gcj-compiled Java code can now be called from a C/C++ application.
     * gcj  can  now use builtin functions for certain known methods, for
       instance Math.cos.
     * gcj  can  now automatically remove redundant array-store checks in
       some common cases.
     * The  --no-store-checks  optimization option was added. This can be
       used  to  omit runtime store checks for code which is known not to
       throw ArrayStoreException
     * The  following  third  party  interface  standards  were  added to
       libgcj: org.w3c.dom and org.xml.sax.
     * java.security  has been merged with GNU Classpath. The new package
       is now JDK 1.2 compliant, and much more complete.
     * A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.
     * java.lang.Character  was  rewritten to comply with the Unicode 3.0
       standard, and improve performance.
     * Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.
     * Socket timeouts have been implemented.
     * libgcj  has been merged into a single shared library. There are no
       longer  separate  shared  libraries  for the garbage collector and
       zlib.
     * Several performance improvements were made to gcj and libgcj:
          + Hash synchronization (thin locks)
          + A special allocation path for finalizer-free objects
          + Thread-local allocation
          + Parallel GC, and other GC tweaks

  Fortran

   Fortran improvements are listed in [9]the Fortran documentation.

  Ada

   [10]Ada  Core Technologies, Inc, has contributed its GNAT Ada 95 front
   end  and  associated tools. The GNAT compiler fully implements the Ada
   language as defined by the ISO/IEC 8652 standard.

   Please note that the integration of the Ada front end is still work in
   progress.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

     * Hans-Peter  Nilsson  has  contributed  a port to [11]MMIX, the CPU
       architecture  used in new editions of Donald E. Knuth's The Art of
       Computer Programming.
     * [12]Axis  Communications  has contributed its port to the CRIS CPU
       architecture,  used  in  the  ETRAX  system-on-a-chip  series. See
       [13]Axis' developer site for technical information.
     * Alexandre  Oliva,  of  [14]Red  Hat, has contributed a port to the
       [15]SuperH  SH5 64-bit RISC microprocessor architecture, extending
       the existing SH port.
     * UltraSPARC  is  fully  supported  in  64-bit mode. The option -m64
       enables it.
     * For  compatibility  with the Sun compiler #pragma redefine_extname
       has been implemented on Solaris.
     * The x86 back end has had some noticeable work done to it.
          + [16]SuSE  Labs developers Jan Hubicka, Bo Thorsen and Andreas
            Jaeger   have   contributed   a   port   to  the  AMD  x86-64
            architecture.    For   more   information   on   x86-64   see
            [17]http://www.x86-64.org.
          + The   compiler  now  supports  MMX,  3DNow!,  SSE,  and  SSE2
            instructions.  Options -mmmx, -m3dnow, -msse, and -msse2 will
            enable  the respective instruction sets. Intel C++ compatible
            MMX/3DNow!/SSE  intrinsics  are  implemented. SSE2 intrinsics
            will be added in next major release.
          + Following  those improvements, targets for Pentium MMX, K6-2,
            K6-3,  Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Athlon 4 Mobile/XP/MP were
            added.  Refer  to  the  documentation  on  -march= and -mcpu=
            options for details.
          + For  those  targets  that support it, -mfpmath=sse will cause
            the  compiler  to generate SSE/SSE2 instructions for floating
            point  math  instead  of x87 instructions. Usually, this will
            lead  to  quicker  code  -- especially on the Pentium 4. Note
            that only scalar floating point instructions are used and GCC
            does not exploit SIMD features yet.
          + Prefetch  support  has been added to the Pentium III, Pentium
            4, K6-2, K6-3, and Athlon series.
          + Code  generated for floating point to integer converisons has
            been  improved  leading  to  better  performance  of  many 3D
            applications.
     * The PowerPC back end has added 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux support.
     * C++ support for AIX has been improved.
     * Aldy  Hernandez, of [18]Red Hat, Inc has contributed extensions to
       the  PowerPC port supporting the AltiVec programming model (SIMD).
       The  support,  though  presently  useful,  is  experimental and is
       expected  to  stabilize for 3.2. The support is written to conform
       to Motorola's AltiVec specs. See -maltivec.

Obsolete Systems

   Support  for  a  number of older systems has been declared obsolete in
   GCC  3.1. Unless there is activity to revive them, the next release of
   GCC will have their sources permanently removed.

   All  configurations of the following processor architectures have been

       Compiler Collection Internals").
     * More complete and much improved documentation about GCC's internal
       representation used by the C and C++ front ends.
     * Many cleanups and improvements in general.

                                 GCC 3.0.4

   February 20, 2002

   The  [1]GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release  of  GCC  3.0.4,  which  is  a bug-fix release for the GCC 3.0
   series.

   GCC  used  to  stand  for  the  GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports  several  other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   GCC  3.0.x  has  several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
   and  many  other  new features, relative to GCC 2.95.x. See the [2]new
   features page for a more complete list.

   A  list  of [3]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The  GCC  developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed  new  features,  test  results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This
   [4]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   And  finally,  we  can't  in  good  conscience  fail  to  mention some
   [5]caveats to using GCC 3.0.x.

   For  additional  information  about  GCC  please  refer  to the [6]GCC
   project web site or contact the [7]GCC development mailing list.

   To obtain GCC please use [8]our mirror sites, one of the [9]GNU mirror
   sites, or [10]our CVS server.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/features.html

                            GCC 3.0 New Features

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.4

     * GCC  3.0  now  supports  newer versions of the [1]NetBSD operating
       system, which use the ELF object file format, on x86 processors.
     * Correct  debugging  information  is  generated from functions that
       have lines from multiple files (e.g. yacc output).
     * A  fix  for  whitespace handling in the -traditional preprocessor,
       which can affect Fortran.
     * Fixes to the exception handling runtime.
     * More fixes for bad code generation in C++.
     * A fix for shared library generation under AIX 4.3.
     * Documentation updates.
     * Port of GCC to Tensilica's Xtensa processor contributed.
     * A fix for compiling the PPC Linux kernel (FAT fs wouldn't link).

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.3

     * A fix to correct an accidental change to the PowerPC ABI.
     * Fixes for bad code generation on a variety of architectures.
     * Improvements  to  the  debugging  information  generated  for  C++
       classes.
     * Fixes for bad code generation in C++.
     * A fix to avoid crashes in the C++ demangler.
     * A fix to the C++ standard library to avoid buffer overflows.
     * Miscellaneous improvements for a variety of architectures.

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.2

     * Fixes for bad code generation during loop unrolling.
     * Fixes for bad code generation by the sibling call optimization.
     * Minor improvements to x86 code generation.
     * Implemenation of function descriptors in C++ vtables for IA64.
     * Numerous minor bug-fixes.

Additional changes in GCC 3.0.1

     * C++ fixes for incorrect code-generation.
     * Improved cross-compiling support for the C++ standard library.
     * Fixes for some embedded targets that worked in GCC 2.95.3, but not
       in GCC 3.0.
     * Fixes for various exception-handling bugs.
     * A port to the S/390 architecture.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * [2]Basic block reordering pass.
     * New  if-conversion  pass with support for conditional (predicated)
       execution.
     * New tail call and sibling call elimination optimizations.
     * New register renaming pass.
     * New    (experimental)    [3]static    single    assignment   (SSA)
       representation support.
     * New   dead-code   elimination   pass  implemented  using  the  SSA
       representation.
     * [4]Global null pointer test elimination.
     * [5]Global code hoisting/unification.
     * More  builtins and optimizations for stdio.h, string.h and old BSD
       functions, as well as for ISO C99 functions.
     * New  builtin  __builtin_expect  for  giving  hints  to  the branch
       predictor.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

     * The GNU Compiler for the Java(TM) language (GCJ) is now integrated
       and  supported,  including  the  run-time  library containing most
       common non-GUI Java classes, a bytecode interpreter, and the Boehm
       conservative garbage collector. Many bugs have been fixed. GCJ can
       compile  Java  source  or  Java bytecodes to either native code or
       Java  class  files,  and supports native methods written in either
       the standard JNI or the more efficient and convenient CNI.
     * Here  is  a [6]partial list of C++ improvements, both new features
       and those no longer supported.
     * New   C++   ABI.   On   the  IA-64  platform  GCC  is  capable  of
       inter-operating with other IA-64 compilers.
     * The  new  ABI  also  significantly  reduces the size of symbol and
       debug information.
     * New  [7]C++  support  library  and  many  C++  bug  fixes,  vastly
       improving our conformance to the ISO C++ standard.
     * New [8]inliner for C++.
     * Rewritten C preprocessor, integrated into the C, C++ and Objective
       C compilers, with very many improvements including ISO C99 support
       and [9]improvements to dependency generation.
     * Support for more [10]ISO C99 features.
     * Many   improvements  to  support  for  checking  calls  to  format
       functions  such as printf and scanf, including support for ISO C99
       format features, extensions from the Single Unix Specification and
       GNU  libc  2.2, checking of strfmon formats and features to assist
       in auditing for format string security bugs.
     * New  warnings for C code that may have undefined semantics because
       of violations of sequence point rules in the C standard (such as a
       = a++;, a[n] = b[n++]; and a[i++] = i;), included in -Wall.
     * Additional warning option -Wfloat-equal.
     * Improvements to -Wtraditional.
     * Fortran improvements are listed in [11]the Fortran documentation.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

     * New x86 back-end, generating much improved code.
     * Support for a generic i386-elf target contributed.
     * New  option  to  emit  x86  assembly code using Intel style syntax
       (-mintel-syntax).
     * HPUX 11 support contributed.
     * Improved PowerPC code generation, including scheduled prologue and
       epilogue.
     * Port of GCC to Intel's IA-64 processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Motorola's MCore 210 and 340 contributed.
     * New unified back-end for Arm, Thumb and StrongArm contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Intel's XScale processor contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Atmel's AVR microcontrollers contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Mitsubishi's D30V processor contributed.
     * Port  of  GCC  to  Matsushita's  AM33  processor  (a member of the
       MN10300 processor family) contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Fujitsu's FR30 processor contributed.
     * Port   of   GCC   to   Motorola's  68HC11  and  68HC12  processors
       contributed.
     * Port of GCC to Sun's picoJava processor core contributed.

Documentation improvements

     * Substantially rewritten and improved C preprocessor manual.
     * Many improvements to other documentation.
     * Manpages  for  gcc,  cpp  and gcov are now generated automatically
       from  the  master  Texinfo  manual,  eliminating  the  problem  of
       manpages  being  out  of  date.  (The  generated manpages are only
       extracts  from the full manual, which is provided in Texinfo form,
       from  which  info, HTML, other formats and a printed manual can be
       generated.)
     * Generated   info  files  are  included  in  the  release  tarballs
       alongside   their  Texinfo  sources,  avoiding  problems  on  some
       platforms with building makeinfo as part of the GCC distribution.

Other significant improvements

     * Garbage collection used internally by the compiler for most memory
       allocation instead of obstacks.
     * Lengauer and Tarjan algorithm used for computing dominators in the
       CFG.  This  algorithm  can  be significantly faster and more space
       efficient than our older algorithm.
     * gccbug  script provided to assist in submitting bug reports to the
       GCC GNATS bug tracking database. (Bug reports previously submitted
       directly to the GCC mailing lists, for which no GNATS bug tracking
       number  has  been  received,  should be submitted again to the bug
       tracking  database  using  gccbug if you can reproduce the problem
       with GCC 3.0.)
     * The  internal  libgcc  library is [12]built as a shared library on
       systems that support it.
     * Extensive  testsuite  included  with  GCC, with many new tests. In
       addition  to  tests  for GCC bugs that have been fixed, many tests
       have  been  added  for  language  features,  compiler warnings and
       builtin functions.
     * Additional    language-independent   warning   options   -Wpacked,
       -Wpadded, -Wunreachable-code and -Wdisabled-optimization.
     * Target-independent  options  -falign-functions,  -falign-loops and
       -falign-jumps.

   Plus  a  great  many bugfixes and almost all the [13]features found in
   GCC 2.95.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/caveats.html

                              GCC 3.0 Caveats

     * -fstrict-aliasing  is  now  part  of  -O2  and higher optimization
       levels.  This allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing
       rules  applicable  to  the language being compiled. For C and C++,
       this  activates  optimizations  based  on the type of expressions.
       This optimization may thus break old, non-compliant code.
     * Enumerations   are  now  properly  promoted  to  int  in  function
       parameters  and  function  returns.  Normally  this  change is not
       visible, but when using -fshort-enums this is an ABI change.
     * The undocumented extension that allowed C programs to have a label
       at  the end of a compound statement has been deprecated and may be
       removed  in a future version. Programs that now generate a warning
       about  this  may  be  fixed  by  adding a null statement (a single
       semicolon) after the label.
     * The  poorly  documented extension that allowed string constants in
       C,  C++  and  Objective  C  to contain unescaped newlines has been
       deprecated  and may be removed in a future version. Programs using
       this  extension may be fixed in several ways: the bare newline may
       be replaced by \n, or preceded by \n\, or string concatenation may
       be  used with the bare newline preceded by \n" and " placed at the
       start of the next line.
     * The Chill compiler is not included in GCC 3.0, because of the lack
       of a volunteer to convert it to use garbage collection.
     * Certain  non-standard  iostream  methods  from earlier versions of
       libstdc++  are not included in libstdc++ v3, i.e. filebuf::attach,
       ostream::form,  and  istream::gets. Here are workaround hints for:
       [1]ostream::form, [2]filebuf::attach.
     * The  new  C++  ABI  is  not  yet fully supported by current (as of
       2001-07-01)  releases  and  development  versions  of  GDB, or any
       earlier  versions.  There is a problem setting breakpoints by line
       number,  and  other related issues that have been fixed in GCC 3.0
       but not yet handled in GDB:

                                  GCC 2.95

   July 31, 1999: The GNU project and the GCC/EGCS developers are pleased
   to announce the release of GCC version 2.95. This is the first release
   of GCC since the April 1999 GCC/EGCS reunification and includes nearly
   a year's worth of new development and bugfixes.

   August 19, 1999: GCC version 2.95.1 has been released.

   October 27, 1999: GCC version 2.95.2 has been released.

   March 16, 2001: GCC version 2.95.3 has been released.

   GCC  used  to  stand  for  the  GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports  several  other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   The   whole  suite  has  been  extensively  [1]regression  tested  and
   [2]package  tested.  It should be reliable and suitable for widespread
   use.

   The compiler has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
   and  other  new  features.  See  the  [3]new  features page for a more
   complete list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

   The  sources  include  installation  instructions  in  both  HTML  and
   plaintext forms in the install directory in the distribution. However,
   the  most  up  to  date [4]installation instructions and [5]build/test
   status  are  on  the  web  pages.  We  will  update those pages as new
   information becomes available.

   The  GCC  developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed  new  features,  test  results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This
   [6]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   And  finally,  we  can't  in  good  conscience  fail  to  mention some
   [7]caveats to using GCC 2.95.

            will result in a warning from the compiler.
          + Several bugs relating to templates and namespaces were fixed.
          + A bug that caused crashes when combining templates with -g on
            DWARF1 platforms was fixed.

            to 1 digit
          + Fix missing std:: in the libstdc++ library.
          + Fix stream locking problems in libio.
          + Fix problem in java compiler driver.

Additional Changes in GCC 2.95.2

   The  -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2. While
   the  optimizations  performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according
   to  the  C  and  C++  standards,  the  optimization  have  caused some
   problems, particularly with old non-conforming code.

   The  GCC  developers  are  experimenting with ways to warn users about
   code  which  violates  the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not
   ready  for  widespread  use  at  this time. Rather than wait for those
   warnings  the  GCC developers have chosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing
   by default for the GCC 2.95.2 release.

   We  strongly  encourage developers to find and fix code which violates
   the  C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in
   future  releases.  Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these
   optimizations.
     * Generic bugfixes and improvements
          + Fix  incorrectly  optimized memory reference in global common
            subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass.
          + Fix  code  generation  bug  in  regmove.c  in  which it could
            incorrectly change a "const" value.
          + Fix  bug  in  optimization of conditionals involving volatile
            memory references.
          + Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures.
          + Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization
            of  an  obscure  series  of  bit  manipulations,  shifts  and
            arithmetic.
          + Fixed  register  allocator  bug  which  caused  teTeX  to  be
            mis-compiled on Sparc targets.
          + Avoid  incorrect  optimization  of degenerate case statements
            for certain targets such as the ARM.
          + Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer.
          + Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header.
          + Fix  test for GCC specific features so that it is possible to
            bootstrap with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC.
          + Fix  typo  in  scheduler which could potentially cause out of
            range memory accesses.
          + Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for
            certain loops on PowerPC targets.
          + Avoid  incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain
            targets (for example the ARM).
     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
          + Work  around bug in Sun V5.0 compilers which caused bootstrap
            comparison failures on Sparc targets.
          + Fix Sparc backend bug which caused aborts in final.c.
          + Fix sparc-hal-solaris2* configuration fragments.
          + Fix bug in sparc block profiling.
          + Fix obscure code generation bug for the PARISC targets.
          + Define __STDC_EXT__ for HPUX configurations.
          + Various POWERPC64 code generation bugfixes.
          + Fix abort for PPC targets using ELF (ex GNU/Linux).
          + Fix collect2 problems for AIX targets.
          + Correct handling of .file directive for PPC targets.
          + Fix bug in fix_trunc x86 patterns.
          + Fix x86 port to correctly pop the FP stack for functions that
            return structures in memory.
          + Fix minor bug in strlen x86 pattern.
          + Use   stabs  debugging  instead  of  dwarf1  for  x86-solaris
            targets.
          + Fix  template repository code to handle leading underscore in
            mangled names.

          + GNU/Linux for the ARM has C++ compatible include files.
     * Language & Runtime specific fixes.
          + Fix  handling  of  constructor  attribute  in the C front-end
            which  caused  problems building the Chill runtime library on
            some targets.
          + Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end.
          + Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++).
          + Fix    incorrect    "non-constant   initializer   bug"   when
            -traditional or -fwritable-strings is enabled.
          + Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS.
          + Do  not  complain  about  duplicate instantiations when using
            -frepo (C++).
          + Fix  array  bounds  handling  in  C++  front-end which caused
            problems   with   dwarf   debugging   information   in   some
            circumstances.
          + Fix minor namespace problem.
          + Fix problem linking java programs.

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/caveats.html

                              GCC 2.95 Caveats

     * GCC  2.95  will issue an error for invalid asm statements that had
       been  silently  accepted by earlier versions of the compiler. This
       is  particularly  noticeable  when compiling older versions of the
       Linux  kernel  (2.0.xx).  Please  refer  to  the  [1]FAQ  for more
       information on this issue.
     * GCC  2.95  implements  type  based  alias analysis to disambiguate
       memory  references.  Some  programs, particularly the Linux kernel
       violate  ANSI/ISO  aliasing  rules  and  therefore may not operate
       correctly  when compiled with GCC 2.95. Please refer to the [2]FAQ
       for more information on this issue.
     * GCC  2.95 has a known bug in its handling of complex variables for
       64bit  targets. Instead of silently generating incorrect code, GCC
       2.95  will  issue  a fatal error for situations it can not handle.
       This primarily affects the Fortran community as Fortran makes more
       use of complex variables than C or C++.
     * GCC  2.95  has  an  integrated  libstdc++,  but  does  not have an
       integrated  libg++.  Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work
       with  GCC  2.95. You can retrieve a recent copy of libg++ from the
       [3]GCC ftp server.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception   handling   may   not   work   with  shared  libraries,
       particularly  on  alphas,  hppas,  rs6000/powerpc  and  mips based
       platforms.  Exception  handling  is known to work on x86 GNU/Linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * In  general, GCC 2.95 is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++
       code or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7, G++ 2.8, EGCS 1.0,
       or  EGCS  1.1.  As  a  result  it may be necessary to fix C++ code
       before it will compile with GCC 2.95.
     * G++  is  also  converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code  which  was  previously  valid  (and  thus  accepted by other
       compilers  and  older  versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
       The  flag  -fpermissive  may  allow  some  non-conforming  code to
       compile with GCC 2.95.
     * GCC  2.95  compiled  C++  code  is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.1.x, EGCS 1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x.
     * GCC  2.95  does  not  have changes from the GCC 2.8 tree that were
       made between Sept 30, 1998 and April 30, 1999 (the official end of
       the  GCC  2.8  project).  Future GCC releases will include all the
       changes from the defunct GCC 2.8 sources.

                                  EGCS 1.1

   September 3, 1998: We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.
   December  1,  1998:  We  are  pleased  to announce the release of EGCS
   1.1.1.
   March 15, 1999: We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.2.

   EGCS  is a free software project to further the development of the GNU
   compilers using an open development environment.

   EGCS  1.1  is  a major new release of the EGCS compiler system. It has
   been  [1]extensively  tested and is believed to be stable and suitable
   for widespread use.

   EGCS  1.1  is  based  on  an  June  6,  1998  snapshot  of the GCC 2.8
   development  sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC
   2.8.1 as well as all new development from GCC up to June 6, 1998.

   EGCS 1.1 also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC
   or in older versions of EGCS:
     * Global  common  subexpression elimination and global constant/copy
       propagation (aka [2]gcse)
     * Ongoing improvements to the [3]alias analysis support to allow for
       better optimizations throughout the compiler.
     * Vastly   improved  [4]C++  compiler  and  integrated  C++  runtime
       libraries.
     * Fixes for the /tmp symlink race security problems.
     * New targets including mips16, arm-thumb and 64 bit PowerPC.
     * Improvements  to  GNU  Fortran  (g77) compiler and runtime library

            instead of being returned as 100 in the year 2000.
          + Fix  the  `Date_and_Time' intrinsic (in libg2c) to return the
            milliseconds value properly in Values(8).
          + Fix  the  `LStat'  intrinsic  (in libg2c) to return device-ID
            information properly in SArray(7).

   Each  release  includes  installation  instructions  in  both HTML and
   plaintext  forms  (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
   of  the  distribution).  However,  we  also  keep  the most up to date
   [6]installation instructions and [7]build/test status on our web page.
   We will update those pages as new information becomes available.

   The  EGCS  project  would  like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc. This [8]amazing
   group of volunteers is what makes EGCS successful.

   And  finally,  we  can't  in  good  conscience  fail  to  mention some
   [9]caveats to using EGCS 1.1.

======================================================================
http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/features.html

                           EGCS 1.1 new features

     * Integrated  GNU  Fortran  (g77)  compiler and runtime library with
       improvements, based on [1]g77 version 0.5.23.
     * Vast  improvements  in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Compiler implements [3]global common subexpression elimination and
       global copy/constant propagation.
     * More major improvements in the [4]alias analysis code.
     * More  major improvements in the exception handling code to improve
       performance,  lower static overhead and provide the infrastructure
       for future improvements.
     * The infamous /tmp symlink race security problems have been fixed.
     * The regmove optimization pass has been nearly completely rewritten
       to improve performance of generated code.
     * The  compiler  now  recomputes  register  usage information before
       local  register allocation. By providing more accurate information
       to   the   priority   based  allocator,  we  get  better  register
       allocation.
     * The  register reloading phase of the compiler optimizes spill code
       much better than in previous releases.
     * Some   bad   interactions   between  the  register  allocator  and
       instruction  scheduler  have  been fixed, resulting in much better
       code  for  certain  programs.  Additionally,  we  have  tuned  the
       scheduler in various ways to improve performance of generated code
       for some architectures.
     * The    compiler's   branch   shortening   algorithms   have   been
       significantly  improved to work better on targets which align jump
       targets.
     * The  compiler now supports -Os to prefer optimizing for code space
       over optimizing for code speed.
     * The  compiler  will  now  totally  eliminate  library  calls which
       compute  constant  values.  This  primarily  helps targets with no
       integer   div/mul  support  and  targets  without  floating  point
       support.
     * The compiler now supports an extensive "--help" option.
     * cpplib  has  been greatly improved and may be suitable for limited
       use.
     * Memory  footprint  for the compiler has been significantly reduced
       for some pathological cases.
     * The  time  to  build  EGCS  has  been improved for certain targets
       (particularly the alpha and mips platforms).
     * Many infrastructure improvements throughout the compiler, plus the
       usual mountain of bugfixes and minor improvements.
     * Target dependent improvements:
          + SPARC  port  now  includes  V8 plus and V9 support as well as
            performance  tuning  for Ultra class machines. The SPARC port
            now uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + Alpha  port  has  been tuned for the EV6 processor and has an
            optimized  expansion of memcpy/bzero. The Alpha port now uses
            the Haifa scheduler.
          + RS6000/PowerPC:  EGCS  1.1  includes  support for the Power64
            architecture  and aix4.3 support. The RS6000/PowerPC port now
            uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + x86:  Alignment  of static store data and jump targets is per
            Intel  recommendations  now.  Various improvements throughout
            the  x86  port  to improve performance on Pentium processors.
            Conditional  move support has been fixed and enabled for PPro
            processors.   The   x86   port  also  better  supports  64bit
            operations now.
          + MIPS  has  improved  multiply/multiply-add  support  and  now
            includes mips16 ISA support.
          + M68k has many micro-optimizations and Coldfire fixes.
     * Core  compiler  is  based on the GCC development tree from June 9,
       1998, so we have all of the [5]features found in GCC 2.8.

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/caveats.html

                              EGCS 1.1 Caveats

     * EGCS  has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++.  Furthermore  old libg++ releases will not work with EGCS;
       HJ  Lu has made a libg++-2.8.1.2 snapshot available which may work
       with EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception   handling   may   not   work   with  shared  libraries,
       particularly  on  alphas,  hppas,  rs6000/powerpc  and  mips based
       platforms.  Exception  handling  is  known  to  work  on x86-linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * Some  versions  of  the  Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from  being  compiled  or  from running when compiled by EGCS. See
       [1]the FAQ for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8 or EGCS 1.0. As
       a  result  it  may  be  necessary  to  fix C++ code before it will
       compile with EGCS.
     * G++  is  also  converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code  which  was  previously  valid  (and  thus  accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS  1.1  compiled  C++  code  is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x due to changes necessary to support thread safe
       exception handling.

                                 EGCS 1.0.3

   May 15, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.3.

   EGCS  is  a  collaborative  effort involving several groups of hackers
   using  an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS  1.0.3  is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0.2 compiler to fix a few
   problems reported by Red Hat for builds of Red Hat 5.1.
     * Generic bugfixes:
          + Fix  a  typo in the libio library which resulted in incorrect
            behavior of istream::get.
          + Fix the Fortran negative array index problem.
          + Fix  a  major  problem  with  the ObjC runtime thread support
            exposed by glibc2.
          + Reduce memory consumption of the Haifa scheduler.
     * Target specific bugfixes:
          + Fix  one  x86  floating  point code generation bug exposed by
            glibc2 builds.
          + Fix one x86 internal compiler error exposed by glibc2 builds.
          + Fix profiling bugs on the Alpha.
          + Fix ImageMagick & emacs 20.2 build problems on the Alpha.
          + Fix  rs6000/ppc bug when converting values from integer types
            to floating point types.

   An  important  goal  of  EGCS  is  to  allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS  has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS  1.0.3  is  based  on  an  August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development  sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   or GCC 2.8.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       GNU/Linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of SGI's
       STL release instead of a modified copy.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler.
     * New instruction scheduler.
     * New alias analysis code.

   See  the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   The EGCS 1.0.3 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and  plaintext  forms  (see  the  INSTALL  directory  in  the toplevel
   directory  of  the EGCS 1.0.3 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most  up to date [2]installation instructions and [3]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   And,  we  can't  in good conscience fail to mention some [4]caveats to
   using EGCS.

   Update:  Big  thanks  to  Stanford for providing a high speed link for
   downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!

   Download  EGCS  from  ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or go.cygnus.com
   (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).

   The EGCS 1.0.3 release is also available on many mirror sites.

   We'd  like  to  thank  the  numerous  people that have contributed new
   features,  test results, bugfixes, etc. Unfortunately, they're far too
   numerous to mention by name.

                                 EGCS 1.0.1

   January 6, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.1.

   EGCS  is  a  collaborative  effort involving several groups of hackers
   using  an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS  1.0.1  is  a  minor update to the EGCS 1.0 compiler to fix a few
   critical bugs and add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux. Changes since the
   EGCS 1.0 release:
     * Add  support  for  Red  Hat 5.0 Linux and better support for Linux
       systems using glibc2.
       Many  programs  failed  to link when compiled with EGCS 1.0 on Red
       Hat  5.0  or  on systems with newer versions of glibc2. EGCS 1.0.1
       should fix these problems.
     * Compatibility  with  both  EGCS  1.0  and GCC 2.8 libgcc exception
       handling interfaces.
       To  avoid  future  compatibility problems, we strongly urge anyone
       who  is planning on distributing shared libraries that contain C++
       code to upgrade to EGCS 1.0.1 first.
       Soon  after  EGCS  1.0  was released, the GCC developers made some
       incompatible  changes  in  libgcc's exception handling interfaces.
       These  changes  were  needed  to solve problems on some platforms.
       This  means  that GCC 2.8.0, when released, will not be seamlessly
       compatible  with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0. The reason is
       that  the libgcc.a in GCC 2.8.0 will not contain a function needed
       by the old interface.
       The  result  of  this  is that there may be compatibility problems
       with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 when used with GCC 2.8.0.
       With   EGCS  1.0.1,  generated  code  uses  the  new  (GCC  2.8.0)
       interface,  and libgcc.a has the support routines for both the old
       and  the  new  interfaces  (so EGCS 1.0.1 and EGCS 1.0 code can be
       freely  mixed,  and  EGCS  1.0.1  and GCC 2.8.0 code can be freely
       mixed).
       The maintainers of GCC 2.x have decided against including seamless
       support  for  the  old  interface  in  2.8.0,  since  it was never
       "official", so to avoid future compatibility problems we recommend
       against  distributing  any shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 that
       contain C++ code (upgrade to 1.0.1 and use that).
     * Various bugfixes in the x86, hppa, mips, and rs6000/ppc backends.
       The  x86  changes fix code generation errors exposed when building
       glibc2 and the Linux dynamic linker (ld.so).
       The  hppa  change  fixes  a compiler abort when configured for use
       with RTEMS.
       The  MIPS  changes fix problems with the definition of LONG_MAX on
       newer systems, allow for command line selection of the target ABI,
       and fix one code generation problem.
       The  rs6000/ppc change fixes some problems with passing structures
       to varargs/stdarg functions.
     * A  few machine independent bugfixes, mostly to fix code generation
       errors when building Linux kernels or glibc.
     * Fix a few critical exception handling and template bugs in the C++
       compiler.
     * Fix Fortran namelist bug on alphas.
     * Fix build problems on x86-solaris systems.

   An  important  goal  of  EGCS  is  to  allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS  has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS  1.0.1  is  based  on  an  August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development  sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of SGI's
       STL release.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
     * New instruction scheduler
     * New alias analysis code

   See  the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   The EGCS 1.0.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and  plaintext  forms  (see  the  INSTALL  directory  in  the toplevel
   directory  of  the EGCS 1.0.1 distribution). However, we also keep the

   December 3, 1997

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.

   EGCS  is  a  collaborative  effort involving several groups of hackers
   using  an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   An  important  goal  of  EGCS  is  to  allow  wide  scale  testing  of

   Update:  The  T1  into  our  main  California  offices  has  been 100%
   saturated  since  shortly  after  the release. We've added an EGCS 1.0
   mirror  at  our  Massachusetts  office to help share the load. We also
   encourage  folks  to  use  the  many  mirrors available throughout the
   world.

       1997, so we have most of the [1]features found in GCC 2.8.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler based on g77-0.5.22-19970929.
     * Vast  improvements  in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * New  instruction  scheduler  from IBM Haifa which includes support

       RS6000/PowerPC variants by default.
     * -mcpu=  and  -march=  switches  for  the  x86 port to allow better
       control over how the x86 port generates code.
     * Includes  the template repository patch (aka repo patch); note the
       new template code makes repo obsolete for ELF systems using gnu-ld
       such as Linux.
     * Plus the usual assortment of bugfixes and improvements.

                              EGCS 1.0 Caveats

     * EGCS  has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with egc; HJ
       Lu has made a libg++-2.8.1.2 available which may work with EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Note  that using -pedantic or -Wreturn-type can cause an explosion
       in  the  amount of memory needed for template-heavy C++ code, such
       as   code   that   uses   STL.   Also  note  that  -Wall  includes
       -Wreturn-type,  so  if  you  use  -Wall  you  will need to specify
       -Wno-return-type to turn it off.
     * Exception   handling   may   not   work   with  shared  libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, and mips based platforms. Exception
       handling  is  known  to  work  on  x86-linux platforms with shared
       libraries.
     * Some  versions  of  the  Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from  being  compiled  or  from running when compiled by EGCS. See
       [1]the FAQ for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or  deprecated  C++ constructs than G++ 2.7. As a result it may be
       necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.
     * G++  is  also  aggressively tracking the C++ standard; as a result
       code  which  was  previously  valid  (and  thus  accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of G++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS  1.0 may not work with Red Hat Linux 5.0 on all targets. EGCS
       1.0.x and later releases should work with Red Hat Linux 5.0.
