GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:
	gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

** Please keep the entries in this file alphabetical **

What I do:
	Primarly I work on GNU software for VMS, both VAX and AXP.  I
	also work on GNU stuff for Unix on occasion.  I'm familiar with
	SunOS (version 4.x.x), BSD (version 4.2 and up),
	Ultrix (version 4.2 and up).
	I've been porting GNU Emacs to VMS since spring 1991.  This
	includes versions 18.57 to 18.59 and version 19.22.
	I maintain GNU vmslib.

Programs supported:
	GNU vmslib:	extending, installation, upgrading aid,
			simple and complex questions, you name it.
	GNU Emacs:	porting, extending, installation, upgrading aid,
			customization, simple or complex questions,
			training, you name it.
	GNU autoconf:	porting, extending, installation, upgrading aid.
	GNU zip, diffutils, m4, patch, texinfo:
			porting, installation, upgrading aid.
	GNU C/C++:	installation, upgrading aid.  I might start to
			hack at it some day.

The list of programs I currently support represents both my interests and
current priorities.  Your interest and funding can influence my priorities.

Experience:
	Fluent in C, C++, Emacs Lisp, Pascal as well as assembler
	on VAX, Motorola 680x0, Intel 8086 and 80x86.  Modified key
	elements in Emacs (e.g., memory and process management) to work
	transparently on VMS.  I have very good knowledge in the VMS
	operating system, as well as MS-DOS and IBM PC compatibles.
	I have worked for four and a half years as a VMS system manager.
	I've also provided consulting services on IBM PC compatibles,
	as well as held classes for IBM PC users.
	A reference list is available on request.

Your Rate:
	$50-$80/hour (400-700 SEK in sweden), plus expenses.  My rates

Work Telephone: (617) 353-3381 (sorry, but no answering machine or voice mail)
Home Telephone: (617) 739-7456 (until August 1995)
Finger "jbw@cs.bu.edu" for up-to-date contact information.

Experience:
    I have B.A. and M.A. degrees in Computer Science and have completed
    all but the dissertation for a Ph.D. in C.S.  My research for my
    Ph.D.  is in the areas of logic, type systems, and programming
    language theory.  My primary programming languages are Emacs Lisp,
    Perl, and Bourne shell, but of course I can program in any language.
    I have written numerous Emacs Lisp packages.  I started the USENET
    "List of Frequently Asked Questions about GNU Emacs with Answers" and
    maintained it for more than two years.  Most of my work has been
    related to the telephone system (modems, voice mail, etc.), but I am
    not limited to that.  Send e-mail for my complete resume or curriculum
    vita.

Programs supported:
    GNU Emacs and Taylor UUCP:
      Installation, training, customization, bug fixing, troubleshooting,
      extension, development, porting, or answering any kind of question.
    Any other GNU program:
      The same things, but I don't necessarily have huge amounts of
      experience with the particular program.

Working conditions:
    I am usually available for part-time work (less than 20 hours per week
    including any travel time).  I can sometimes make time for full-time
    work for a month or two; please inquire.  I can either work in or near
    Boston or via the Internet or via telephone; travel outside the Boston
    metropolitan area can be negotiated.  My schedule is very flexible.
    Any programs I write will normally have the copying conditions of the
    GNU General Public License; this is negotiable.

Rates: $65/hour as an independent contractor.
       travel and telephone expenses.
       higher rates if extensive travel is required.

I'm a better "planner" than I am a hacker.  A really good hacker will be able
to keep many pieces of information in their short-term memory and to memorize
new pieces of information at a fast rate.  This is not my strong point.
Rather, I excel in domains that require knowledge of the slightly more
theoretical parts of computer science --for example, logic, formal methods of
program development, and functional programming.  I can write, and I have
"tutoring" (teaching one-on-one) experience, an, unlike some programmers,
I enjoy doing these things.

I have spend a lot of time looking at the Emacs Lisp sources and customizing
Emacs and VM.  I think I can customize Emacs and its packages quickly and
effectively.
