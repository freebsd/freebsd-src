%%%                        covering 1958--1996 became too large (about
%%%                        4000 entries) for BibTeX and TeX to handle,
%%%                        so at version 1.44, it was split into
%%%                        cacm1950.bib, cacm1960.bib, cacm1970.bib,
%%%                        cacm1980.bib, and cacm1990.bib, each covering

%%%                        the filename.  Version numbers for these
%%%                        files begin at 2.00.
%%%
%%%                        Volumes from the 1990s average more than 200
%%%                        articles yearly, so a complete bibliography
%%%                        for this journal could contain more than 6000
%%%                        entries from 1958 to 2000.
%%%
%%%                        These bibliographies also include ACM
%%%                        Algorithms 1--492.  For Algorithms 493--686,

%%%                        that citing a paper will automatically
%%%                        generate citations for those Remarks and

%%%                        duplicated in cacm19*.bib and toms.bib, so
%%%                        that each is completely self-contained.

The M \& N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors. An M \& N procedure was written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the M \& Nprocedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure. The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.",

The definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a bounded-context parser are recalled. The notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated. Next, pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are defined. Finally, the algorithm is described; it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes. The utility of the algorithm is discussed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.",

In particular, functions and labels are permissible results of functions and values of variables.

The assignment operation always affects the relation between some reference and its values. All composed data structures are treated as functions. Type declarations are not permitted. Any data structure may be implicit; i.e., it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components. The existence of label variables permits the construction of coroutines, quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms. A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language. Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.",

Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding of the information in the decision table. The second algorithm programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby resulting in storage economy. A comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made. Some features of a decision table to FORTRAN IV translator developed for the IBM 7044 are given.",

Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on $n$-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.

Other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can be augmented by the user. The machine, although small, aids program design by providing display scope and premarked randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment similar to that of a sophisticated terminal. The tapes are logically similar to a disk. Priority was given to the design of efficient tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.

The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new method.",

The algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive grammars and general rewriting systems, and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed.

A number of options are available to give the user full control over the output format and to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early stages of development of a PL/I source deck. One option, USAGE, causes NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded during execution.

A rigorous proof of the algorithm is given as well as an example of its application.

Generations of cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. \par The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has been alleged that the ``known solution'' to Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49, \ldots{} (``I have deposited in the County of Bedford about four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault \ldots{}'') with the aid of an unsanitized version of the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons. Modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction. For the benefit of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message. \par The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code. While primitive, the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders. The work now completed with the help of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. \par For example, we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures. These simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.",

MULTIPLE's proving program (PP) uses two evaluation functions to guide its search for a proof of whether or not a particular goal is achievable. Thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were created for use in the automatic learning of better evaluation functions for PP. A multiple regression program was used to produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.\par Also, automatic data-handling routines were written for passing data between the learning program and the proving program, and for analyzing and summarizing results. Data was generally collected for learning (regression analysis) from the experience of PP. A number of experiments were performed to test the effectiveness and generality of the learning program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic improvements in the solutions to problems which were in the same domain as those used for collection learning data. Learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains other than those used for data collection. Another experiment demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously improve performance on problems in a specific domain and on problems in a variety of domains. Some variations of the learning program were also tested.",

In a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices, Hamiltonian circuits equivalent to $.5(n - 1)!$ specific permutations of $n$ elements, termed rosary permutations, can be defined. Each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by a number system covering $3*4*\ldots*(n-1)$ sets of edges. Every set of edges $\{E[k]\}, 1 <= E[k] <= k, 3 <= k <= (n-1)$ is determined recursively by constructing a Hamiltonian circuit with $k$ vertices from a Hamiltonian circuit with $k-1$ vertices, starting with the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices. The basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by $\{E[k]\}$. Two algorithms treating the same example for five vertices are presented. It is very easy to derive all possible n! permutations from the $.5(n - 1 )!$ rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer.",

A spanning tree with labeled edges is grown, two edges finally bearing different labels if and only if they belong to different blocks. For both representations the time required to analyze a graph on $n$ nodes increases as $n^G$ where $G$ depends on the type of graph, $1 <= G <= 2$, and both bounds are attained. \par Values of G are derived for each of several suitable families of test graphs, generated by an extension of the web grammar approach.

First some standard terminology is introduced. Then the input buffer allocation method is described, followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected over more conventional allocation. This analysis makes use of a particular distribution function. An analysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results. This suggests that the results do not depend on a particular distribution function. An optimum output buffer size is also determined. It is concluded that this buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the input data are not random, and that this output buffer allocation should be used whether the data is random or not.",

This paper shows that expression execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given to the ordering of the subexpressions. In particular, subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory and processor time requirements. This observation is valid for configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to multiprocessor with a ``cache'' buffer memory. If the number of subexpressions which can be executed in parallel exceeds the number of available processors, then execution of some of these subexpressions must be postponed. A procedure is given which combines this requirement with the earlier ordering considerations to provide an optimal execution sequence.",

The logic of this algorithm is rather complicated; hence, several other new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward logic are presented. Of the simple dispersion algorithms discussed, the Horizontal is best. It does approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent less reading and writing than most algorithms in use today. An additional two and one-fourth to three percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing the Modified Optimum Algorithm. This algorithm is relatively straightforward, but it requires a fairly close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins.",

This procedure may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large scale integrated technology is envisioned. The principal features of this method are the very small window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking any pattern, regardless of the complexity of its configuration. Problems regarding merging and disconnection of patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of steps necessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern, are reviewed and discussed. An analogy with a neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts ``neurons'' is presented.",

An efficient algorithm for estimating these quantities is given. The relation to LRU (least recently used) paging is characterized. The independent-reference model, in which page references are statistically independent, is used to assess the effects to interpage dependencies on working-set size observations. Under general assumptions, working-set size is shown to be normally distributed.",

This paper is in two parts; a companion paper, ``II Computing the Cosine Transformation,'' shows that this objection can be overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast Fourier transform algorithm. \par This first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates, and summarizes experience with a particular implementation of the scheme.",

The high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. \par Two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some. First, the conventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral. Second, in case the automatic scheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed. This second part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation can be computed by a modification of the fast Fourier transform and all three problems overcome. The modification is also applicable in other circumstances requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial interpolation through the Chebyshev points.",

For explicit control of the scheduling of resources, an event queue is associated with a shared variable, and two procedures await (event) (leave a critical region associated with the shared variable and join the event queue) and cause (event) (enable all processes in the event queue to reenter their critical regions) are provided, which can control process scheduling to any degree desired.",

A number of university projects,though not directly comparable to those of the manufacturers, have contributed greatly to a better understanding of operating system principles. Important trends include the increased interest in the development of system measurement and evaluation techniques,and increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions.",

A program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset of the lambda-calculus, which characterizes the type relations within the program and eliminates all other information. The determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding lambda-calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant ``correct'' for a type-wise correct program or the constant ``error.'' An application to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type checking are discussed.",

The algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band matrix C whose bandwidth is the same as A and B. The algorithm is similar to those of Rutishauser and Schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices to band form. The calculation of C requires order N**2m operation. The round-off error in the calculation of C is of the same order as the sum of the errors at each of the n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter errors being largely determined by the condition of B with respect to inversion.",

The algorithm then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable generalization of the examples submitted by the designer. \par The implementation is presently restricted to a subclass of operator precedence grammars, but a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a larger class of context-free grammars.",

This freedom simplified both incremental compilation and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the communication mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical subsystems. It also suggested an important new concept for operating systems: separation of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource allocation. This separation enables incorporation of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without endangering the system integration (correctly performing the scheduling decisions).",

For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compilers. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance --- it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration. PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with the IBM compiler, PL/C permits ``pseudo comments'' --- constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source text or comment. In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor. It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.",

In particular, it is shown that it may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation. \par In the past, backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric with respect to their read and write times. This situation may not continue, as several devices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio.

Because dominoes is a game of incomplete information, the program uses somewhat different principles of artificial intelligence from those used in programs for games of complete information, such as checkers, chess, and go. The program was constructed to use a ``strategy signature table'' which classifies board situations through the interactions of game parameters. Each entry in the table contains adaptively determined weights indicating the advisability of various strategies. Once chosen, a strategy then employs probability analysis and linear polynomial evaluation to choose a move. Our program wins approximately two-thirds of its games in tournament situations, and has defeated championship players.",

It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types.

The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system. The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y. The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon.

  abstract =     "Using ideas from information theory, this paper develops a heuristic algorithm that converts a limited entry decision table to a tree structured computer program with near minimum average processing time. The method is applicable to any limited entry decision table and does not require that actions have single rules or that the cost of testing conditions be equal. It is thus more general than the previously published heuristic algorithms. Compared to the optimal algorithm of Reinwald and Soland, this algorithm is easy to code and takes a much smaller translation time; it is thus felt that it is more useful in practice. The algorithm is well suited for manual conversion of decision tables to flowcharts.",

The problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques.

As a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit-vector tree.

A satisfactory method of data allocation is then presented. Language structures to utilize this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.",

The technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault. Furthermore, multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other.

In the input translation grammar, each BNF syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly empty) ``code generator'' realizable as an assembly language, FORTRAN or Algol, subroutine that is called whenever that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program. Typical one-pass compilers constructed by the PGS translate source programs at speeds approaching 14,000 cards per minute. For an XPL compiler, the parser program and its tables currently occupy 288 words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code generators.",

It is proved that the diagonals of the LU decomposition converges when floating-point precision. It is also proved that the computed LU decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the LU diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic. This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from $8n-7$ to $5n+2k-3$, where $k$ is much less than $n$, the order of the matrix. If the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1, then only $4n+2k-3$ operations are needed. The entire LU decomposition takes $k$ words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved. Upper and lower bounds on $k$ are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the floating-point number system. Various generalizations of these results are discussed.",

Consider the class of sparse matrices which can be tridiagonalized using only row and corresponding column permutations. The advantages of using such a transformation include the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time when compared with standard transformations. \par A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary $n \times n$ matrix and determines whether or not it can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given. The algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number of increments are linear in $n$. This compares very favorably with standard transformation methods. \par If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.

This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user. The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output.

Fundamental to the method is a set of productions together with sets of applicability rules and weight rules which operate on the productions deciding when and to what extent they are available for use. Several rounds generated by the computer implementation of the method are presented. Generally, the resultant music sounds mediocre to the professional although usually pleasing to the layman. It appears that full-blown music theory is not needed for rounds --- all the hardware required for structural levels is not necessary for these pieces. The author has tried to address both musicians and computer scientists.",

There is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters. A common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by the use of the so-called probability switch method. Another procedure, which is exact, is due to Joehnk. This paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when alpha is greater than 1. The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of M. D. Joehnk's method. The paper concludes that when alpha is non-integral, the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when alpha is less than 1, use Joehnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than alpha and alpha is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when alpha is greater than 5, use the probability switch method.",

Most of these formulations can be presented in the terminology of classical Network Theory. \par One such formulation is: Given a nondirected network, partition its nodes into a minimal number of subsets such that no two members of the same subset are connected by an arc. An obvious lower limit to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected subgraph. Kirchgassner proved that an upper limit is this size plus one. One logical extension of the previous work is the introduction of variable length examinations where $W(I)$ is the number of periods for exam $I$. The object of this paper is to generalize the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph to include the weighting of nodes, to present an approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the application of this algorithm to the solution of school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.",

They are implemented in a model fact retrieval system which uses a formal query language and a property-list data structure. A program of experiments is described wherein the procedures are used with test data bases which are altered by deleting part of the data and by purposely introducing false data. It is found that the system can infer the correct response under a variety of conditions involving incomplete and inconsistent data.",

Experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules and fewer exceptions. For typical expressions, the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and the like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically. For example, the input {\tt sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i=pi over 2} produces $\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i = \pi/2$. The syntax of the language is specified by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this language into typesetting commands. Output maybe produced on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply. This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described.",

For exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit. It is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other end. Sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests. Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of requests that are large compared to the average request. when the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit.",

The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test. In the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an O(n**k** plus **2) algorithm for testing the LR(k) property, where n is the size of the grammar in question. On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k. More specifically, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time. These results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars, such as the LL(k), strong LL(k), SLR(k), and strong LC(k) grammars.",

The relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach are discussed, showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computing time. Moreover, if heuristic search methods are used, the computing time will depend on the amount of noise in the picture. Some experimental results are given; these show how various information about the shape of the contour of an object can be embedded in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction of contours from noisy pictures and the separation of touching objects.",

An induction principle is presented which treats the control and data state sets on the same ground. Through the use of ``place variables'', it is observed that certain correctness conditions can be expressed without enumeration of the set of all possible control states. Examples are presented in which the induction principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion. Also discussed is an extension of the program model which allows each process to have its own local variables and permits shared global variables.

A real time garbage collection system avoids suspending the operations of a list processor for the long times that garbage collection normally requires by performing garbage collection on a second processor in parallel with list processing operations, or on a single processor time-shared with them. Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in this manner are presented and analyzed to determine sufficient conditions under which the list processor never need to wait on the collector. These techniques are shown to require at most twice as much processing power as regular garbage collectors, if they are used efficiently. The average behavior of the program is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also suitable for measuring the typical behavior of the algorithm.",

The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of mirror reflections.

  abstract =     "By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques of computer picture production are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, ``clipping'' becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical ``working set,'' or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.",

Each value of the parameter represents at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.

A second example then describes how using the most frequently entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.

An illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented. \par Many of the graphs involved are constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding certain costs that low-level methods incur repeatedly at compile time.",

The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the choice level). The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a tree of contexts. The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice points. According to the proposed programming style, a generative function is associated with each choice point, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage of this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice point was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives. Examples are given in term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines.",

During the search operation, the characters of pat are matched starting with the last character of pat. The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched. Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat. For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i plus patlen machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i plus patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.",

A new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently. On the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process. Additional simulations support this hypothesis. Systematic placement, which refers to the natural convention of always allocating storage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to order blocks within contiguous groups, according to their allocation time. The degree of anomalous behavior depends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation. For non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release order varies approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution. The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases. Some practical implications are briefly discussed.",

The first method, the ``quotient reduction'' method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. The second method, the ``remainder reduction'' method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set. The two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. Some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented. A rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used conveniently in several practical applications.",

The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs.

This method is similar to two other methods recently given by N. D. Wallace and G. S. Fishman. It is compared with Fishman's and J. H. Ahrens and U. Dieter's methods. The core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of Fishman's method. The proposed method is the same as Fishman's method for 1 less than equivalent to alpha less than 2 and is faster than Fishman's method for 3 less than equivalent to alpha less than equivalent to 19. Also, the proposed method is much simpler than Ahrens and Dieter's method and is faster for alpha less than equivalent to 8.",

For a ratio of 100:1, 10\slash 11 of a full cycle should be covered quickly and 1/11 should be covered slowly. As device manufacturers increase this ratio, the average latency for a block transfer will slowly decrease. Increasing the raw shift speed will of course directly reduce both the latency time and the block transfer time.",

It has an advantage over the more general AVL tree in that only one bit of balancing information is required (two bits are required for the AVL tree). It is shown that deletion of an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished in O(log n) operations, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order of magnitude. This result, coupled with earlier results by D. S. Hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basic problems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an AVL tree.",

Use of ``warm-start'' rather than ``cold-start'' miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed ``S-shape'' of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage.

Simulation of the system model yields the timing resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulation of a model of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360\slash 191 is described. The results of evaluating some alternative system designs are discussed. The experiments reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks in the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit. Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated pipelining and buffering techniques implemented in the architecture of the IBM 360\slash 91 are of little value when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as in the IBM 360\slash 195.",

Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means. The required alignment is achieved by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. The technique is illustrated using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models.",

A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values --- a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split value which partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and right subtrees. A median split tree (MST) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed. Unlike frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a successful search of an MST is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values. Further, an MST can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n**2 for an optimum binary search tree. A discussion of the application of MST's to dictionary lookup for English is presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques.",

Furthermore, it cannot be used to produce good, quasioptimal solutions The branch-and-bound technique uses a good heuristic to direct the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search space, since the number of solutions increases with the number of test variables according to a double exponential. In this paper authors suggest a heuristically guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic programming, recognizes identical subproblems but which can be used to find both optimal and quasioptimal solutions. A heuristic search method is introduced that combines the positive aspects of the above two techniques. Compressed tables with a large number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.",

Direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed systems. The mechanism is defined formally, and then several examples of its uses are given. The relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular, eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters.

Since a central hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better than a noncentral hyperplane.

Algorithms for the organization and retrieval of information are described. This method is particularly suitable for queries requesting a group of information items, all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly some other attributes as well). Several examples are given; the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other common approaches. Algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system are described. For a certain class of information systems, the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems. Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted file technique.",

In order to develop such systems, we need to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of algorithms, towards the description of the properties of the packages and objects with which we build.

This also makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data. The reorganization\slash block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is not.

Two parameterized algorithms which partition the main memory between two classes of jobs are considered. Initially, a closed system consisting of a processor and paging and file devices, with fixed number of jobs, is studied to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion of processor time devoted to each class. Applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server, the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied. The object is to investigate the effect of the memory allocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms. Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained.

  abstract =     "An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced (OSHB) binary search tree is presented. The algorithm operates in time $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree. This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time $O(\log 2n)$. Moreover, the $O(\log n)$ complexity is optimal. Earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in $O(\log n)$ time. Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion. Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor. However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees.",

For a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a worst-case time bound of 0(e log e) function operations. It is also shown that in programming terms, the number of operations is proportional to e plus the number of exits from program loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures guarantees linearity. The algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.",

Several algorithms for determining the number of components in the graph associated with a particular set of elements are constructed and compared. When the classification process operates on independently-drawn samples of $n$ distinct elements from a population, the expected number of components is shown to be obtainable recursively for a class of problems called separable; in all cases, estimates are available to reach any desired level of accuracy. Clustering models in Euclidean space are analyzed in detail and asymptotic formulas obtained to complement experiments. Conjectures concerning the general behavior of the expected number of components are presented also. Finally, several computational tools of general interest are improved significantly.",
