	Restore the ability to compile with g++. Thanks to
	Arnold Robbins.

Dec 24, 2023:
	Matchop dereference after free problem fix when the first
	argument is a function call. Thanks to Oguz Ismail Uysal.
	Fix inconsistent handling of --csv and FS set in the
	command line. Thanks to Wilbert van der Poel.
	Casting changes to int for is* functions. 

Nov 27, 2023:
	Fix exit status of system on MacOS. Update to REGRESS.
	Thanks to Arnold Robbins.

Nov 24, 2023:
        Fix issue #199: gototab improvements to dynamically resize the
        table, qsort and bsearch to improve the lookup speed as the
        table gets larger for multibyte input. Thanks to Arnold Robbins.

Nov 23, 2023:
	Fix Issue #169, related to escape sequences in strings.
	Thanks to Github user rajeevvp.
	Fix Issue #147, reported by Github user drawkula, and fixed
	by Miguel Pineiro Jr.

Nov 20, 2023:
	Rewrite of fnematch to fix a number of issues, including
	extraneous output, out-of-bounds access, number of bytes
	to push back after a failed match etc.
	Thanks to Miguel Pineiro Jr.

Nov 15, 2023:
	Man page edit, regression test fixes. Thanks to Arnold Robbins
	Consolidation of sub and gsub into dosub, removing duplicate
	code. Thanks to Miguel Pineiro Jr.
	gcc replaced with cc everywhere.

Oct 30, 2023:
	Multiple fixes and a minor code cleanup.
	Disabled utf-8 for non-multibyte locales, such as C or POSIX.
	Fixed a bad char * cast that causes incorrect results on big-endian
	systems. Also fixed an out-of-bounds read for empty CCL.
	Fixed a buffer overflow in substr with utf-8 strings.
	Many thanks to Todd C Miller.

Sep 24, 2023:
	fnematch and getrune have been overhauled to solve issues around
	unicode FS and RS. Also fixed gsub null match issue with unicode.
	Big thanks to Arnold Robbins.

Sep 12, 2023:
	Fixed a length error in u8_byte2char that set RSTART to
	incorrect (cannot happen) value for EOL match(str, /$/).


-----------------------------------------------------------------

[This entry is a summary, not a precise list of changes.]

	Added --csv option to enable processing of comma-separated
	values inputs.  When --csv is enabled, fields are separated
	by commas, fields may be quoted with " double quotes, fields
	may contain embedded newlines.

	If no explicit separator argument is provided, split() uses
	the setting of --csv to determine how fields are split.

	Strings may now contain UTF-8 code points (not necessarily
	characters).  Functions that operate on characters, like
	length, substr, index, match, etc., use UTF-8, so the length
	of a string of 3 emojis is 3, not 12 as it would be if bytes
	were counted.

	Regular expressions are processed as UTF-8.

	Unicode literals can be written as \u followed by one
	to eight hexadecimal digits.  These may appear in strings and
	regular expressions.
