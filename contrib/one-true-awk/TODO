============================

Here are some things that it'd be nice to have volunteer
help on.

1. Rework the test suite so that it's easier to maintain
and see exactly which tests fail:
	A. Extract beebe.tar into separate file and update scripts
	B. Split apart multiple tests into separate tests with input
	   and "ok" files for comparisons.

2. Pull in more of the tests from gawk that only test standard features.
   The beebe.tar file appears to be from sometime in the 1990s.

3. Make the One True Awk valgrind clean. In particular add a
   test suite target that runs valgrind on all the tests and
   reports if there are any definite losses or any invalid reads
   or writes (similar to gawk's test of this nature).
