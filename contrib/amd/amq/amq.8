.Sh NAME
.Nm amq
.Nd automounter query tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm amq
.Op Fl fmpsuvTU
.Op Fl h Ar hostname
.Op Fl l Ar log_file
.Op Fl x Ar log_options
.Op Fl D Ar debug_options
.Op Fl M Ar mountmap_entry
.Op Fl P Ar program_number
.Op Ar directory
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Amq
provides a simple way of determining the current state of the
.Xr amd 8
program.
Communication is by
.Tn RPC .
Three modes of operation are supported by the current protocol.
By default a list of mount points and auto-mounted file systems
is output.
An alternative host can be specified using the
.Fl h
option.
.Pp
If directory names are given, as output by default,
then per file system information is displayed.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Request automounter to flush the internal caches.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Query alternate host
.Ar hostname .
By default the local host is used.  In an
.Tn HP-UX
cluster, the root server is queried by default, since
that is the system on which the automounter is normally run.
.It Fl l Ar log_file
Tell amd to use
.Ar log_file
as the log file name. 
For security reasons, this must be the same log file which
.Nm amd
used when started.  This option is therefore only useful to 
refresh
.Nm amd Ns \'s
open file handle on the log file, so that it can be rotated and compressed via
daily cron jobs.
.It Fl m
Request the automounter to provide a list of mounted file systems,
including the number of references to each file system and any error
which occurred while mounting.
.It Fl p
Return the process ID of the remote or locally running
.Nm amd .  
Useful when you need to send a signal to the local
.Nm amd
process, and would rather not have to search through the process table.  This
option is used in the
.Pa ctl-amd
script.
.It Fl s
Request the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.
.It Fl u
Request the automounter to unmount the named file systems
instead of providing information about them.  Unmounts are requested,
not forced.  They merely cause the mounted file system to timeout,
which will be picked up by
.Nm amd Ns \'s
main scheduler thus causing the normal timeout action to be taken.
.It Fl v
Request the automounter to provide version information.  This is a subset
of the information provided by
.Nm amd Ns \'s Fl v
option.
.It Fl x Ar log_options
Ask the automounter to use the logging options specified in 
.Ar log_options
from now on.
.It Fl D Ar log_options
Ask the automounter to use the debugging options specified in 
.Ar debug_options
from now on.
.It Fl M
Pass a mount map entry to 
.Nm amd
and wait for it to be evaluated, possibly causing a mount.
This option is highly insecure.  
By default,
.Nm amd
and 
.Nm amq
do not support it.
It is necessary to configure
.Nm am-utils
with 
.Ar --enable-amq-mount
to enable this option.
.It Fl P Ar program_number
Contact an alternate running 
.Nm amd 
that had registered itself on a different RPC
.Ar program_number 
and apply all other operations to that instance of the automounter.  
This is useful when running multiple copies of 
.Nm amd , 
and need to manage each one separately.  
If not specified, 
.Nm amq
will use the default program number for 
.Nm amd ,
300019.
For security reasons, the only alternate program numbers
.Nm amd
can use range from 300019 to 300029, inclusive.
.It Fl T
Contact
.Nm amd
using the TCP transport only.  
Normally 
.Nm amq
will try TCP, and if that fails, will try UDP.
.It Fl U
Contact 
.Nm amd
using UDP (connectionless) transport only. 
Normally
.Nm amq
will try TCP, and if that fails, will try UDP.
