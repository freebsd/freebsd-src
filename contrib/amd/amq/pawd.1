.SH NAME
pawd \- print automounter working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pawd
[
.I path ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B pawd
is used to print the current working directory, adjusted to reflect proper
paths that can be reused to go through the automounter for the shortest
possible path.  In particular, the path printed back does not include any
of
.BR Amd 's
local mount points.  Using them is unsafe, because
.B Amd
may unmount managed file systems from the mount points, and thus including
them in paths may not always find the files within.
.P
Without any arguments,
.B pawd
will print the automounter adjusted current working directory.  With any
number of arguments, it will print the adjusted path of each one of the
arguments.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR amd (8),
.BR amq (8),
.BR pwd (1).
