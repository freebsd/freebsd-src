.TH AMQ.CONF 8 "7 August 1997"
.SH NAME
amd.conf \- amd configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B amd.conf
file is the configuration file for amd, as part of the am-utils suite.
.P
.B amd.conf
contains runtime configuration information for the
.B amd
automounter program.
.\" **************************************************************************
.SH FILE FORMAT
.P
The file consists of sections and parameters.  A section begins with the
name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section
begins or the end the file is reached.  Sections contain parameters of the
form 'name = value'.
.P
The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents
either a comment, a section name or a parameter.  No line-continuation
syntax is available.
.P
Section, parameter names and their values are case sensitive.
.P
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.  Whitespace before
or after the first equals sign is discarded.  Leading, trailing and
internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant.  Leading
and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded.  Internal
whitespace within a parameter value is not allowed, unless the whole
parameter value is quoted with double quotes as in 'name = "some value"'.
.P
Any line beginning with a pound sign (#) is ignored, as are lines containing
only whitespace.
.P
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string
(no quotes needed if string does not include spaces) or a boolean, which may
be given as yes/no.  Case is significant in all values.  Some items such as
cache timeouts are numeric.
.\" **************************************************************************
.SH SECTIONS
.SS The [global] section
Parameters in this section either apply to amd as a whole, or to all other
regular map sections which follow.  There should be only one global section
defined in one configuration file.
.P
It is highly recommended that this section be specified first in the
configuration file.  If it is not, then regular map sections which precede
it will not use global values defined later.

.SS Regular [/map] sections
Parameters in regular (non-global) sections apply to a single map entry.
For example, if the map section
.B [/homes]
is defined, then all parameters following it will be applied to the
.I /homes
amd-managed mount point.
.\" **************************************************************************
.SH PARAMETERS
.SS Parameters common to all sections
These parameters can be specified either in the global or a map specific
section.  Entries specified in a map-specific section override the default
value or one defined in the global section.   If such a common parameter is
specified only in the global section, it is applicable to all regular map
sections that follow.
.\" **************************************************************************
.TP
.BR browsable_dirs " (string, default=no)"
If "yes", then amd's top-level mount points will be browsable to
.BR readdir (3)
calls.  This means you could run for example
.BR ls (3)
and see what keys are available to mount in that directory.  Not all entries
are made visible to readdir(3): the "/default" entry, wildcard
entries, and those with a "/" in them are not included.  If you specify
"full" to this option, all but "/default" will be visible.
Note that if you run a command which will attempt to
.BR stat (2)
the entries, such as often done by "ls -l" or "ls -F", amd will attempt to
mount
.I every
entry in that map.  This is often called a ``mount storm''.

.TP
.BR map_options " (string, default no options)"
This option is the same as specifying map options on the command line to
amd, such as "cache:=all".

.TP
.BR map_type " (string, default search all map types)"
If specified, amd will initialize the map only for the type given.  This is
useful to avoid the default map search type used by amd which takes longer
and can have undesired side-effects such as initializing NIS even if not
used.  Possible values are

.nf
\fBfile\fR      plain files
\fBhesiod\fR    Hesiod name service from MIT
\fBldap\fR      Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
\fBndbm\fR      (New) dbm style hash files
\fBnis\fR       Network Information Services (version 2)
\fBnisplus\fR   Network Information Services Plus (version 3)
\fBpasswd\fR    local password files
\fBunion\fR     union maps
.fi

.TP
.BR mount_type " (string, default=nfs)"
All amd mount types default to NFS.  That is, amd is an NFS server on the
map mount points, for the local host it is running on.  If "autofs" is
specified, amd will be an autofs server for those mount points.

.TP
.BR search_path " (string, default no search path)"
This provides a (colon-delimited) search path for file maps.  Using a search
path, sites can allow for local map customizations and overrides, and can
distributed maps in several locations as needed.

.\" **************************************************************************
.SS Parameters applicable to the global section only

.TP
.BR arch " (string, default to compiled in value)"
Allows you to override the value of the
.I arch
amd variable.

.TP
.BR auto_dir " (string, default=/a)"
Same as the
.B \-a
option to amd.  This sets the private directory where amd will create
sub-directories for its real mount points.

.TP
.BR cache_duration " (numeric, default=300)"
Same as the
.B \-c
option to amd.  Sets the duration in seconds that looked up map entries
remain in the cache.

.TP
.BR cluster " (string, default no cluster)"
Same as the
.B \-C
option to amd.  Specifies the alternate HP-UX cluster to use.

.TP
.BR debug_options " (string, default no debug options)"
Same as the
.B \-D
option to amd.  Specify any debugging options for amd.  Works only if
am-utils was configured for debugging using the --enable-debug option.  The
"mem" option alone can be turned on via --enable-debug=mem.  Otherwise
debugging options are ignored.  Options are comma delimited, and can be
preceded by the string "no" to negate their meaning.  You can get the list
of supported debugging options by running amd \-v.  Possible values are:

.nf
\fBall\fR       all options
\fBamq\fR       register for amq
\fBdaemon\fR    enter daemon mode
\fBfork\fR      fork server
\fBfull\fR      program trace
\fBinfo\fR      info service specific debugging (hesiod, nis, etc.)
\fBmem\fR       trace memory allocations
\fBmtab\fR      use local "./mtab" file
\fBstr\fR       debug string munging
\fBtest\fR      full debug but no daemon
\fBtrace\fR     protocol trace
.fi

.TP
.BR dismount_interval " (numeric, default=120)"
Same as the
.B \-w
option to amd.  Specify in seconds, the time between attempts to dismount
file systems that have exceeded their cached times.

.TP
.BR fully_qualified_hosts " (string, default=no)"
If "yes",
.I Amd
will perform RPC authentication using fully-qualified host names.  This is
necessary for some systems, and especially when performing cross-domain
mounting.  For this function to work, the
.I Amd
variable ${hostd} is used, requiring that ${domain} not be null.

.TP
.BR hesiod_base " (string, default=automount)"
Specify the base name for hesiod maps.

.TP
.BR karch " (string, default to karch of the system)"
Same as the
.B \-k
option to amd.  Allows you to override the kernel-architecture of your
system.  Useful for example on Sun (Sparc) machines, where you can build one
amd binary, and run it on multiple machines, yet you want each one to get
the correct
.I karch
variable set (for example, sun4c, sun4m, sun4u, etc.)  Note that if not
specified, amd will use uname(2) to figure out the kernel architecture of
the machine.

.TP
.BR ldap_base " (string, default not set)"
Specify the base name for LDAP.

.TP
.BR ldap_cache_maxmem " (numeric, default=131072)"
Specify the maximum memory amd should use to cache LDAP entries.

.TP
.BR ldap_cache_seconds " (numeric, default=0)"
Specify the number of seconds to keep entries in the cache.

.TP
.BR ldap_hostports " (string, default not set)"
Specify LDAP-specific values such as country and organization.

.TP
.BR local_domain " (string, default no sub-domain)"
Same as the
.B \-d
option to amd.  Specify the local domain name.  If this option is not given
the domain name is determined from the hostname, by removing the first
component of the fully-qualified host name.

.TP
.BR log_file " (string, default=/dev/stderr)"
Same as the
.B \-l
option to amd.  Specify a file name to log amd events to.
If the string
.B /dev/stderr
is specified, amd will send its events to the standard error file descriptor.
If the string
.B syslog
is given, amd will record its events with the system logger
.BR syslogd (8).
The default syslog facility used is LOG_DAEMON.  If you
wish to change it, append its name to the log file name, delimited by a
single colon.  For example, if
.I logfile
is the string
.B syslog:local7
then amd will log messages via
.IR syslog (3)
using the LOG_LOCAL7 facility (if it exists on the system).

.TP
.BR log_options " (string, default no logging options)"
Same as the
.B \-x
option to amd.  Specify any logging options for amd.  Options are comma
delimited, and can be preceded by the string "no" to negate their meaning.
The "debug" logging option is only available if am-utils was configured with
--enable-debug.  You can get the list of supported debugging options by
running amd \-v.  Possible values are:

.nf
\fBall\fR       all messages
\fBdebug\fR     debug messages
\fBerror\fR     non-fatal system errors
\fBfatal\fR     fatal errors
\fBinfo\fR      information
\fBmap\fR       map errors
\fBstats\fR     additional statistical information
\fBuser\fR      non-fatal user errors
\fBwarn\fR      warnings
\fBwarning\fR   warnings
.fi

.TP
.BR nfs_retransmit_counter " (numeric, default=110)"
Same as the
.I counter
part of the 
.BI \-t " interval.counter"
option to amd.  Specifies the retransmit counter's value in
.I tenths
of seconds.

.TP
.BR nfs_retry_interval " (numeric, default=8)"
Same as the
.I interval
part of the 
.BI \-t " interval.counter"
option to amd.  Specifies the interval in
.I tenths
of seconds, between NFS/RPC/UDP retries.

.TP
.BR nis_domain " (string, default to local NIS domain name)"
Same as the
.B \-y
option to amd.  Specify an alternative NIS domain from which to fetch the
NIS maps.  The default is the system domain name.  This option is ignored if
NIS support is not available.

.TP
.BR normalize_hostnames " (boolean, default=no)"
Same as the
.B \-n
option to amd.  If "yes", then the name refereed to by ${rhost} is
normalized relative to the host database before being used.  The effect is
to translate aliases into ``official'' names.

.TP
.BR os " (string, default to compiled in value)"
Same as the
.B \-O
option to amd.  Allows you to override the compiled-in name of the operating
system.  Useful when the built-in name is not desired for backward
compatibility reasons.  For example, if the build in name is ``sunos5'', you
can override it to ``sos5'', and use older maps which were written with the
latter in mind.

.TP
.BR osver " (string, default to compiled in value)"
Same as the
.B \-o
option to amd.  Override the compiled-in version number of the operating
system.  Useful when the built in version is not desired for backward
compatibility reasons.  For example, if the build in version is ``2.5.1'',
you can override it to ``5.5.1'', and use older maps that were written with
the latter in mind.

.TP
.BR pid_file " (string, default=/dev/stdout)"
Specify a file to store the process ID of the running daemon into.  If not
specified, amd will print its process id onto the standard output.  Useful
for killing amd after it had run.  Note that the PID of a running amd can
also be retrieved via
.B amq
.BR \-p .
This file is used only if the print_pid option is on.

.TP
.BR plock " (boolean, default=yes)"
Same as the
.B \-S
option to amd.
If "yes", lock the running executable pages of amd into memory.  To improve
amd's performance, systems that support the
.BR plock (3)
call can lock the amd process into memory.  This way there is less chance it
the operating system will schedule, page out, and swap the amd process as
needed.  This improves amd's performance, at the cost of reserving the
memory used by the amd process (making it unavailable for other processes).

.TP
.BR portmap_program " (numeric, default=300019)"
Specify an alternate Port-mapper RPC program number, other than the official
number.  This is useful when running multiple amd processes.  For example,
you can run another amd in "test" mode, without affecting the primary amd
process in any way.  For safety reasons, the alternate program numbers that
can be specified must be in the range 300019-300029, inclusive.
.B amq
has an option
.B -P
which can be used to specify an alternate program number of an amd to
contact.  In this way, amq can fully control any number of amd processes
running on the same host.

.TP
.BR print_pid " (boolean, default=no)"
Same as the
.B \-p
option to amd.  If "yes", amd will print its process ID upon starting.

.TP
.BR print_version " (boolean, default=no)"
Same as the
.B \-v
option to amd, but the version prints and amd continues to run.  If "yes",
amd will print its version information string, which includes some
configuration and compilation values.

.TP
.BR restart_mounts " (boolean, default=no)"
Same as the
.B \-r
option to amd.  If "yes"
.B amd
will scan the mount table to determine which file systems are currently
mounted.  Whenever one of these would have been auto-mounted,
.B amd
inherits it.

.TP
.BR selectors_on_default " (boolean, default=no)"
If "yes", then the /default entry of maps will be look for and process any
selectors before setting defaults for all other keys in that map.  Useful
when you want to set different options for a complete map based on some
parameters.  For example, you may want to better the NFS performance over
slow slip-based networks as follows:

.nf
/defaults \\
    wire==slip-net;opts:=intr,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 \\
    wire!=slip-net;opts:=intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
.fi

.TP
.BR show_statfs_entries " (boolean), default=no)"
If "yes", then all maps which are browsable will also show the number of
entries (keys) they have when "df" runs. (This is accomplished by returning
non-zero values to the statfs(2) system call).

.TP
.BR unmount_on_exist " (boolean), default=no)"
If "yes", then amd will attempt to unmount all file systems which it knows
about.  Normally amd leaves all (esp. NFS) mounted file systems intact.
Note that amd does not know about file systems mounted before it starts up,
unless the restart_mounts option or
.B \-r
flag are used.

.\" **************************************************************************
.SS Parameters applicable to regular map sections

.TP
.BR map_name " (string, must be specified)"
Name of the map where the keys are located.

.TP
.BR tag " (string, default no tag)"
Each map entry in the configuration file can be tagged.  If no tag is
specified, that map section will always be processed by amd.  If it is
specified, then amd will process the map if the
.B -T
option was given to amd, and the value given to that command-line option
matches that in the map section.
