v1.3.2 Thu Sep 26 18:06:16 PDT 1996

- Rewrite source routing code to eliminate a number of problems on
  systems using raw ip options. Also pad options with a noop so gateway
  addresses are aligned.

- Don't call inet_ntoa() twice in the same printf(). Thanks to NetBSD
  via Bill Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Decode "administratively prohibited filter" icmp code and print
  numeric value for unknown codes. Thanks to Bill Fenner.

v1.3.1 Wed Sep 18 21:08:16 PDT 1996

- Some systems (e.g. AIX) need sys/select.h. Thanks to Brett Hogden
  (hogden@rge.com)

- Byte swap ip header length under Solaris. (This has no effect on the
  sparc but is required on the i386.)

- Made optional packet length control total size of packet.

v1.3 Mon Sep 16 14:55:44 PDT 1996

- Overrun buffer security fixes. Thanks to Bill Fenner
  (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Wait for response packet relative to start of probe. Thanks to Bill
  Fenner.

- Fix bug that prevented changing the packet size. Thanks to Gregory
  Decker (gdecker@nate.dcrt.nih.gov)

- Add support for RAW_OPTIONS (e.g. 4.4 BSD systems such as BSD/OS and
  FreeBSD) thanks to Jeffrey C Honig (jch@bsdi.com)

- Remove ip header byte swap fix from v1.2; most kernels swap the ip
  header length in the kernel (and it causes OSF3 to crash).

- Fix to not exit when the number of probes is set to 1 (i.e. "-q 1")

- Improve autoconf configuration.

v1.2 Tue Oct 17 23:50:05 PDT 1995

- Convert to autoconf and ansify.

- Byte swap ip header length for little endian machines. Fix thanks to
  Y Badri (yb@greybox.demon.co.uk).

v1.1 Thu Jun 15 02:32:55 PDT 1995

- Check for too many arguments.

- Recode to make timing of packet's round trip more obvious and to
  tighten up code.

- Ifdef IP_OPTIONS code.

- Display time in microseconds.

v1.0 Tue Feb 28 23:50:05 PDT 1989

- Initial public release.
