.SH NAME
dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.B options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.   When configuring
.B dhcpd(8)
or
.B dhclient(8) ,
options must often be declared.   The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
.SH REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
.PP
DHCP \fIoption\fR statements always start with the \fIoption\fR
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.   It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.PP
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.PP
The
.B ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.PP
The
.B int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The 
.B uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The 
.B int16
and
.B uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The 
.B int8
and
.B uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.PP
The
.B text
data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a root-path
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
option root-path "10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs";
.fi
.PP
The
.B domain-name
data type specifies a domain name, which must not
enclosed in double quotes.   This data type is not used for any
existing DHCP options.   The domain name is stored just as if it were
a text option.
.PP
The
.B flag
data type specifies a boolean value.   Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.   For example:
.nf
.sp 1
  option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
or
  option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.fi
.SH SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS
Sometimes it's helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option
based on some value that the client has sent.   To do this, you can
use expression evaluation.   The 
.B dhcp-eval(5)
manual page describes how to write expressions.   To assign the result
of an evaluation to an option, define the option as follows:
.nf
.sp 1
  \fBoption \fImy-option \fB= \fIexpression \fB;\fR
.fi
.PP
For example:
.nf
.sp 1
  option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, "-",
                                     substring (hardware, 1, 6));
.fi
.SH STANDARD DHCP OPTIONS
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.  Options not
listed below may not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use
such options by defining them in the configuration file.  Please see
the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this document for more
information.
.PP
Some of the options documented here are automatically generated by
the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot be configured by the user.
The value of such an option can be used in the configuration file of
the receiving DHCP protocol agent (server or client), for example in
conditional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot be
used in the configuration file of the sending agent, because the value
is determined only \fIafter\fR the configuration file has been
processed. In the following documentation, such options will be shown
as "not user configurable"
.PP
The standard options are:
.PP
.B option \fBall-subnets-local\fR \fIflag\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all
subnets of the IP network to which the client is connected use the
same MTU as the subnet of that network to which the client is
directly connected.  A value of true indicates that all subnets share
the same MTU.  A value of false means that the client should assume that
some subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBarp-cache-timeout\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbootfile-name\fR \fItext\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.  If supported by the
client, it should have the same effect as the \fBfilename\fR
declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some
DHCP clients will support it, and others actually require it.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBboot-size\fR \fIuint16\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default
boot image for the client.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBbroadcast-address\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's
subnet.  Legal values for broadcast addresses are specified in
section 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBcookie-servers\fR \fIip-address\fR [\fB,\fR \fIip-address\fR...
]\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie
servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order
of preference.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdefault-ip-ttl\fR \fIuint8;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should
use on outgoing datagrams.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdefault-tcp-ttl\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when
sending TCP segments.  The minimum value is 1.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-client-identifier\fR \fIstring\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option can be used to specify the a DHCP client identifier in a
host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the host record by matching
against the client identifier.
.PP
Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured with client
identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a zero to the ASCII
text.   So you may need to write:
.nf

	option dhcp-client-identifier "\\0foo";

rather than:

	option dhcp-client-identifier "foo";
.fi
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-lease-time\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST)
to allow the client to request a lease time for the IP address.  In a
server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify
the lease time it is willing to offer.                                    
.PP
This option is not directly user configurable in the server; refer to the
\fImax-lease-time\fR and \fidefault-lease-time\fR server options in
.B dhcpd.conf(5).
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-max-message-size\fR \fIuint16\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, when sent by the client, specifies the maximum size of
any response that the server sends to the client.   When specified on
the server, if the client did not send a dhcp-max-message-size option,
the size specified on the server is used.   This works for BOOTP as
well as DHCP responses.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-message\fR \fItext\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a
DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event of a failure. A client
may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate why the
client declined the offered parameters.
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-message-type\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, sent by both client and server, specifies the type of DHCP
message contained in the DHCP packet. Possible values (taken directly from
RFC2132) are:
.PP
.nf
             1     DHCPDISCOVER
             2     DHCPOFFER
             3     DHCPREQUEST
             4     DHCPDECLINE
             5     DHCPACK
             6     DHCPNAK
             7     DHCPRELEASE
             8     DHCPINFORM               
.fi
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.B option \fBdhcp-option-overload\fR \fIuint8\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used to indicate that the DHCP 'sname' or 'file'
fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP options. A
DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will
exceed the usual space allotted for options.
.PP
If this option is present, the client interprets the specified
additional fields after it concludes interpretation of the standard
option fields.
.PP
Legal values for this option are:
.PP
.nf
             1     the 'file' field is used to hold options
             2     the 'sname' field is used to hold options
             3     both fields are used to hold options                        
.fi
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-parameter-request-list\fR \fIuint16\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option, when sent by the client, specifies which options the
client wishes the server to return.   Normally, in the ISC DHCP
client, this is done using the \fIrequest\fR statement.   If this
option is not specified by the client, the DHCP server will normally
return every option that is valid in scope and that fits into the
reply.   When this option is specified on the server, the server
returns the specified options.   This can be used to force a client to
take options that it hasn't requested, and it can also be used to
tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients that may need a
more limited set of options than those the server would normally
return.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-rebinding-time\fR \fIuint32\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets
an address until the client transitions to the REBINDING state.
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP

This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-requested-address\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to
request that a particular IP address be assigned.                 
.PP
This option is not user configurable.
.PP
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBdhcp-server-identifier\fR \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may
optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.  DHCP
servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the
client to distinguish between lease offers.  DHCP clients use the
contents of the 'server identifier' field as the destination address
for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP clients also
indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by including
this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.
.PP
The value of this option is the IP address of the server.
.PP
This option is not directly user configurable. See the 
\fIserver-identifier\fR server option in
.B \fIdhcpd.conf(5).

This option specifies the name of the client.  The name may or may
not be qualified with the local domain name (it is preferable to use
the domain-name option to specify the domain name).  See RFC 1035 for
character set restrictions.  This option is only honored by

.SH RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION
An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series
of encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP packet
when relaying it to the DHCP server.   The server can then make
address allocation decisions (or whatever other decisions it wants)
based on these options.   The server also returns these options in any
replies it sends through the relay agent, so that the relay agent can
use the information in these options for delivery or accounting
purposes.
.PP
The current draft defines two options.   To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space name,
"agent", followed by a period, followed by the option name.   It is
not normally useful to define values for these options in the server,
although it is permissible.   These options are not supported in the

.SH DEFINING NEW OPTIONS
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client and server provide the
capability to define new options.   Each DHCP option has a name, a
code, and a structure.   The name is used by you to refer to the
option.   The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option.   The structure describes what the contents of an
option looks like.
.PP
To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not
in use for some other option - for example, you can't use "host-name"
because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is
documented earlier in this manual page.   If an option name doesn't
appear in this manual page, you can use it, but it's probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so you can be
sure that future options don't take your name.   For example, you
might define an option, "local-host-name", feeling some confidence
that no official DHCP option name will ever start with "local".
.PP
Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code.  For site-local
options, all codes between 128 and 254 are reserved for DHCP options,
so you can pick any one of these.  In practice, some vendors have
interpreted the protocol rather loosely and have used option code
values greater than 128 themselves.   There's no real way to avoid
this problem, but it's not likely to cause too much trouble in
practice.
.PP
The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option
data appears.   The ISC DHCP server currently supports a few simple
types, like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also
supports the ability to define arrays of single types or arrays of
fixed sequences of types.
.PP
New options are declared as follows:
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.I definition
.B ;
.PP
The values of
.I new-name
and
.I new-code
should be the name you have chosen for the new option and the code you
have chosen.   The
.I definition
should be the definition of the structure of the option.
.PP
The following simple option type definitions are supported:
.PP
.B BOOLEAN
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B boolean
.B ;
.PP
An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off
(or true or false).   So an example use of the boolean type would be:
.nf

option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
option use-zephyr on;

.fi
.B INTEGER
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.I sign
.B integer
.I width
.B ;
.PP
The \fIsign\fR token should either be blank, \fIunsigned\fR
or \fIsigned\fR.   The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer.   So for example, the following two
lines show a definition of the sql-connection-max option and its use:
.nf

option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
option sql-connection-max 1536;

.fi
.B IP-ADDRESS
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B ip-address
.B ;
.PP
An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as
a domain name or as a dotted quad.  So the following is an example use
of the ip-address type:
.nf

option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

.fi
.PP
.B TEXT
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B text
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.   For
example:
.nf

option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
option sql-default-connection-name "PRODZA";

.fi
.PP
.B DATA STRING
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B string
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection
of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text, like the text
type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose
values must be between 0 and FF.   For example:
.nf

option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

.fi
.PP
.B ENCAPSULATION
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B encapsulate
.I identifier
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is \fBencapsulate\fR will encapsulate the
contents of the option space specified in \fIidentifier\fR.   Examples
of encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it currently exists
include the vendor-encapsulated-options option, the netware-suboptions
option and the relay-agent-information option.
.nf

option space local;
option local.demo code 1 = text;
option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
option local.demo "demo";

.fi
.PP
.B ARRAYS
.PP
Options can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the
text and data string types, which aren't currently supported in
arrays.   An example of an array definition is as follows:
.nf

option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

.fi
.B RECORDS
.PP
Options can also contain data structures consisting of a sequence of
data types, which is sometimes called a record type.   For example:
.nf

option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
option contrived-001 on 1772 "contrivance";

.fi
It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for
example:

.SH VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
The DHCP protocol defines the \fB vendor-encapsulated-options\fR
option, which allows vendors to define their own options that will be
sent encapsulated in a standard DHCP option.   The format of the
.B vendor-encapsulated-options
option is either a series of bytes whose format is not specified, or
a sequence of options, each of which consists of a single-byte
vendor-specific option code, followed by a single-byte length,
followed by as many bytes of data as are specified in the length (the
length does not include itself or the option code).
.PP
The value of this option can be set in one of two ways.   The first
way is to simply specify the data directly, using a text string or a
colon-separated list of hexadecimal values.   For example:
.PP
.nf
option vendor-encapsulated-options
    2:4:AC:11:41:1:
    3:12:73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
    4:12:2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
.fi
.PP
The second way of setting the value of this option is to have the DHCP
server generate a vendor-specific option buffer.   To do this, you
must do four things: define an option space, define some options in
that option space, provide values for them, and specify that that 
option space should be used to generate the
.B vendor-encapsulated-options
option.
.PP
To define a new option space in which vendor options can be stored,
use the \fRoption space\fP statement:
.PP
.B option
.B space
.I name
.B ;
.PP
The name can then be used in option definitions, as described earlier in
this document.   For example:
.nf

option space SUNW;
option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address;
option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text;
option SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;

.fi
Once you have defined an option space and the format of some options,
you can set up scopes that define values for those options, and you
can say when to use them.   For example, suppose you want to handle
two different classes of clients.   Using the option space definition
shown in the previous example, you can send different option values to
different clients based on the vendor-class-identifier option that the
clients send, as follows:
.PP
.nf
class "vendor-classes" {
  match option vendor-class-identifier;
}

option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1;
option SUNW.server-name "sundhcp-server17-1";

subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.Ultra-5_10" {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/sparc";
}

subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.i86pc" {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/i86pc";
}
.fi
.PP
As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping rules apply,
so you can define values that are global in the global scope, and only
define values that are specific to a particular class in the local
scope.   The \fBvendor-option-space\fR declaration tells the DHCP
server to use options in the SUNW option space to construct the
.B vendor-encapsulated-options
option.
