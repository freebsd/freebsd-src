.SH NAME
dhclient.leases - DHCP client lease database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent
database of leases that it has acquired that are still valid.   The
database is a free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration
per lease.   If more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
the last one in the file is used.   The file is written as a log, so
this is not an unusual occurrance.
.PP
The format of the lease declarations is described in
.B dhclient.conf(5).
