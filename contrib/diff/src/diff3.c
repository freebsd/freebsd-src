/* Combine the two diffs together into one.
   Here is the algorithm:

     File2 is shared in common between the two diffs.
     Diff02 is the diff between 0 and 2.
     Diff12 is the diff between 1 and 2.

	1) Find the range for the first block in File2.
	    a) Take the lowest of the two ranges (in File2) in the two
	       current blocks (one from each diff) as being the low
	       water mark.  Assign the upper end of this block as
	       being the high water mark and move the current block up
	       one.  Mark the block just moved over as to be used.
	    b) Check the next block in the diff that the high water
	       mark is *not* from.

	       *If* the high water mark is above
	       the low end of the range in that block,

		   mark that block as to be used and move the current
		   block up.  Set the high water mark to the max of
		   the high end of this block and the current.  Repeat b.

	 2) Find the corresponding ranges in File0 (from the blocks
	    in diff02; line per line outside of diffs) and in File1.
	    Create a diff3_block, reserving space as indicated by the ranges.

	 3) Copy all of the pointers for file2 in.  At least for now,
	    do memcmp's between corresponding strings in the two diffs.

	 4) Copy all of the pointers for file0 and 1 in.  Get what is
	    needed from file2 (when there isn't a diff block, it's
	    identical to file2 within the range between diff blocks).

	 5) If the diff blocks used came from only one of the two
	    strings of diffs, then that file (i.e. the one other than
	    the common file in that diff) is the odd person out.  If
	    diff blocks are used from both sets, check to see if files
	    0 and 1 match:

		Same number of lines?  If so, do a set of memcmp's (if
	    a memcmp matches; copy the pointer over; it'll be easier
	    later during comparisons).  If they match, 0 & 1 are the
	    same.  If not, all three different.

     Then do it again, until the blocks are exhausted.  */

     way diff; if no blocks from a particular thread are to be used,
     that element of USING is 0.  LAST_USING contains the last
     elements on each of the using lists.

     HIGH_WATER_MARK is the highest line number in the common file
