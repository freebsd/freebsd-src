This document details the changes between this version, readline-2.2,
and the previous version, readline-2.1.

1.  Changes to Readline

a.  Added a missing `extern' to a declaration in readline.h that kept
    readline from compiling cleanly on some systems.

b.  The history file is now opened with mode 0600 when it is written for
    better security.

c.  Changes were made to the SIGWINCH handling code so that prompt redisplay
    is done better.

d.  ^G now interrupts incremental searches correctly.

e.  A bug that caused a core dump when the set of characters to be quoted
    when completing words was empty was fixed.

f.  Fixed a problem in the readline test program rltest.c that caused a core
    dump.

g.  The code that handles parser directives in inputrc files now displays
    more error messages.

h.  The history expansion code was fixed so that the appearance of the
    history comment character at the beginning of a word inhibits history
    expansion for that word and the rest of the input line.

i.  The code that prints completion listings now behaves better if one or
    more of the filenames contains non-printable characters.

j.  The time delay when showing matching parentheses is now 0.5 seconds.


2.  New Features in Readline

a.  There is now an option for `iterative' yank-last-arg handline, so a user
    can keep entering `M-.', yanking the last argument of successive history
    lines.

b.  New variable, `print-completions-horizontally', which causes completion
    matches to be displayed across the screen (like `ls -x') rather than up
    and down the screen (like `ls').

c.  New variable, `completion-ignore-case', which causes filename completion
    and matching to be performed case-insensitively.

d.  There is a new bindable command, `magic-space', which causes history
    expansion to be performed on the current readline buffer and a space to
    be inserted into the result.

e.  There is a new bindable command, `menu-complete', which enables tcsh-like
    menu completion (successive executions of menu-complete insert a single
    completion match, cycling through the list of possible completions).

f.  There is a new bindable command, `paste-from-clipboard', for use on Win32
    systems, to insert the text from the Win32 clipboard into the editing
    buffer.

g.  The key sequence translation code now understands printf-style backslash
    escape sequences, including \NNN octal escapes.  These escape sequences
    may be used in key sequence definitions or macro values.

h.  An `$include' inputrc file parser directive has been added.
