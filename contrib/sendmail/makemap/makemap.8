.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Makemap
creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
sendmail(8).  
It reads input from the standard input
and outputs them to the indicated
.I mapname.
.PP
Depending on how it is compiled,
.B makemap
handles up to three different database formats, 
selected using the
.I maptype
parameter.  
They may be
.TP
dbm
DBM format maps.  
This requires the 
ndbm(3) 
library.
.TP
btree
B-Tree format maps.  
This requires the new Berkeley DB 
library.
.TP
hash
Hash format maps.  
This also requires the Berkeley DB 
library.
.PP
In all cases,
.B makemap
reads lines from the standard input consisting of two 
words separated by white space.  
The first is the database key, 
the second is the value.  
The value may contain 
``%\fIn\fP'' 
strings to indicate parameter substitution.  
Literal percents should be doubled 
(``%%'').
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
If the
.I TrustedUser
option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
.B makemap
is invoked as root, the generated files will be owned by 
the specified
.IR TrustedUser.
.SS Flags
.TP  
.B \-C
Use the specified sendmail configuration file for 
looking up the TrustedUser option.
.TP 
.B \-N
Include the null byte that terminates strings 
in the map.  
This must match the \-N flag in the sendmail.cf 
``K'' line.
.TP
.B \-c
Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.
.TP
.B \-d
Allow duplicate keys in the map.  
This is only allowed on B-Tree format maps.  
If two identical keys are read, 
they will both be inserted into the map.
.TP
.B \-e
Allow empty value (right hand side).
.TP
.B \-f
Normally all upper case letters in the key 
are folded to lower case.  
This flag disables that behaviour.  
This is intended to mesh with the 
\-f flag in the 
.B K 
line in sendmail.cf.  
The value is never case folded.
.TP
.B \-l
List supported map types.
.TP
.B \-o
Append to an old file.  
This allows you to augment an existing file.
.TP
.B \-r
Allow replacement of existing keys.  
Normally
.B makemap
complains if you repeat a key, 
and does not do the insert.
.TP
.B \-s
Ignore safety checks on maps being created.  
This includes checking for hard or symbolic 
links in world writable directories.
.TP
.B \-u
dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbosely print what it is doing.
