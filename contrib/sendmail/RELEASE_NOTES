			SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES
      $Id: RELEASE_NOTES,v 8.561.2.5.2.235 2001/05/27 21:39:16 gshapiro Exp $


This listing shows the version of the sendmail binary, the version
of the sendmail configuration files, the date of release, and a
summary of the changes in that release.

8.11.4/8.11.4	2001/05/28
	Clean up signal handling routines to reduce the chances of heap
		corruption and other potential race conditions.
		Terminating and restarting the daemon may not be
		instantaneous due to this change.  Also, non-root users can
		no longer send out-of-band signals.  Problem reported by
		Michal Zalewski of BindView.
	If LogLevel is greater than 9 and SASL fails to negotiate an
		encryption layer, avoid core dump logging the encryption
		strength.  Problem noted by Miroslav Zubcic of Crol.
	If a server offers "AUTH=" and "AUTH " and the list of mechanisms is
		different in those two lines, sendmail might not have
		recognized (and used) all of the offered mechanisms.
	Fix an IP address lookup problem on Solaris 2.0 - 2.3.  Patch
		from Kenji Miyake.
	This time, really don't use the .. directory when expanding
		QueueDirectory wildcards.
	If a process is interrupted while closing a map, don't try to close
		the same map again while exiting.
	Allow local mailers (F=l) to contact remote hosts (e.g., via
		LMTP).  Problem noted by Norbert Klasen of the University
		of Tuebingen.
	If Timeout.QueueReturn was set to a value less the time it took
		to write a new queue file (e.g., 0 seconds), the bounce
		message would be lost.  Problem noted by Lorraine L Goff of
		Oklahoma State University.
	Pass map argument vector into map rewriting engine for the regex
		and prog map types.  Problem noted by Stephen Gildea of
		InTouch Systems, Inc.
	When closing an LDAP map due to a temporary error, close all of the
		other LDAP maps which share the original map's connection
		to the LDAP server.  Patch from Victor Duchovni of
		Morgan Stanley.
	To detect changes of NDBM aliases files check the timestamp of the
		.pag file instead of the .dir file.  Problem noted by Neil
		Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	Don't treat temporary hesiod lookup failures as permanent.  Patch
		from Werner Wiethege.
	If ClientPortOptions is set, make sure to create the outgoing socket
		with the family set in that option.  Patch from Sean Farley.
	Avoid a segmentation fault trying to dereference a NULL pointer
		when logging a MaxHopCount exceeded error with an empty
		recipient list.  Problem noted by Chris Adams of HiWAAY
		Internet Services.
	Fix DSN for "Too many hops" bounces.  Problem noticed by Ulrich
		Windl of the Universitaet Regensburg.
	Fix DSN for "mail loops back to me" bounces.  Problem noticed by
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Portability:
		OpenBSD has a broken setreuid() implementation.
	CONFIG: Undo change from 8.11.1: change 501 SMTP reply code back
		to 553 since it is allowed by DRUMS.
	CONFIG: Add OSTYPE(freebsd4) for FreeBSD 4.X.
	DEVTOOLS: install.sh did not properly handle paths in the source
		file name argument.  Noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	DEVTOOLS: Add FAST_PID_RECYCLE to compile time options for OpenBSD
		since it generates random process ids.
	PRALIASES: Add back adaptive algorithm to deal with different endings
		of entries in the database (with/without trailing '\0').
		Patch from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	New Files:
		cf/ostype/freebsd4.m4

8.11.3/8.11.3	2001/02/27
	Prevent a segmentation fault when a bogus value was used in the
		LDAPDefaultSpec option's -r, -s, or -M flags and if a bogus
		option was used.  Problem noted by Allan E Johannesen of
		Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	Prevent "token too long" message by shortening {currHeader} which
		could be too long if the last copied character was a quote.
		Problem detected by Jan Krueger of digitalanswers
		communications consulting gmbh.
	Additional IPv6 check for unspecified addresses.  Patch from
		Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of the KAME Project.
	Do not ignore the ClientPortOptions setting if DaemonPortOptions
		Modifier=b (bind to same interface) is set and the
		connection came in from the command line.
	Do not bind to the loopback address if DaemonPortOptions
		Modifier=b (bind to same interface) is set.  Patch from
		John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Properly deal with open failures on non-optional maps used in
		check_* rulesets by returning a temporary failure.
	Buffered file I/O files were not being properly fsync'ed to disk
		when they were committed.
	Properly encode '=' for the AUTH= parameter of the MAIL command.
		Problem noted by Hadmut Danisch.
	Under certain circumstances the macro {server_name} could be set
		to the wrong hostname (of a previous connection), which may
		cause some rulesets to return wrong results.  This would
		usually cause mail to be queued up and delivered later on.
	Ignore F=z (LMTP) mailer flag if $u is given in the mailer A=
		equate.  Problem noted by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto
		University.
	Work around broken accept() implementations which only partially
		fill in the peer address if the socket is closed before
		accept() completes.
	Return an SMTP "421" temporary failure if the data file can't be
		opened where the "354" reply would normally be given.
	Prevent a CPU loop in trying to expand a macro which doesn't exist
		in a queue run.  Problem noted by Gordon Lack of Glaxo
		Wellcome.
	If delivering via a program and that program exits with EX_TEMPFAIL,
		note that fact for the mailq display instead of just showing
		"Deferred".  Problem noted by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto
		University.
	If doing canonification via /etc/hosts, try both the fully
		qualified hostname as well as the first portion of the
		hostname.  Problem noted by David Bremner of the
		University of New Brunswick.
	Portability:
		Fix a compilation problem for mail.local and rmail if SFIO
			is in use.  Problem noted by Auteria Wally
			Winzer Jr. of Champion Nutrition.
		IPv6 changes for platforms using KAME.  Patch from
			Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of the KAME Project.
		OpenBSD 2.7 and higher has srandomdev(3).  OpenBSD 2.8 and
			higher has BSDI-style login classes.  Patch from
			Todd C.  Miller of Courtesan Consulting.
		Unixware 7.1.1 doesn't allow h_errno to be set directly if
			sendmail is being compiled with -kthread.  Problem
			noted by Orion Poplawski of CQG, Inc.
	CONTRIB: buildvirtuser: Substitute current domain for $DOMAIN and
		current left hand side for $LHS in virtuser files.
	DEVTOOLS: Do not pass make targets to recursive Build invocations.
		Problem noted by Jeff Bronson of J.D. Bronson, Inc.
	MAIL.LOCAL: In LMTP mode, do not return errors regarding problems
		storing the temporary message file until after the remote
		side has sent the final DATA termination dot.  Problem
		noted by Allan E Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic
		Institute.
	MAIL.LOCAL: If LMTP mode is set, give a temporary error if users
		are also specified on the command line.  Patch from
		Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	PRALIASES: Skip over AliasFile specifications which aren't based on
		database files (i.e., only show dbm, hash, and btree).
	Renamed Files:
		devtools/OS/OSF1.V5.0 => devtools/OS/OSF1.V5.x

8.11.2/8.11.2	2000/12/29
	Prevent a segmentation fault when trying to set a class in
		address test mode due to a negative array index.  Audit
		other array indexing.  This bug is not believed to be
		exploitable.  Noted by Michal Zalewski of the "Internet for
		Schools" project (IdS).
	Add an FFR (for future release) to drop privileges when using
		address test mode.  This will be turned on in 8.12. It can
		be enabled by compiling with:
		APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-D_FFR_TESTMODE_DROP_PRIVS')
		in your devtools/Site/site.config.m4 file.  Suggested by
		Michal Zalewski of the "Internet for Schools" project (IdS).
	Fix potential problem with Cyrus-SASL security layer which may have
		caused I/O errors, especially for mechanism DIGEST-MD5.
	When QueueSortOrder was set to host, sendmail might not read
		enough of the queue file to determine the host, making the
		sort sub-optimal.  Problem noted by Jeff Earickson of
		Colby College.
	Don't issue DSNs for addresses which use the NOTIFY parameter (per
		RFC 1891) but don't have FAILURE as value.
	Initialize Cyrus-SASL library before the SMTP daemon is started.
		This implies that every change to SASL related files requires
		a restart of the daemon, e.g., Sendmail.conf, new SASL
		mechanisms (in form of shared libraries).
	Properly set the STARTTLS related macros during a queue run for
		a cached connection.  Bug reported by Michael Kellen of
		NxNetworks, Inc.
	Log the server name in relay= for ruleset tls_server instead of the
		client name.
	Include original length of bad field/header when reporting
		MaxMimeHeaderLength problems.  Requested by Ulrich Windl of
		the Universitat Regensburg.
	Fix delivery to set-user-ID files that are expanded from aliases in
		DeliveryMode queue.  Problem noted by Ric Anderson of the
		University of Arizona.
	Fix LDAP map -m (match only) flag.  Problem noted by Jeff Giuliano
		of Collective Technologies.
	Avoid using a negative argument for sleep() calls when delaying answers
		to EXPN/VRFY commands on systems which respond very slowly.
		Problem noted by Mikolaj J. Habryn of Optus Internet
		Engineering.
	Make sure the F=u flag is set in the default prog mailer
		definition.  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	Fix IPv6 check for unspecified addresses.  Patch from
		Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of the KAME Project.
	Fix return values for IRIX nsd map.  From Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	Fix parsing of DaemonPortOptions and ClientPortOptions.  Read all
		of the parameters to find Family= setting before trying to
		interpret Addr= and Port=.  Problem noted by Valdis
		Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	When delivering to a file directly from an alias, do not call
		initgroups(); instead use the DefaultUser group information.
		Problem noted by Marc Schaefer of ALPHANET NF.
	RunAsUser now overrides the ownership of the control socket, if
		created.  Otherwise, sendmail can not remove it upon
		close.  Problem noted by Werner Wiethege.
	Fix ConnectionRateThrottle counting as the option is the number of
		overall connections, not the number of connections per
		socket.  A future version may change this to per socket
		counting.
	Portability:
		Clean up libsmdb so it functions properly on platforms
			where sizeof(u_int32_t) != sizeof(size_t).  Problem
			noted by Rein Tollevik of Basefarm AS.
		Fix man page formatting for compatibility with Solaris'
			whatis.  From Stephen Gildea of InTouch Systems, Inc.
		UnixWare 7 includes snprintf() support.  From Larry
			Rosenman.
		IPv6 changes for platforms using KAME.  Patch from
			Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of the KAME Project.
		Avoid a typedef compile conflict with Berkeley DB 3.X and
			Solaris 2.5 or earlier.  Problem noted by Bob Hughes
			of Pacific Access.
		Add preliminary support for AIX 5.  Contributed by
			Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
		Solaris 9 load average support from Andrew Tucker of Sun
			Microsystems.
	CONFIG: Reject addresses of the form a!b if FEATURE(`nouucp', `r')
		is used.  Problem noted by Phil Homewood of Asia Online,
		patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: Change the default DNS based blacklist server for
		FEATURE(`dnsbl') to blackholes.mail-abuse.org.
	CONFIG: Deal correctly with the 'C' flag in {daemon_flags}, i.e.,
		implicitly assume canonical host names.
	CONFIG: Deal with "::" in IPv6 addresses for access_db.  Based on
		patch by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	CONFIG: New OSTYPE(`aix5') contributed by Valdis Kletnieks of
		Virginia Tech.
	CONFIG: Pass the illegal header form <list:;> through untouched
		instead of making it worse.  Problem noted by Motonori
		Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	CONTRIB: Added buildvirtuser (see `perldoc contrib/buildvirtuser`).
	CONTRIB: qtool.pl: An empty queue is not an error.  Problem noted
		by Jan Krueger of digitalanswers communications consulting
		gmbh.
	CONTRIB: domainmap.m4: Handle domains with '-' in them.  From Mark
		Roth of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	DEVTOOLS: Change the internal devtools OS, REL, and ARCH m4
		variables into bldOS, bldREL, and bldARCH to prevent
		namespace collisions.  Problem noted by Motonori Nakamura
		of Kyoto University.
	RMAIL: Undo the 8.11.1 change to use -G when calling sendmail.  It
		causes some changes in behavior and may break rmail for
		installations where sendmail is actually a wrapper to
		another MTA.  The change will re-appear in a future
		version.
	SMRSH: Use the vendor supplied directory on HPUX 10.X, HPUX 11.X,
		and SunOS 5.8.  Requested by Jeff A. Earickson of Colby
		College and John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	VACATION: Fix pattern matching for addresses to ignore.
	VACATION: Don't reply to addresses of the form owner-*
		or *-owner.
	New Files:
		cf/ostype/aix5.m4
		contrib/buildvirtuser
		devtools/OS/AIX.5.0

8.11.1/8.11.1	2000/09/27
	Fix SMTP EXPN command output if the address expands to a single
		name.  Fix from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Don't try STARTTLS in the client if the PRNG has not been properly
		seeded.  This problem only occurs on systems without
		/dev/urandom.  Problem detected by Jan Krueger of
		digitalanswers communications consulting gmbh and
		Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	Don't use the . and .. directories when expanding QueueDirectory
		wildcards.
	Do not try to cache LDAP connections across processes as a parent
		process may close the connection before the child process
		has completed.  Problem noted by Lai Yiu Fai of the Hong
		Kong University of Science and Technology and Wolfgang
		Hottgenroth of UUNET.
	Use Timeout.fileopen to limit the amount of time spent trying to
		read the LDAP secret from a file.
	Prevent SIGTERM from removing a command line submitted item after
		the user submits the message and before the first delivery
		attempt completes.  Problem noted by Max France of AlphaNet.
		Fix from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	Deal correctly with MaxMessageSize restriction if message size is
		greater than 2^31.  Problem noted by Tim "Darth Dice" Bosserman
		of EarthLink.
	Turn off queue checkpointing if CheckpointInterval is set to zero.
	Treat an empty home directory (from getpw*() or $HOME) as
		non-existent instead of treating it as /.  Problem noted by
		Todd C. Miller of Courtesan Consulting.
	Don't drop duplicate headers when reading a queued item.  Problem
		noted by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Avoid bogus error text when logging the savemail panic "cannot
		save rejected email anywhere".  Problem noted by Marc G.
		Fournier of Acadia University.
	If an LDAP search fails because the LDAP server went down, close
		the map so subsequent searches reopen the map.  If there are
		multiple LDAP servers, the down server will be skipped and
		one of the others may be able to take over.
	Set the ${load_avg} macro to the current load average, not the
		previous load average query result.
	If a non-optional map used in a check_* ruleset can't be opened,
		return a temporary failure to the remote SMTP client
		instead of ignoring the map.  Problem noted by Allan E
		Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	Avoid a race condition when queuing up split envelopes by saving
		the split envelopes before the original envelope.
	Fix a bug in the PH_MAP code which caused mail to bounce instead of
		defer if the PH server could not be contacted.  From Mark
		Roth of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	Prevent QueueSortOrder=Filename from interfering with -qR, -qS, and
		ETRN.  Problem noted by Erik R. Leo of SoVerNet.
	Change error code for unrecognized parameters to the SMTP MAIL and
		RCPT commands from 501 to 555 per RFC 1869.  Problem
		reported to Postfix by Robert Norris of Monash University.
	Prevent overwriting the argument of -B on certain OS.  Problem
		noted by Matteo Gelosa of I.NET S.p.A.
	Use the proper routine for freeing memory with Netscape's LDAP
		client libraries.  Patch from Paul Hilchey of the
		University of British Columbia.
	Portability:
		Move the NETINET6 define to devtools/OS/SunOS.5.{8,9}
			instead of defining it in conf.h so users can
			override the setting.  Suggested by
			Henrik Nordstrom of Ericsson.
		On HP-UX 10.X and 11.X, use /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of
			/usr/lib/sendmail for rmail and vacation.  From
			Jeff A. Earickson of Colby College.
		On HP-UX 11.X, use /usr/sbin instead of /usr/libexec (which
			does not exist).  From Jeff A. Earickson of Colby
			College.
		Avoid using the UCB subsystem on NCR MP-RAS 3.x.  From
			Tom Moore of NCR.
		NeXT 3.X and 4.X installs man pages in /usr/man.  From
			Hisanori Gogota of NTT/InterCommunicationCenter.
		Solaris 8 and later include /var/run.  The default PID file
			location is now /var/run/sendmail.pid.  From John
			Beck of Sun Microsystems.
		SFIO includes snprintf() for those operating systems
			which do not.  From Todd C. Miller of Courtesan
			Consulting.
	CONFIG: Use the result of _CERT_REGEX_SUBJECT_ not {cert_subject}.
		Problem noted by Kaspar Brand of futureLab AG.
	CONFIG: Change 553 SMTP reply code to 501 to avoid problems with
		errors in the MAIL address.
	CONFIG: Fix FEATURE(nouucp) usage in example .mc files.  Problem
		noted by Ron Jarrell of Virginia Tech.
	CONFIG: Add support for Solaris 8 (and later) as OSTYPE(solaris8).
		Contributed by John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	CONFIG: Set confFROM_HEADER such that the mail hub can possibly add
		GECOS information for an address.  This more closely
		matches pre-8.10 nullclient behavior.  From Per Hedeland of
		Ericsson.
	CONFIG: Fix MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(): apply the flag modifications for
		SMTP to all *smtp* mailers and those for RELAY to the relay
		mailer as described in cf/README.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Open the mailbox as the recipient not root so quotas
		are obeyed.  Problem noted by Damian Kuczynski of NIK.
	MAKEMAP: Do not change a map's owner to the TrustedUser if using
		makemap to 'unmake' the map.
	RMAIL: Avoid overflowing the list of recipients being passed to
		sendmail.
	RMAIL: Invoke sendmail with '-G' to indicate this is a gateway
		submission.  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	VACATION: Read the complete message to avoid "broken pipe" signals.
	VACATION: Do not cut off vacation.msg files which have a single
		dot as the only character on the line.
	New Files:
		cf/ostype/solaris8.m4

8.11.0/8.11.0	2000/07/19
	SECURITY: If sendmail is installed as a non-root set-user-ID binary
		(not the normal case), some operating systems will still
		keep a saved-uid of the effective-uid when sendmail tries
		to drop all of its privileges.  If sendmail needs to drop
		these privileges and the operating system doesn't set the
		saved-uid as well, exit with an error.  Problem noted by
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	SECURITY: sendmail depends on snprintf() NUL terminating the string
		it populates.  It is possible that some broken
		implementations of snprintf() exist that do not do this.
		Systems in this category should compile with
		-DSNPRINTF_IS_BROKEN=1.  Use test/t_snprintf.c to test your
		system and report broken implementations to
		sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org and your OS vendor.  Problem
		noted by Slawomir Piotrowski of TELSAT GP.
	Support SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP (RFC 2487) (STARTTLS).
		Implementation influenced by the example programs of
		OpenSSL and the work of Lutz Jaenicke of TU Cottbus.
	Add new STARTTLS related options CACERTPath, CACERTFile,
		ClientCertFile, ClientKeyFile, DHParameters, RandFile,
		ServerCertFile, and ServerKeyFile.  These are documented in
		cf/README and doc/op/op.*.
	New STARTTLS related macros: ${cert_issuer}, ${cert_subject},
		${tls_version}, ${cipher}, ${cipher_bits}, ${verify},
		${server_name}, and ${server_addr}.  These are documented
		in cf/README and doc/op/op.*.
	Add support for the Entropy Gathering Daemon (EGD) for better
		random data.
	New DontBlameSendmail option InsufficientEntropy for systems which
		don't properly seed the PRNG for OpenSSL but want to
		try to use STARTTLS despite the security problems.
	Support the security layer in SMTP AUTH for mechanisms which
		support encryption.  Based on code contributed by Tim
		Martin of CMU.
	Add new macro ${auth_ssf} to reflect the SMTP AUTH security
		strength factor.
	LDAP's -1 (single match only) flag was not honored if the -z
		(delimiter) flag was not given.  Problem noted by ST Wong of
		the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Fix from Mark Adamson
		of CMU.
	Add more protection from accidentally tripping OpenLDAP 1.X's
		ld_errno == LDAP_DECODING_ERROR hack on ldap_next_attribute().
		Suggested by Kurt Zeilenga of OpenLDAP.
	Fix the default family selection for DaemonPortOptions.  As
		documented, unless a family is specified in a
		DaemonPortOptions option, "inet" is the default.  It is
		also the default if no DaemonPortOptions value is set.
		Therefore, IPv6 users should configure additional sockets
		by adding DaemonPortOptions settings with Family=inet6 if
		they wish to also listen on IPv6 interfaces.  Problem noted
		by Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of the KAME Project.
	Set ${if_family} when setting ${if_addr} and ${if_name} to reflect
		the interface information for an outgoing connection.
		Not doing so was creating a mismatch between the socket
		family and address used in subsequent connections if the
		M=b modifier was set in DaemonPortOptions.  Problem noted
		by John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	If DaemonPortOptions modifier M=b is used, determine the socket
		family based on the IP address.  ${if_family} is no longer
		persistent (i.e., saved in qf files).  Patch from John Beck
		of Sun Microsystems.
	sendmail 8.10 and 8.11 reused the ${if_addr} and ${if_family}
		macros for both the incoming interface address/family and
		the outgoing interface address/family.  In order for M=b
		modifier in DaemonPortOptions to work properly, preserve
		the incoming information in the queue file for later
		delivery attempts.
	Use SMTP error code and enhanced status code from check_relay in
		responses to commands.  Problem noted by Jeff Wasilko of
		smoe.org.
	Add more vigilance in checking for putc() errors on output streams
		to protect from a bug in Solaris 2.6's putc().  Problem
		noted by Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	The LDAP map -n option (return attribute names only) wasn't working.
		Problem noted by Ajay Matia.
	Under certain circumstances, an address could be listed as deferred
		but would be bounced back to the sender as failed to be
		delivered when it really should have been queued.  Problem
		noted by Allan E Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	Prevent a segmentation fault in a child SMTP process from getting
		the SMTP transaction out of sync.  Problem noted by Per
		Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Turn off RES_DEBUG if SFIO is defined unless SFIO_STDIO_COMPAT
		is defined to avoid a core dump due to incompatibilities
		between sfio and stdio.  Problem noted by Neil Rickert
		of Northern Illinois University.
	Don't log useless envelope ID on initial connection log.  Problem
		noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Convert the free disk space shown in a control socket status query
		to kilobyte units.
	If TryNullMXList is True and there is a temporary DNS failure
		looking up the hostname, requeue the message for a later
		attempt.  Problem noted by Ari Heikkinen of Pohjois-Savo
		Polytechnic.
	Under the proper circumstances, failed connections would be recorded
		as "Bad file number" instead of "Connection failed" in the
		queue file and persistent host status.  Problem noted by
		Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	Avoid getting into an endless loop if a non-hoststat directory exists
		within the hoststatus directory (e.g., lost+found).
		Patch from Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	Make sure Timeout.queuereturn=now returns a bounce message to the
		sender.  Problem noted by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	If a message data file can't be opened at delivery time, panic and
		abort the attempt instead of delivering a message that
		states "<<< No Message Collected >>>".
	Fixup the GID checking code from 8.10.2 as it was overly
		restrictive.  Problem noted by Mark G. Thomas of Mark
		G. Thomas Consulting.
	Preserve source port number instead of replacing it with the ident
		port number (113).
	Document the queue status characters in the mailq man page.
		Suggested by Ulrich Windl of the Universitat Regensburg.
	Process queued items in which none of the recipient addresses have
		host portions (or there are no recipients).  Problem noted
		by Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	If a cached LDAP connection is used for multiple maps, make sure
		only the first to open the connection is allowed to close
		it so a later map close doesn't break the connection for
		other maps.  Problem noted by Wolfgang Hottgenroth of UUNET.
	Netscape's LDAP libraries do not support Kerberos V4
		authentication.  Patch from Rainer Schoepf of the
		University of Mainz.
	Provide workaround for inconsistent handling of data passed
		via callbacks to Cyrus SASL prior to version 1.5.23.
	Mention ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES in the SMTP HELP helpfile.  Omission
		noted by Ulrich Windl of the Universitat Regensburg.
	Portability:
		Add the ability to read IPv6 interface addresses into class
			'w' under FreeBSD (and possibly others).  From Jun
			Kuriyama of IMG SRC, Inc. and the FreeBSD Project.
		Replace code for finding the number of CPUs on HPUX.
		NCRUNIX MP-RAS 3.02 SO_REUSEADDR socket option does not
			work properly causing problems if the accept()
			fails and the socket needs to be reopened.  Patch
			from Tom Moore of NCR.
		NetBSD uses a .0 extension of formatted man pages.  From
			Andrew Brown of Crossbar Security.
		Return to using the IPv6 AI_DEFAULT flag instead of AI_V4MAPPED
			for calls to getipnodebyname().  The Linux
			implementation is broken so AI_ADDRCONFIG is stripped
			under Linux.  From John Beck of Sun Microsystems and
			John Kennedy of Cal State University, Chico.
	CONFIG: Catch invalid addresses containing a ',' at the wrong place.
		Patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: New variables for the new sendmail options:
		confCACERT_PATH			CACERTPath
		confCACERT			CACERTFile
		confCLIENT_CERT			ClientCertFile
		confCLIENT_KEY			ClientKeyFile
		confDH_PARAMETERS		DHParameters
		confRAND_FILE			RandFile
		confSERVER_CERT			ServerCertFile
		confSERVER_KEY			ServerKeyFile
	CONFIG: Provide basic rulesets for TLS policy control and add new
		tags to the access database to support these policies.  See
		cf/README for more information.
	CONFIG: Add TLS information to the Received: header.
	CONFIG: Call tls_client ruleset from check_mail in case it wasn't
		called due to a STARTTLS command.
	CONFIG: If TLS_PERM_ERR is defined, TLS related errors are permanent
		instead of temporary.
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`relay_hosts_only') didn't work in combination with
		the access map and relaying to a domain without using a To:
		tag.  Problem noted by Mark G. Thomas of Mark G. Thomas
		Consulting.
	CONFIG: Set confEBINDIR to /usr/sbin to match the devtools entry in
		OSTYPE(`linux') and OSTYPE(`mklinux').  From Tim Pierce of
		RootsWeb.com.
	CONFIG: Make sure FEATURE(`nullclient') doesn't use aliasing and
		forwarding to make it as close to the old behavior as
		possible.  Problem noted by George W. Baltz of the
		University of Maryland.
	CONFIG: Added OSTYPE(`darwin') for Mac OS X and Darwin users.  From
		Wilfredo Sanchez of Apple Computer, Inc.
	CONFIG: Changed the map names used by FEATURE(`ldap_routing') from
		ldap_mailhost and ldap_mailroutingaddress to ldapmh and
		ldapmra as underscores in map names cause problems if
		underscore is in OperatorChars.  Problem noted by Bob Zeitz
		of the University of Alberta.
	CONFIG: Apply blacklist_recipients also to hosts in class {w}.
		Patch from Michael Tratz of Esosoft Corporation.
	CONFIG: Use A=TCP ... instead of A=IPC ... in SMTP mailers.
	CONTRIB: Add link_hash.sh to create symbolic links to the hash
		of X.509 certificates.
	CONTRIB: passwd-to-alias.pl:  More protection from special characters;
		treat special shells as root aliases; skip entries where the
		GECOS full name and username match.  From Ulrich Windl of the
		Universitat Regensburg.
	CONTRIB: qtool.pl: Add missing last_modified_time method and fix a
		typo.  Patch from Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	CONTRIB: re-mqueue.pl: Improve handling of a race between re-mqueue
		and sendmail.  Patch from Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	CONTRIB: re-mqueue.pl: Don't exit(0) at end so can be called as
		subroutine Patch from Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	CONTRIB: Add movemail.pl (move old mail messages between queues by
		calling re-mqueue.pl) and movemail.conf (configuration
		script for movemail.pl).  From Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	CONTRIB: Add cidrexpand (expands CIDR blocks as a preprocessor to
		makemap).  From Derek J. Balling of Yahoo,Inc.
	DEVTOOLS: INSTALL_RAWMAN installation option mistakenly applied any
		extension modifications (e.g., MAN8EXT) to the installation
		target.  Patch from James Ralston of Carnegie Mellon
		University.
	DEVTOOLS: Add support for SunOS 5.9.
	DEVTOOLS: New option confLN contains the command used to create
		links.
	LIBSMDB: Berkeley DB 2.X and 3.X errors might be lost and not
		reported.
	MAIL.LOCAL: DG/UX portability.  Problem noted by Tim Boyer of
		Denman Tire Corporation.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Prevent a possible DoS attack when compiled with
		-DCONTENTLENGTH.  Based on patch from 3APA3A@SECURITY.NNOV.RU.
	MAILSTATS: Fix usage statement (-p and -o are optional).
	MAKEMAP: Change man page layout as workaround for problem with nroff
		and -man on Solaris 7.  Patch from Larry Williamson.
	RMAIL: AIX 4.3 has snprintf().  Problem noted by David Hayes of
		Black Diamond Equipment, Limited.
	RMAIL: Prevent a segmentation fault if the incoming message does not
		have a From line.
	VACATION: Read all of the headers before deciding whether or not
		to respond instead of stopping after finding recipient.
	Added Files:

8.10.2/8.10.2	2000/06/07
	SECURITY: Work around broken Linux setuid() implementation.
		On Linux, a normal user process has the ability to subvert
		the setuid() call such that it is impossible for a root
		process to drop its privileges.  Problem noted by Wojciech
		Purczynski of elzabsoft.pl.
	SECURITY: Add more vigilance around set*uid(), setgid(), setgroups(),
		initgroups(), and chroot() calls.
	Added Files:
		test/t_setuid.c

8.10.1/8.10.1	2000/04/06
	SECURITY: Limit the choice of outgoing (client-side) SMTP
		Authentication mechanisms to those specified in
		AuthMechanisms to prevent information leakage.  We do not
		recommend use of PLAIN for outgoing mail as it sends the
		password in clear text to possibly untrusted servers.  See
		cf/README's DefaultAuthInfo section for additional information.
	Copy the ident argument for openlog() to avoid problems on some
		OSs.  Based on patch from Rob Bajorek from Webhelp.com.
	Avoid bogus error message when reporting an alias line as too long.
	Avoid bogus socket error message if sendmail.cf version level is
		greater than sendmail binary supported version.  Patch
		from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Prevent a malformed ruleset (missing right hand side) from causing
		a segmentation fault when using address test mode.  Based on
		patch from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Prevent memory leak from use of NIS maps and yp_match(3).  Problem
		noted by Gil Kloepfer of the University of Texas at Austin.
	Fix queue file permission checks to allow for TrustedUser ownership.
	Change logging of errors from the trust_auth ruleset to LogLevel 10
		or higher.
	Avoid simple password cracking attacks against SMTP AUTH by using
		exponential delay after too many tries within one connection.
	Encode an initial empty AUTH challenge as '=', not as empty string.
	Avoid segmentation fault on EX_SOFTWARE internal error logs.
		Problem noted by Allan E Johannesen of Worcester
		Polytechnic Institute.
	Ensure that a header check which resolves to $#discard actually
		discards the message.
	Emit missing value warnings for aliases with no right hand side
		when newaliases is run instead of only when delivery is
		attempted to the alias.
	Remove AuthOptions missing value warning for consistency with other
		flag options.
	Portability:
		SECURITY: Specify a run-time shared library search path for
			AIX 4.X instead of using the dangerous AIX 4.X
			linker semantics.  AIX 4.X users should consult
			sendmail/README for further information.  Problem
			noted by Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
		Avoid use of strerror(3) call.  Problem noted by Charles
			Levert of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.
		DGUX requires -lsocket -lnsl and has a non-standard install
			program.  From Tim Boyer of Denman Tire Corporation.
		HPUX 11.0 has a broken res_search() function.
		Updates to devtools/OS/NeXT.3.X, NeXT.4.X, and NEXTSTEP.4.X
			from J. P. McCann of E I A.
		Digital UNIX/Compaq Tru64 5.0 now includes snprintf(3).
			Problem noted by Michael Long of Info Avenue Internet
			Services, LLC.
		Modern (post-199912) OpenBSD versions include working
			strlc{at,py}(3) functions.  From Todd C. Miller of
			Courtesan Consulting.
		SINIX doesn't have random(3).  From Gerald Rinske of
			Siemens Business Services.
	CONFIG: Change error message about unresolvable sender domain to
		include the sender address.  Proposed by Wolfgang Rupprecht
		of WSRCC.
	CONFIG: Fix usenet mailer calls.
	CONFIG: If RELAY_MAILER_FLAGS is not defined, use SMTP_MAILER_FLAGS
		to be backward compatible with 8.9.
	CONFIG: Change handling of default case @domain for virtusertable
		to allow for +*@domain to deal with +detail.
	CONTRIB: Remove converting.sun.configs -- it is obsolete.
	DEVTOOLS: confUBINMODE was being ignored.  Fix from KITAZIMA, Tuneki
		of NEC.
	DEVTOOLS: Add to NCR platform list and include the architecture
		(i486).  From Tom J. Moore of NCR.
	DEVTOOLS: SECURITY: Change method of linking with sendmail utility
		libraries to work around the AIX 4.X and SunOS 4.X linker's
		overloaded -L option.  Problem noted by Valdis Kletnieks of
		Virginia Tech.
	DEVTOOLS: configure.sh was overriding the user's choice for
		confNROFF.  Problem noted by Glenn A. Malling of Syracuse
		University.
	DEVTOOLS: New variables conf_prog_LIB_POST and confBLDVARIANT added
		for other internal projects but included in the open source
		release.
	LIBSMDB: Check for ".db" instead of simply "db" at the end of the
		map name to determine whether or not to add the extension.
		This fixes makemap when building the userdb file.  Problem
		noted by Andrew J Cole of the University of Leeds.
	LIBSMDB: Allow a database to be opened for updating and created if
		it doesn't already exist.  Problem noted by Rand Wacker of
		Sendmail.
	LIBSMDB: If type is SMDB_TYPE_DEFAULT and both NEWDB and NDBM are
		available, fall back to NDBM if NEWDB open fails.  This
		fixes praliases.  Patch	from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	LIBSMUTIL: safefile()'s SFF_NOTEXCL check was being misinterpreted
		as SFF_NOWRFILES.
	OP.ME: Clarify some issues regarding mailer flags.  Suggested by
		Martin Mokrejs of The Charles University and Neil Rickert of
		Northern Illinois University.
	PRALIASES: Restore 8.9.X functionality of being able to search for
		particular keys in a database by specifying the keys on the
		command line.  Man page updated accordingly.  Patch from
		John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	VACATION: SunOS 4.X portability from Charles Levert of Ecole
		Polytechnique de Montreal.
	VACATION: Fix -t option which is ignored but available for
		compatibility with Sun's version, based on patch from
		Volker Dobler of Infratest Burke.

	    *************************************************************
	SECURITY: The safe file checks now back track through symbolic
		links to make sure the files can't be compromised due
		to poor permissions on the parent directories of the
		symbolic link target.
	SECURITY: Only root, TrustedUser, and users in class t can rebuild
		the alias map.  Problem noted by Michal Zalewski of the
		"Internet for Schools" project (IdS).
	SECURITY: There is a potential for a denial of service attack if
		the AutoRebuildAliases option is set as a user can kill the
		sendmail process while it is rebuilding the aliases file
		(leaving it in an inconsistent state).  This option and
		its use is deprecated and will be removed from a future
		version of sendmail.
	SECURITY: Make sure all file descriptors (besides stdin, stdout, and
		stderr) are closed before restarting sendmail.  Problem noted
		by Michal Zalewski of the "Internet for Schools" project
		(IdS).
	Begin using /etc/mail/ for sendmail related files.  This affects
		a large number of files.  See cf/README for more details.
	The directory structure of the distribution has changed slightly
		for easier code sharing among the programs.
	Support SMTP AUTH (see RFC 2554).  New macros for this purpose
		are ${auth_authen}, ${auth_type}, and ${auth_author}
		which hold the client's authentication credentials,
		the mechanism used for authentication, and the
		authorization identity (i.e., the AUTH= parameter if
		supplied).  Based on code contributed by Tim Martin of CMU.
	On systems which use the Torek stdio library (all of the BSD
		distributions), use memory-buffered files to reduce
		file system overhead by not creating temporary files on
		disk.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	New option DataFileBufferSize to control the maximum size of a
		memory-buffered data (df) file before a disk-based file is
		used.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	New option XscriptFileBufferSize to control the maximum size of a
		memory-buffered transcript (xf) file before a disk-based
		file is used.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	sendmail implements RFC 2476 (Message Submission), e.g., it can
		now listen on several different ports.  Use:
		O DaemonPortOptions=Name=MSA, Port=587, M=E
		to run a Message Submission Agent (MSA); this is turned
		on by default in m4-generated .cf files; it can be turned
		off with FEATURE(`no_default_msa').
	The 'XUSR' SMTP command is deprecated.  Mail user agents should
		begin using RFC 2476 Message Submission for initial user
		message submission.  XUSR may disappear from a future release.
	The new '-G' (relay (gateway) submission) command line option
		indicates that the message being submitted from the command
		line is for relaying, not initial submission.  This means
		the message will be rejected if the addresses are not fully
		qualified and no canonicalization will be done.  Future
		releases may even reject improperly formed messages.
	The '-U' (initial user submission) command line option is
		deprecated and may be removed from a future release.
		Mail user agents should begin using '-G' to indicate that
		this is a relay submission (the inverse of -U).
	The next release of sendmail will assume that any message submitted
		from the command line is an initial user submission and act
		accordingly.
	If sendmail doesn't have enough privileges to run a .forward
		program or deliver to file as the owner of that file, the
		address is marked as unsafe.  This means if RunAsUser is
		set, users won't be able to use programs or delivery to
		files in their .forward files.  Administrators can override
		this by setting the DontBlameSendmail option to the new
		setting NonRootSafeAddr.
	Allow group or world writable directories if the sticky bit is set
		on the directory and DontBlameSendmail is set to
		TrustStickyBit.  Based on patch from Chris Metcalf of
		InCert Software.
	Prevent logging of unsafe directory paths for non-existent forward
		files if the new DontWarnForwardFileInUnsafeDirPath bit is
		set in the DontBlameSendmail option.  Requested by many.
	New Timeout.control option to limit the total time spent satisfying
		a control socket request.
	New Timeout.resolver options for controlling BIND resolver
		settings:
		Timeout.resolver.retrans
			Sets the resolver's retransmission time interval (in
			seconds).  Sets both Timeout.resolver.retrans.first
			and Timeout.resolver.retrans.normal.
		Timeout.resolver.retrans.first
			Sets the resolver's retransmission time interval (in
			seconds) for the first attempt to deliver a message.
		Timeout.resolver.retrans.normal
			Sets the resolver's retransmission time interval (in
			seconds) for all resolver lookups except the first
			delivery attempt.
		Timeout.resolver.retry
			Sets the number of times to retransmit a resolver
			query.  Sets both Timeout.resolver.retry.first
			and Timeout.resolver.retry.normal.
		Timeout.resolver.retry.first
			Sets the number of times to retransmit a resolver
			query for the first attempt to deliver a message.
		Timeout.resolver.retry.normal
			Sets the number of times to retransmit a resolver
			query for all resolver lookups except the first
			delivery attempt.
		Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	Support multiple queue directories.  To use multiple queues, supply
		a QueueDirectory option value ending with an asterisk.  For
		example, /var/spool/mqueue/q* will use all of the
		directories or symbolic links to directories beginning with
		'q' in /var/spool/mqueue as queue directories.  Keep in
		mind, the queue directory structure should not be changed
		while sendmail is running.  Queue runs create a separate
		process for running each queue unless the verbose flag is
		given on a non-daemon queue run.  New items are randomly
		assigned to a queue.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	Support different directories for qf, df, and xf queue files; if
		subdirectories or symbolic links to directories of those names
		exist in the queue directories, they are used for the
		corresponding queue files.  Keep in mind, the queue
		directory structure should not be changed while sendmail is
		running.  Proposed by Mathias Koerber of Singapore
		Telecommunications Ltd.
	New queue file naming system which uses a filename guaranteed to be
		unique for 60 years.  This allows queue IDs to be assigned
		without fancy file system locking.  Queued items can be
		moved between queues easily.  Contributed by Exactis.com,
		Inc.
	Messages which are undeliverable due to temporary address failures
		(e.g., DNS failure) will now go to the FallBackMX host, if
		set.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	New command line option '-L tag' which sets the identifier used for
		syslog.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	QueueSortOrder=Filename will sort the queue by filename.  This
		avoids opening and reading each queue file when preparing
		to run the queue.  Contributed by Exactis.com, Inc.
	Shared memory counters and microtimers functionality has been
		donated by Exactis.com, Inc.
	The SCCS ID tags have been replaced with RCS ID tags.
	Allow trusted users (those on a T line or in $=t) to set the
		QueueDirectory (Q) option without an X-Authentication-Warning:
		being added.  Suggested by Michael K. Sanders.
	IPv6 support based on patches from John Kennedy of Cal State
		University, Chico, Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University,
		and John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	In low-disk space situations, where sendmail would previously refuse
		connections, still accept them, but only allow ETRN commands.
		Suggested by Mathias Koerber of Singapore Telecommunications
		Ltd.
	The [IPC] builtin mailer now allows delivery to a UNIX domain socket
		on systems which support them.  This can be used with LMTP
		local delivery agents which listen on a named socket.  An
		example mailer might be:
			Mexecmail, P=[IPC], F=lsDFMmnqSXzA5@/:|, E=\r\n,
				S=10, R=20/40, T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
				A=FILE /var/run/lmtpd
		Code contributed by Lyndon Nerenberg of Messaging Direct.
	The [TCP] builtin mailer name is now deprecated.  Use [IPC]
		instead.
	The first mailer argument in the [IPC] mailer is now checked for a
		legitimate value.  Possible values are TCP (for TCP/IP
		connections), IPC (which will be deprecated in a future
		version), and FILE (for UNIX domain socket delivery).
	PrivacyOptions=goaway no longer includes the noetrn and the noreceipts
		flags.
	PrivacyOptions=nobodyreturn instructs sendmail not to include the
		body of the original message on delivery status
		notifications.
	Don't announce DSN if PrivacyOptions=noreceipts is set.  Problem noted
		by Dan Bernstein, fix from Robert Harker of Harker Systems.
	Accept the SMTP RSET command even when rejecting commands due to TCP
		Wrappers or the check_relay ruleset.  Problem noted by
		Steve Schweinhart of America Online.
	Warn if OperatorChars is set multiple times.  OperatorChars should
		not be set after rulesets are defined.  Suggested by
		Mitchell Blank Jr of Exec-PC.
	Do not report temporary failure on delivery to files.  In
		interactive delivery mode, this would result in two SMTP
		responses after the DATA command.  Problem noted by
		Nik Conwell of Boston University.
	Check file close when mailing to files.  Problem noted by Nik
		Conwell of Boston University.
	Avoid a segmentation fault when using the LDAP map.  Patch from
		Curtis W. Hillegas of Princeton University.
	Always bind to the LDAP server regardless of whether you are using
		ldap_open() or ldap_init().  Fix from Raj Kunjithapadam of
		@Home Network.
	New ruleset trust_auth to determine whether a given AUTH=
		parameter of the MAIL command should be trusted.  See SMTP
		AUTH, cf/README, and doc/op/op.ps.
	Allow new named config file rules check_vrfy, check_expn, and
		check_etrn for VRFY, EXPN, and ETRN commands, respectively,
		similar to check_rcpt etc.
	Introduce new macros ${rcpt_mailer}, ${rcpt_host}, ${rcpt_addr},
		${mail_mailer}, ${mail_host}, ${mail_addr} that hold
		the results of parsing the RCPT and MAIL arguments, i.e.
		the resolved triplet from $#mailer $@host $:addr.
		From Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	New macro ${client_resolve} which holds the result of the resolve
		call for ${client_name}: OK, FAIL, FORGED, TEMP.  Proposed
		by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	New macros ${dsn_notify}, ${dsn_envid}, and ${dsn_ret} that hold
		the corresponding DSN parameter values.  Proposed by
		Mathias Herberts.
	New macro ${msg_size} which holds the value of the SIZE= parameter,
		i.e., usually the size of the message (in an ESMTP dialogue),
		before the message has been collected, thereafter it holds
		the message size as computed by sendmail (and can be used
		in check_compat).
	The macro ${deliveryMode} now specifies the current delivery mode
		sendmail is using instead of the value of the DeliveryMode
		option.
	New macro ${ntries} holds the number of delivery attempts.
	Drop explicit From: if same as what would be generated only if it is
		a local address.  From Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Write pid to file also if sendmail only processes the queue.
		Proposed by Roy J. Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Log "low on disk space" only when necessary.
	New macro ${load_avg} can be used to check the current load average.
		Suggested by Scott Gifford of The Internet Ramp.
	Return-Receipt-To: header implies DSN request if option RrtImpliesDsn
		is set.
	Flag -S for maps to specify the character which is substituted
		for spaces (instead of the default given by O BlankSub).
	Flag -D for maps: perform no lookup in deferred delivery mode.
		This flag is set by default for the host map.  Based on a
		proposal from Ian MacPhedran of the University of Saskatchewan.
	Open maps only on demand, not at startup.
	Log warning about unsupported IP address families.
	New option MaxHeadersLength allows to specify a maximum length
		of the sum of all headers.  This can be used to prevent
		a denial-of-service attack.
	New option MaxMimeHeaderLength which limits the size of MIME
		headers and parameters within those headers.  This option
		is intended to protect mail user agents from buffer
		overflow attacks.
	Added option MaxAliasRecursion to specify the maximum depth of
		alias recursion.
	New flag F=6 for mailers to strip headers to seven bit.
	Map type syslog to log the key via syslogd.
	Entries in the alias file can be continued by putting a backslash
		directly before the newline.
	New option DeadLetterDrop to define the location of the system-wide
		dead.letter file, formerly hardcoded to
		/usr/tmp/dead.letter.  If this option is not set (the
		default), sendmail will not attempt to save to a
		system-wide dead.letter file if it can not bounce the mail
		to the user nor postmaster.  Instead, it will rename the qf
		file as it has in the past when the dead.letter file
		could not be opened.
	New option PidFile to define the location of the pid file.  The
		value of this option is macro expanded.
	New option ProcessTitlePrefix specifies a prefix string for the
		process title shown in 'ps' listings.
	New macros for use with the PidFile and ProcessTitlePrefix options
		(along with the already existing macros):
		${daemon_info}      Daemon information, e.g.
		                    SMTP+queueing@00:30:00
		${daemon_addr}	    Daemon address, e.g., 0.0.0.0
		${daemon_family}    Daemon family, e.g., inet, inet6, etc.
		${daemon_name}      Daemon name, e.g., MSA.
		${daemon_port}	    Daemon port, e.g., 25
		${queue_interval}   Queue run interval, e.g., 00:30:00
	New macros especially for virtual hosting:
		${if_name}	hostname of interface of incoming connection.
		${if_addr}	address of interface of incoming connection.
		The latter is only set if the interface does not belong to the
		loopback net.
	If a message being accepted via a method other than SMTP and
		would be rejected by a header check, do not send the message.
		Suggested by Phil Homewood of Mincom Pty Ltd.
	Don't strip comments for header checks if $>+ is used instead of $>.
		Provide header value as quoted string in the macro
		${currHeader} (possibly truncated to MAXNAME).  Suggested by
		Jan Krueger of Unix-AG of University of Hannover.
		The length of the header value is stored in ${hdrlen}.
	H*: allows to specify a default ruleset for header checks.  This
		ruleset will only be called if the individual header does
		not have its own ruleset assigned.  Suggested by Jan
		Krueger of Unix-AG of University of Hannover.
		The name of the header field stored in ${hdr_name}.
	Comments (i.e., text within parentheses) in rulesets are not
		removed if the config file version is greater than or equal
		to 9.  For example, "R$+ ( 1 )		$@ 1" matches the
		input "token (1)" but does not match "token".
	Avoid removing the Content-Transfer-Encoding MIME header on
		MIME messages.  Problem noted by Sigurbjorn B. Larusson of
		Multimedia Consumer Services.  Fix from Per Hedeland of
		Ericsson.
	Avoid duplicate Content-Transfer-Encoding MIME header on
		messages with 8-bit text in headers.  Problem noted by
		Per Steinar Iversen of Oslo College.  Fix from Per Hedeland
		of Ericsson.
	Avoid keeping maps locked longer than necessary when re-opening a
		modified database map file.  Problem noted by Chris Adams
		of Renaissance Internet Services.
	Resolving to the $#error mailer with a temporary failure code (e.g.,
		$#error $@ tempfail $: "400 Temporary failure") will now
		queue up the message instead of bouncing it.
	Be more liberal in acceptable responses to an SMTP RSET command as
		standard does not provide any indication of what to do when
		something other than 250 is received.  Based on a patch
		from Steve Schweinhart of America Online.
	New option TrustedUser allows to specify a user who can own
		important files instead of root.  This requires HASFCHOWN.
	Fix USERDB conditional so compiling with NEWDB or HESIOD and
		setting USERDB=0 works.  Fix from Jorg Zanger of Schock.
	Fix another instance (similar to one in 8.9.3) of a network failure
		being mis-logged as "Illegal Seek" instead of whatever
		really went wrong.  From John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	$? tests also whether the macro is non-null.
	Print an error message if a mailer definition contains an invalid
		equate name.
	New mailer equate /= to specify a directory to chroot() into before
		executing the mailer program.  Suggested by Igor Vinokurov.
	New mailer equate W= to specify the maximum time to wait for the
		mailer to return after sending all data to it.
	Only free memory from the process list when adding a new process
		into a previously filled slot.  Previously, the memory was
		freed at removal time.  Since removal can happen in a
		signal handler, this may leave the memory map in an
		inconsistent state.  Problem noted by Jeff A. Earickson and
		David Cooley of Colby College.
	When using the UserDB @hostname catch-all, do not try to lookup
		local users in the passwd file.  The UserDB code has
		already decided the message will be passed to another host
		for processing.  Fix from Tony Landells of Burdett
		Buckeridge Young Limited.
	Support LDAP authorization via either a file containing the
		password or Kerberos V4 using the new map options
		'-ddistinguished_name', '-Mmethod', and '-Pfilename'.  The
		distinguished_name is who to login as.  The method can be
		one of LDAP_AUTH_NONE, LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE, or
		LDAP_AUTH_KRBV4.  The filename is the file containing the
		secret key for LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE or the name of the Kerberos
		ticket file for LDAP_AUTH_KRBV4.  Patch from Booker Bense
		of Stanford University.
	The ldapx map has been renamed to ldap.  The use of ldapx is
		deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
	If the result of an LDAP search returns a multi-valued attribute
		and the map has the column delimiter set, it turns that
		response into a delimiter separated string.  The LDAP map
		will traverse multiple entries as well.  LDAP alias maps
		automatically set the column delimiter to the comma.
		Based on patch from Booker Bense of Stanford University and
		idea from Philip A. Prindeville of Mirapoint, Inc.
	Support return of multiple values for a single LDAP lookup.  The
		values to be returned should be in a comma separated string.
		For example, `-v "email,emailother"'.  Patch from
		Curtis W. Hillegas of Princeton University.
	Allow the use of LDAP for alias maps.
	If no LDAP attributes are specified in an LDAP map declaration, all
		attributes found in the match will be returned.
	Prevent commas in quoted strings in the AliasFile value from
		breaking up a single entry into multiple entries.  This is
		needed for LDAP alias file specifications to allow for
		comma separated key and value strings.
	Keep connections to LDAP server open instead of opening and closing
		for each lookup.  To reduce overhead, sendmail will cache
		connections such that multiple maps which use the same
		host, port, bind DN, and authentication will only result in
		a single connection to that host.
	Put timeout in the proper place for USE_LDAP_INIT.
	Be more careful about checking for errors and freeing memory on
		LDAP lookups.
	Use asynchronous LDAP searches to save memory and network
		resources.
	Do not copy LDAP query results if the map's match only flag is set.
	Increase portability to the Netscape LDAP libraries.
	Change the parsing of the LDAP filter specification.  '%s' is still
		replaced with the literal contents of the map lookup key --
		note that this means a lookup can be done using the LDAP
		special characters.  The new '%0' token can be used instead
		of '%s' to encode the key buffer according to RFC 2254.
		For example, if the LDAP map specification contains '-k
		"(user=%s)"' and a lookup is done on "*", this would be
		equivalent to '-k "(user=*)"' -- matching ANY record with a
		user attribute.  Instead, if the LDAP map specification
		contains '-k "(user=%0)"' and a lookup is done on "*", this
		would be equivalent to '-k "(user=\2A)"' -- matching a user
		with the name "*".
	New LDAP map flags: "-1" requires a single match to be returned, if
		more than one is returned, it is equivalent to no records
		being found; "-r never|always|search|find" sets the LDAP
		alias dereference option; "-Z size" limits the number of
		matches to return.
	New option LDAPDefaultSpec allows a default map specification for
		LDAP maps.  The value should only contain LDAP specific
		settings such as "-h host -p port -d bindDN", etc.  The
		settings will be used for all LDAP maps unless they are
		specified in the individual map specification ('K'
		command).  This option should be set before any LDAP maps
		are defined.
	Prevent an NDBM alias file opening loop when the NDBM open
		continually fails.  Fix from Roy J. Mongiovi of Georgia
		Tech.
	Reduce memory utilization for smaller symbol table entries.  In
		particular, class entries get much smaller, which can be
		important if you have large classes.
	On network-related temporary failures, record the hostname which
		gave error in the queued status message.  Requested by
		Ulrich Windl of the Universitat Regensburg.
	Add new F=% mailer flag to allow for a store and forward
		configuration.  Mailers which have this flag will not attempt
		delivery on initial receipt of a message or on queue runs
		unless the queued message is selected using one of the
		-qI/-qR/-qS queue run modifiers or an ETRN request.  Code
		provided by Philip Guenther of Gustavus Adolphus College.
	New option ControlSocketName which, when set, creates a daemon
		control socket.  This socket allows an external program to
		control and query status from the running sendmail daemon
		via a named socket, similar to the ctlinnd interface to the
		INN news server.  Access to this interface is controlled by
		the UNIX file permissions on the named socket on most UNIX
		systems (see sendmail/README for more information).  An
		example control program is provided as contrib/smcontrol.pl.
	Change the default values of QueueLA from 8 to (8 * numproc) and
		RefuseLA from 12 to (12 * numproc) where numproc is the
		number of processors online on the system (if that can be
		determined).  For single processor machines, this change
		has no effect.
	Don't return body of message to postmaster on "Too many hops" bounces.
		Based on fix from Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Give more detailed DSN descriptions for some cases.  Patch from
		Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Logging of alias, forward file, and UserDB expansion now happens
		at LogLevel 11 or higher instead of 10 or higher.
	Logging of an envelope's complete delivery (the "done" message) now
		happens at LogLevel 10 or higher instead of 11 or higher.
	Logging of TCP/IP or UNIX standard input connections now happens at
		LogLevel 10 or higher.  Previously, only TCP/IP connections
		were logged, and on at LogLevel 12 or higher.  Setting
		LogLevel to 10 will now assist users in tracking frequent
		connection-based denial of service attacks.
	Log basic information about authenticated connections at LogLevel
		10 or higher.
	Log SMTP Authentication mechanism and author when logging the sender
		information (from= syslog line).
	Log the DSN code for each recipient if one is available as a new
		equate (dsn=).
	Macro expand PostmasterCopy and DoubleBounceAddress options.
	New "ph" map for performing ph queries in rulesets.  More
		information is available at
		http://www-dev.cso.uiuc.edu/sendmail/.  Contributed by Mark
		Roth of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	Detect temporary lookup failures in the host map if looking up a
		bracketed IP address.  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the
		Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Do not report a Remote-MTA on local deliveries.  Problem noted by
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	When a forward file points to an alias which runs a program, run
		the program as the default user and the default group, not
		the forward file user.  This change also assures the
		:include: directives in aliases are also processed using
		the default user and group.  Problem noted by Sergiu
		Popovici of DNT Romania.
	Prevent attempts to save a dead.letter file for a user with
		no home directory (/no/such/directory).  Problem noted by
		Michael Brown of Finnigan FT/MS.
	Include message delay and number of tries when logging that a
		message has been completely delivered (LogLevel of 10 or
		above).  Suggested by Nick Hilliard of Ireland Online.
	Log the sender of a message even if none of the recipients were
		accepted.  If some of the recipients were rejected, it is
		helpful to know the sender of the message.
	Check the root directory (/) when checking a path for safety.
		Problem noted by John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Prevent multiple responses to the DATA command if DeliveryMode is
		interactive and delivering to an alias which resolves to
		multiple files.
	Macros in the helpfile are expanded if the helpfile version is 2 or
		greater (see below); the help function doesn't print the
		version of sendmail any longer, instead it is placed in
		the helpfile ($v).  Suggested by Chuck Foster of UUNET
		PIPEX.  Additionally, comment lines (starting with #) are
		skipped and a version line (#vers) is introduced.  The
		helpfile version for 8.10.0 is 2, if no version or an older
		version is found, a warning is logged.  The '#vers'
		directive should be placed at the top of the help file.
	Use fsync() when delivering to a file to guarantee the delivery to
		disk succeeded.  Suggested by Nick Christenson.
	If delivery to a file is unsuccessful, truncate the file back to its
		length before the attempt.
	If a forward points to a filename for delivery, change to the
		user's uid before checking permissions on the file.  This
		allows delivery to files on NFS mounted directories where
		root is remapped to nobody.  Problem noted by Harald
		Daeubler of Universitaet Ulm.
	purgestat and sendmail -bH purge only expired (Timeout.hoststatus)
		host status files, not all files.
	Any macros stored in the class $={persistentMacros} will be saved
		in the queue file for the message and set when delivery
		is attempted on the queued item.  Suggested by Kyle Jones of
		Wonderworks Inc.
	Add support for storing information between rulesets using the new
		macro map class.  This can be used to store information
		between queue runs as well using $={persistentMacros}.
		Based on an idea from Jan Krueger of Unix-AG of University
		of Hannover.
	New map class arith to allow for computations in rules.  The
		operation (+, -, *, /, l (for less than), and =) is given
		as key.  The two operands are specified as arguments; the
		lookup returns the result of the computation.  For example,
		"$(arith l $@ 4 $@ 2 $)" will return "FALSE" and
		"$(arith + $@ 4 $@ 2 $)" will return "6".
	Add new syntax for header declarations which decide whether to
		include the header based on a macro rather than a mailer
		flag:
			H?${MyMacro}?X-My-Header: ${MyMacro}
		This should be used along with $={persistentMacros}.
		It can be used for adding headers to a message based on
		the results of check_* and header check rulesets.
	Allow new named config file rule check_eoh which is called after
		all of the headers have been collected.  The input to the
		ruleset the number of headers and the size of all of the
		headers in bytes separated by $|.  This ruleset along with
		the macro storage map can be used to correlate information
		gathered between headers and to check for missing headers.
		See cf/README or doc/op/op.ps for an example.
	Change the default for the MeToo option to True to correspond
		to the clarification in the DRUMS SMTP Update spec.  This
		option is deprecated and will be removed from a future
		version.
	Change the sendmail binary default for SendMimeErrors to True.
	Change the sendmail binary default for SuperSafe to True.
	Display ruleset names in debug and address test mode output
		if referencing a named ruleset.
	New mailer equate m= which will limit the number of messages
		delivered per connection on an SMTP or LMTP mailer.
	Improve QueueSortOrder=Host by reversing the hostname before
		using it to sort.  Now all the same domains are really run
		through the queue together.  If they have the same MX host,
		then they will have a much better opportunity to use the
		connection cache if available.  This should be a reasonable
		performance improvement.  Patch from Randall Winchester of
		the University of Maryland.
	If a message is rejected by a header check ruleset, log who would
		have received the message if it had not been rejected.
	New "now" value for Timeout.queuereturn to bounce entries from the
		queue immediately.  No delivery attempt is made.
	Increase sleeping time exponentially after too many "bad" commands
		up to 4 minutes delay (compare MAX{BAD,NOOP,HELO,VRFY,ETRN}-
		COMMANDS).
	New option ClientPortOptions similar to DaemonPortOptions
		but for outgoing connections.
	New suboptions for DaemonPortOptions: Name (a name used for
		error messages and logging) and Modifiers, i.e.
			a	require authentication
			b	bind to interface through which mail has
				been received
			c	perform hostname canonification
			f	require fully qualified hostname
			h	use name of interface for outgoing HELO
				command
			C	don't perform hostname canonification
			E	disallow ETRN (see RFC 2476)
	New suboption for ClientPortOptions: Modifiers, i.e.
			h	use name of interface for HELO command
	The version number for queue files (qf) has been incremented to 4.
	Log unacceptable HELO/EHLO domain name attempts if LogLevel is set
		to 10 or higher.  Suggested by Rick Troxel of the National
		Institutes of Health.
	If a mailer dies, print the status in decimal instead of octal
		format.  Suggested by Michael Shapiro of Sun Microsystems.
	Limit the length of all MX records considered for delivery to 8k.
	Move message priority from sender to recipient logging.  Suggested by
		Ulrich Windl of the Universitat Regensburg.
	Add support for Berkeley DB 3.X.
	Add fix for Berkeley DB 2.X fcntl() locking race condition.
		Requires a post-2.7.5 version of Berkeley DB.
	Support writing traffic log (sendmail -X option) to a FIFO.
		Patch submitted by Rick Heaton of Network Associates, Inc.
	Do not ignore Timeout settings in the .cf file when a Timeout
		sub-options is set on the command line.  Problem noted by
		Graeme Hewson of Oracle.
	Randomize equal preference MX records each time delivery is
		attempted via a new connection to a host instead of once per
		session.  Suggested by Scott Salvidio of Compaq.
	Implement enhanced status codes as defined by RFC 2034.
	Add [hostname] to class w for the names of all interfaces unless
		DontProbeInterfaces is set. This is useful for sending mails
		to hosts which have dynamically assigned names.
	If a message is bounced due to bad MIME conformance, avoid bouncing
		the bounce for the same reason.  If the body is not 8-bit
		clean, and EightBitMode isn't set to pass8, the body will
		not be included in the bounce.  Problem noted by Valdis
		Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	The timeout for sending a message via SMTP has been changed from
		'${msgsize} / 16 + (${nrcpts} * 300)' to a timeout which
		simply checks for progress on sending data every 5 minutes.
		This will detect the inability to send information quicker
		and reduce the number of processes simply waiting to
		timeout.
	Prevent a segmentation fault on systems which give a partial filled
		interface address structure when loading the system network
		interface addresses.  Fix from Reinier Bezuidenhout of
		Nanoteq.
	Add a compile-time configuration macro, MAXINTERFACES, which
		indicates the number of interfaces to read when probing
		for hostnames and IP addresses for class w ($=w).  The
		default value is 512.  Based on idea from Reinier
		Bezuidenhout of Nanoteq.
	If the RefuseLA option is set to 0, do not reject connections based
		on load average.
	Allow ruleset 0 to have a name.  Problem noted by Neil Rickert of
		Northern Illinois University.
	Expand the Return-Path: header at delivery time, after "owner-"
		envelope splitting has occurred.
	Don't try to sort the queue if there are no entries. Patch from
		Luke Mewburn from RMIT University.
	Add a "/quit" command to address test mode.
	Include the proper sender in the UNIX "From " line and Return-Path:
		header when undeliverable mail is saved to ~/dead.letter.
		Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	The contents of a class can now be copied to another class using
		the syntax: "C{Dest} $={Source}".  This would copy all of
		the items in class $={Source} into the class $={Dest}.
	Include original envelope's error transcript in bounces created for
		split (owner-) envelopes to see the original errors when
		the recipients were added.  Based on fix from Motonori
		Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Show reason for permanent delivery errors directly after the
		addresses.  From Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Prevent a segmentation fault when bouncing a split-envelope
		message.  Patch from Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	If the specification for the queue run interval (-q###) has a
		syntax error, consider the error fatal and exit.
	Pay attention to CheckpointInterval during LMTP delivery.  Problem
		noted by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	On operating systems which have setlogin(2), use it to set the
		login name to the RunAsUserName when starting as a daemon.
		This is for delivery to programs which use getlogin().
		Based on fix from Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Differentiate between "command not implemented" and "command
		unrecognized" in the SMTP dialogue.
	Strip returns from forward and include files.  Problem noted by
		Allan E Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	Prevent a core dump when using 'sendmail -bv' on an address which
		resolves to the $#error mailer with a temporary failure.
		Based on fix from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois
		University.
	Prevent multiple deliveries of a message with a "non-local alias"
		pointing to a local user, if canonicalization fails
		the message was requeued *and* delivered to the alias.
	If an invalid ruleset is declared, the ruleset name could be
		ignored and its rules added to S0.  Instead, ignore the
		ruleset lines as well.
	Avoid incorrect Final-Recipient, Action, and X-Actual-Recipient
		success DSN fields as well as duplicate entries for a
		single address due to S5 and UserDB processing.  Problems
		noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	Turn off timeouts when exiting sendmail due to an interrupt signal
		to prevent the timeout from firing during the exit process.
		Problem noted by Michael Shapiro of Sun Microsystems.
	Do not append @MyHostName to non-RFC822 addresses output by the EXPN
		command or on Final-Recipient: and X-Actual-Recipient: DSN
		headers.  Non-RFC822 addresses include deliveries to
		programs, file, DECnet, etc.
	Fix logic for determining if a local user is using -f or -bs to
		spoof their return address.  Based on idea from Neil Rickert
		of Northern Illinois University and patch from Per Hedeland
		of Ericsson.
	Report the proper UID in the bounce message if an :include: file is
		owned by a uid that doesn't map to a username and the
		:include: file contains delivery to a file or program.
		Problem noted by John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Avoid the attempt of trying to send a second SMTP QUIT command if
		the remote server responds to the first QUIT with a 4xx
		response code and drops the connection.  This behavior was
		noted by Ulrich Windl of the Universitat Regensburg when
		sendmail was talking to the Mercury 1.43 MTA.
	If a hostname lookup times out and ServiceSwitchFile is set but the
		file is not present, the lookup failure would be marked as
		a permanent failure instead of a temporary failure.  Fix
		from Russell King of the ARM Linux Project.
	Handle aliases or forwards which deliver to programs using tabs
		instead of spaces between arguments.  Problem noted by Randy
		Wormser.  Fix from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois
		University.
	Allow MaxRecipientsPerMessage option to be set on the command line
		by normal users (e.g., sendmail won't drop its root
		privileges) to allow overrides for message submission via
		'sendmail -bs'.
	Set the names for help file and statistics file to "helpfile" and
		"statistics", respectively, if no parameters are given for
		them in the .cf file.
	Avoid bogus 'errbody: I/O Error -7' log messages when sending
		success DSN messages for messages relayed to non-DSN aware
		systems.  Problem noted by Juergen Georgi of RUS University
		of Stuttgart and Kyle Tucker of Parexel International.
	Prevent +detail information from interfering with local delivery to
		multiple users in the same transaction (F=m).
	Add H_FORCE flag for the X-Authentication-Warning: header, so it
		will be added even if one already exists.  Problem noted
		by Michal Zalewski of Marchew Industries.
	Stop processing SMTP commands if the SMTP connection is dropped.
		This prevents a remote system from flooding the connection
		with commands and then disconnecting.  Previously, the
		server would process all of the buffered commands.  Problem
		noted by Michal Zalewski of Marchew Industries.
	Properly process user-supplied headers beginning with '?'.  Problem
		noted by Michal Zalewski of Marchew Industries.
	If multiple header checks resolve to the $#error mailer, use the
		last permanent (5XX) failure if any exist.  Otherwise, use
		the last temporary (4XX) failure.
	RFC 1891 requires "hexchar" in a "xtext" to be upper case.  Patch
		from Ronald F. Guilmette of Infinite Monkeys & Co.
	Timeout.ident now defaults to 5 seconds instead of 30 seconds to
		prevent the now common delays associated with mailing to a
		site which drops IDENT packets.  Suggested by many.
	Persistent host status data is not reloaded disk when current data
		is available in the in-memory cache.  Problem noted by Per
		Hedeland of Ericsson.
	mailq displays unprintable characters in addresses as their octal
		representation and a leading backslash.  This avoids problems
		with "unprintable" characters.  Problem noted by Michal
		Zalewski of the "Internet for Schools" project (IdS).
	The mail line length limit (L= equate) was adding the '!' indicator
		one character past the limit.  This would cause subsequent
		hops to break the line again.  The '!' is now placed in
		the last column of the limit if the line needs to be broken.
		Problem noted by Joe Pruett of Q7 Enterprises.  Based on fix
		from Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	If a resolver ANY query is larger than the UDP packet size, the
		resolver will fall back to TCP.  However, some
		misconfigured firewalls black 53/TCP so the ANY lookup
		fails whereas an MX or A record might succeed.  Therefore,
		don't fail on ANY queries.
	If an SMTP recipient is rejected due to syntax errors in the
		address, do not send an empty postmaster notification DSN
		to the postmaster.  Problem noted by Neil Rickert of
		Northern Illinois University.
	Allow '_' and '.' in map names when parsing a sequence map
		specification.  Patch from William Setzer of North Carolina
		State University.
	Fix hostname in logging of read timeouts for the QUIT command on
		cached connections.  Problem noted by Neil Rickert of
		Northern Illinois University.
	Use a more descriptive entry to log "null" connections, i.e.,
		"host did not issue MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection".
	Fix a file descriptor leak in ONEX mode.
	Portability:
		Reverse signal handling logic such that sigaction(2) with
			the SA_RESTART flag is the preferred method and the
			other signal methods are only tried if SA_RESTART
			is not available.  Problem noted by Allan E
			Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

	CONFIG: confDAEMON_OPTIONS has been replaced by DAEMON_OPTIONS(),
		which takes the options as argument and can be used
		multiple times; see cf/README for details.
	CONFIG: Add a fifth mailer definition to MAILER(`smtp') called
		"dsmtp".  This mail provides on-demand delivery using the
		F=% mailer flag described above.  The "dsmtp" mailer
		definition uses the new DSMTP_MAILER_ARGS which defaults
		to "IPC $h".
	CONFIG: New variables LOCAL_MAILER_MAXMSGS, SMTP_MAILER_MAXMSGS,
		and RELAY_MAILER_MAXMSGS for setting the m= equate for the
		local, smtp, and relay mailers respectively.
	CONFIG: New variable LOCAL_MAILER_DSN_DIAGNOSTIC_CODE for setting
		the DSN Diagnostic-Code type for the local mailer.  The
		value should be changed with care.
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`local_lmtp') now sets the DSN Diagnostic-Code type
		for the local mailer to the proper value of "SMTP".
	CONFIG: All included maps are no longer optional by default; if
		there there is a problem with a map, sendmail will
		complain.
	CONFIG: Removed root from class E; use EXPOSED_USER(`root')
		to get the old behavior.  Suggested by Joe Pruett
		of Q7 Enterprises.
	CONFIG: MASQUERADE_EXCEPTION() defines hosts/subdomains which
		will not be masqueraded.  Proposed by Arne Wichmann
		of MPI Saarbruecken, Griff Miller of PGS Tensor,
		Jayme Cox of Broderbund Software Inc.
	CONFIG: A list of exceptions for FEATURE(`nocanonify') can be
		specified by CANONIFY_DOMAIN or CANONIFY_DOMAIN_FILE,
		i.e., a list of domains which are passed to $[ ... $]
		for canonification. Based on an idea from Neil Rickert
		of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: If `canonify_hosts' is specified as parameter for
		FEATURE(`nocanonify') then addresses which have only
		a hostname, e.g., <user@host>, will be canonified.
	CONFIG: If FEATURE(`nocanonify') is turned on, a trailing dot is
		nevertheless added to addresses with more than one component
		in it.
	CONFIG: Canonification is no longer attempted for any host or domain
		in class 'P' ($=P).
	CONFIG: New class for matching virtusertable entries $={VirtHost} that
		can be populated by VIRTUSER_DOMAIN or VIRTUSER_DOMAIN_FILE.
		FEATURE(`virtuser_entire_domain') can be used to apply this
		class also to entire subdomains.  Hosts in this class are
		treated as canonical in SCanonify2, i.e., a trailing dot
		is added.
	CONFIG: If VIRTUSER_DOMAIN() or VIRTUSER_DOMAIN_FILE() are used,
		include $={VirtHost} in $=R (hosts allowed to relay).
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`generics_entire_domain') can be used to apply the
		genericstable also to subdomains of $=G.
	CONFIG: Pass "+detail" as %2 for virtusertable lookups.
		Patch from Noam Freedman from University of Chicago.
	CONFIG: Pass "+detail" as %1 for genericstable lookups.  Suggested
		by Raymond S Brand of rsbx.net.
	CONFIG: Allow @domain in genericstable to override masquerading.
		Suggested by Owen Duffy from Owen Duffy & Associates.
	CONFIG: LOCAL_DOMAIN() adds entries to class w.  Suggested by Steve
		Hubert of University of Washington.
	CONFIG: OSTYPE(`gnuhurd') has been replaced by OSTYPE(`gnu') as
		GNU is now the canonical system name.  From Mark
		Kettenis of the University of Amsterdam.
	CONFIG: OSTYPE(`unixware7') updates from Larry Rosenman.
	CONFIG: Do not include '=' in option expansion if there is no value
		associated with the option.  From Andrew Brown of
		Graffiti World Wide, Inc.
	CONFIG: Add MAILER(`qpage') to define a new pager mailer.  Contributed
		by Philip A. Prindeville of Enteka Enterprise Technology
		Services.
	CONFIG: MAILER(`cyrus') was not preserving case for mail folder
		names.  Problem noted by Randall Winchester of Swales
		Aerospace.
	CONFIG: RELAY_MAILER_FLAGS can be used to define additional flags
		for the relay mailer.  Suggested by Doug Hughes of Auburn
		University and Brian Candler.
	CONFIG: LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS now includes 'P' (Add Return-Path:
		header) by default.  Suggested by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONFIG: Use SMART_HOST for bracketed addresses, e.g., user@[host].
		Suggested by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	CONFIG: New macro MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS to tweak *_MAILER_FLAGS;
		i.e., to set, add, or delete flags.
	CONFIG: If SMTP AUTH is used then relaying is allowed for any user
		who authenticated via a "trusted" mechanism, i.e., one that
		is defined via TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`list of mechanisms').
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`delay_checks') delays check_mail and check_relay
		after check_rcpt and allows for exceptions from the checks.
	CONFIG: Map declarations have been moved into their associated
		feature files to allow greater flexibility in use of
		sequence maps.  Suggested by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONFIG: New macro LOCAL_MAILER_EOL to override the default end of
		line string for the local mailer.  Requested by Il Oh of
		Willamette Industries, Inc.
	CONFIG: Route addresses are stripped, i.e., <@a,@b,@c:user@d> is
		converted to <user@d>
	CONFIG: Reject bogus return address of <@@hostname>, generated by
		Sun's older, broken configuration files.
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`nullclient') now provides the full rulesets of a
		normal configuration, allowing anti-spam checks to be
		performed.
	CONFIG: Don't return a permanent error (Relaying denied) if
		${client_name} can't be resolved just temporarily.
		Suggested by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	CONFIG: Change numbered rulesets into named (which still can
		be accessed by their numbers).
	CONFIG: FEATURE(`nouucp') takes one parameter: reject or nospecial
		which describes whether to disallow "!" in the local part
		of an address.
	CONFIG: Call Local_localaddr from localaddr (S5) which can be used
		to rewrite an address from a mailer which has the F=5 flag
		set.  If the ruleset returns a mailer, the appropriate
		action is taken, otherwise the returned tokens are ignored.
	CONFIG: cf/ostype/solaris.m4 has been renamed to solaris2.pre5.m4
		and cf/ostype/solaris2.m4 is now a copy of solaris2.ml.m4.
		The latter is kept around for backward compatibility.
	CONFIG: Allow ":D.S.N:" for mailer/virtusertable "error:" entries,
		where "D.S.N" is an RFC 1893 compliant error code.
	CONFIG: Use /usr/lbin as confEBINDIR for Compaq Tru64 (Digital UNIX).
	CONFIG: Remove second space between username and date in UNIX From_
		line.  Noted by Allan E Johannesen of Worcester Polytechnic
		Institute.
	CONFIG: Make sure all of the mailers have complete T= equates.
	CONFIG: Extend FEATURE(`local_procmail') so it can now take
		arguments overriding the mailer program, arguments, and
		mailer definition flags.  This makes it possible to use
		other programs such as maildrop for local delivery.
	CONFIG: Emit warning if FEATURE(`local_lmtp') or
		FEATURE(`local_procmail') is given after MAILER(`local').
		Patch from Richard A. Nelson of IBM.
	CONFIG: Add SMTP Authentication information to Received: header
		default value (confRECEIVED_HEADER).
	CONFIG: Remove `l' flag from USENET_MAILER_FLAGS as it is not a
		local mailer.  Problem noted by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONTRIB: Added bounce-resender.pl from Brian R. Gaeke of the
		University of California at Berkeley.
	CONTRIB: Added domainmap.m4 from Mark D. Roth of the University of
		Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	CONTRIB: etrn.pl now recognizes bogus host names.  Patch from
		Bruce Barnett of GE's R&D Lab.
	CONTRIB: Patches for re-mqueue.pl by Graeme Hewson of Oracle
		Corporation UK.
	CONTRIB: Added qtool.pl to assist in managing the queues.
	DEVTOOLS: Prevent user environment variables from interfering with
		the Build scripts.  Problem noted by Ezequiel H. Panepucci of
		Yale University.
	DEVTOOLS: 'Build -M' will display the obj.* directory which will
		be used for building.
	DEVTOOLS: 'Build -A' will display the architecture that would be
		used for a fresh build.
	DEVTOOLS: New variable confRANLIB, set automatically by configure.sh.
	DEVTOOLS: New variable confRANLIBOPTS for the options to send to
		ranlib.
	DEVTOOLS: 'Build -O <path>' will have the object files build in
		<path>/obj.*.  Suggested by Bryan Costales of Exactis.
	DEVTOOLS: New variable confNO_MAN_BUILD which will prevent the
		building of the man pages when defined.  Suggested by Bryan
		Costales.
	DEVTOOLS: New variables confNO_HELPFILE_INSTALL and
		confNO_STATISTICS_INSTALL which will prevent the
		installation of the sendmail helpfile and statistics file
		respectively.  Suggested by Bryan Costales.
	DEVTOOLS: Recognize ReliantUNIX as SINIX.  Patch from Gerald Rinske
		of Siemens Business Services.
	DEVTOOLS: New variable confSTDIO_TYPE which defines the type of
		stdio library.  The new buffered file I/O depends on the
		Torek stdio library.  This option can be either portable or
		torek.
	DEVTOOLS: New variables confSRCADD and confSMSRCADD which
		correspond to confOBJADD and confSMOBJADD respectively.
		They should contain the C source files for the object files
		listed in confOBJADD and confSMOBJADD.  These file names
		will be passed to the 'make depend' stage of compilation.
	DEVTOOLS: New program specific variables for each of the programs
		in the sendmail distribution.  Each has the form
		`conf_prog_ENVDEF', for example, `conf_sendmail_ENVDEF'.
		The new variables are conf_prog_ENVDEF, conf_prog_LIBS,
		conf_prog_SRCADD, and conf_prog_OBJADD.
	DEVTOOLS: Build system redesign.  This should have little affect on
		building the distribution, but documentation on the changes
		are in devtools/README.
	DEVTOOLS: Don't allow 'Build -f file' if an object directory already
		exists.  Suggested by Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	DEVTOOLS: Rename confSRCDIR to confSMSRCDIR since it only identifies
		the path to the sendmail source directory.  confSRCDIR is a
		new variable which identifies the root of the source
		directories for all of the programs in the distribution.
	DEVTOOLS: confSRCDIR and confSMSRCDIR are now determined at Build
		time.  They can both still be overridden by setting the m4
		macro.
	DEVTOOLS: confSBINGRP now defaults to bin instead of kmem.
	DEVTOOLS: 'Build -Q prefix' uses devtools/Site/prefix.*.m4 for
		build configurations, and places objects in obj.prefix.*/.
		Complains as 'Build -f file' does for existing object
		directories.  Suggested by Tom Smith of Digital Equipment
		Corporation.
	DEVTOOLS: Setting confINSTALL_RAWMAN will install unformatted
		manual pages in the directory tree specified by
		confMANROOTMAN.
	DEVTOOLS: If formatting the manual pages fails, copy in the
		preformatted pages from the distribution.  The new variable
		confCOPY specifies the copying program.
	DEVTOOLS: Defining confFORCE_RMAIL will install rmail without
		question.  Suggested by Terry Lambert of Whistle
		Communications.
	DEVTOOLS: confSTFILE and confHFFILE can be used to change the names
		of the installed statistics and help files, respectively.
	DEVTOOLS: Remove spaces in `uname -r` output when determining
		operating system identity.  Problem noted by Erik
		Wachtenheim of Dartmouth College.
	DEVTOOLS: New variable confLIBSEARCHPATH to specify the paths that
		will be search for the libraries specified in confLIBSEARCH.
		Defaults to "/lib /usr/lib /usr/shlib".
	DEVTOOLS: New variables confSTRIP and confSTRIPOPTS for specifying
		how to strip binaries.  These are used by the new
		install-strip target.
	DEVTOOLS: New config file site.post.m4 which is included after
		the others (if it exists).
	DEVTOOLS: Change order of LIBS: first product specific libraries
		then the default ones.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Will not be installed setuid root.  To use mail.local
		as local delivery agent without LMTP mode, use
		MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+S')
		to set the S flag.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Do not reject addresses which would otherwise be
		accepted by sendmail.  Suggested by Neil Rickert of
		Northern Illinois University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: New -7 option which causes LMTP mode not to advertise
		8BITMIME in the LHLO response.  Suggested by Kari Hurtta of
		the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Add support for the maillock() routines by defining
		MAILLOCK when compiling.  Also requires linking with
		-lmail.  Patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois
		University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Create a Content-Length: header if CONTENTLENGTH is
		defined when compiling.  Automatically set for Solaris 2.3
		and later.  Patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois
		University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Move the initialization of the 'notifybiff' address
		structure to the beginning of the program.  This ensures that
		the getservbyname() is done before any seteuid to a possibly
		unauthenticated user.  If you are using NIS+ and secure RPC
		on a Solaris system, this avoids syslog messages such as,
		"authdes_refresh: keyserv(1m) is unable to encrypt session
		key."  Patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois
		University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Support group writable mail spool files when MAILGID is
		set to the gid to use (-DMAILGID=6) when compiling.
		Patch from Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: When a mail message included lines longer than 2046
		characters (in LMTP mode), mail.local split the incoming
		line up into 2046-character output lines (excluding the
		newline).  If an input line was 2047 characters long
		(excluding CR-LF) and the last character was a '.',
		mail.local saw it as the end of input, transfered it to the
		user mailbox and tried to write an `ok' back to sendmail.
		If the message was much longer, both sendmail and
		mail.local would deadlock waiting for each other to read
		what they have written.  Problem noted by Peter Jeremy of
		Alcatel Australia Limited.
	MAIL.LOCAL: New option -b to return a permanent error instead of a
		temporary error if a mailbox exceeds quota.  Suggested by
		Neil Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	MAIL.LOCAL: The creation of a lockfile is subject to a global
		timeout to avoid starvation.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Properly parse addresses with multiple quoted
		local-parts.  Problem noted by Ronald F. Guilmette of
		Infinite Monkeys & Co.
	MAIL.LOCAL: NCR MP/RAS 3.X portability from Tom J. Moore of NCR.
	MAILSTATS: New -p option to invoke program mode in which stats are
		printed in a machine readable fashion and the stats file
		is reset.  Patch from Kevin Hildebrand of the University
		of Maryland.
	MAKEMAP: If running as root, automatically change the ownership of
		generated maps to the TrustedUser as specified in the
		sendmail configuration file.
	MAKEMAP: New -C option to accept an alternate sendmail
		configuration file to use for finding the TrustedUser
		option.
	MAKEMAP: New -u option to dump (unmap) a database.  Based on
		code contributed by Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	MAKEMAP: New -e option to allow empty values.  Suggested by Philip
		A. Prindeville of Enteka Enterprise Technology Services.
	MAKEMAP: Compile cleanly on 64-bit operating systems.  Problem
		noted by Gerald Rinske of Siemens Business Services.
	OP.ME: Correctly document interaction between F=S and U= mailer
		equates.  Problem noted by Bob Halley of Internet Engines.
	OP.ME: Fixup Timeout documentation.  From Graeme Hewson of Oracle
		Corporation UK.
	OP.ME: The Timeout [r] option was incorrectly listed as "safe"
		(e.g., sendmail would not drop root privileges if the
		option was specified on the command line).  Problem noted
		by Todd C. Miller of Courtesan Consulting.
	PRALIASES: Handle the hash and btree map specifications for
		Berkeley DB.  Patch from Brian J. Coan of the
		Institute for Global Communications.
	PRALIASES: Read the sendmail.cf file for the location(s) of the
		alias file(s) if the -f option is not used.  Patch from
		John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	PRALIASES: New -C option to specify an alternate sendmail
		configuration file to use for finding alias file(s).  Patch
		from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	SMRSH: allow shell commands echo, exec, and exit.  Allow command
		lists using || and &&.  Based on patch from Brian J. Coan
		of the Institute for Global Communications.
	SMRSH: Update README for the new Build system.  From Tim Pierce
		of RootsWeb Genealogical Data Cooperative.
	VACATION: Added vacation auto-responder to sendmail distribution.
	LIBSMDB: Added abstracted database library.  Works with Berkeley
		DB 1.85, Berkeley DB 2.X, Berkeley DB 3.X, and NDBM.
	Changed Files:
		The Build script in the various program subdirectories are
			no longer symbolic links.  They are now scripts
			which execute the actual Build script in
			devtools/bin.
		All the manual pages are now written against -man and not
			-mandoc as they were previously.
		Add a simple Makefile to every directory so make instead
			of Build will work (unless parameters are
			required for Build).

8.9.3/8.9.3	1999/02/04
	SECURITY: Limit message headers to a maximum of 32K bytes (total
		of all headers in a single message) to prevent a denial of
		service attack.  This limit will be configurable in 8.10.
		Problem noted by Michal Zalewski of the "Internet for
		Schools" project (IdS).
	Prevent segmentation fault on an LDAP lookup if the LDAP map
		was closed due to an earlier failure.  Problem noted by
		Jeff Wasilko of smoe.org.  Fix from Booker Bense of
		Stanford University and Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Preserve the order of the MIME headers in multipart messages
		when performing the MIME header length check.  This
		will allow PGP signatures to function properly.  Problem
		noted by Lars Hecking of University College, Cork, Ireland.
	If ruleset 5 rewrote the local address to an :include: directive,
		the delivery would fail with an "aliasing/forwarding loop
		broken" error.  Problem noted by Eric C Hagberg of Morgan
		Stanley.  Fix from Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Allow -T to work for bestmx maps.  Fix from Aaron Schrab of
		ExecPC Internet Systems.
	During the transfer of a message in an SMTP transaction, if a
		TCP timeout occurs, the message would be properly queued
		for later retry but the failure would be logged as
		"Illegal Seek" instead of a timeout.  Problem noted by
		Piotr Kucharski of the Warsaw School of Economics (SGH)
		and Carles Xavier Munyoz Baldo of CTV Internet.
	Prevent multiple deliveries on a self-referencing alias if the
		F=w mailer flag is not set.  Problem noted by Murray S.
		Kucherawy of Concentric Network Corporation and Per
		Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Do not strip empty headers but if there is no value and a
		default is defined in sendmail.cf, use the default.
		Problem noted by Philip Guenther of Gustavus Adolphus
		College and Christopher McCrory of Netus, Inc.
	Don't inherit information about the sender (notably the full name)
		in SMTP (-bs) mode, since this might be called from inetd.
	Accept any 3xx reply code in response to DATA command instead of
		requiring 354.  This change will match the wording to be
		published in the updated SMTP specification from the DRUMS
		group of the IETF.
	Portability:
		AIX 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 may become updated by the fileset
			bos.rte.net level 4.2.0.2.  This introduces the
			softlink /usr/lib/libbind.a which should
			not be used.  It conflicts with the resolver
			built into libc.a.  "bind" has been removed
			from the confLIBSEARCH BuildTools variable.
			Users who have installed BIND 8.X will have
			to add it back in their site.config.m4 file.
			Problem noted by Ole Holm Nielsen of the
			Technical University of Denmark.
		CRAY TS 10.0.x from Sven Nielsen of San Diego
			Supercomputer Center.
		Improved LDAP version 3 integration based on input
			from Kurt D. Zeilenga of the OpenLDAP Foundation,
			John Beck of Sun Microsystems, and Booker Bense
			of Stanford University.
		Linux doesn't have a standard way to get the timezone
			between different releases.  Back out the
			change in 8.9.2 and don't attempt to derive
			a timezone.  Problem reported by Igor S. Livshits
			of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
			and Michael Dickens of Tetranet Communications.
		Reliant UNIX, the new name for SINIX, from Gert-Jan Looy
			of Siemens/SNI.
		SunOS 5.8 from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	CONFIG: SCO UnixWare 2.1 and 7.0 need TZ to get the proper
		timezone.  Problem noted by Petr Lampa of Technical
		University of Brno.
	CONFIG: Handle <@bestmx-host:user@otherhost> addressing properly
		when using FEATURE(bestmx_is_local).  Patch from Neil W.
		Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: Properly handle source routed and %-hack addresses on
		hosts which the mailertable remaps to local:.  Patch from
		Neil W. Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: Internal fixup of mailertable local: map value.  Patch from
		Larry Parmelee of Cornell University.
	CONFIG: Only add back +detail from host portion of mailer triplet
		on local mailer triplets if it was originally +detail.
		Patch from Neil W. Rickert of Northern Illinois University.
	CONFIG: The bestmx_is_local checking done in check_rcpt would
		cause later checks to fail.  Patch from Paul J Murphy of
		MIDS Europe.
	New Files:
		BuildTools/OS/CRAYTS.10.0.x
		BuildTools/OS/ReliantUNIX
		BuildTools/OS/SunOS.5.8

8.9.2/8.9.2	1998/12/30
	SECURITY: Remove five second sleep on accepting daemon connections
		due to an accept() failure.  This sleep could be used
		for a denial of service attack.
	Do not silently ignore queue files with names which are too long.
		Patch from Bryan Costales of InfoBeat, Inc.
	Do not store failures closing an SMTP session in persistent
		host status.  Reported by Graeme Hewson of Oracle
		Corporation UK.
	Allow symbolic link forward files if they are in safe directories.
		Problem noted by Andreas Schott of the Max Planck Society.
	Missing columns in a text map could cause a segmentation fault.
		Fix from David Lee of the University of Durham.
	Note that for 8.9.X, PrivacyOptions=goaway also includes the
		noetrn flag.  This is scheduled to change in a future
		version of sendmail.  Problem noted by Theo Van Dinter of
		Chrysalis Symbolic Designa and Alan Brown of Manawatu
		Internet Services.
	When trying to do host canonification in a Wildcard MX
		environment, try an MX lookup of the hostname without the
		default domain appended.  Problem noted by Olaf Seibert of
		Polderland Language & Speech Technology.
	Reject SMTP RCPT To: commands with only comments (i.e.
		'RCPT TO: (comment)'.  Problem noted by Earle Ake of
		Hassler Communication Systems Technology, Inc.
	Handle any number of %s in the LDAP filter spec.  Patch from
		Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Clear ldapx open timeouts even if the map open failed to prevent
		a segmentation fault.  Patch from Wayne Knowles of the
		National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research Ltd.
	Do not syslog envelope clone messages when using address
		verification (-bv).  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the
		Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Continue to perform queue runs while in daemon mode even if the
		daemon is rejecting connections due to a disk full
		condition.  Problem noted by JR Oldroyd of TerraNet
		Internet Services.
	Include full filename on installation of the sendmail.hf file
		in case the $HFDIR directory does not exist.  Problem
		noted by Josef Svitak of Montana State University.
	Close all maps when exiting the process with one exception.
		Berkeley DB can use internal shared memory locking for
		its memory pool.  Closing a map opened by another process
		will interfere with the shared memory and locks of the
		parent process leaving things in a bad state.  For
		Berkeley DB, only close the map if the current process
		is also the one that opened the map, otherwise only close
		the map file descriptor.  Thanks to Yoseff Francus of
		Collective Technologies for volunteering his system for
		extended testing.
	Avoid null pointer dereference on XDEBUG output for SMTP reply
		failures.  Problem noted by Carlos Canau of EUnet Portugal.
	On mailq and hoststat listings being piped to another program, such
		as more, if the pipe closes (i.e., the user quits more),
		stop sending output and exit.  Patch from Allan E Johannesen
		of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	In accordance with the documentation, LDAP map lookup failures
		are now considered temporary failures instead of permanent
		failures unless the -t flag is used in the map definition.
		Problem noted by Booker Bense of Stanford University and
		Eric C. Hagberg of Morgan Stanley.
	Fix by one error reporting on long alias names.  Problem noted by
		H. Paul Hammann of the Missouri Research and Education
		Network.
	Fix DontBlameSendmail=IncludeFileInUnsafeDirPath behavior.  Problem
		noted by Barry S. Finkel of Argonne National Laboratory.
	When automatically converting from 8 bit to quoted printable MIME,

8.9.0/8.9.0	1998/05/19
	SECURITY: To prevent users from reading files not normally
		readable, sendmail will no longer open forward, :include:,
		class, ErrorHeader, or HelpFile files located in unsafe
		(i.e., group or world writable) directory paths.  Sites
		which need the ability to override security can use the
		DontBlameSendmail option.  See the README file for more
		information.
	SECURITY: Problems can occur on poorly managed systems, specifically,
		if maps or alias files are in world writable directories.
		This fixes the change added to 8.8.6 to prevent links in these
		world writable directories.
	SECURITY: Make sure ServiceSwitchFile option file is not a link if
		it is in a world writable directory.
	SECURITY: Never pass a tty to a mailer -- if a mailer can get at the
		tty it may be able to push bytes back to the senders input.
		Unfortunately this breaks -v mode.  Problem noted by
		Wietse Venema of the Global Security Analysis Lab at
		IBM T.J. Watson Research.
	SECURITY: Empty group list if DontInitGroups is set to true to
		prevent program deliveries from picking up extra group
		privileges.  Problem reported by Wolfgang Ley of DFN-CERT.
	SECURITY: The default value for DefaultUser is now set to the uid and
		gid of the first existing user mailnull, sendmail, or daemon
		that has a non-zero uid.  If none of these exist, sendmail
		reverts back to the old behavior of using uid 1 and gid 1.
		This is a security problem for Linux which has chosen that
		uid and gid for user bin instead of daemon.  If DefaultUser
		is set in the configuration file, that value overrides this
		default.
	SECURITY: Since 8.8.7, the check for non-setuid binaries
		interfered with setting an alternate group id for the
		RunAsUser option.  Problem noted by Randall Winchester of
		the University of Maryland.
	Add support for Berkeley DB 2.X.  Based on patch from John Kennedy
		of Cal State University, Chico.
	Remove support for OLD_NEWDB (pre-1.5 version of Berkeley DB).  Users
		which previously defined OLD_NEWDB=1 must now upgrade to the
		current version of Berkeley DB.
	Added support for regular expressions using the new map class regex.
		From Jan Krueger of Unix-AG of University of Hannover.
	Support for BIND 8.1.1's hesiod for hesiod maps and hesiod
		UserDatabases from Randall Winchester of the University
		of Maryland.
	Allow any shell for user shell on program deliveries on V1
		configurations for backwards compatibility on machines which
		do not have getusershell().  Fix from John Beck of Sun
		Microsystems.
	On operating systems which change the process title by reusing the
		argument vector memory, sendmail could corrupt memory if the
		last argument was either "-q" or "-d".  Problem noted by
		Frank Langbein of the University of Stuttgart.
	Support Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP) between sendmail and
		mail.local on the F=z flag.
	Macro-expand the contents of the ErrMsgFile.  Previously this was
		only done if you had magic characters (0x81) to indicate
		macro expansion.  Now $x will be expanded.  This means that
		real dollar signs have to be backslash escaped.
	TCP Wrappers expects "unknown" in the hostname argument if the
		reverse DNS lookup for the incoming connection fails.
		Problem noted by Randy Grimshaw of Syracuse University and
		Wietse Venema of the Global Security Analysis Lab at
		IBM T.J. Watson Research.
	DSN success bounces generated from an invocation of sendmail -t
		would be sent to both the sender and MAILER-DAEMON.
		Problem noted by Claus Assmann of
		Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel.
	Avoid "Error 0" messages on delivery mailers which exit with a
		valid exit value such as EX_NOPERM.  Fix from Andreas Luik
		of ISA Informationssysteme GmbH.
	Tokenize $&x expansions on right hand side of rules.  This eliminates
		the need to use tricks like $(dequote "" $&{client_name} $)
		to cause the ${client_name} macro to be properly tokenized.
	Add the MaxRecipientsPerMessage option: this limits the number of
		recipients that will be accepted in a single SMTP
		transaction.  After this number is reached, sendmail
		starts returning "452 Too many recipients" to all RCPT
		commands.  This can be used to limit the number of recipients
		per envelope (in particular, to discourage use of the server
		for spamming).  Note: a better approach is to restrict
		relaying entirely.
	Fixed pointer initialization for LDAP lmap struct, fixed -s option
		to ldapx map and added timeout for ldap_open call to
		avoid hanging sendmail in the event of hung LDAP servers.
		Patch from Booker Bense of Stanford University.
	Allow multiple -qI, -qR, or -qS queue run limiters.  For example,
		'-qRfoo -qRbar' would deliver mail to recipients with foo or
		bar in their address.  Patch from Allan E Johannesen of
		Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
	The bestmx map will now return a list of the MX servers for a host if
		passed a column delimiter via the -z map flag.  This can be
		used to check if the server is an MX server for the recipient
		of a message.  This can be used to help prevent relaying.
		Patch from Mitchell Blank Jr of Exec-PC.
	Mark failures for the *file* mailer and return bounce messages to the
		sender for those failures.
	Prevent bogus syslog timestamps on errors in sendmail.cf by
		preserving the TZ environment variable until TimeZoneSpec
		has been determined.  Problem noted by Ralf Hildebrandt of
		Technical University of Braunschweig.  Patch from Per Hedeland
		of Ericsson.
	Print test input in address test mode when input is not from the tty
		when the -v flag is given (i.e., sendmail -bt -v) to make
		output easier to decipher.  Problem noted by Aidan Nichol
		of Procter & Gamble.
	The LDAP map -s flag was not properly parsed and the error message
		given included the remainder of the arguments instead of
		solely the argument in error.  Problem noted by Aidan Nichol
		of Procter & Gamble.
	New DontBlameSendmail option.  This option allows administrators to
		bypass some of sendmail's file security checks at the expense
		of system security.  This should only be used if you are
		absolutely sure you know the consequences.  The available
		DontBlameSendmail options are:
			Safe
			AssumeSafeChown
			ClassFileInUnsafeDirPath
			ErrorHeaderInUnsafeDirPath
			GroupWritableDirPathSafe

	New DontProbeInterfaces option to turn off the inclusion of all the
		interface names in $=w on startup.  In particular, if you
		have lots of virtual interfaces, this option will speed up
		startup.  However, unless you make other arrangements, mail
		sent to those addresses will be bounced.
	Automatically create alias databases if they don't exist and
		AutoRebuildAliases is set.
	Add PrivacyOptions=noetrn flag to disable the SMTP ETRN command.
		Suggested by Christophe Wolfhugel of the Institut Pasteur.
	Add PrivacyOptions=noverb flag to disable the SMTP VERB command.
	When determining the client host name ($&{client_name} macro), do
		a forward (A) DNS lookup on the result of the PTR lookup
		and compare results.  If they differ or if the PTR lookup
		fails, &{client_name} will contain the IP address
		surrounded by square brackets (e.g., [127.0.0.1]).
	New map flag: -Tx appends "x" to lookups that return temporary failure
		(i.e, it is like -ax for the temporary failure case, in
		contrast to the success case).
	New syntax to do limited checking of header syntax.  A config line
		of the form:
			HHeader: $>Ruleset
		causes the indicated Ruleset to be invoked on the Header
		when read.  This ruleset works like the check_* rulesets --
		that is, it can reject mail on the basis of the contents.
	Limit the size of the HELO/EHLO parameter to prevent spammers
		from hiding their connection information in Received:
		headers.
	When SingleThreadDelivery is active, deliveries to locked hosts
		are skipped.  This will cause the delivering process to
		try the next MX host or queue the message if no other MX
		hosts are available.  Suggested by Alexander Litvin.
	The [FILE] mailer type now delivers to the file specified in the
		A= equate of the mailer definition instead of $u.  It also
		obeys all of the F= mailer flags such as the MIME
		7/8 bit conversion flags.  This is useful for defining
		a mailer which delivers to the same file regardless of the
		recipient (e.g., 'A=FILE /dev/null' to discard unwanted mail).
	Do not assume the identity of a remote connection is root@localhost
		if the remote connection closes the socket before the
		remote identity can be queried.
	Change semantics of the F=S mailer flag back to 8.7.5 behavior.
		Some mailers, including procmail, require that the real
		uid is left unchanged by sendmail.  Problem noted by Per
		Hedeland of Ericsson.
	No longer is the src/obj*/Makefile selected from a large list -- it
		is now generated using the information in BuildTools/OS/ --
		some of the details are determined dynamically via
		BuildTools/bin/configure.sh.
	The other programs in the sendmail distribution -- mail.local,
		mailstats, makemap, praliases, rmail, and smrsh -- now use
		the new Build method which creates an operating system
		specific Makefile using the information in BuildTools.
	Make 4xx reply codes to the SMTP MAIL command be non-sticky (i.e.,
		a failure on one message won't affect future messages to the
		same host).  This is necessary if the remote host sends
		a 451 error if the domain of the sender does not resolve
		as is common in anti-spam configurations.  Problem noted
		by Mitchell Blank Jr of Exec-PC.
	New "discard" mailer for check_* rulesets and header checking
		rulesets.  If one of the above rulesets resolves to the
		$#discard mailer, the commands will be accepted but the
		message will be completely discarded after it is accepting.
		This means that even if only one of the recipients
		resolves to the $#discard mailer, none of the recipients
		will receive the mail.  Suggested by Brian Kantor.
	All but the last cloned envelope of a split envelope were queued
		instead of being delivered.  Problem noted by John Caruso
		of CNET: The Computer Network.
	Fix deadlock situation in persistent host status file locking.
	Syslog an error if a user forward file could not be read due to
		an error.  Patch from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	Use the first name returned on machine lookups when canonifying a
		hostname via NetInfo.  Patch from Timm Wetzel of GWDG.
	Clear the $&{client_addr}, $&{client_name}, and $&{client_port}
		macros when delivering a bounce message to prevent
		rejection by a check_compat ruleset which uses these macros.
		Problem noted by Jens Hamisch of AgiX Internetservices GmbH.
	If the check_relay ruleset resolves to the the error mailer, the
		error in the $: portion of the resolved triplet is used
		in the rejection message given to the remote machine.
		Suggested by Scott Gifford of The Internet Ramp.
	Set the $&{client_addr}, $&{client_name}, and $&{client_port} macros
		before calling the check_relay ruleset.  Suggested by Scott
		Gifford of The Internet Ramp.
	Sendmail would get a segmentation fault if a mailer exited with an
		exit code of 79.  Problem noted by Aaron Schrab of ExecPC
		Internet.  Fix from Christophe Wolfhugel of the Pasteur
		Institute.
	Separate snprintf/vsnprintf routines into separate file for use by
		mail.local.
	Allow multiple map lookups on right hand side, e.g.,
		R$*	$( host $1 $) $| $( passwd $1 $).  Patch from
		Christophe Wolfhugel of the Pasteur Institute.
	Properly generate success DSN messages if requested for aliases
		which have owner- aliases.  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta
		of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Properly display delayed-expansion macros ($&{macroname}) in
		address test mode (-bt).  Problem noted by Bryan Costales
		of InfoBeat, Inc.
	-qR could sometimes match names incorrectly.  Problem noted by
		Lutz Euler of Lavielle EDV Systemberatung GmbH & Co.
	Include a magic number and version in the StatusFile for the
		mailstats command.
	Record the number of rejected and discarded messages in the
		StatusFile for display by the mailstats command.  Patch
		from Randall Winchester of the University of Maryland.
	IDENT returns where the OSTYPE field equals "OTHER" now list the
		user portion as IDENT:username@site instead of
		username@site to differentiate the two.  Suggested by
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Enforce timeout for LDAP queries.  Patch from Per Hedeland of
		Ericsson.
	Change persistent host status filename substitution so '/' is
		replaced by ':' instead of '|' to avoid clashes.  Also
		avoid clashes with hostnames with leading dots.  Fix from
		Mitchell Blank Jr. of Exec-PC.
	If the system lock table is full, only attempt to create a new
		queue entry five times before giving up.  Previously, it
		was attempted indefinitely which could cause the partition
		to run out of inodes.  Problem noted by Suzie Weigand of
		Stratus Computer, Inc.
	In verbose mode, warn if the sendmail.cf version is less than the
		currently supported version.
	Sorting for QueueSortOrder=host is now case insensitive.  Patch
		from Randall S. Winchester of the University of Maryland.
	Properly quote a full name passed via the -F command line option,
		the Full-Name: header, or the NAME environment variable if
		it contains characters which must be quoted.  Problem noted
		by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Avoid possible race condition that unlocked a mail job before
		releasing the transcript file on systems that use flock(2).
		In some cases, this might result in a "Transcript Unavailable"
		message in error bounces.
	Accept SMTP replies which contain only a reply code and no
		accompanying text.  Problem noted by Fernando Fraticelli of
		Digital Equipment Corporation.
	Portability:
		AIX 4.1 uses int for SOCKADDR_LEN_T from Motonori Nakamura

	CONFIG: Increment version number of config file.
	CONFIG: add DATABASE_MAP_TYPE to set the default type of database
		map for the various maps.  The default is hash.  Patch from
		Robert Harker of Harker Systems.
	CONFIG: new confEBINDIR m4 variable for defining the executable
		directory for certain programs.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(local_lmtp) to use the new LMTP support for
		local mail delivery.  By the default, /usr/libexec/mail.local
		is used.  This is expected to be the mail.local shipped
		with 8.9 which is LMTP capable.  The path is based on the
		new confEBINDIR m4 variable.
	CONFIG: Use confEBINDIR in determining path to smrsh for
		FEATURE(smrsh).  Note that this changes the default from
		/usr/local/etc/smrsh to /usr/libexec/smrsh.  To obtain the
		old path for smrsh, use FEATURE(smrsh, /usr/local/etc/smrsh).
	CONFIG: DOMAIN(generic) changes the default confFORWARD_PATH to
		include $z/.forward.$w+$h and $z/.forward+$h which allow
		the user to setup different .forward files for
		user+detail addressing.
	CONFIG: add confMAX_RCPTS_PER_MESSAGE, confDONT_PROBE_INTERFACES,
		and confDONT_BLAME_SENDMAIL to set MaxRecipientsPerMessage,
		DontProbeInterfaces, and DontBlameSendmail options.
	CONFIG: by default do not allow relaying (that is, accepting mail
		from outside your domain and sending it to another host
		outside your domain).
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(promiscuous_relay) to allow mail relaying from
		any site to any site.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(relay_entire_domain) allows any host in your
		domain as defined by the 'm' class ($=m) to relay.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(relay_based_on_MX) to allow relaying based on
		the MX records of the host portion of an incoming recipient.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(access_db) which turns on the access database
		feature.  This database gives you the ability to allow
		or refuse to accept mail from specified domains for
		administrative reasons.  By default, names that are listed
		as "OK" in the access db are domain names, not host names.
	CONFIG: new confCR_FILE m4 variable for defining the name of the file
		used for class 'R'.  Defaults to /etc/mail/relay-domains.
	CONFIG: new command RELAY_DOMAIN(domain) and RELAY_DOMAIN_FILE(file)
		to add items to class 'R' ($=R) for hosts allowed to relay.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(relay_hosts_only) to change the behavior
		of FEATURE(access_db) and class 'R' to lookup individual
		host names only.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(loose_relay_check).  Normally, if a recipient
		using % addressing is used, e.g.  user%site@othersite,
		and othersite is in class 'R', the check_rcpt ruleset
		will strip @othersite and recheck user@site for relaying.
		This feature changes that behavior.  It should not be
		needed for most installations.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(relay_local_from) to allow relaying if the
		domain portion of the mail sender is a local host.  This
		should only be used if absolutely necessary as it opens
		a window for spammers.  Patch from Randall S. Winchester of
		the University of Maryland.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(blacklist_recipients) turns on the ability to
		block incoming mail destined for certain recipient
		usernames, hostnames, or addresses.
	CONFIG: By default, MAIL FROM: commands in the SMTP session will be
		refused if the host part of the argument to MAIL FROM: cannot
		be located in the host name service (e.g., DNS).
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(accept_unresolvable_domains) accepts
		unresolvable hostnames in MAIL FROM: SMTP commands.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(accept_unqualified_senders) accepts
		MAIL FROM: senders which do not include a domain.
	CONFIG: new FEATURE(rbl) Turns on rejection of hosts found in the
		Realtime Blackhole List.  You can specify the RBL name
		server to contact by specifying it as an optional argument.
		The default is rbl.maps.vix.com.  For details, see
		http://maps.vix.com/rbl/.
	CONFIG: Call Local_check_relay, Local_check_mail, and
		Local_check_rcpt from check_relay, check_mail, and
		check_rcpt.  Users with local rulesets should place the
		rules using LOCAL_RULESETS.  If a Local_check_* ruleset
		returns $#OK, the message is accepted.  If the ruleset
		returns a mailer, the appropriate action is taken, else
		the return of the ruleset is ignored.
	CONFIG: CYRUS_MAILER_FLAGS now includes the /:| mailer flags by
		default to support file, :include:, and program deliveries.
	CONFIG: Remove the default for confDEF_USER_ID so the binary can
		pick the proper default value.  See the SECURITY note
		above for more information.
	CONFIG: FEATURE(nodns) now warns the user that the feature is a
		no-op.  Patch from Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	CONFIG: OSTYPE(osf1) now sets DefaultUserID (confDEF_USER_ID) to
		daemon since DEC's /bin/mail will drop the envelope
		sender if run as mailnull.  See the Digital UNIX section
		of src/README for more information.  Problem noted by
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	CONFIG: .cf files are now stored in the same directory with the
		.mc files instead of in the obj directory.
	CONFIG: New options confSINGLE_LINE_FROM_HEADER,
		confALLOW_BOGUS_HELO, and confMUST_QUOTE_CHARS for
		setting SingleLineFromHeader, AllowBogusHELO, and
		MustQuoteChars respectively.
	MAIL.LOCAL: support -l flag to run LMTP on stdin/stdout.  This
		SMTP-like protocol allows detailed reporting of delivery
		status on a per-user basis.  Code donated by John Myers of
		CMU (now of Netscape).
	MAIL.LOCAL: HP-UX support from Randall S. Winchester of the
		University of Maryland.  NOTE: mail.local is not
		compatible with the stock HP-UX mail format.  Be sure to
		read mail.local/README.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Prevent other mail delivery agents from stealing a
		mailbox lock.  Patch from Randall S. Winchester of the
		University of Maryland.
	MAIL.LOCAL: glibc portability from John Kennedy of Cal State
		University, Chico.
	MAIL.LOCAL: IRIX portability from Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	MAILSTATS: Display the number of rejected and discarded messages
		in the StatusFile.  Patch from Randall Winchester of the
		University of Maryland.
	MAKEMAP: New -s flag to ignore safety checks on database map files
		such as linked files in world writable directories.
	MAKEMAP: Add support for Berkeley DB 2.X.  Remove OLD_NEWDB support.
	PRALIASES: Add support for Berkeley DB 2.X.
	PRALIASES: Do not automatically include NDBM support.  Problem
		noted by Ralf Hildebrandt of the Technical University of
		Braunschweig.
	RMAIL: Improve portability for other platforms.  Patches from
		Randall S. Winchester of the University of Maryland and
		Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

8.8.8/8.8.8	1997/10/24
	If the check_relay ruleset failed, the relay= field was logged
		incorrectly.  Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish
		Meteorological Institute.
	If /usr/tmp/dead.letter already existed, sendmail could not
		add additional bounces to it.  Problem noted by Thomas J.
		Arseneault of SRI International.
	If an SMTP mailer used a non-standard port number for the outgoing
		connection, it would be displayed incorrectly in verbose mode.
		Problem noted by John Kennedy of Cal State University, Chico.
	Log the ETRN parameter specified by the client before altering them
		to internal form.  Suggested by Bob Kupiec of GES-Verio.
	EXPN and VRFY SMTP commands on malformed addresses were logging as
		User unknown with bogus delay= values.  Change them to log
		the same as compliant addresses.  Problem noted by Kari E.
		Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Ignore the debug resolver option unless using sendmail debug trace
		option for resolver.  Problem noted by Greg Nichols of Wind
		River Systems.
	If SingleThreadDelivery was enabled and the remote server returned a
		protocol error on the DATA command, the connection would be
		closed but the persistent host status file would not be
		unlocked so other sendmail processes could not deliver to
		that host.  Problem noted by Peter Wemm of DIALix.
	If queueing up a message due to an expensive mailer, don't increment
		the number of delivery attempts or set the last delivery
		attempt time so the message will be delivered on the next
		queue run regardless of MinQueueAge.  Problem noted by
		Brian J. Coan of the Institute for Global Communications.
	Authentication warnings of "Processed from queue _directory_" and
		"Processed by _username_ with -C _filename_" would be logged
		with the incorrect timestamp.  Problem noted by Kari E. Hurtta
		of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Use a better heuristic for detecting GDBM.
	Log null connections on dropped connections.  Problem noted by
		Jon Lewis of Florida Digital Turnpike.
	If class dbm maps are rebuilt, sendmail will now detect this and
		reopen the map.  Previously, they could give stale
		results during a single message processing (but would
		recover when the next message was received).  Fix from
		Joe Pruett of Q7 Enterprises.
	Do not log failures such as "User unknown" on -bv or SMTP VRFY
		requests.  Problem noted by Kari E. Hurtta of the
		Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Do not send a bounce message back to the sender regarding bad
		recipients if the SMTP connection is dropped before the
		message is accepted.  Problem noted by Kari E. Hurtta of the
		Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Use "localhost" instead of "[UNIX: localhost]" when connecting to
		sendmail via a UNIX pipe.  This will allow rulesets using
		$&{client_name} to process without sending the string through
		dequote.  Problem noted by Alan Barrett of Internet Africa.
	A combination of deferred delivery mode, a double bounce situation,
		and the inability to save a bounce message to
		/var/tmp/dead.letter would cause sendmail to send a bounce
		to postmaster but not remove the offending envelope from the
		queue causing it to create a new bounce message each time the
		queue was run.  Problem noted by Brad Doctor of Net Daemons
		Associates.
	Remove newlines from hostname information returned via DNS.  There are
		no known security implications of newlines in hostnames as
		sendmail filters newlines in all vital areas; however, this
		could cause confusing error messages.
	Starting with sendmail 8.8.6, mail sent with the '-t' option would be
		rejected if any of the specified addresses were bad.  This
		behavior was modified to only reject the bad addresses and not
		the entire message.  Problem noted by Jozsef Hollosi of
		SuperNet, Inc.
	Use Timeout.fileopen when delivering mail to a file.  Suggested by
		Bryan Costales of InfoBeat, Inc.
	Display the proper Final-Recipient on DSN messages for non-SMTP
		mailers.  Problem noted by Kari E. Hurtta of the
		Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	An error in calculating the available space in the list of addresses
		for logging deliveries could cause an address to be silently
		dropped.
	Include the initial user environment if sendmail is restarted via
		a HUP signal.  This will give room for the process title.
		Problem noted by Jon Lewis of Florida Digital Turnpike.
	Mail could be delivered without a body if the machine does not
		support flock locking and runs out of processes during
		delivery.  Fix from Chuck Lever of the University of Michigan.
	Drop recipient address from 251 and 551 SMTP responses per RFC 821.
		Problem noted by Kari E. Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	Make sure non-rebuildable database maps are opened before the
		rebuildable maps (i.e., alias files) in case the database maps
		are needed for verifying the left hand side of the aliases.
		Problem noted by Lloyd Parkes of Victoria University.
	Make sure sender RFC822 source route addresses are alias expanded for
		bounce messages.  Problem noted by Juergen Georgi of
		RUS University of Stuttgart.
	Minor lint fixes.
	Return a temporary error instead of a permanent error if an LDAP map
		search returns an error.  This will allow sequenced maps which
		use other LDAP servers to be checked.  Fix from Booker Bense
		of Stanford University.
	When automatically converting from quoted printable to 8bit text do
		not pad bare linefeeds with a space.  Problem noted by Theo
		Nolte of the University of Technology Aachen, Germany.
	Portability:
		Non-standard C compilers may have had a problem compiling
			conf.c due to a standard C external declaration of
			setproctitle().  Problem noted by Ted Roberts of
			Electronic Data Systems.
		AUX: has a broken O_EXCL implementation.  Reported by Jim
			Jagielski of jaguNET Access Services.
		BSD/OS: didn't compile if HASSETUSERCONTEXT was defined.
		Digital UNIX: Digital UNIX (and possibly others) moves
			loader environment variables into the loader memory
			area.  If one of these environment variables (such as
			LD_LIBRARY_PATH) was the last environment variable,
			an invalid memory address would be used by the process
			title routine causing memory corruption.  Problem
			noted by Sam Hartman of Mesa Internet Systems.
		GNU libc: uses an enum for _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED which caused
			chownsafe() to always return 0 even if the OS does
			not permit file giveaways.  Problem noted by
			Yasutaka Sumi of The University of Tokyo.
		IRIX6: Syslog buffer size set to 512 bytes.  Reported by
			Gerald Rinske of Siemens Business Services VAS.
		Linux: Pad process title with NULLs.  Problem noted by
			Jon Lewis of Florida Digital Turnpike.
		SCO OpenServer 5.0: SIOCGIFCONF ioctl call returns an
			incorrect value for the number of interfaces.
			Problem noted by Chris Loelke of JetStream Internet
			Services.
		SINIX: Update for Makefile and syslog buffer size from Gerald
			Rinske of Siemens Business Services VAS.
		Solaris: Make sure HASGETUSERSHELL setting for SunOS is not
			used on a Solaris machine.  Problem noted by
			Stephen Ma of Jtec Pty Limited.
		CONFIG: SINIX: Update from Gerald Rinske of Siemens Business
			Services VAS.
	MAKEMAP: Use a better heuristic for detecting GDBM.
	CONTRIB: expn.pl: Updated version from the author, David Muir Sharnoff.
	OP.ME: Document the F=i mailer flag.  Problem noted by Per Hedeland of
			Ericsson.

8.8.7/8.8.7	1997/08/03
	If using Berkeley DB on systems without O_EXLOCK (open a file with
		an exclusive lock already set -- i.e., almost all systems
		except 4.4-BSD derived systems), the initial attempt at
		rebuilding aliases file if the database didn't already
		exist would fail.  Patch from Raymund Will of LST Software
		GmbH.
	Bogus incoming SMTP commands would reset the SMTP conversation.
		Problem noted by Fredrik Jnsson of the Royal Institute
		of Technology, Stockholm.
	Since TCP Wrappers includes setenv(), unsetenv(), and putenv(),
		some environments could give "multiple definitions" for these
		routines during compilation.  If using TCP Wrappers, assume
		that these routines are included as though they were in the
		C library.  Patch from Robert La Ferla.
	When a NEWDB database map was rebuilt at the same time it was being
		used by a queue run, the maps could be left locked for the
		duration of the queue run, causing other processes to hang.
		Problem noted by Kendall Libby of Shore.NET.
	In some cases, NoRecipientAction=add-bcc was being ignored, so the
		mail was passed on without any recipient header.  This could
		cause problems downstream.  Problem noted by Xander Jansen
		of SURFnet ExpertiseCentrum.
	Give error when GDBM is used with sendmail.  GDBM's locking and
		linking of the .dir and .pag files interferes with sendmail's
		locking and security checks.  Problems noted by Fyodor
		Yarochkin of the Kyrgyz Republic FreeNet.
	Don't fsync qf files if SuperSafe option is not set.
	Avoid extra calls to gethostbyname for addresses for which a
		gethostbyaddr found no value.  Also, ignore any returns
		from gethostbyaddr that look like a dotted quad.
	If PTR lookup fails when looking up an SMTP peer, don't tag it as
		"may be forged", since at the network level we pretty much
		have to assume that the information is good.
	In some cases, errors during an SMTP session could leave files
		open or locked.
	Better handling of missing file descriptors (0, 1, 2) on startup.
	Better handling of non-setuid binaries -- avoids certain obnoxious
		errors during testing.
	Errors in file locking of NEWDB maps had the incorrect file name
		printed in the error message.
	If the AllowBogusHELO option were set and an EHLO with a bad or
		missing parameter were issued, the EHLO behaved like a HELO.
	Load limiting never kicked in for incoming SMTP transactions if the
		DeliveryMode=background and any recipient was an alias or
		had a .forward file.  From Nik Conwell of Boston University.
	On some non-Posix systems, the decision of whether chown(2) permits
		file giveaway was undefined.  From Tetsu Ushijima of the
		Tokyo Institute of Technology.
	Fix race condition that could cause the body of a message to be
		lost (so only the header was delivered).  This only occurs
		on systems that do not use flock(2), and only when a queue
		runner runs during a critical section in another message
		delivery.  Based on a patch from Steve Schweinhart of
		Results Computing.
	If a qf file was found in a mail queue directory that had a problem
		(wrong ownership, bad format, etc.) and the file name was
		exactly MAXQFNAME bytes long, then instead of being tried
		once, it would be tried on every queue run.  Problem noted
		by Bryan Costales of Mercury Mail.
	If the system supports an st_gen field in the status structure,
		include it when reporting that a file has changed after open.
		This adds a new compile flag, HAS_ST_GEN (0/1 option).
		This out to be checked as well as reported, since it is
		theoretically possible for an attacker to remove a file after
		it is opened and replace it with another file that has the
		same i-number, but some filesystems (notably AFS) return
		garbage in this field, and hence always look like the file
		has changed.  As a practical matter this is not a security
		problem, since the files can be neither hard nor soft links,
		and on no filesystem (that I am aware of) is it possible to
		have two files on the same filesystem with the same i-number
		simultaneously.
	Delete the root Makefile from the distribution -- it is only for
		use internally, and does not work at customer sites.
	Fix botch that caused the second MAIL FROM: command in a single
		transaction to clear the entire transaction.  Problem
		noted by John Kennedy of Cal State University, Chico.
	Work properly on machines that have _PATH_VARTMP defined without
		a trailing slash.  (And a pox on vendors that decide to
		ignore the established conventions!)  Problem noted by
		Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Internal changes to make it easier to add another protocol family
		(intended for IPv6).  Patches are from John Kennedy of
		CSU Chico.
	In certain cases, 7->8 bit MIME decoding of Base64 text could leave
		an extra space at the beginning of some lines.  Problem
		noted by Charles Karney of Princeton University; fix based
		on a patch from Christophe Wolfhugel.
	Portability:
		Allow _PATH_VENDOR_CF to be set in Makefile for consistency
			with the _Sendmail_ book, 2nd edition.  Note that
			the book is actually wrong: _PATH_SENDMAILCF should
			be used instead.
		AIX 3.x: Include <sys/select.h>.  Patch from Gene Rackow
			of Argonne National Laboratory.
		OpenBSD from from Paul DuBois of the University of Wisconsin.
		RISC/os 4.0 from Paul DuBois of the University of Wisconsin.
		SunOS: Include <memory.h> to fix warning from util.c.  From
			James Aldridge of EUnet Ltd.
		Solaris: Change STDIR (location of status file) to /etc/mail
			in Makefiles.
		Linux, Dynix, UNICOS: Remove -DNDBM and -lgdbm from
			Makefiles.  Use NEWDB on Linux instead.
		NCR MP-RAS 3.x with STREAMware TCP/IP: SIOCGIFNUM ioctl
			exists but behaves differently than other OSes.
			Add SIOCGIFNUM_IS_BROKEN compile flag to get
			around the problem.  Problem noted by Tom Moore of
			NCR Corp.
		HP-UX 9.x: fix compile warnings for old select API.  Problem
			noted by Tom Smith of Digital Equipment Corp.
		UnixWare 2.x: compile warnings on offsetof macro.  Problem
			noted by Tom Good of the Community Access Information
			Resource Network
		SCO 4.2: compile problems caused by a change in the type of
			the "length" parameters passed to accept, getpeername,
			getsockname, and getsockopt.  Adds new compile flags
			SOCKADDR_SIZE_T and SOCKOPT_SIZE_T.  Problem reported
			by Tom Good of St. Vincent's North Richmond Community
			Mental Health Center Residential Services.
		AIX 4: Use size_t for SOCKADDR_SIZE_T and SOCKOPT_SIZE_T.
			Suggested by Brett Hogden of Rochester Gas & Electric
			Corp.
		Linux: avoid compile problem for versions of <setjmp.h> that
			#define both setjmp and longjmp.  Problem pointed out
			by J.R. Oldroyd of TerraNet.
		CONFIG: SCO UnixWare 2.1: Support for OSTYPE(sco-uw-2.1)
			from Christopher Durham of SCO.
		CONFIG: NEXTSTEP: define confCW_FILE to
			/etc/sendmail/sendmail.cw to match the usual
			configuration.  Patch from Dennis Glatting of
			PlainTalk.
	CONFIG: MAILER(fax) called a program that hasn't existed for a long
		time.  Convert to use the HylaFAX 4.0 conventions.  Suggested
		by Harry Styron.
	CONFIG: Improve sample anti-spam rulesets in cf/cf/knecht.mc.  These
		are the rulesets in use on sendmail.org.
	MAKEMAP: give error on GDBM files.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Make error messages a bit more explicit, for example,
		telling more details on what actually changed when "file
		changed after open".
	CONTRIB: etrn.pl: Ignore comments in Fw files.  Support multiple Fw
		files.
	CONTRIB: passwd-to-alias.pl: Handle 8 bit characters and '-'.
	NEW FILES:

8.8.6/8.8.6	1997/06/14
	    *************************************************************
	    * The extensive assistance of Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI	*
	    * in preparing this release is gratefully appreciated.	*
	    * Sun Microsystems has also provided resources toward	*
	    * continued sendmail development.				*
	    *************************************************************
	SECURITY: A few systems allow an open with the O_EXCL|O_CREAT open
		mode bits set to create a file that is a symbolic link that
		points nowhere.  This makes it possible to create a root
		owned file in an arbitrary directory by inserting the symlink
		into a writable directory after the initial lstat(2) check
		determined that the file did not exist.  The only verified
		example of a system having these odd semantics for O_EXCL
		and symbolic links was HP-UX prior to version 9.07.  Most
		systems do not have the problem, since a exclusive create
		of a file disallows symbolic links.  Systems that have been
		verified to NOT have the problem include AIX 3.x, *BSD,
		DEC OSF/1, HP-UX 9.07 and higher, Linux, SunOS, Solaris,
		and Ultrix.  This is a potential exposure on systems that
		have this bug and which do not have a MAILER-DAEMON alias
		pointing at a legitimate account, since this will cause old
		mail to be dropped in /var/tmp/dead.letter.
	SECURITY: Problems can occur on poorly managed systems, specifically,
		if maps or alias files are in world writable directories.
		If your system has alias maps in writable directories, it
		is potentially possible for an attacker to replace the .db
		(or .dir and .pag) files by symbolic links pointing at
		another database; this can be used either to expose
		information (e.g., by pointing an alias file at /etc/spwd.db
		and probing for accounts), or as a denial-of-service attack
		(by trashing the password database).  The fix disallows
		symbolic links entirely when rebuilding alias files or on
		maps that are in writable directories, and always warns on
		writable directories; 8.9 will probably consider writable
		directories to be fatal errors.  This does not represent an
		exposure on systems that have alias files in unwritable
		system directories.
	SECURITY: disallow .forward or :include: files that are links (hard
		or soft) if the parent directory (or any directory in the
		path) is writable by anyone other than the owner.  This is
		similar to the previous case for user files.  This change
		should not affect most systems, but is necessary to prevent
		an attacker who can write the directory from pointing such
		files at other files that are readable only by the owner.
	SECURITY: Tighten safechown rules: many systems will say that they
		have a safe (restricted to root) chown even on files that
		are mounted from another system that allows owners to give
		away files.  The new rules are very strict, trusting file
		ownership only in those few cases where the system has
		been verified to be at least as paranoid as necessary.
		However, it is possible to relax the rules to partially
		trust the ownership if the directory path is not world or
		group writable.  This might allow someone who has a legitimate
		:include: file (referenced directly from /etc/aliases) to
		become another non-root user if the :include: file is in a
		non-writable directory on an NFS-mounted filesystem where
		the local system says that giveaway is denied but it is
		actually permitted.  I believe this to be a very small set
		of cases.  If in doubt, do not point :include: aliases at
		NFS-mounted filesystems.
	SECURITY: When setting a numeric group id using the RunAsUser option
		(e.g., "O RunAsUser=10:20", the group id would not be set.
		Implicit group ids (e.g., "O RunAsUser=mailnull") or alpha
		group ids (e.g., "O RunAsUser=mailuser:mailgrp") worked fine.
		The user id was still set properly.  Problem noted by Uli
		Pralle of the Technical University of Berlin.
	Save the initial gid set for use when checking for if the
		PrivacyOptions=restrictmailq option is set.  Problem reported
		by Wolfgang Ley of DFN-CERT.
	Make 55x reply codes to the SMTP DATA-"." be non-sticky (i.e., a
		failure on one message won't affect future messages to the
		same host).
	IP source route printing had an "off by one" error that would
		affect any options that came after the route option.  Patch
		from Theo de Raadt.
	The "Message is too large" error didn't successfully bounce the error
		back to the sender.  Problem reported by Stephen More of
		PSI; patch from Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Change SMTP status code 553 to map into Extended code 5.1.0 (instead
		of 5.1.3); it apparently gets used in multiple ways.
		Suggested by John Myers of Portola Communications.
	Fix possible extra null byte generated during collection if errors
		occur at the beginning of the stream.  Patch contributed by
		Andrey A. Chernov and Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	Code changes to avoid possible reentrant call of malloc/free within
		a signal handler.  Problem noted by John Beck of Sun
		Microsystems.
	Move map initialization to be earlier so that check_relay ruleset
		will have the latest version of the map data.  Problem noted
		by Paul Forgey of Metainfo; patch from Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	If there are fatal errors during the collection phase (e.g., message
		too large) don't send the bogus message.
	Avoid "cannot open xfAAA00000" messages when sending to aliases that
		have errors and have owner- aliases.  Problem noted by Michael
		Barber of MTU; fix from Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Avoid null pointer dereference on illegal Boundary= parameters in
		multipart/mixed Content-Type: header.  Problem noted by
		Richard Muirden of RMIT University.
	Always print error messages during newaliases (-bi) even if the
		ErrorMode is not set to "print".  Fix from Gregory Neil
		Shapiro.
	Test mode could core dump if you did a /map lookup in an optional map
		that could not be opened.  Based on a fix from John Beck of
		Sun Microsystems.
	If DNS is misconfigured so that the last MX record tried points to
		a host that does not have an A record, but other MX records
		pointed to something reasonable, don't bounce the message
		with a "host unknown" error.  Note that this should really
		be fixed in the zone file for the domain.  Problem noted by
		Joe Rhett of Navigist, Inc.
	If a map fails (e.g., DNS times out) on all recipient addresses, mark
		the message as having been tried; otherwise the next queue
		run will not realize that this is a second attempt and will
		retry immediately.  Problem noted by Bryan Costales of
		Mercury Mail.
	If the clock is set backwards, and a MinQueueAge is set, no jobs
		will be run until the later setting of the clock is reached.
		"Problem" (I use the term loosely) noted by Eric Hagberg of
		Morgan Stanley.
	If the load average rises above the cutoff threshold (above which
		sendmail will not process the queue at all) during a queue
		run, abort the queue run immediately.  Problem noted by
		Bryan Costales of Mercury Mail.
	The variable queue processing algorithm (based on the message size,
		number of recipients, message precedence, and job age) was
		non-functional -- either the entire queue was processed or
		none of the queue was processed.  The updated algorithm
		does no queue run if a single recipient zero size job will
		not be run.
	If there is a fatal ("panic") message that will cause sendmail to
		die immediately, never hold the error message for future
		printing.
	Force ErrorMode=print in -bt mode so that all errors are printed
		regardless of the setting of the ErrorMode option in the
		configuration file.  Patch from Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	New compile flag HASSTRERROR says that this OS has the strerror(3)
		routine available in one of the libraries.  Use it in conf.h.
	The -m (match only) flag now works on host class maps.
	If class hash or btree maps are rebuilt, sendmail will now detect
		this and reopen the map.  Previously, they could give
		erroneous results during a single message processing
		(but would recover when the next message was received).
	Don't delete zero length queue files when doing queue runs until the
		files are at least ten minutes old.  This avoids a potential
		race condition: the creator creates the qf file, getting back
		a file descriptor.  The queue runner locks it and deletes it
		because it is zero length.  The creator then writes the
		descriptor that is now for a disconnected file, and the
		job goes away.  Based on a suggestion by Bryan Costales.
	When determining the "validated" host name ($_ macro), do a forward
		(A) DNS lookup on the result of the PTR lookup and compare
		results.  If they differ or if the PTR lookup fails, tag the
		address as "may be forged".
	Log null connections (i.e., hosts that connect but do not do any
		substantive activity on the connection before disconnecting;
		"substantive" is defined to be MAIL, EXPN, VRFY, or ETRN.
	Always permit "writes" to /dev/null regardless of the link count.
		This is safe because /dev/null is special cased, and no open
		or write is ever actually attempted.  Patch from Villy Kruse
		of TwinCom.
	If a message cannot be sent because of a 552 (exceeded storage
		allocation) response to the MAIL FROM:<>, and a SIZE= parameter
		was given, don't return the body in the bounce, since there
		is a very good chance that the message will double-bounce.
	Fix possible line truncation if a quoted-printable had an =00 escape
		in the body.  Problem noted by Charles Karney of the Princeton
		Plasma Physics Laboratory.
	Notify flags (e.g., -NSUCCESS) were lost on user+detail addresses.
		Problem noted by Kari Hurtta of the Finnish Meteorological
		Institute.
	The MaxDaemonChildren option wasn't applying to queue runs as
		documented.  Note that this increases the potential denial
		of service problems with this option: an attacker can
		connect many times, and thereby lock out queue runs as well
		as incoming connections.  If you use this option, you should
		run the "sendmail -bd" and "sendmail -q30m" jobs separately
		to avoid this attack.  Failure to limit noted by Matthew
		Dillon of BEST Internet Communications.
	Always give a message in newaliases if alias files cannot be
		opened instead of failing silently.  Suggested by Gregory
		Neil Shapiro.  This change makes the code match the O'Reilly
		book (2nd edition).
	Some older versions of the resolver could return with h_errno == -1
		if no name server could be reached, causing mail to bounce
		instead of queueing.  Treat this like TRY_AGAIN.  Fix from
		John Beck of SunSoft.
	If a :include: file is owned by a user that does not have an entry
		in the passwd file, sendmail could dereference a null pointer.
		Problem noted by Satish Mynam of Sun Microsystems.
	Take precautions to make sure that the SMTP protocol cannot get out
		of sync if (for example) an alias file cannot be opened.
	Fix a possible race condition that can cause a SIGALRM to come in
		immediately after a SIGHUP, causing the new sendmail to die.
	Avoid possible hang on SVr3 systems when doing child reaping.  Patch
		from Villy Kruse of TwinCom.
	Ignore improperly formatted SMTP reply codes.  Previously these were
		partially processed, which could cause confusing error
		returns.
	Fix possible bogus pointer dereference when doing ldapx map lookups
		on some architectures.
	Portability:
		A/UX: from Jim Jagielski of NASA/GSFC.
		glibc: SOCK_STREAM was changed from a #define to an enum,
			thus breaking #ifdef SOCK_STREAM.  Only option seems
			to be to assume SOCK_STREAM if __GNU_LIBRARY__ is
			defined.  Problem reported by A Sun of the University

		Solaris: use SIOCGIFNUM to get the number of interfaces on
			the system rather than guessing at compile time.
			Patch contributed by John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
		Intel Paragon: from Wendy Lin of Purdue University.
		GNU Hurd: from Miles Bader of the GNU project.
		RISC/os 4.50 from Harlan Stenn of PFCS Corporation.
		ISC Unix: wait never returns if SIGCLD signals are blocked.
			Unfortunately releasing them opens a race condition,
			but there appears to be no fix for this.  Patch from
			Gregory Neil Shapiro.
		BIND 8.1 for IPv6 compatibility from John Kennedy.
		Solaris: a bug in strcasecmp caused characters with the

			IRIX Makefile).
		IRIX 6.x: Fix load average computation on 64 bit kernels.
			Problem noted by Eric Hagberg of Morgan Stanley.
	CONFIG: Some canonification was still done for UUCP-like addresses
		even if FEATURE(nocanonify) was set.  Problem pointed out by
		Brian Candler.
	CONFIG: In some cases UUCP mailers wouldn't properly recognize all
		local names as local.  Problem noted by Jeff Polk of BSDI;
		fix provided by Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	CONFIG: The "local:user" syntax entries in mailertables and other
		"mailer:user" syntax locations returned an incorrect value
		for the $h macro.  Problem noted by Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	CONFIG: Retain "+detail" information when forwarding mail to a
		MAIL_HUB, LUSER_RELAY, or LOCAL_RELAY.  Patch from Philip
		Guenther of Gustavus Adolphus College.
	CONFIG: Make sure user+detail works for FEATURE(virtusertable);
		rules are the same as for aliasing.  Based on a patch from
		Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	CONFIG: Break up parsing rules into several pieces; this should
		have no functional change in this release, but makes it
		possible to have better anti-spam rulesets in the future.
	CONFIG: Disallow double dots in host names to avoid having the
		HostStatusDirectory store status under the wrong name.
		In some cases this can be used as a denial-of-service attack.
		Problem noted by Ron Jarrell of Virginia Tech, patch from
		Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	CONFIG: Don't use F=m (multiple recipients per invocation) for
		MAILER(procmail), but do pass F=Pn9 (include Return-Path:,
		don't include From_, and convert to 8-bit).  Suggestions
		from Kimmo Suominen and Roderick Schertler.
	CONFIG: Domains under $=M (specified with MASQUERADE_DOMAIN) were
		being masqueraded as though FEATURE(masquerade_entire_domain)
		was specified, even when it wasn't.
	MAIL.LOCAL: Solaris 2.6 has snprintf.  From John Beck of SunSoft.
	MAIL.LOCAL: SECURITY: check to make sure that an attacker doesn't
		"slip in" a symbolic link between the lstat(2) call and the
		exclusive open.  This is only a problem on System V derived
		systems that allow an exclusive create on files that are
		symbolic links pointing nowhere.
	MAIL.LOCAL: If the final mailbox close() failed, the user id was
		not reset back to root, which on some systems would cause
		later mailboxes to fail.  Also, any partial message would
		not be truncated, which could result in repeated deliveries.
		Problem noted by Bruce Evans via Peter Wemm (FreeBSD
		developers).
	MAKEMAP: Handle cases where O_EXLOCK is #defined to be 0.  A similar
		change to the sendmail map code was made in 8.8.3.  Problem
		noted by Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	MAKEMAP: Give warnings on file problems such as map files that are
		symbolic links; although makemap is not setuid root, it is
		often run as root and hence has the potential for the same
		sorts of problems as alias rebuilds.
	MAKEMAP: Change compilation so that it will link properly on
		NEXTSTEP.
	CONTRIB: etrn.pl: search for Cw as well as Fw lines in sendmail.cf.
		Accept an optional list of arguments following the server
		name for the ETRN arguments to use (instead of $=w).  Other
		miscellaneous bug fixes.  From Christian von Roques via
		John Beck of Sun Microsystems.
	CONTRIB: Add passwd-to-alias.pl, contributed by Kari Hurtta.  This
		Perl script converts GECOS information in the /etc/passwd
		file into aliases, allowing for faster access to full name
		lookups; it is also clever about adding aliases (to root)
		for system accounts.

8.8.5/8.8.5	1997/01/21
	SECURITY: Clear out group list during startup.  Without this, sendmail
		will continue to run with the group permissions of the caller,
		even if RunAsUser is specified.
	SECURITY: Make purgestat (-bH) be root-only.  This is not in response
		to any known attack, but it's best to be conservative.
		Suggested by Peter Wemm of DIALix.
	SECURITY: Fix buffer overrun problem in MIME code that has possible
		security implications.  Patch from Alex Garthwaite of the
		University of Pennsylvania.
	Use of a -f flag with a phrase attached (e.g., "-f 'Full Name <addr>'")
		would truncate the address after "Full".  Although the -f
		syntax is incorrect (since it is in the envelope, it
		shouldn't have comments and full names), the failure mode
		was unnecessarily awful.
	Fix a possible null pointer dereference when converting 8-bit data
		to a 7-bit format.  Problem noted by Jim Hutchins of
		Sandia National Labs and David James of British Telecom.
	Clear out stale state that affected F=9 on SMTP mailers in queue
		runs.  Although this really shouldn't be used (F=9 is for
		final delivery only, and using it on an SMTP mailer makes
		it possible for a message to be converted from 8->7->8->7
		bits several times), it shouldn't have failed with a syserr.
		Problem noted by Eric Hagberg of Morgan Stanley.
	_Really_ fix the multiple :maildrop code in the user database
		module.  Patch from Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Let F lines in the configuration file actually read root-only
		files if the configuration file is safe.  Based on a
		patch from Keith Reynolds of SCO.
	ETRN followed by QUIT would hold the connection open until the queue
		run completed.  Problem noted by Truck Lewis of TDK
		Semiconductor Corp.
	It turns out that despite the documentation, the TCP wrappers library
		does _not_ log rejected connections.  Do the logging ourselves.
		Problem noted by Fletcher Mattox of the University of Texas
		at Austin.
	If sendmail finds a qf file in its queue directory that is an unknown
		version (e.g., when backing out to an old version), the
		error is reported on every queue run.  Change it to only
		give the error once (and rename the qf => Qf).  Patch from
		William A. Gianopoulos of Raytheon Company.
	Start a new session when doing background delivery; currently it
		ignored signals but didn't start a new signal, that caused
		some problems if a background process tried to send mail
		under certain circumstances.  Problem noted by Eric Hagberg
		of Morgan Stanley; fix from Kari Hurtta.
	Simplify test for skipping a queue run to just check if the current
		load average is >= the queueing load average.  Previously
		the check factored in some other parameters that caused it
		to essentially never skip the queue run.  Patch from Bryan
		Costales.
	If the SMTP server is running in "nullserver" mode (that is, it is
		rejecting all commands), start sleeping after MAXBADCOMMAND
		(25) commands; this helps prevent a bad guy from putting
		you into a tight loop as a denial-of-service attack.  Based
		on an e-mail conversation with Brad Knowles of AOL.
	Slow down when too many "light weight" commands have been issued;
		this helps prevent a class of denial-of-service attacks.
		The current values and defaults are:
		    MAXNOOPCOMMANDS	20	NOOP, VERB, ONEX, XUSR
		    MAXHELOCOMMANDS	3	HELO, EHLO
		    MAXVRFYCOMMANDS	6	VRFY, EXPN
		    MAXETRNCOMMANDS	8	ETRN
		These will probably be configurable in a future release.
	On systems that have uid_t typedefed to be an unsigned short, programs
		that had the F=S flag and no U= equate would be invoked with
		the real uid set to 65535 rather than being left unchanged.
	In some cases, NOTIFY=NEVER was not being honored.  Problem noted
		by Steve Hubert of the University of Washington, Seattle.
	Mail that was Quoted-Printable encoded and had a soft line break on
		the last line (i.e., an incomplete continuation) had the last
		line dropped.  Since this appears to be illegal it isn't
		clear what to do with it, but flushing the last line seems
		to be a better "fail soft" approach.  Based on a patch from
		Eric Hagberg.
	If AllowBogusHELO and PrivacyOptions=needmailhelo are both set, a
		bogus HELO command still causes the "Polite people say HELO
		first" error message.  Problem pointed out by Chris Thomas
		of UCLA; patch from John Beck of SunSoft.
	Handle "sendmail -bp -qSfoobar" properly if restrictqrun is set
		in PrivacyOptions.  The -q shouldn't turn this command off.
		Problem noted by Murray Kucherawy of Pacific Bell Internet;
		based on a patch from Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Don't consider SMTP reply codes 452 or 552 (exceeded storage allocation)
		in a DATA transaction to be sticky; these can occur because
		a message is too large, and smaller messages should still go
		through.  Problem noted by Matt Dillon of Best Internet
		Communications.
	In some cases bounces were saved in /var/tmp/dead.letter even if they
		had been successfully delivered to the envelope sender.
		Problem noted Eric Hagberg of Morgan Stanley; solution from
		Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Give better diagnostics on long alias lines.  Based on code contributed
		by Patrick Gosling of the University of Cambridge.
	Increase the number of virtual interfaces that will be probed for
		alternate names.  Problem noted by Amy Rich of Shore.Net.

	CONFIG: It seems that I hadn't gotten the Received: line syntax
		_just_right_ yet.  Tweak it again.  I'll omit the names
		of the "contributors" (quantity two) in this one case.
		As of now, NO MORE DISCUSSION about the syntax of the
		Received: line.
	CONFIG: Although FEATURE(nullclient) uses EXPOSED_USER (class $=E),
		it never inserts that class into the output file.  Fix it
		so it will honor EXPOSED_USER but will _not_ include root
		automatically in this class.  Problem noted by Ronan KERYELL
		of Centre de Recherche en Informatique de l'cole Nationale
		Suprieure des Mines de Paris (CRI-ENSMP).
	CONFIG: Clean up handling of "local:" syntax in relay specifications
		such as LUSER_RELAY.  This change permits the following
		syntaxes:  ``local:'' will send to the same user on the
		local machine (e.g., in a mailertable entry for "host",
		``local:'' will cause an address addressed to user@host to
		go to user on the local machone).  ``local:user'' will send
		to the named user on the local machine.  ``local:user@host''
		is equivalent to ``local:user'' (the host is ignored).  In
		all cases, the original user@host is passed in $@ (i.e., the
		detail information).  Inspired by a report from Michael Fuhr.
	CONFIG: Strip quotes from the first word of an "error:" host
		indication.  This lets you set (for example) the LUSER_RELAY
		to be ``error:\"5.1.1\" Your Message Here''.  Note the use
		of the \" so that the resulting string is properly quoted.
		Problem noted by Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	OP.ME: documentation was inconsistent about whether sendmail did a
		NOOP or a RSET to probe the connection (it does a RSET).
		Inconsistency noted by Deeran Peethamparam.
	OP.ME: insert additional blank pages so it will print properly on
		a duplex printer.  From Matthew Black of Cal State University,
		Long Beach.

8.8.4/8.8.4	1996/12/02
	SECURITY: under some circumstances, an attacker could get additional
		permissions by hard linking to files that were group
		writable by the attacker.  The solution is to disallow any
		files that have hard links -- this will affect .forward,
		:include:, and output files.  Problem noted by Terry
		Kyriacopoulos of Interlog Internet Services.  As a
		workaround, set UnsafeGroupWrites -- always a good idea.
	SECURITY: the TryNullMXList (w) option should not be safe -- if it
		is, it is possible to do a denial-of-service attack on
		MX hosts that rely on the use of the null MX list.  There
		is no danger if you have this option turned off (the default).
		Problem noted by Dan Bernstein.  Also, make the DontInitGroups
		unsafe.  I know of no specific attack against this, although
		a denial-of-service attack is probably possible, but in theory
		you should not be able to safely tweak anything that affects
		the permissions that are used when mail is delivered.
	Purgestat could go into an infinite loop if one of the host status
		directories somehow became empty.  Problem noted by Roy
		Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Processes got "lost" when counting children due to a race condition.
		This caused "proc_list_probe: lost pid" messages to be logged.
		Problem noted by several people.
	On systems with System V SIGCLD child signal semantics (notably AIX
		and HP-UX), mail transactions would print the message "451
		SMTP-MAIL: lost child: No child processes".  Problem noted
		by several people.
	Miscellaneous compiler warnings on picky compilers (or when setting
		gcc to high warning levels).  From Tom Moore of NCR Corp.
	SMTP protocol errors, and most errors on MAIL FROM: lines should
		not be persistent between runs, since they are based on the
		message rather than the host.  Problem noted by Matt Dillon
		of Best Internet Communications.
	The F=7 flag was ignored on SMTP mailers.  Problem noted by Tom Moore
		of NCR (a.k.a., AT&T Global Information Solutions).
	Avoid the possibility of having a child daemon run to completion
		(including closing the SMTP socket) before the parent has
		had a chance to close the socket; this can cause the parent
		to hang for a long time waiting for the socket to drain.
		Patch from Don Lewis of TDK Semiconductor.
	If the fork() failed in a queue run, the queue runners would not be
		rescheduled (so queue runs would stop).  Patch from Don Lewis.
	Some error conditions in ETRN could cause output without an SMTP
		status code.  Problem noted by Don Lewis.
	Multiple :maildrop addresses in the user database didn't work properly.
		Patch from Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Add ".db" automatically onto any user database spec that does not
		already have it; this is for consistency with makemap, the
		K line, and the documentation.  Inconsistency pointed out
		by Roy Mongiovi.
	Allow sendmail to be properly called in nohup mode.  Patch from
		Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	Change ETRN to ignore but still update host status files; previously
		it would ignore them and not save the updated status, which
		caused stale information to be maintained.  Based on a patch
		from Christopher Davis of Kapor Enterprises Inc.  Also, have
		ETRN ignore the MinQueueAge option.
	Patch long term host status to recover more gracefully from an empty
		host status file condition.  Patch from NAKAMURA Motonori
		of Kyoto University.
	Several patches to signal handling code to fix potential race
		conditions from Don Lewis.
	Make it possible to compile with -DDAEMON=0 (previously it had some
		compile errors).  This turns DAEMON, QUEUE, and SMTP into
		0/1 compilation flags.  Note that DAEMON is an obsolete
		compile flag; use NETINET instead.  Solution based on a
		patch from Bryan Costales.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		AIX4: getpwnam() and getpwuid() do a sequential scan of the
			/etc/security/passwd file when called as root.  This

			Patch from Chris Thomas of UCLA/OAC Systems Group.
		SCO 5.x: include -lprot in the Makefile.  Patch from Bill

8.8.3/8.8.3	1996/11/17
	SECURITY: it was possible to get a root shell by lying to sendmail
		about argv[0] and then sending it a signal.  Problem noted
		by Leshka Zakharoff <leshka@leshka.chuvashia.su> on the
		best-of-security list.
	Log sendmail binary version number in "Warning: .cf version level
		(%d) exceeds program functionality (%d) message" -- this
		should make it clearer to people that they are running
		the wrong binary.
	Fix a problem that occurs when you open an SMTP connection and then
		do one or more ETRN commands followed by a MAIL command; at
		the end of the DATA phase sendmail would incorrectly report
		"451 SMTP-MAIL: lost child: No child processes".  Problem
		noted by Eric Bishop of Virginia Tech.
	When doing text-based host canonification (typically /etc/hosts
		lookup), a null host name would match any /etc/hosts entry
		with space at the end of the line.  Problem noted by Steve
		Hubert of the University of Washington, Seattle.
	7 to 8 bit BASE64 MIME conversions could duplicate bits of text.
		Problem reported by Tom Smith of Digital Equipment Corp.
	Increase the size of the DNS answer buffer -- the standard UDP packet
		size PACKETSZ (512) is not sufficient for some nameserver
		answers containing very many resource records.  The resolver
		may also switch to TCP and retry if it detects UDP packet
		overflow.  Also, allow for the fact that the resolver
		routines res_query and res_search return the size of the
		*un*truncated answer in case the supplied answer buffer it
		not big enough to accommodate the entire answer.  Patch from
		Eric Wassenaar.
	Improvements to MaxDaemonChildren code.  If you think you have too
		many children, probe the ones you have to verify that they
		are still around.  Suggested by Jared Mauch of CICnet, Inc.
		Also, do this probe before growing the vector of children
		pids; this previously caused the vector to grow indefinitely
		due to a race condition.  Problem reported by Kyle Jones of
		UUNET.
	On some architectures, <db.h> (from the Berkeley DB library) defines
		O_EXLOCK to zero; this fools the map compilation code into
		thinking that it can avoid race conditions by locking on open.
		Change it to check for O_EXLOCK non-zero.  Problem noted by
		Leif Erlingsson of Data Lege.
	Always call res_init() on startup (if compiled in, of course) to
		allow the sendmail.cf file to tweak resolver flags; without
		it, flag tweaks in ResolverOptions are ignored.  Patch from
		Andrew Sun of Merrill Lynch.
	Improvements to host status printing code.  Suggested by Steve Hubert
		of the University of Washington, Seattle.
	Change MinQueueAge option processing to do the check for the job age
		when reading the queue file, rather than at the end; this
		avoids parsing the addresses, which can do DNS lookups.
		Problem noted by John Beck of InReference, Inc.
	When MIME was being 7->8 bit decoded, "From " lines weren't being
		properly escaped.  Problem noted by Peter Nilsson of the
		University of Linkoping.
	In some cases, sendmail would retain root permissions during queue
		runs even if RunAsUser was set.  Problem noted by Mark
		Thomas of Mark G. Thomas Consulting.
	If the F=l flag was set on an SMTP mailer to indicate that it is
		actually local delivery, and NOTIFY=SUCCESS is specified in
		the envelope, and the receiving SMTP server speaks DSN, then
		the DSN would be both generated locally and propagated to the
		other end.
	The U= mailer field didn't correctly extract the group id if the
		user id was numeric.  Problem noted by Kenneth Herron of
		MCI Telecommunications Communications.
	If a message exceeded the fixed maximum size on input, the body of
		the message was included in the bounce.  Note that this did
		not occur if it exceeded the maximum _output_ size.  Problem
		reported by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		AIX4: 4.1 doesn't have a working setreuid(2); change the
			AIX4 defines to use seteuid(2) instead, which
			works on 4.1 as well as 4.2.  Problem noted by
			Hkan Lindholm of interAF, Sweden.
		AIX4: use tzname[] vector to determine time zone name.
			Patch from NAKAMURA Motonori of Kyoto University.
		MkLinux: add Makefile.Linux.ppc and OSTYPE(mklinux) support.
			Contributed by Paul DuBois <dubois@primate.wisc.edu>.
		Solaris: kstat(3k) support for retrieving the load average.
			This adds the LA_KSTAT definition for LA_TYPE.
			The outline of the implementation was contributed
			by Michael Tokarev of Telecom Service, JSC, Moscow.
		HP-UX 10.0 gripes about the (perfectly legal!) forward
			declaration of struct rusage at the top of conf.h;
			change it to only be included if you are using gcc,
			which is apparently the only compiler that requires
			it in the first place.  Problem noted by Jeff
			Earickson of Colby College.
		IRIX: don't default to using gcc.  IRIX is a civilized
			operating system that comes with a decent compiler
			by default.  Problem noted by Barry Bouwsma and
			Kari Hurtta.
	CONFIG: specify F=9 as default in FEATURE(local_procmail) for
		consistency with other local mailers.  Inconsistency
		pointed out by Teddy Hogeborn <teddy@fukt.hk-r.se>.
	CONFIG: if the "limited best mx" feature is used (to reduce DNS
		overhead) as part of the bestmx_is_local feature, the
		domain part was dropped from the name.  Patch from Steve
		Hubert of the University of Washington, Seattle.
	CONFIG: catch addresses of the form "user@.dom.ain"; these could
		end up being translated to the null host name, which would
		return any entry in /etc/hosts that had a space at the end
		of the line.  Problem noted by Steve Hubert of the
		University of Washington, Seattle.
	CONFIG: add OSTYPE(aix4).  From Michael Sofka of Rensselaer
		Polytechnic Institute.
	MAKEMAP: tweak hash and btree parameters for better performance.
		Patch from Matt Dillon of Best Internet Communications.

8.8.2/8.8.2	1996/10/18
	SECURITY: fix a botch in the 7-bit MIME patch; the previous patch
		changed the code but didn't fix the problem.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		Solaris: Don't use the system getusershell(3); it can
			apparently corrupt the heap in some circumstances.
			Problem found by Ken Pizzini of Spry, Inc.
	OP.ME: document several mailer flags that were accidentally omitted
		from this document.  These flags were F=d, F=j, F=R, and F=9.
	CONFIG: no changes.

8.8.1/8.8.1	1996/10/17
	SECURITY: unset all environment variables that the resolver will
		examine during queue runs and daemon mode.  Problem noted
		by Dan Bernstein of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
	SECURITY: in some cases an illegal 7-bit MIME-encoded text/plain
		message could overflow a buffer if it was converted back
		to 8 bits.  This caused core dumps and has the potential
		for a remote attack.  Problem first noted by Gregory Shapiro
		of WPI.
	Avoid duplicate deliveries of error messages on systems that don't
		have flock(2) support.  Patch from Motonori Nakamura of
		Kyoto University.
	Ignore null FallBackMX (V) options.  If this option is null (as
		opposed to undefined) it can cause "null signature" syserrs
		on illegal host names.
	If a Base64 encoded text/plain message has no trailing newline in
		the encoded text, conversion back to 8 bits will drop the
		final line.  Problem noted by Pierre David.
	If running with a RunAsUser, sendmail would give bogus "cannot
		setuid" (or seteuid, or setreuid) messages on some systems.
		Problem pointed out by Jordan Mendelson of Web Services, Inc.
	Always print error messages in -bv mode -- previously, -bv would
		be absolutely silent on errors if the error mode was sent
		to (say) mail-back.  Problem noted by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	If -qI/R/S is set (or the ETRN command is used), ignore all long
		term host status.  This is necessary because it is common
		to do this when you know a host has just come back up.
	Disallow duplicate HELO/EHLO commands as required by RFC 1651 section
		4.2.  Excessive permissiveness noted by Lee Flight of the
		University of Leicester.
	If a service (such as NIS) is specified as the last entry in the
		service switch, but that service is not compiled in, sendmail
		would return a temporary failure when an entry was not found
		in the map.  This caused the message to be queued instead of
		bouncing immediately.  Problem noted by Harry Edmon of the
		University of Washington.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		Solaris 2.3 had compilation problems in conf.c.  Several
			people pointed this out.
		NetBSD from Charles Hannum of MIT.
		AIX4 improvements based on info from Steve Bauer of South
			Dakota School of Mines & Technology.
	CONFIG: ``error:code message'' syntax was broken in virtusertable.
		Patch from Gil Kloepfer Jr.
	CONFIG: if FEATURE(nocanonify) was specified, hosts in $=M (set
		using MASQUERADE_DOMAIN) were not masqueraded unless they
		were also in $=w.  Problem noted by Zoltan Basti of
		Softec.
	MAIL.LOCAL: patches to compile and link cleanly on AIX.  Based
		on a patch from Eric Hagberg of Morgan Stanley.
	MAIL.LOCAL: patches to compile on NEXTSTEP.  From Patrick Nolan
		of Stanford via Robert La Ferla.

8.8.0/8.8.0	1996/09/26
	Under some circumstances, Bcc: headers would not be properly
		deleted.  Pointed out by Jonathan Kamens of OpenVision.
	Log a warning if the sendmail daemon is invoked without a full
		pathname, which prevents "kill -1" from working.  I was
		urged to put this in by Andrey A. Chernov of DEMOS (Russia).
	Fix small buffer overflow.  Since the data in this buffer was not
		read externally, there was no security problem (and in fact
		probably wouldn't really overflow on most compilers).  Pointed
		out by KIZU takashi of Osaka University.
	Fix problem causing domain literals such as [1.2.3.4] to be ignored
		if a FallbackMXHost was specified in the configuration file
		-- all mail would be sent to the fallback even if the original
		host was accessible.  Pointed out by Munenari Hirayama of
		NSC (Japan).
	A message that didn't terminate with a newline would (sometimes) not
		have the trailing "." added properly in the SMTP dialogue,
		causing SMTP to hang.  Patch from Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	The DaemonPortOptions suboption to bind to a particular address was
		incorrect and nonfunctional due to a misunderstanding of the
		semantics of binding on a passive socket.  Patch from
		NIIBE Yutaka of Mitsubishi Research Institute.
	Increase the number of MX hosts for a single name to 100 to better
		handle the truly huge service providers such as AOL, which
		has 13 at the moment (and climbing).  In order to avoid
		trashing memory, the buffer for all names has only been
		slightly increased in size, to 12.8K from 10.2K -- this means
		that if a single name had 100 MX records, the average size
		of those records could not exceed 128 bytes.  Requested by
		Brad Knowles of America On Line.
	Restore use of IDENT returns where the OSTYPE field equals "OTHER".
		Urged by Dan Bernstein of U.C. Berkeley.
	Print q_statdate and q_specificity in address structure debugging
		printout.
	Expand MCI structure flag bits for debugging output.
	Support IPv6-style domain literals, which can have colons between
		square braces.
	Log open file descriptors for the "cannot dup" messages in deliver();
		this is an attempt to track down a bug that one person seems
		to be having (it may be a Solaris bug!).
	DSN NOTIFY parameters were not properly propagated across queue runs;
		this caused the NOTIFY info to sometimes be lost.  Problem
		pointed out by Claus Assmann of the
		Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel.
	The statistics gathered in the sendmail.st file were too high; in
		some cases failures (e.g., user unknown or temporary failure)
		would count as a delivery as far as the statistics were
		concerned.  Problem noted by Tom Moore of AT&T GIS.
	Systems that don't have flock() would not send split envelopes in
		the initial run.  Problem pointed out by Leonard Zubkoff of
		Dandelion Digital.
	Move buffer overflow checking -- these primarily involve distrusting
		results that may come from NIS and DNS.
	4.4-BSD-derived systems, including FreeBSD, NetBSD, and BSD/OS didn't
		include <paths.h> and hence had the wrong pathnames for a few
		things like /var/tmp.  Reported by Matthew Green.
	Conditions were reversed for the Priority: header, resulting in all
		values being interpreted as non-urgent except for non-urgent,
		which was interpreted as normal.  Patch from Bryan Costales.
	The -o (optional) flag was being ignored on hash and btree maps
		since 8.7.2.  Fix from Bryan Costales.
	Content-Types listed in class "q" will always be encoded as
		Quoted-Printable (or more accurately, will never be encoded
		as base64).  The class can have primary types (e.g., "text")
		or full types (e.g., "text/plain").  Based on a suggestion by
		Marius Olafsson of the University of Iceland.
	Define ${envid} to be the original envelope id (from the ESMTP DSN
		dialogue) so it can be passed to programs in mailers.
	Define ${bodytype} to be the body type (from the -B flag or the
		BODY= ESMTP parameter) so it can be passed to programs in
		mailers.
	Cause the VRFY command to return 252 instead of 250 unless the F=q
		flag is set in the mailer descriptor.  Suggested by John
		Myers of CMU.
	Implement ESMTP ETRN command to flush the queue for a specific host.
		The command takes a host name; data for that host is
		immediately (and asynchronously) flushed.  Because this shares
		the -qR implementation, other hosts may be attempted, but
		there should be no security implications.  Implementation
		from John Beck of InReference, Inc.  See RFC 1985 for details.
	Add three new command line flags to pass in DSN parameters: -V envid
		(equivalent to ENVID=envid on the MAIL command), -R ret
		(equivalent to RET=ret on the MAIL command), and -Nnotify
		(equivalent to NOTIFY=notify on the RCPT command).  Note
		that the -N flag applies to all recipients; there is no way
		to specify per-address notifications on the command line,
		nor is there an equivalent for the ORCPT= per-address
		parameter.
	Restore LogLevel option to be safe (it can only be increased);
		apparently I went into paranoid mode between 8.6 and 8.7
		and made it unsafe.  Pointed out by Dabe Murphy of the
		University of Maryland.
	New logging on log level 15:  all SMTP traffic.  Patches from
		Andrew Gross of San Diego Supercomputer Center.
	NetInfo property value searching code wasn't stopping when it found
		a match.  This was causing the wrong values to be found (and
		had a memory leak).  Found by Bastian Schleuter of TU-Berlin.
	Add new F=0 (zero) mailer flag to turn off MX lookups.  It was pointed
		out by Bill Wisner of Electronics for Imaging that you can't
		use the bracket address form for the MAIL_HUB macro, since
		that causes the brackets to remain in the envelope recipient
		address used for delivery.  The simple fix (stripping off the
		brackets in the config file) breaks the use of IP literal
		addresses.  This flag will solve that problem.
	Add MustQuoteChars option.  This is a list of characters that must
		be quoted if they are found in the phrase part of an address
		(that is, the full name part).  The characters @,;:\()[] are
		always in this list and cannot be removed.  The default is
		this list plus . and ' to match RFC 822.
	Add AllowBogusHELO option; if set, sendmail will allow HELO commands
		that do not include a host name for back compatibility with
		some stupid SMTP clients.  Setting this violates RFC 1123
		section 5.2.5.
	Add MaxDaemonChildren option; if this is set, sendmail will start
		rejecting connections if it has more than this many
		outstanding children accepting mail.  Note that you may
		see more processes than this because of outgoing mail; this
		is for incoming connections only.
	Add ConnectionRateThrottle option.  If set to a positive value, the
		number of incoming SMTP connections that will be permitted
		in a single second is limited to this number.  Connections are
		not refused during this time, just deferred.  The intent is to
		flatten out demand so that load average limiting can kick in.
		It is less radical than MaxDaemonChildren, which will stop
		accepting connections even if all the connections are idle
		(e.g., due to connection caching).
	Add Timeout.hoststatus option.  This interval (defaulting to 30m)
		specifies how long cached information about the state of a
		host will be kept before they are considered stale and the
		host is retried.  If you are using persistent host status
		(i.e., the HostStatusDirectory option is set) this will apply
		between runs; otherwise, it applies only within a single queue
		run and hence is useful only for hosts that have large queues
		that take a very long time to run.
	Add SingleLineFromHeader option.  If set, From: headers are coerced
		into being a single line even if they had newlines in them
		when read.  This is to get around a botch in Lotus Notes.
	Text class maps were totally broken -- if you ever retrieved the last
		item in a table it would be truncated.  Problem noted by
		Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Extend the lines printed by the mailq command (== the -bp flag) when
		-v is given to 120 characters; this allows more information
		to be displayed.  Suggested by Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Allow macro definitions (`D' lines) with unquoted commas; previously
		this was treated as end-of-input.  Problem noted by Bryan
		Costales.
	The RET= envelope parameter (used for DSNs) wasn't properly written
		to the queue file.  Fix from John Hughes of Atlantic
		Technologies, Inc.
	Close /var/tmp/dead.letter after a successful write -- otherwise
		if this happens in a queue run it can cause nasty delays.
		Problem noted by Mark Horton of AT&T.
	If userdb entries pointed to userdb entries, and there were multiple
		values for a given key, the database cursor would get
		trashed by the recursive call.  Problem noted by Roy Mongiovi
		of Georgia Tech.  Fixed by reading all the values and creating
		a comma-separated list; thus, the -v output will be somewhat
		different for this case.
	Fix buffer allocation problem with Hesiod-based userdb maps when
		HES_GETMAILHOST is defined.  Based on a patch by Betty Lee
		of Stanford University.
	When envelopes were split due to aliases with owner- aliases, and
		there was some error on one of the lists, more than one of
		the owners would get the message.  Problem pointed out by
		Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Detect excessive recursion in macro expansions, e.g., $X defined
		in terms of $Y which is defined in terms of $X.  Problem
		noted by Bryan Costales; patch from Eric Wassenaar.
	When using F=U to get "ugly UUCP" From_ lines, a buffer could in
		some cases get trashed causing bogus From_ lines.  Fix from
		Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	When doing load average initialization, if the nlist call for avenrun
		failed, the second and subsequent lookups wouldn't notice
		that fact causing bogus load averages to be returned.  Noted
		by Casper Dik of Sun Holland.
	Fix problem with incompatibility with some versions of inet_aton that
		have changed the return value to unsigned, so a check for an
		error return of -1 doesn't work.  Use INADDR_NONE instead.
		This could cause mail to addresses such as [foo.com] to bounce
		or get dropped.  Problem noted by Christophe Wolfhugel of the
		Pasteur Institute.
	DSNs were inconsistent if a failure occurred during the DATA phase
		rather than the RCPT phase: the Action: would be correct, but
		the detailed status information would be wrong.  Problem noted
		by Bob Snyder of General Electric Company.
	Add -U command line flag and the XUSR ESMTP extension, both indicating
		that this is the initial MUA->MTA submission.  The flag current
		does nothing, but in future releases (when MUAs start using
		these flags) it will probably turn on things like DNS
		canonification.
	Default end-of-line string (E= specification on mailer [M] lines)
		to \r\n on SMTP mailers.  Default remains \n on non-SMTP
		mailers.
	Change the internal definition for the *file* and *include* mailers
		to have $u in the argument vectors so that they aren't
		misinterpreted as SMTP mailers and thus use \r\n line
		termination.  This will affect anyone who has redefined
		either of these in their configuration file.
	Don't assume that IDENT servers close the connection after a query;
		responses can be newline terminated.  From Terry Kennedy of
		St. Peter's College.
	Avoid core dumps on erroneous configuration files that have
		$#mailer with nothing following.  From Bryan Costales.
	Avoid null pointer dereference with high debug values in unlockqueue.
		Fix from Randy Martin of Clemson University.
	Fix possible buffer overrun when expanding very large macros.  Fix
		from Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	After 25 EXPN or VRFY commands, start pausing for a second before
		processing each one.  This avoids a certain form of denial
		of service attack.  Potential attack pointed out by Bryan
		Costales.
	Allow new named (not numbered!) config file rules to do validity
		checking on SMTP arguments: check_mail for MAIL commands and
		check_rcpt for RCPT commands.  These rulesets can do anything
		they want; their result is ignored unless they resolve to the
		$#error mailer, in which case the indicated message is printed
		and the command is rejected.  Similarly, the check_compat
		ruleset is called before delivery with "from_addr $| to_addr"
		(the $| is a meta-symbol used to separate the two addresses);
		it can give a "this sender can't send to this recipient"
		notification.  Note that this patch allows $| to stand alone
		in rulesets.
	Define new macros ${client_name}, ${client_addr}, and ${client_port}
		that have the name, IP address, and port number (respectively)
		of the SMTP client (that is, the entity at the other end of
		the connection.  These can be used in (e.g.) check_rcpt to
		verify that someone isn't trying to relay mail through your
		host inappropriately.  Be sure to use the deferred evaluation
		form, for example $&{client_name}, to avoid having these bound
		when sendmail reads the configuration file.
	Add new config file rule check_relay to check the incoming connection
		information.  Like check_compat, it is passed the host name
		and host address separated by $| and can reject connections
		on that basis.
	Allow IDA-style recursive function calls.  Code contributed by Mark
		Lovell and Paul Vixie.
	Eliminate the "No ! in UUCP From address!" message" -- instead, create
		a virtual UUCP address using either a domain address or the $k
		macro.  Based on code contributed by Mark Lovell and Paul
		Vixie.
	Add Stanford LDAP map.  Requires special libraries that are not
		included with sendmail.  Contributed by Booker C. Bense
		<bbense@networking.stanford.edu>; contact him for support.
		See also the src/READ_ME file.
	Allow -dANSI to turn on ANSI escape sequences in debug output; this
		puts metasymbols (e.g., $+) in reverse video.  Really useful
		only for debugging deep bits of code where it is important to
		distinguish between the single-character metasymbol $+ and the
		two characters $, +.
	Changed ruleset 89 (executed in dumpstate()) to a named ruleset,
		debug_dumpstate.
	Add new UnsafeGroupWrites option; if set, .forward and :include:
		files that are group writable are considered "unsafe" -- that
		is, programs and files referenced from such files are not
		valid recipients.
	Delete bogosity test for FallBackMX host; this prevented it to be a
		name that was not in DNS or was a domain-literal.  Problem
		noted by Tom May.
	Change the introduction to error messages to more clearly delineate
		permanent from temporary failures; if both existed in a
		single message it could be confusing.  Suggested by John
		Beck of InReference, Inc.
	The IngoreDot (i) option didn't work for lines that were terminated
		with CRLF.  Problem noted by Ted Stockwell of Secure
		Computing Corporation.
	Add a heuristic to improve the handling of unbalanced `<' signs in
		message headers.  Problem reported by Matt Dillon of Best
		Internet Communications.
	Check for bogus characters in the 0200-0237 range; since these are
		used internally, very strange errors can occur if those
		characters appear in headers.  Problem noted by Anders Gertz
		of Lysator.
	Implement 7 -> 8 bit MIME conversions.  This only takes place if the
		recipient mailer has the F=9 flag set, and only works on
		text/plain body types.  Code contributed by Marius Olafsson
		of the University of Iceland.
	Special case "postmaster" name so that it is always treated as lower
		case in alias files regardless of configuration settings;
		this prevents some potential problems where "Postmaster" or
		"POSTMASTER" might not match "postmaster".  In most cases
		this change is a no-op.
	The -o map flag was ignored for text maps.  Problem noted by Bryan
		Costales.
	The -a map flag was ignored for dequote maps.  Problem noted by
		Bryan Costales.
	Fix core dump when a lookup of a class "prog" map returns no
		response.  Patch from Bryan Costales.
	Log instances where sendmail is deferring or rejecting connections
		on LogLevel 14.  Suggested by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	Include port number in process title for network daemons.  Suggested
		by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	Send ``double bounces'' (errors that occur when sending an error
		message) to the address indicated in the DoubleBounceAddress
		option (default: postmaster).  Previously they were always
		sent to postmaster.  Suggested by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	Add new mode, -bD, that acts like -bd in all respects except that
		it runs in foreground.  This is useful for using with a
		wrapper that "watches" system services.  Suggested by Kyle
		Jones of UUNET.
	Fix botch in spacing around (parenthesized) comments in addresses
		when the comment comes before the address.  Patch from
		Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Use the prefix "Postmaster notify" on the Subject: lines of messages
		that are being bounced to postmaster, rather than "Returned
		mail".  This permits the person who is postmaster more
		easily determine what messages are to their role as
		postmaster versus bounces to mail they actually sent.  Based
		on a suggestion by Motonori Nakamura.
	Add new value "time" for QueueSortOrder option; this causes the queue
		to be sorted strictly by the time of submission.  Note that
		this can cause very bad behavior over slow lines (because
		large jobs will tend to delay small jobs) and on nodes with
		heavy traffic (because old things in the queue for hosts that
		are down delay processing of new jobs).  Also, this does not
		guarantee that jobs will be delivered in submission order
		unless you also set DeliveryMode=queue.  In general, it should
		probably only be used on the command line, and only in
		conjunction with -qRhost.domain.  In fact, there are very few
		cases where it should be used at all.  Based on an
		implementation by Motonori Nakamura.
	If a map lookup in ruleset 5 returns tempfail, queue the message in
		the same manner as other rulesets.  Previously a temporary
		failure in ruleset 5 was ignored.  Patch from Booker Bense
		of Stanford University.
	Don't proceed to the next MX host if an SMTP MAIL command returns a
		5yz (permanent failure) code.  The next MX host will still be
		tried if the connection cannot be opened in the first place
		or if the MAIL command returns a 4yz (temporary failure) code.
		(It's hard to know what to do here, since neither RFC 974 nor
		RFC 1123 specify when to proceed to the next MX host.)
		Suggested by Jonathan Kamens of OpenVision, Inc.
	Add new "-t" flag for map definitions (the "K" line in the .cf file).
		This causes map lookups that get a temporary failure (e.g.,
		name server failure) to _not_ defer the delivery of the
		message.  This should only be used if your configuration file
		is prepared to do something sensible in this case.  Based on
		an idea by Gregory Shapiro of WPI.
	Fix problem finding network interface addresses.  Patch from
		Motonori Nakamura.
	Don't reject qf entries that are not owned by your effective uid if
		you are not running setuid; this makes management of certain
		kinds of firewall setups difficult.  Patch suggested by
		Eamonn Coleman of Qualcomm.
	Add persistent host status.  This keeps the information normally
		maintained within a single queue run in disk files that are
		shared between sendmail instances.  The HostStatusDirectory
		is the directory in which the information is maintained.  If
		not set, persistent host status is turned off.  If not a full
		pathname, it is relative to the queue directory.  A common
		value is ".hoststat".
		There are also two new operation modes:
		  * -bh prints the status of hosts that have had recent
		    connections.
		  * -bH purges the host statuses.  No attempt is made to save
		    recent status information.
		This feature was originally written by Paul Vixie of Vixie
		Enterprises for KJS and adapted for V8 by Mark Lovell of
		Bigrock Consulting.  Paul's funding of Mark and Mark's patience
		with my insistence that things fit cleanly into the V8
		framework is gratefully appreciated.
	New SingleThreadDelivery option (requires HostStatusDirectory to
		operate).  Avoids letting two sendmails on the local machine
		open connections to the same remote host at the same time.
		This reduces load on the other machine, but can cause mail to
		be delayed (for example, if one sendmail is delivering a huge
		message, other sendmails won't be able to send even small
		messages).  Also, it requires another file descriptor (for the
		lock file) per connection, so you may have to reduce
		ConnectionCacheSize to avoid running out of per-process
		file descriptors.  Based on the persistent host status code
		contributed by Paul Vixie and Mark Lovell.
	Allow sending to non-simple files (e.g., /dev/null) even if the
		SafeFileEnvironment option is set.  Problem noted by Bryan
		Costales.
	The -qR flag mistakenly matched flags in the "R" line of the queue
		file.  Problem noted by Bryan Costales.
	If a job was aborted using the interrupt signal (e.g., control-C from
		the keyboard), on some occasions an empty df file would be
		left around; these would collect in the queue directory.
		Problem noted by Bryan Costales.
	Change the makesendmail script to enhance the search for Makefiles
		based on release number.  For example, on SunOS 5.5.1, it will
		search for Makefile.SunOS.5.5.1, Makefile.SunOS.5.5, and then
		Makefile.SunOS.5.x (in addition to the other rules, e.g.,
		adding $arch).  Problem noted by Jason Mastaler of Atlanta
		Webmasters.
	When creating maps using "newaliases", always map the keys to lower
		case when creating the map unless the -f flag is specified on
		the map itself.  Previously this was done based on the F=u
		flag in the local mailer, which meant you could create aliases
		that you could never access.  Problem noted by Bob Wu of DEC.
	When a job was read from the queue, the bits causing notification on
		failure or delay were always set.  This caused those
		notifications to be sent even if NOTIFY=NEVER had been
		specified.  Problem noted by Steve Hubert of the University
		of Washington, Seattle.
	Add new configurable routine validate_connection (in conf.c).  This
		lets you decide if you are willing to accept traffic from
		this host.  If it returns FALSE, all SMTP commands will return
		"550 Access denied".  -DTCPWRAPPERS will include support for
		TCP wrappers; you will need to add -lwrap to the link line.
		(See src/READ_ME for details.)
	Don't include the "THIS IS A WARNING MESSAGE ONLY" banner on postmaster
		bounces.  Some people seemed to think that this could be
		confusing (even though it is true).  Suggested by Motonori
		Nakamura.
	Add new RunAsUser option; this causes sendmail to do a setuid to that
		user early in processing to avoid potential security problems.
		However, this means that all .forward and :include: files must
		be readable by that user, and all files to be written must be
		writable by that user and all programs will be executed by that
		user.  It is also incompatible with the SafeFileEnvironment
		option.  In other words, it may not actually add much to
		security.  However, it should be useful on firewalls and other
		places where users don't have accounts and the aliases file is
		well constrained.
	Add Timeout.iconnect.  This is like Timeout.connect except it is used
		only on the first attempt to delivery to an address.  It could
		be set to be lower than Timeout.connect on the principle that
		the mail should go through quickly to responsive hosts; less
		responsive hosts get to wait for the next queue run.
	Fix a problem on Solaris that occasionally causes programs
		(such as vacation) to hang with their standard input connected
		to a UDP port.  It also created some signal handling problems.
		The problems turned out to be an interaction between vfork(2)
		and some of the libraries, particularly NIS/NIS+.  I am
		indebted to Tor Egge <tegge@idt.ntnu.no> for this fix.
	Change user class map to do the same matching that actual delivery
		will do instead of just a /etc/passwd lookup.  This adds
		fuzzy matching to the user map.  Patch from Dan Oscarsson.
	The Timeout.* options are not safe -- they can be used to create a
		denial-of-service attack.  Problem noted by Christophe
		Wolfhugel.
	Don't send PostmasterCopy messages in the event of a "delayed"
		notification.  Suggested by Barry Bouwsma.
	Don't advertise "VERB" ESMTP extension if the "noexpn" privacy
		option is set, since this disables VERB mode.  Suggested
		by John Hawkinson of MIT.
	Complain if the QueueDirectory (Q) option is not set.  Problem noted
		by Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Only queue messages on transient .forward open failures if there
		were no successful opens.  The previous behavior caused it
		to queue even if a "fall back" .forward was found.  Problem
		noted by Ann-Kian Yeo of the Dept. of Information Systems
		and Computer Science (DISCS), NUS, Singapore.
	Don't do 8->7 bit conversions when bouncing a MIME message that
		is bouncing because of a MIME error during 8->7 bit conversion;
		the encapsulated message will bounce again, causing a loop.
		Problem noted by Steve Hubert of the University of Washington.
	Create xf (transcript) files using the TempFileMode option value
		instead of 0644.  Suggested by Ann-Kian Yeo of the
		National University of Singapore.
	Print errors if setgid/setuid/etc. fail during delivery.  This helps
		detect cases where DefaultUid is set to something that the
		system can't cope with.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		Support for AIX/RS 2.2.1 from Mark Whetzel of Western
			Atlas International.
		Patches for Intel Paragon OSF/1 1.3 from Leo Bicknell
			<bicknell@ufp.org>.
		On DEC OSF/1 3.2 and earlier, the MatchGECOS code would only
			work on the first recipient of a message due to a
			bug in the getpwent family.  If this is something you
			use, you can define DEC_OSF_BROKEN_GETPWENT=1 for a
			workaround.  From Maximum Entropy of Sanford C.
			Bernstein and Associates.
		FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 uname -r returns a string containing
			parentheses, which breaks makesendmail.  Reported
			by Piero Serini <piero@strider.ibenet.it>.
		Sequent DYNIX/ptx 4.0.2 patches from Jack Woolley of
			Systems and Computer Technology Corporation.
		Solaris 2.x: omit the UUCP grade parameter (-g flag) because
			it is system-dependent.  Problem noted by J.J. Bailey
			of Bailey Computer Consulting.
		Pyramid NILE running DC/OSx support from Earle F. Ake of
			Hassler Communication Systems Technology, Inc.
		HP-UX 10.x compile glitches, reported by Anne Brink of the

		NEXTSTEP 3.x compilation from Robert La Ferla.
		NEXTSTEP 3.x code changes from Allan J. Nathanson of NeXT.
		Solaris 2.5 configuration fixes for mail.local by Jim Davis
			of the University of Arizona.
		Solaris 2.5 has a working setreuid.  Noted by David Linn of
			Vanderbilt University.
		Solaris changes for praliases, makemap, mailstats, and smrsh.
			Previously you had to add -DSOLARIS in Makefile.dist;
			this auto-detects.  Based on a patch from Randall
			Winchester of the University of Maryland.
	CONFIG: add generic-nextstep3.3.mc file.  Contributed by
		Robert La Ferla of Hot Software.
	CONFIG: allow mailertables to resolve to ``error:code message''
		(where "code" is an exit status) on domains (previously
		worked only on hosts).  Patch from Cor Bosman of Xs4all
		Foundation.
	CONFIG: hooks for IPv6-style domain literals.
	CONFIG: predefine ALIAS_FILE and change the prototype file so that
		if it is undefined the AliasFile option is never set; this
		should be transparent for most everyone.  Suggested by John
		Myers of CMU.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(limited_masquerade).  Without this feature, any
		domain listed in $=w is masqueraded.  With it, only those
		domains listed in a MASQUERADE_DOMAIN macro are masqueraded.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(masquerade_entire_domain).  This causes
		masquerading specified by MASQUERADE_DOMAIN to apply to all
		hosts under those domains as well as the domain headers
		themselves.  For example, if a configuration had
		MASQUERADE_DOMAIN(foo.com), then without this feature only
		foo.com would be masqueraded; with it, *.foo.com would be
		masqueraded as well.  Based on an implementation by Richard
		(Pug) Bainter of U. Texas.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(genericstable) to do a more general rewriting of
		outgoing addresses.  Defaults to ``hash -o /etc/genericstable''.
		Keys are user names; values are outgoing mail addresses.  Yes,
		this does overlap with the user database, and figuring out
		just when to use which one may be tricky.  Based on code
		contributed by Richard (Pug) Bainter of U. Texas with updates
		from Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(virtusertable) to do generalized rewriting of
		incoming addresses.  Defaults to ``hash -o /etc/virtusertable''.
		Keys are either fully qualified addresses or just the host
		part (with the @ sign).  For example, a table containing:
			info@foo.com	foo-info
			info@bar.com	bar-info
			@baz.org	jane@elsewhere.net
		would send all mail destined for info@foo.com to foo-info
		(which is presumably an alias), mail addressed to info@bar.com
		to bar-info, and anything addressed to anyone at baz.org will
		be sent to jane@elsewhere.net.  The names foo.com, bar.com,
		and baz.org must all be in $=w.  Based on discussions with
		a great many people.
	CONFIG: add nullclient configurations to define SMTP_MAILER_FLAGS.
		Suggested by Richard Bainter.
	CONFIG: add FAX_MAILER_ARGS to tweak the arguments passed to the
		"fax" mailer.
	CONFIG: allow mailertable entries to resolve to local:user; this
		passes the original user@host in to procmail-style local
		mailers as the "detail" information to allow them to do
		additional clever processing.  From Joe Pruett of
		Teleport Corporation.  Delivery to the original user can
		be done by specifying "local:" (with nothing after the colon).
	CONFIG: allow any context that takes "mailer:domain" to also take
		"mailer:user@domain" to force mailing to the given user;
		"local:user" can also be used to do local delivery.  This
		applies on *_RELAY and in the mailertable entries.  Based
		on a suggestion by Ribert Kiessling of Easynet.
	CONFIG: Allow FEATURE(bestmx_is_local) to take an argument that
		limits the possible domains; this reduces the number of DNS
		lookups required to support this feature.  For example,
		FEATURE(bestmx_is_local, my.site.com) limits the lookups
		to domains under my.site.com.  Code contributed by Anthony
		Thyssen <anthony@cit.gu.edu.au>.
	CONFIG: LOCAL_RULESETS introduces any locally defined rulesets,
		such as the check_rcpt ruleset.  Suggested by Gregory Shapiro
		of WPI.
	CONFIG: MAILER_DEFINITIONS introduces any mailer definitions, in the
		event you have to define local mailers.  Suggested by
		Gregory Shapiro of WPI.
	CONFIG: fix cases where a three- (or more-) stage route-addr could
		be misinterpreted as a list:...; syntax.  Based on a patch by
		Vlado Potisk <Vlado_Potisk@tempest.sk>.
	CONFIG: Fix masquerading of UUCP addresses when the UUCP relay is
		remotely connected.  The address host!user was being
		converted to host!user@thishost instead of host!user@uurelay.
		Problem noted by William Gianopoulos of Raytheon Company.
	CONFIG: add confTO_ICONNECT to set Timeout.iconnect.
	CONFIG: change FEATURE(redirect) message from "User not local" to
		"User has moved"; the former wording was confusing if the
		new address is still on the local host.  Based on a suggestion
		by Andreas Luik.
	CONFIG: add support in FEATURE(nullclient) for $=E (exposed users).
		However, the class is not pre-initialized to contain root.
		Suggested by Gregory Neil Shapiro.
	CONTRIB: Remove XLA code at the request of the author, Christophe
		Wolfhugel.
	CONTRIB: Add re-mqueue.pl, contributed by Paul Pomes of Qualcomm.
	MAIL.LOCAL: make it possible to compile mail.local on Solaris.  Note
		well: this produces a slightly different mailbox format (no
		Content-Length: headers), file ownerships and modes are
		different (not owned by group mail; mode 600 instead of 660),
		and the local mailer flags will have to be tweaked (make them
		match bsd4.4) in order to use this mailer.  Patches from Paul
		Hammann of the Missouri Research and Education Network.
	MAIL.LOCAL: in some cases it could return EX_OK even though there
		was a delivery error, such as if the ownership on the file
		was wrong or the mode changed between the initial stat and
		the open.  Problem reported by William Colburn of the New
		Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
	MAILSTATS: handle zero length files more reliably.  Patch from Bryan
		Costales.
	MAILSTATS: add man page contributed by Keith Bostic of BSDI.
	MAKEMAP: The -d flag (to allow duplicate keys) to a btree map wasn't
		honored.  Fix from Michael Scott Shappe.
	PRALIASES: add man page contributed by Keith Bostic of BSDI.

8.7.6/8.7.3	1996/09/17
	SECURITY: It is possible to force getpwuid to fail when writing the
		queue file, causing sendmail to fall back to running programs
		as the default user.  This is not exploitable from off-site.
		Workarounds include using a unique user for the DefaultUser
		(old u & g options) and using smrsh as the local shell.
	SECURITY: fix some buffer overruns; in at least one case this allows
		a local user to get root.  This is not known to be exploitable
		from off-site.  The workaround is to disable chfn(1) commands.

8.7.5/8.7.3	1996/03/04
	Fix glitch in 8.7.4 when putting certain internal lines; this can
		in some case cause connections to hang or messages to have
		extra spaces in odd places.  Patch from Eric Wassenaar;
		reports from Eric Hall of Chiron Corporation, Stephen
		Hansen of Stanford University, Dean Gaudet of HotWired,
		and others.

8.7.4/8.7.3	1996/02/18
	SECURITY: In some cases it was still possible for an attacker to
		insert newlines into a queue file, thus allowing access to
		any user (except root).
	CONFIG: no changes -- it is not a bug that the configuration
		version number is unchanged.

8.7.3/8.7.3	1995/12/03
	Fix botch in name server timeout in RCPT code; this problem caused
		two responses in SMTP, which breaks things horribly.  Fix
		from Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	Verify that L= value on M lines cannot be negative, which could cause
		negative array subscripting.  Not a security problem since
		this has to be in the config file, but it could have caused
		core dumps.  Pointed out by Bryan Costales.
	Fix -d21 debug output for long macro names.  Pointed out by Bryan
		Costales.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		SCO doesn't have ftruncate.  From Bill Aten of Computerizers.
		IBM's version of arpa/nameser.h defaults to the wrong byte
			order.  Tweak it to work properly.  Based on fixes
			from Fletcher Mattox of UTexas and Betty Lee of
			Stanford University.
	CONFIG: add confHOSTS_FILE m4 variable to set HostsFile option.
		Deficiency pointed out by Bryan Costales of ICSI.

8.7.2/8.7.2	1995/11/19
	REALLY fix the backslash escapes in SmtpGreetingMessage,
		OperatorChars, and UnixFromLine options.  They were not
		properly repaired in 8.7.1.
	Completely delete the Bcc: header if and only if there are other
		valid recipient headers (To:, Cc: or Apparently-To:, the
		last being a historic botch, of course).  If Bcc: is the
		only recipient header in the message, its value is tossed,
		but the header name is kept.  The old behavior (always keep
		the header name and toss the value) allowed primary recipients
		to see that a Bcc: went to _someone_.
	Include queue id on ``Authentication-Warning: <host>: <user> set
		sender to <address> using -f'' syslog messages.  Suggested
		by Kari Hurtta.
	If a sequence or switch map lookup entry gets a tempfail but then
		continues on to another map type, but the name is not found,
		return a temporary failure from the sequence or switch map.
		For example, if hosts search ``dns files'' and DNS fails
		with a tempfail, the hosts map will go on and search files,
		but if it fails the whole thing should be a tempfail, not
		a permanent (host unknown) failure, even though that is the
		failure in the hosts.files map.  This error caused hard
		bounces when it should have requeued.
	Aliases to files such as /users/bar/foo/inbox, with /users/bar/foo
		owned by bar mode 700 and inbox being setuid bar stopped
		working properly due to excessive paranoia.  Pointed out by
		John Hawkinson of Panix.
	An SMTP RCPT command referencing a host that gave a nameserver
		timeout would return a 451 command (8.6 accepted it and
		queued it locally).  Revert to the 8.6 behavior in order
		to simplify queue management for clustered systems.  Suggested
		by Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.  The same problem could break
		MH, which assumes that the SMTP session will succeed (tsk, tsk
		-- mail gets lost!); this was pointed out by Stuart Pook of
		Infobiogen.
	Fix possible buffer overflow in munchstring().  This was not a security
		problem because you couldn't specify any argument to this
		without first giving up root privileges, but it is still a
		good idea to avoid future problems.  Problem noted by John
		Hawkinson and Sam Hartman of MIT.
	``452 Out of disk space for temp file'' messages weren't being
		printed.  Fix from David Perlin of Nanosoft.
	Don't advertise the ESMTP DSN extension if the SendMimeErrors option
		is not set, since this is required to get the actual DSNs
		created.  Problem pointed out by John Gardiner Myers of CMU.
	Log permission problems that cause .forward and :include: files to
		be untrusted or ignored on log level 12 and higher.  Suggested
		by Randy Martin of Clemson University.
	Allow user ids in U= clauses of M lines to have hyphens and
		underscores.
	Fix overcounting of recipients -- only happened when sending to an
		alias.  Pointed out by Mark Andrews of SGI and Jack Woolley
		of Systems and Computer Technology Corporation.
	If a message is sent to an address that fails, the error message that
		is returned could show some extraneous "success" information
		included even if the user did not request success notification,
		which was confusing.  Pointed out by Allan Johannesen of WPI.
	Config files that had no AliasFile definition were defaulting to
		using /etc/aliases; this caused problems with nullclient
		configurations.  Change it back to the 8.6 semantics of
		having no local alias file unless it is declared.  Problem
		noted by Charles Karney of Princeton University.
	Fix compile problem if NOTUNIX is defined.  Pointed out by Bryan
		Costales of ICSI.
	Map lookups of class "userdb" maps were always case sensitive; they
		should be controlled by the -f flag like other maps.  Pointed
		out by Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>.
	Fix problem that caused some addresses to be passed through ruleset 5
		even when they were tagged as "sticky" by prefixing the
		address with an "@".  Patch from Thomas Dwyer III of Michigan
		Technological University.
	When converting a message to Quoted-Printable, prevent any lines with
		dots alone on a line by themselves.  This is because of the
		preponderance of broken mailers that still get this wrong.
		Code contributed by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	Fix F{macro}/file construct -- it previously did nothing.  Pointed
		out by Bjart Kvarme of USIT/UiO (Norway).
	Announce whether a cached connection is SMTP or ESMTP (in -v mode).
		Requested by Allan Johannesen.
	Delete check for text format of alias files -- it should be legal
		to have the database format of the alias files without the
		text version.  Problem pointed out by Joe Rhett of Navigist,
		Inc.
	If "Ot" was specified with no value, the TZ variable was not properly
		imported from the environment.  Pointed out by Frank Crawford
		<frank@ansto.gov.au>.
	Some architectures core dumped on "program" maps that didn't have
		extra arguments.  Patch from Booker C. Bense of Stanford
		University.
	Queue run processes would re-spawn daemons when given a SIGHUP; only
		the parent should do this.  Fix from Brian Coan of the
		Association for Progressive Communications.
	If MinQueueAge was set and a message was considered but not run
		during a queue run and the Timeout.queuereturn interval was
		reached, a "timed out" error message would be returned that
		didn't include the failed address (and claimed to be a warning
		even though it was fatal).  The fix is to not return such
		messages until they are actually tried, i.e., in the next
		MinQueueAge interval.  Problem noted by Rein Tollevik of
		SINTEF RUNIT, Oslo.
	Add HES_GETMAILHOST compile flag to support MIT Hesiod distributions
		that have the hes_getmailhost() routine.  DEC Hesiod
		distributions do not have this routine.  Based on a patch
		from Betty Lee of Stanford University.
	Extensive cleanups to map open code to handle a locking race condition
		in ndbm, hash, and btree format database files on some (most
		non-4.4-BSD based) OS architectures.  This should solve the
		occasional "user unknown" problem during alias rebuilds that
		has plagued me for quite some time.  Based on a patch from
		Thomas Dwyer III of Michigan Technological University.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		Solaris: Change location of newaliases and mailq from
			/usr/ucb to /usr/bin to match Sun settings.  From
			James B. Davis of TCI.
		DomainOS: Makefile.DomainOS doesn't require -ldbm.  From
			Don Lewis of Silicon Systems.
		HP-UX 10: rename Makefile.HP-UX.10 => Makefile.HP-UX.10.x
			so that the makesendmail script will find it.  Pointed
			out by Richard Allen of the University of Iceland.
			Also, use -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE instead of -Ae, which
			isn't supported on all compilers.
		UXPDS: compilation fixes from Diego R. Lopez.
	CONFIG: FAX mailer wasn't setting .FAX as a pseudo-domain unless
		you also had a FAX_RELAY.  From Thomas.Tornblom@Hax.SE.
	CONFIG: Minor glitch in S21 -- attachment of local domain name
		didn't have trailing dot.  From Jim Hickstein of Teradyne.
	CONFIG: Fix best_mx_is_local feature to allow nested addresses such as
		user%host@thishost.  From Claude Scarpelli of Infobiogen
		(France).
	CONFIG: OSTYPE(hpux10) failed to define the location of the help file.
		Pointed out by Hannu Martikka of Nokia Telecommunications.
	CONFIG: Diagnose some inappropriate ordering in configuration files,
		such as FEATURE(smrsh) listed after MAILER(local).  Based on
		a bug report submitted by Paul Hoffman of Proper Publishing.
	CONFIG: Make OSTYPE files consistently not override settings that
		have already been set.  Previously it worked differently
		for different files.
	CONFIG: Change relay mailer to do masquerading like 8.6 did.  My take
		is that this is wrong, but the change was causing problems
		for some people.  From Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONTRIB: bitdomain.c patch from John Gardiner Myers <jgm+@CMU.EDU>;
		portability changes for Posix environments (no functional
		changes).

8.7.1/8.7.1	1995/10/01
	Old macros that have become options (SmtpGreetingMessage,
		OperatorChars, and UnixFromLine) didn't allow backslash
		escapes in the options, where they previously had.  Bug
		pointed out by John Hawkinson of MIT.
	Fix strange case of an executable called by a program map that
		returns a value but also a non-zero exit status; this
		would give contradictory results in the higher level; in
		particular, the default clause in the map lookup would be
		ignored.  Change to ignore the value if the program returns
		non-zero exit status.  From Tom Moore of AT&T GIS.
	Shorten parameters passed to syslog() in some contexts to avoid a
		bug in many vendors' implementations of that routine.  Although
		this isn't really a bug in sendmail per se, and my solution
		has to assume that syslog() has at least a 1K buffer size
		internally (I know some vendors have shortened this
		dramatically -- they're on their own), sendmail is a popular
		target.  Also, limit the size of %s arguments in sprintf.
		These both have possible security implications.  Solutions
		suggested by Casper Dik of Sun's Network Security Group
		(Holland), Mark Seiden, and others.
	Fix a problem that might cause a non-standard -B (body type)
		parameter to be passed to the next server with undefined
		results.  This could have security implications.
	If a filesystem was at > 100% utilization, the freediskspace()
		routine incorrectly returned an error rather than zero.
		Problem noted by G. Paul Ziemba of Alantec.
	Change MX sort order so that local hostnames (those in $=w) always
		sort first within a given preference.  This forces the bestmx
		map to always return the local host first, if it is included
		in the list of highest priority MX records.  From K. Robert
		Elz.
	Avoid some possible null pointer dereferences.  Fixes from Randy
		Martin <WOLF@CLEMSON.EDU>
	When sendmail starts up on systems that have no fully qualified
		domain name (FQDN) anywhere in the first matching host map
		(e.g., /etc/hosts if the hosts service searches "files dns"),
		sendmail would sleep to try to find a FQDN, which it really
		really needs.  This has been changed to fall through to the
		next map type if it can't find a FQDN -- i.e., if the hosts
		file doesn't have a FQDN, it will try dns even though the
		short name was found in /etc/hosts.  This is probably a crock,
		but many people have hosts files without FQDNs.  Remember:
		domain names are your friends.
	Log a high-priority message if you can't find your FQDN during startup.
		Suggested by Simon Barnes of Schlumberger Limited.
	When using Hesiod, initialize it early to improve error reporting.
		Patch from Don Lewis of Silicon Systems, Inc.
	Apparently at least some versions of Linux have a 90 !minute! TCP
		connection timeout in the kernel.  Add a new "connect" timeout
		to limit this time.  Defaults to zero (use whatever the
		kernel provides).  Based on code contributed by J.R. Oldroyd
		of TerraNet.
	Under some circumstances, a failed message would not be properly
		removed from the queue, causing tons of bogus error messages.
		(This fix eliminates the problematic EF_KEEPQUEUE flag.)
		Problem noted by Allan E Johannesen and Gregory Neil Shapiro
		of WPI.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		On IRIX 5.x, there was an inconsistency in the setting
			of sendmail.st location.  Change the Makefile to
			install it in /var/sendmail.st to match the OSTYPE
			file and SGI standards.  From Andre
			<andre@curry.zfe.siemens.de>.
		Support for Fujitsu/ICL UXP/DS (For the DS/90 Series)
			from Diego R. Lopez <drlopez@cica.es>.
		Linux compilation patches from J.R. Oldroyd of TerraNet, Inc.
		LUNA 2 Mach patches from Motonori Nakamura.
		SunOS Makefile was including -ldbm, which is for the old
			dbm library.  The ndbm library is part of libc.
	CONFIG: avoid bouncing ``user@host.'' (note trailing dot) with
		``local configuration error'' in nullclient configuration.
		Patch from Gregory Neil Shapiro of WPI.
	CONFIG: don't allow an alias file in nullclient configurations --
		since all addresses are relayed, they give errors during
		rebuild.  Suggested by Per Hedeland of Ericsson.
	CONFIG: local mailer on Solaris 2 should always get a -f flag because
		otherwise the F=S causes the From_ line to imply that root is
		the sender.  Problem pointed out by Claude Scarpelli of
		Infobiogen (France).
	NEW FILES:

8.7/8.7		1995/09/16
	Fix a problem that could cause sendmail to run out of file
		descriptors due to a trashed data structure after a
		vfork.  Fix from Brian Coan of the Institute for
		Global Communications.
	Change the VRFY response if you have disabled VRFY -- some
		people seemed to think that it was too rude.
	Avoid reference to uninitialized file descriptor if HASFLOCK
		was not defined.  This was used "safely" in the sense
		that it only did a stat, but it would have set the
		map modification time improperly.  Problem pointed out
		by Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech.
	Clean up the Subject: line on warning messages and return
		receipts so that they don't say "Returned mail:"; this
		can be confusing.
	Move ruleset entry/exit debugging from 21.2 to 21.1 -- this is
		useful enough to make it worthwhile printing on "-d".
	Avoid logging alias statistics every time you read the alias
		file on systems with no database method compiled in.
	If you have a name with a trailing dot, and you try looking it
		up using gethostbyname without the dot (for /etc/hosts
		compatibility), be sure to turn off RES_DEFNAMES and
		RES_DNSRCH to avoid finding the wrong name accidentally.
		Problem noted by Charles Amos of the University of
		Maryland.
	Don't do timeouts in collect if you are not running SMTP.
		There is nothing that says you can't have a long
		running program piped into sendmail (possibly via
		/bin/mail, which just execs sendmail).  Problem reported
		by Don "Truck" Lewis of Silicon Systems.
	Try gethostbyname() even if the DNS lookup fails iff option I
		is not set.  This allows you to have hosts listed in
		NIS or /etc/hosts that are not known to DNS.  It's normally
		a bad idea, but can be useful on firewall machines.  This
		should really be broken out on a separate flag, I suppose.
	Avoid compile warnings against BIND 4.9.3, which uses function
		prototypes.  From Don Lewis of Silicon Systems.
	Avoid possible incorrect diagnosis of DNS-related errors caused
		by things like attempts to resolve uucp names using
		$[ ... $] -- the fix is to clear h_errno at appropriate
		times.  From Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	SECURITY: avoid denial-of-service attacks possible by destroying
		the alias database file by setting resource limits low.
		This involves adding two new compile-time options:
		HASSETRLIMIT (indicating that setrlimit(2) support is
		available) and HASULIMIT (indicating that ulimit(2) support
		is available -- the Release 3 form is used).  The former
		is assumed on BSD-based systems, the latter on System
		V-based systems.  Attack noted by Phil Brandenberger of
		Swarthmore University.
	New syntaxes in test (-bt) mode:
		``.Dmvalue'' will define macro "m" to "value".
		``.Ccvalue'' will add "value" to class "c".
		``=Sruleset'' will dump the contents of the indicated
			ruleset.
		``=M'' will display the known mailers.
		``-ddebug-spec'' is equivalent to the command-line
			-d debug flag.
		``$m'' will print the value of macro $m.
		``$=c'' will print the contents of class $=c.
		``/mx host'' returns the MX records for ``host''.
		``/parse address'' will parse address, returning the value of
			crackaddr (essentially, the comment information)
			and the parsed address.
		``/try mailer address'' will rewrite address into the form
			it will have when presented to the indicated mailer.
		``/tryflags flags'' will set flags used by parsing.  The
			flags can be `H' for header or `E' for envelope,
			and `S' for sender or `R' for recipient.  These
			can be combined, so `HR' sets flags for header
			recipients.
		``/canon hostname'' will try to canonify hostname and
			return the result.
		``/map mapname key'' will look up `key' in the indicated
			`mapname' and return the result.
	Somewhat better handling of UNIX-domain socket addresses -- it
		should show the pathname rather than hex bytes.
	Restore ``-ba'' mode -- this reads a file from stdin and parses
		the header for envelope sender information and uses
		CR-LF as message terminators.  It was thought to be
		obsolete (used only for Arpanet NCP protocols), but it
		turns out that the UK ``Grey Book'' protocols require
		that functionality.
	Fix a fix in previous release -- if gethostname and gethostbyname
		return a name without dots, and if an attempt to canonify
		that name fails, wait one minute and try again.  This can
		result in an extra 60 second delay on startup if your system
		hostname (as returned by hostname(1)) has no dot and no names
		listed in /etc/hosts or your NIS map have a dot.
	Check for proper domain name on HELO and EHLO commands per
		RFC 1123 section 5.2.5.  Problem noted by Thomas Dwyer III
		of Michigan Technological University.
	Relax chownsafe rules slightly -- old version said that if you
		can't tell if _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is set (that is,
		if fpathconf returned EINVAL or ENOSYS), assume that
		chown is not safe.  The new version falls back to whether
		you are on a BSD system or not.  This is important for
		SunOS, which apparently always returns one of those
		error codes.  This impacts whether you can mail to files
		or not.
	Syntax errors such as unbalanced parentheses in the configuration
		file could be omitted if you had "Oem" prior to the
		syntax error in the config file.  Change to always print
		the error message.  It was especially weird because it
		would cause a "warning" message to be sent to the Postmaster
		for every message sent (but with no transcript).  Problem
		noted by Gregory Paris of Motorola.
	Rewrite collect and putbody to handle full 8-bit data, including
		zero bytes.  These changes are internally extensive, but
		should have minimal impact on external function.
	Allow full words for option names -- if the option letter is
		(apparently) a space, then take the word following -- e.g.,
			O MatchGECOS=TRUE
		The full list of old and new names is as follows:
			7	SevenBitInput
			8	EightBitMode
			A	AliasFile
			a	AliasWait
			B	BlankSub
			b	MinFreeBlocks/MaxMessageSize
			C	CheckpointInterval
			c	HoldExpensive
			D	AutoRebuildAliases
			d	DeliveryMode
			E	ErrorHeader
			e	ErrorMode
			f	SaveFromLine
			F	TempFileMode
			G	MatchGECOS
			H	HelpFile
			h	MaxHopCount
			i	IgnoreDots
			I	ResolverOptions
			J	ForwardPath
			j	SendMimeErrors
			k	ConnectionCacheSize
			K	ConnectionCacheTimeout
			L	LogLevel
			l	UseErrorsTo
			m	MeToo
			n	CheckAliases
			O	DaemonPortOptions
			o	OldStyleHeaders
			P	PostmasterCopy
			p	PrivacyOptions
			Q	QueueDirectory
			q	QueueFactor
			R	DontPruneRoutes
			r, T	Timeout
			S	StatusFile
			s	SuperSafe
			t	TimeZoneSpec
			u	DefaultUser
			U	UserDatabaseSpec
			V	FallbackMXHost
			v	Verbose
			w	TryNullMXList
			x	QueueLA
			X	RefuseLA
			Y	ForkEachJob
			y	RecipientFactor
			z	ClassFactor
			Z	RetryFactor
		The old macros that passed information into sendmail have
		been changed to options; those correspondences are:
			$e	SmtpGreetingMessage
			$l	UnixFromLine
			$o	OperatorChars
			$q	(deleted -- not necessary)
		To avoid possible problems with an older sendmail,
		configuration level 6 is accepted by this version of
		sendmail; any config file using the new names should
		specify "V6" in the configuration.
	Change address parsing to properly note that a phrase before a
		colon and a trailing semicolon are essentially the same
		as text outside of angle brackets (i.e., sendmail should
		treat them as comments).  This is to handle the
		``group name: addr1, addr2, ..., addrN;'' syntax (it will
		assume that ``group name:'' is a comment on the first
		address and the ``;'' is a comment on the last address).
		This requires config file support to get right.  It does
		understand that :: is NOT this syntax, and can be turned
		off completely by setting the ColonOkInAddresses option.
	Level 6 config files added with new mailer flags:
		    A	Addresses are aliasable.
		    i	Do udb rewriting on envelope as well as header
			sender lines.  Applies to the from address mailer
			flags rather than the recipient mailer flags.
		    j	Do udb rewriting on header recipient addresses.
			Applies to the sender mailer flags rather than the
			recipient mailer flags.
		    k	Disable check for loops when doing HELO command.
		    o	Always run as the mail recipient, even on local
			delivery.
		    w	Check for an /etc/passwd entry for this user.
		    5	Pass addresses through ruleset 5.
		    :	Check for :include: on this address.
		    |	Check for |program on this address.
		    /	Check for /file on this address.
		    @	Look up sender header addresses in the user
			database.  Applies to the mailer flags for the
			mailer corresponding to the envelope sender
			address, rather than to recipient mailer flags.
		Pre-level 6 configuration files set A, w, 5, :, |, /, and @
		on the "local" mailer, the o flag on the "prog" and "*file*"
		mailers, and the ColonOkInAddresses option.
	Eight-to-seven bit MIME conversions.  This borrows ideas from
		John Beck of Hewlett-Packard, who generously contributed
		their implementation to me, which I then didn't use (see
		mime.c for an explanation of why).  This adds the
		EightBitMode option (a.k.a. `8') and an F=8 mailer flag
		to control handling of 8-bit data.  These have to cope with
		two types of 8-bit data: unlabelled 8-bit data (that is,
		8-bit data that is entered without declaring it as 8-bit
		MIME -- technically this is illegal according to the
		specs) and labelled 8-bit data (that is, it was declared
		as 8BITMIME in the ESMTP session or by using the
		-B8BITMIME command line flag).  If the F=8 mailer flag is
		set then 8-bit data is sent to non-8BITMIME machines
		instead of converting to 7 bit (essentially using
		just-send-8 semantics).  The values for EightBitMode are:
		    m	convert unlabelled 8-bit input to 8BITMIME, and do
			any necessary conversion of 8BITMIME to 7BIT
			(essentially, the full MIME option).
		    p	pass unlabelled 8-bit input, but convert labelled
			8BITMIME input to 7BIT as required (default).
		    s	strict adherence: reject unlabelled 8-bit input,
			convert 8BITMIME to 7BIT as required.  The F=8
			flag is ignored.
		Unlabelled 8-bit data is rejected in mode `s' regardless of
			the setting of F=8.
	Add new internal class 'n', which is the set of MIME Content-Types
		which can not be 8 to 7 bit encoded because of other
		considerations.  Types "multipart/*" and "message/*" are
		never directly encoded (although their components can be).
	Add new internal class 's', which is the set of subtypes of the
		MIME message/* content type that can be treated as though
		they are an RFC822 message.  It is predefined to have
		"rfc822".  Suggested By Kari Hurtta.
	Add new internal class 'e'.  This is the set of MIME
		Content-Transfer-Encodings that can be converted to
		a seven bit format (Quoted-Printable or Base64).  It is
		preinitialized to contain "7bit", "8bit", and "binary".
	Add C=charset mailer parameter and the the DefaultCharSet option (no
		short name) to set the default character set to use in the
		Content-Type: header when doing encoding of an 8-bit message
		which isn't marked as MIME into MIME format.  If the C=
		parameter is set on the Envelope From address, use that as
		the default encoding; else use the DefaultCharSet option.
		If neither is set, it defaults to "unknown-8bit" as
		suggested by RFC 1428 section 3.
	Allow ``U=user:group'' field in mailer definition to set a default
		user and group that a mailer will be executed as.  This
		overrides the 'u' and 'g' options, and if the `F=S' flag is
		also set, it is the uid/gid that will always be used (that
		is, the controlling address is ignored).  The values may be
		numeric or symbolic; if only a symbolic user is given (no
		group) that user's default group in the passwd file is used
		as the group.  Based on code donated by Chip Rosenthal of
		Unicom.
	Allow `u' option to also accept user:group as a value, in the same
		fashion as the U= mailer option.
	Add the symbolic time zone name in the Arpanet format dates (as
		a comment).  This adds a new compile-time configuration
		flag: TZ_TYPE can be set to TZ_TM_NAME (use the value
		of (struct tm *)->tm_name), TZ_TM_ZONE (use the value
		of (struct tm *)->tm_zone), TZ_TZNAME (use extern char
		*tzname[(struct tm *)->tm_isdst]), TZ_TIMEZONE (use
		timezone()), or TZ_NONE (don't include the comment).  Code
		from Chip Rosenthal.
	The "Timeout" option (formerly "r") is extended to allow suboptions.
		For example,
		    O Timeout.helo = 2m
		There are also two new suboptions "queuereturn" and
		"queuewarn"; these subsume the old T option.  Thus, to
		set them both the preferred new syntax is
		    O Timeout.queuereturn = 5d
		    O Timeout.queuewarn = 4h
	Sort queue by host name instead of by message priority if the
		QueueSortOrder option (no short name) is set is set to
		``host''.  This makes better use of the connection cache,
		but may delay more ``interactive'' messages behind large
		backlogs under some circumstances.  This is probably a
		good option if you have high speed links or don't do lots
		of ``batch'' messages, but less good if you are using
		something like PPP on a 14.4 modem.  Based on code
		contributed by Roy Mongiovi of Georgia Tech (my main
		contribution was to make it configurable).
	Save i-number of df file in qf file to simplify rebuilding of queue
		after disastrous disk crash.  Suggested by Kyle Jones of
		UUNET; closely based on code from KJS DECWRL code written
		by Paul Vixie.  NOTA BENE: The qf files produced by 8.7
		are NOT back compatible with 8.6 -- that is, you can convert
		from 8.6 to 8.7, but not the other direction.
	Add ``F=d'' mailer flag to disable all use of angle brackets in
		route-addrs in envelopes; this is because in some cases
		they can be sent to the shell, which interprets them as
		I/O redirection.
	Don't include error file (option E) with return-receipts; this
		can be confusing.
	Don't send "Warning: cannot send" messages to owner-* or
		*-request addresses.  Suggested by Christophe Wolfhugel
		of the Institut Pasteur, Paris.
	Allow -O command line flag to set long form options.
	Add "MinQueueAge" option to set the minimum time between attempts
		to run the queue.  For example, if the queue interval
		(-q value) is five minutes, but the minimum queue age
		is fifteen minutes, jobs won't be tried more often than
		once every fifteen minutes.  This can be used to give
		you more responsiveness if your delivery mode is set to
		queue-only.
	Allow "fileopen" timeout (default: 60 seconds) for opening
		:include: and .forward files.
	Add "-k", "-v", and "-z" flags to map definitions; these set the
		key field name, the value field name, and the field
		delimiter.  The field delimiter can be a single character
		or the sequence "\t" or "\n" for tab or newline.
		These are for use by NIS+ and similar access methods.
	Change maps to always strip quotes before lookups; the -q flag
		turns off this behavior.  Suggested by Motonori Nakamura.
	Add "nisplus" map class.  Takes -k and -v flags to choose the
		key and value field names respectively.  Code donated by
		Sun Microsystems.
	Add "hesiod" map class.  The "file name" is used as the
		"HesiodNameType" parameter to hes_resolve(3).  Returns the
		first value found for the match.  Code donated by Scott
		Hutton of Indiana University.
	Add "netinfo" (NeXT NetInfo) map class.  Maps can have a -k flag to
		specify the name of the property that is searched as the
		key and a -v flag to specify the name of the property that
		is returned as the value (defaults to "members").  The
		default map is "/aliases".  Some code based on code
		contributed by Robert La Ferla of Hot Software.
	Add "text" map class.  This does slow, linear searches through
		text files.  The -z flag specifies a column delimiter
		(defaults to any sequence of white space), the -k flag
		sets the key column number, and the -v flag sets the
		value column number.  Lines beginning with `#' are treated
		as comments.
	Add "program" map class to execute arbitrary programs.  The search
		key is presented as the last argument; the output is one
		line read from the programs standard output.  Exit statuses
		are from sysexits.h.
	Add "sequence" map class -- searches maps in sequence until it
		finds a match.  For example, the declarations:
		    Kmap1 ...
		    Kmap2 ...
		    Kmapseq sequence map1 map2
		defines a map "mapseq" that first searches map1; if the
		value is found it is returned immediately, otherwise
		map2 is searched and the value returned.
	Add "switch" map class.  This is much like "sequence" except that
		the ordering is fetched from an external file, usually
		the system service switch.  The parameter is the name of
		the service to switch on, and the maps that it will use
		are the name of the switch map followed by ".service_type".
		For example, if the declaration of the map is
		    Ksample switch hosts
		and the system service switch specifies that hosts are
		looked up using dns and nis in that order, then this is
		equivalent to
		    Ksample sequence sample.dns sample.nis
		The subordinate maps (sample.*) must already be defined.
	Add "user" map class -- looks up users using getpwnam.  Takes a
		"-v field" flag on the definition that tells what passwd
		entry to return -- legal values are name, passwd, uid, gid,
		gecos, dir, and shell.  Generally expected to be used with
		the -m (matchonly) flag.
	Add "bestmx" map class -- returns the best MX value for the host
		listed as the value.  If there are several "best" MX records
		for this host, one will be chosen at random.
	Add "userdb" map class -- looks up entries in the user database.
		The "file name" is actually the tag that will be used,
		typically "mailname".  If there are multiple entries
		matching the name, the one chosen is undefined.
	Add multiple queue timeouts (both return and warning).  These are
		set by the Precedence: or Priority: header fields to one of
		three values.  If a Priority: is set and has value "normal",
		"urgent", or "non-urgent" the corresponding timeouts are
		used.  If no priority is set, the Precedence: is consulted;
		if negative, non-urgent timeouts are used; if greater than
		zero, urgent timeouts are used.  Otherwise, normal timeouts
		are used.  The timeouts are set by setting the six timeouts
		queue{warn,return}.{urgent,normal,non-urgent}.
	Fix problem when a mail address is resolved to a $#error mailer
		with a temporary failure indication; it works in SMTP,
		but when delivering locally the mail is silently discarded.
		This patch, from Kyle Jones of UUNET, bounces it instead
		of queueing it (queueing is very hard).
	When using /etc/hosts or NIS-style lookups, don't assume that
		the first name in the list is the best one -- instead,
		search for the first one with a dot.  For example, if
		an /etc/hosts entry reads
		    128.32.149.68	mammoth mammoth.CS.Berkeley.EDU
		this change will use the second name as the canonical
		machine name instead of the initial, unqualified name.
	Change dequote map to replace spaces in quoted text with a value
		indicated by the -s flag on the dequote map definition.
		For example, ``Mdequote dequote -s_'' will change
		"Foo Bar" into an unquoted Foo_Bar instead of leaving it
		quoted (because of the space character).  Suggested by Dan
		Oscarsson for use in X.400 addresses.
	Implement long macro names as ${name}; long class names can
		be similarly referenced as $={name} and $~{name}.
		Definitions are (e.g.) ``D{name}value''.  Names that have
		a leading lower case letter or punctuation characters are
		reserved for internal use by sendmail; i.e., config files
		should use names that begin with a capital letter.  Based
		on code contributed by Dan Oscarsson.
	Fix core dump if getgrgid returns a null group list (as opposed
		to an empty group list, that is, a pointer to a list
		with no members).  Fix from Andrew Chang of Sun Microsystems.
	Fix possible core dump if malloc fails -- if the malloc in xalloc
		failed, it called syserr which called newstr which called
		xalloc....  The newstr is now avoided for "panic" messages.
		Reported by Stuart Kemp of James Cook University.
	Improve connection cache timeouts; previously, they were not even
		checked if you were delivering to anything other than an
		IPC-connected host, so a series of (say) local mail
		deliveries could cause cached connections to be open
		much longer than the specified timeout.
	If an incoming message exceeds the maximum message size, stop
		writing the incoming bytes to the queue data file, since
		this can fill your mqueue partition -- this is a possible
		denial-of-service attack.
	Don't reject all numeric local user names unless HESIOD is
		defined.  It turns out that Posix allows all-numeric
		user names.  Fix from Tony Sanders of BSDI.
	Add service switch support.  If the local OS has a service
		switch (e.g., /etc/nsswitch.conf on Solaris or /etc/svc.conf
		on DEC systems) that will be used; otherwise, it falls back
		to using a local mechanism based on the ServiceSwitchFile
		option (default: /etc/service.switch).  For example, if the
		service switch lists "files" and "nis" for the aliases
		service, that will be the default lookup order.  the "files"
		("local" on DEC) service type expands to any alias files
		you listed in the configuration file, even if they aren't
		actually file lookups.
	Option I (NameServerOptions) no longer sets the "UseNameServer"
		variable which tells whether or not DNS should be considered
		canonical.  This is now determined based on whether or not
		"dns" is in the service list for "hosts".
	Add preliminary support for the ESMTP "DSN" extension (Delivery
		Status Notifications).  DSN notifications override
		Return-Receipt-To: headers, which are bogus anyhow --
		support for them has been removed.
	Add T=mts-name-type/address-type/diagnostic-type keyletter to mailer
		definitions to define the types used in DSN returns for
		MTA names, addresses, and diagnostics respectively.
	Extend heuristic to force running in ESMTP mode to look for the
		five-character string "ESMTP" anywhere in the 220 greeting
		message (not just the second line).  This is to provide
		better compatibility with other ESMTP servers.
	Print sequence number of job when running the queue so you can
		easily see how much progress you have made.  Suggested
		by Peter Wemm of DIALix.
	Map newlines to spaces in logged message-ids; some versions of
		syslog truncate the rest of the line after newlines.
		Suggested by Fletcher Mattox of U. Texas.
	Move up forking for job runs so that if a message is split into
		multiple envelopes you don't get "fork storms" -- this
		also improves the connection cache utilization.
	Accept "<<>>", "<<<>>>", and so forth as equivalent to "<>" for
		the purposes of refusing to send error returns.  Suggested
		by Motonori Nakamura of Ritsumeikan University.
	Relax rules on when a file can be written when referenced from
		the aliases file: use the default uid/gid instead of the
		real uid/gid.  This allows you to create a file owned by
		and writable only by the default uid/gid that will work
		all the time (without having the setuid bit set).  Change
		suggested by Shau-Ping Lo and Andrew Cheng of Sun
		Microsystems.
	Add "DialDelay" option (no short name) to provide an "extra"
		delay for dial on demand systems.  If this is non-zero
		and a connect fails, sendmail will wait this long and
		then try again.  If it takes longer than the kernel
		timeout interval to establish the connection, this
		option can give the network software time to establish
		the link.  The default units are seconds.
	Move logging of sender information to be as early as possible;
		previously, it could be delayed a while for SMTP mail
		sent to aliases.  Suggested by Brad Knowles of the
		Defense Information Systems Agency.
	Call res_init() before setting RES_DEBUG; this is required by
		BIND 4.9.3, or so I'm told.  From Douglas Anderson of
		the National Computer Security Center.
	Add xdelay= field in logs -- this is a transaction delay, telling
		you how long it took to deliver to this address on the
		last try.  It is intended to be used for sorting mailing
		lists to favor "quick" addresses.  Provided for use by
		the mailprio scripts (see below).
	If a map cannot be opened, and that map is non-optional, and
		an address requires that map for resolution, queue the
		map instead of bouncing it.  This involves creating a
		pseudo-class of maps called "bogus-map" -- if a required
		map cannot be opened, the class is changed to bogus-map;
		all queries against bogus-map return "tempfail".  The
		bogus-map class is not directly accessible.  A sample
		implementation was donated by Jem Taylor of Glasgow
		University Computing Service.
	Fix a possible core dump when mailing to a program that talks
		SMTP on its standard input.  Fix from Keith Moore of
		the University of Kentucky.
	Make it possible to resolve filenames to $#local $: @ /filename;
		previously, the "@" would cause it to not be recognized
		as a file.  Problem noted by Brian Hill of U.C. Davis.
	Accept a -1 signal to re-exec the daemon.  This only works if
		argv[0] is a full path to sendmail.
	Fix bug in "addr=..." field in O option on little-endian machines
		-- the network number wasn't being converted to network
		byte order.  Patch from Kurt Lidl of Pix Technologies
		Corporation.
	Pre-initialize the resolver early on; this is to avoid a bug with
		BIND 4.9.3 that can cause the _res.retry field to get
		reset to zero, causing all name server lookups to time
		out.  Fix from Matt Day of Artisoft.
	Restore T line (trusted users) in config file -- but instead of
		locking out the -f flag, they just tell whether or not
		an X-Authentication-Warning: will be added.  This really
		just creates new entries in class 't', so "Ft/file/name"
		can be used to read trusted user names from a file.
		Trusted users are also allowed to execute programs even
		if they have a shell that isn't in /etc/shells.
	Improve NEWDB alias file rebuilding so it will create them
		properly if they do not already exist.  This had been
		a MAYBENEXTRELEASE feature in 8.6.9.
	Check for @:@ entry in NIS maps before starting up to avoid
		(but not prevent, sigh) race conditions.  This ought to
		be handled properly in ypserv, but isn't.  Suggested by
		Michael Beirne of Motorola.
	Refuse connections if there isn't enough space on the filesystem
		holding the queue.  Contributed by Robert Dana of Wolf
		Communications.
	Skip checking for directory permissions in the path to a file
		when checking for file permissions iff setreuid()
		succeeded -- it is unnecessary in that case.  This avoids
		significant performance problems when looking for .forward
		files.  Based on a suggestion by Win Bent of USC.
	Allow symbolic ruleset names.  Syntax can be "Sname" to get an
		arbitrary ruleset number assigned or "Sname = integer"
		to assign a specific ruleset number.  Reference is
		$>name_or_number.  Names can be composed of alphas, digits,
		underscore, or hyphen (first character must be non-numeric).
	Allow -o flag on AliasFile lines to make the alias file optional.
		From Bryan Costales of ICSI.
	Add NoRecipientAction option to handle the case where there is
		no legal recipient header in the message.  It can take
		on values:
		  None			Leave the message as is.  The
					message will be passed on even
					though it is in technically
					illegal syntax.
		  Add-To		Add a To: header with any
					recipients that it can find from
					the envelope.  This risks exposing
					Bcc: recipients.
		  Add-Apparently-To	Add an Apparently-To: header.  This
					has almost no redeeming social value,
					and is provided only for back
					compatibility.
		  Add-To-Undisclosed	Add a header reading
					To: undisclosed-recipients:;
					which will have the effect of
					making the message legal without
					exposing Bcc: recipients.
		  Add-Bcc		To add an empty Bcc: header.
					There is a chance that mailers down
					the line will delete this header,
					which could cause exposure of Bcc:
					recipients.
		The default is NoRecipientAction=None.
	Truncate (rather than delete) Bcc: lines in the header.  This
		should prevent later sendmails (at least, those that don't
		themselves delete Bcc:) from considering this message to
		be non-conforming -- although it does imply that non-blind
		recipients can see that a Bcc: was sent, albeit not to whom.
	Add SafeFileEnvironment option.  If declared, files named as delivery
		targets must be regular files in addition to the regular
		checks.  Also, if the option is non-null then it is used as
		the name of a directory that is used as a chroot(2)
		environment for the delivery; the file names listed in an
		alias or forward should include the name of this root.
		For example, if you run with
			O SafeFileEnvironment=/arch
		then aliases should reference "/arch/rest/of/path".  If a
		value is given, sendmail also won't try to save to
		/usr/tmp/dead.letter (instead it just leaves the job in the
		queue as Qfxxxxxx).  Inspired by *Hobbit*'s sendmail patch kit.
	Support -A flag for alias files; this will comma concatenate like
		entries.  For example, given the aliases:
			list: member1
			list: member2
		and an alias file declared as:
			OAhash:-A /etc/aliases
		the final alias inserted will be "list: member1,member2";
		without -A you will get an error on the second and subsequent
		alias for "list".  Contributed by Bryan Costales of ICSI.
	Line-buffer transcript file.  Suggested by Liudvikas Bukys.
	Fix a problem that could cause very long addresses to core dump in
		some special circumstances.  Problem pointed out by Allan
		Johannesen.
	(Internal change.)  Change interface to expand() (macro expansion)
		to be simpler and more consistent.
	Delete check for funny qf file names.  This didn't really give
		any extra security and caused some people some problems.
		(If you -really- want this, define PICKY_QF_NAME_CHECK
		at compile time.)  Suggested by Kyle Jones of UUNET.
	(Internal change.)  Change EF_NORETURN to EF_NO_BODY_RETN and
		merge with DSN code; this is simpler and more consistent.
		This may affect some people who have written their own
		checkcompat() routine.
	(Internal change.)  Eliminate `D' line in qf file.  The df file
		is now assumed to be the same name as the qf file (with
		the `q' changed to a `d', of course).
	Avoid forking for delivery if all recipient mailers are marked as
		"expensive" -- this can be a major cost on some systems.
		Essentially, this forces sendmail into "queue only" mode
		if all it is going to do is queue anyway.
	Avoid sending a null message in some rather unusual circumstances
		(specifically, the RCPT command returns a temporary
		failure but the connection is lost before the DATA
		command).  Fix from Scott Hammond of Secure Computing
		Corporation.
	Change makesendmail to use a somewhat more rational naming scheme:
		Makefiles and obj directories are named $os.$rel.$arch,
		where $os is the operating system (e.g., SunOS), $rel is
		the release number (e.g., 5.3), and $arch is the machine
		architecture (e.g., sun4).  Any of these can be omitted,
		and anything after the first dot in a release number can
		be replaced with "x" (e.g., SunOS.4.x.sun4).  The previous
		version used $os.$arch.$rel and was rather less general.
	Change makesendmail to do a "make depend" in the target directory
		when it is being created.  This involves adding an empty
		"depend:" entry in most Makefiles.
	Ignore IDENT return value if the OSTYPE field returns "OTHER",
		as indicated by RFC 1413.  Pointed out by Kari Hurtta
		of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
	Fix problem that could cause multiple responses to DATA command
		on header syntax errors (e.g., lines beginning with colons).
		Problem noted by Jens Thomassen of the University of Oslo.
	Don't let null bytes in headers cause truncation of the rest of
		the header.
	Log Authentication-Warning:s.  Suggested by Motonori Nakamura.
	Increase timeouts on message data puts to allow time for receivers
		to canonify addresses in headers on the fly.  This is still
		a rather ugly heuristic.  From Motonori Nakamura.
	Add "HasWildcardMX" suboption to ResolverOptions; if set, MX
		records are not used when canonifying names, and when MX
		lookups are done for addressing they must be fully
		qualified.  This is useful if you have a wildcard MX record,
		although it may cause other problems.  In general, don't use
		wildcard MX records.  Patch from Motonori Nakamura.
	Eliminate default two-line SMTP greeting message.  Instead of
		adding an extra "ESMTP spoken here" line, the word "ESMTP"
		is added between the first and second word of the first
		line of the greeting message (i.e., immediately after the
		host name).  This eliminates the need for the BROKEN_SMTP_PEERS
		compile flag.  Old sendmails won't see the ESMTP, but that's
		acceptable because SIZE was the only useful extension that
		old sendmails understand.
	Avoid gethostbyname calls on UNIX domain sockets during SIGUSR1
		invoked state dumps.  From Masaharu Onishi.
	Allow on-line comments in .forward and :include: files; they are
		introduced by the string "<LWSP>#@#<LWSP>", where <LWSP>
		is a space or a tab.  This is intended for native
		representation of non-ASCII sets such as Japanese, where
		existing encodings would be unreadable or would lose
		data -- for example,
		 <motonori@cs.ritsumei.ac.jp> NAKAMURA Motonori
					(romanized/less information)
		 <motonori@cs.ritsumei.ac.jp> =?ISO-2022-JP?B?GyRCQ2ZCPBsoQg==?=
					      =?ISO-2022-JP?B?GyRCQUdFNRsoQg==?=
					(with MIME encoding, not human readable)
		 <motonori@cs.ritsumei.ac.jp> #@# ^[$BCfB<^[(B ^[$BAGE5^[(B
					(native encoding with ISO-2022-JP)
		The last form is human readable in the Japanese environment.
		Based on a fix from (surprise!) Motonori Nakamura.
	Don't make SMTP error returns on MAIL FROM: line be "sticky" for all
		messages to that host; these are most frequently associated
		with addresses rather than the host, with the exception of
		421 (service shutting down).  The effect was to cause queues
		to sometimes take an excessive time to flush.  Reported by
		Robert Sargent of Southern Geographics Technologies and
		Eric Prestemon of American University.
	Add Nice=N mailer option to set the niceness at which a mailer will
		run.  This is actually a relative niceness (that is, an
		increment on the background value).
	Log queue runs that are skipped due to high loads.  They are logged
		at LOG_INFO priority iff the log level is > 8.  Contributed
		by Bruce Nagel of Data General.
	Allow the error mailer to accept a DSN-style error status code
		instead of an sysexits status code in the host part.
		Anything with a dot will be interpreted as a DSN-style code.
	Add new mailer flag: F=3 will tell translations to Quoted-Printable
		to encode characters that might be munged by an EBCDIC system
		in addition to the set required by RFC 1521.  The additional
		characters are !, ", #, $, @, [, \, ], ^, `, {, |, }, and ~.
		(Think of "IBM 360" as the mnemonic for this flag.)
	Change check for mailing to files to look for a pathname of [FILE]
		rather than looking for the mailer named *file*.  The mapping
		of leading slashes still goes to the *file* mailer.  This
		allows you to implement the *file* mailer as a separate
		program, for example, to insert a Content-Length: header
		or do special security policy.  However, note that the usual
		initial checking for the file permissions is still done, and
		the program in question needs to be very careful about how
		it does the file write to avoid security problems.
	Be able to read ~root/.forward even if the path isn't accessible to
		regular users.  This is disrecommended because sendmail
		sometimes does not run as root (e.g., when an unsafe option
		is specified on the command line), but should otherwise be
		safe because .forward files must be owned by the user for
		whom mail is being forwarded, and cannot be a symbolic link.
		Suggested by Forrest Aldrich of Wang Laboratories.
	Add new "HostsFile" option that is the pathname to the /etc/hosts
		file.  This is used for canonifying hostnames when the
		service type is "files".
	Implement programs on F (read class from file) line.  The syntax is
		Fc|/path/to/program to read the output from the program
		into class "c".
	Probe the network interfaces to find alternate names for this
		host.  Requires the SIOCGIFCONF ioctl call.  Code
		contributed by SunSoft.
	Add "E" configuration line to set or propagate environment
		variables into children.  "E<envar>" will propagate
		the named variable from the environment when sendmail
		was invoked into any children it calls; "E<envar>=<value>"
		sets the named variable to the indicated value.  Any
		variables not explicitly named will not be in the child
		environment.  However, sendmail still forces an
		"AGENT=sendmail" environment variable, in part to enforce
		at least one environment variable, since many programs and
		libraries die horribly if this is not guaranteed.
	Change heuristic for rebuilding both NEWDB and NDBM versions of
		alias databases -- new algorithm looks for the substring
		"/yp/" in the file name.  This is more portable and involves
		less overhead.  Suggested by Motonori Nakamura.
	Dynamically allocate the queue work list so that you don't lose
		jobs in large queue runs.  The old QUEUESIZE compile parameter
		is replaced by QUEUESEGSIZE (the unit of allocation, which
		should not need to be changed) and the MaxQueueRunSize option,
		which is the absolute maximum number of jobs that will ever
		be handled in a single queue run.  Based on code contributed
		by Brian Coan of the Institute for Global Communications.
	Log message when a message is dropped because it exceeds the maximum
		message size.  Suggested by Leo Bicknell of Virginia Tech.
	Allow trusted users (those on a T line or in $=t) to use -bs without
		an X-Authentication-Warning: added.  Suggested by Mark Thomas
		of Mark G. Thomas Consulting.
	Announce state of compile flags on -d0.1 (-d0.10 throws in the
		OS-dependent defines).  The old semantic of -d0.1 to not
		run the daemon in background has been moved to -d99.100,
		and the old 52.5 flag (to avoid disconnect() from closing
		all output files) has been moved to 52.100.  This makes
		things more consistent (flags below .100 don't change
		semantics) and separates out the backgrounding so that
		it doesn't happen automatically on other unrelated debugging
		flags.
	If -t is used but no addresses are found in the header, give an
		error message rather than just doing nothing.  Fix from
		Motonori Nakamura.
	On systems (like SunOS) where the effective gid is not necessarily
		included in the group list returned by getgroups(), the
		`restrictmailq' option could sometimes cause an authorized
		user to not be able to use `mailq'.  Fix from Charles Hannum
		of MIT.
	Allow symbolic service names for [IPC] mailers.  Suggested by
		Gerry Magennis of Logica International.
	Add DontExpandCnames option to prevent $[ ... $] from expanding CNAMEs
		when running DNS.  For example, if the name FTP.Foo.ORG is
		a CNAME for Cruft.Foo.ORG, then when sitting on a machine in
		the Foo.ORG domain a lookup of "FTP" returns "Cruft.Foo.ORG"
		if this option is not set, or "FTP.Foo.ORG" if it is set.
		This is technically illegal under RFC 822 and 1123, but the
		IETF is moving toward legalizing it.  Note that turning on
		this option is not sufficient to guarantee that a downstream
		neighbor won't rewrite the address for you.
	Add "-m" flag to makesendmail script -- this tells you what object
		directory and Makefile it will use, but doesn't actually do
		the make.
	Do some additional checking on the contents of the qf file to try
		to detect attacks against the qf file.  In particular,
		abort on any line beginning "From ", and add an "end of
		file" line -- any data after that line is prohibited.
	Always use /etc/sendmail.cf, regardless of the arbitrary vendor
		choices.  This can be overridden in the Makefile by using
		either -DUSE_VENDOR_CF_PATH to get the vendor location
		(to the extent that we know it) or by defining
		_PATH_SENDMAILCF (which is a "hard override").  This allows
		sendmail 8 to have more consistent installation instructions.
	Allow macros on `K' line in config file.  Suggested by Andrew Chang
		of Sun Microsystems.
	Improved symbol table hash function from Eric Wassenaar.  This one
		is at least 50% faster.
	Fix problem that didn't notice that timeout on file open was a
		transient error.  Fix from Larry Parmelee of Cornell
		University.
	Allow comments (lines beginning with a `#') in files read for
		classes.  Suggested by Motonori Nakamura.
	Make SIGINT (usually ^C) in test mode return to the prompt instead
		of dropping out entirely.  This makes testing some of the
		name server lookups easier to deal with when there are
		hung servers.  From Motonori Nakamura.
	Add new ${opMode} macro that is set to the current operation mode
		(e.g., `s' for -bs, `t' for -bt, etc.).  Suggested by
		Claude Marinier <MARINIER@emp.ewd.dreo.dnd.ca>.
	Add new delivery mode (Odd) that defers all map lookups to queue runs.
		Kind of like queue-only mode (Odq) except it tries to avoid
		any external service requests; for dial-on-demand hosts that
		want to minimize DNS lookups when mail is being queued.  For
		this to work you will also have to make sure that gethostbyname
		of your local host name does not do a DNS lookup.
	Improved handling of "out of space" conditions from John Myers of
		Carnegie Mellon.
	Improved security for mailing to files on systems that have fchmod(2)
		support.
	Improve "cannot send message for N days" message -- now says "could
		not send for past N days".  Suggested by Tom Moore of AT&T
		Global Information Solutions.
	Less misleading Subject: line on messages sent to postmaster only.
		From Motonori Nakamura.
	Avoid duplicate error messages on bad command line flags.  From
		Motonori Nakamura.
	Better error message for case where ruleset 0 falls off the end
		or otherwise does not resolve to a canonical triple.
	Fix a problem that could cause multiple bounce messages if a bad
		address was sent along with a good address to an SMTP
		site where that SMTP site returned a 4yz code in response
		to the final dot of the data.  Problem reported by David
		James of British Telecom.
	Add "volatile" declarations so that gcc -O2 will work.  Patches
		from Alexander Dupuy of System Management ARTS.
	Delete duplicates in MX lists -- believe it or not, there are sites
		that list the same host twice in an MX list.  This deletion
		only works on adjacent preferences, so an MX list that
		had A=5, B=10, A=15 would leave both As, but one that had
		A=5, A=10, B=15 would reduce to A, B.  This is intentional,
		just in case there is something weird I haven't thought of.
		Suggested by Barry Shein of Software Tool & Die.
	SECURITY: .forward files cannot be symbolic links.  If they are,
		a bad guy can read your private files.
	PORTABILITY FIXES:
		Solaris 2 from Rob McMahon <cudcv@csv.warwick.ac.uk>.
		System V Release 4 from Motonori Nakamura of Ritsumeikan
			University.  This expands the disk size
			checking to include all (?) SVR4 configurations.
		System V Release 4 from Kimmo Suominen -- initgroups(3)
			and setrlimit(2) are both available.
		System V Release 4 from sob@sculley.ffg.com -- some versions
			apparently "have EX_OK defined in other headerfiles."
		Linux Makefile typo.
		Linux getusershell(3) is broken in Slackware 2.0 --
			from Andrew Pam of Xanadu Australia.
		More Linux tweaking from John Kennedy of California State
			University, Chico.
		Cray changes from Eric Wassenaar:  ``On Cray, shorts,
			ints, and longs are all 64 bits, and all structs
			are multiples of 64 bits.  This means that the
			sizeof operator returns only multiples of 8.
			This requires adaptation of code that really
			deals with 32 bit or 16 bit fields, such as IP
			addresses or nameserver fields.''
		DG/UX 5.4.3 from Mark T. Robinson <mtr@ornl.gov>.  To
			get the old behavior, use -DDGUX_5_4_2.
		DG/UX hack: add _FORCE_MAIL_LOCAL_=yes environment
			variable to fix bogus /bin/mail behavior.
		Tandem NonStop-UX from Rick McCarty <mccarty@mpd.tandem.com>.
			This also cleans up some System V Release 4 compile
			problems.
		Solaris 2: sendmail.cw file should be in /etc/mail to
			match all the other configuration files.  Fix
			from Glenn Barry of Emory University.
		Solaris 2.3: compile problem in conf.c.  Fix from Alain
			Nissen of the University of Liege, Belgium.
		Ultrix: freespace calculation was incorrect.  Fix from
			Takashi Kizu of Osaka University.
		SVR4: running in background gets a SIGTTOU because the
			emulation code doesn't realize that "getpeername"
			doesn't require reading the file.  Fix from Peter
			Wemm of DIALix.
		Solaris 2.3: due to an apparent bug in the socket emulation
			library, sockets can get into a "wedged" state where
			they just return EPROTO; closing and re-opening the
			socket clears the problem.  Fix from Bob Manson
			of Ohio State University.
		Hitachi 3050R & 3050RX running HI-UX/WE2: portability
			fixes from Akihiro Hashimoto ("Hash") of Chiba
			University.
		AIX changes to allow setproctitle to work from Rainer Schpf
			of Zentrum fr Datenverarbeitung der Universitt
			Mainz.
		AIX changes for load average from Ed Ravin of NASA/Goddard.
		SCO Unix from Chip Rosenthal of Unicom (code was using the
			wrong statfs call).
		ANSI C fixes from Adam Glass (NetBSD project).
		Stardent Titan/ANSI C fixes from Kate Hedstrom of Rutgers
			University.
		DG-UX fixes from Bruce Nagel of Data General.
		IRIX64 updates from Mark Levinson of the University of
			Rochester Medical Center.
		Altos System V (``the first UNIX/XENIX merge the Altos
			did for their Series 1000 & Series 2000 line;
			their merged code was licensed back to AT&T and
			Microsoft and became System V release 3.2'') from
			Tim Rice <timr@crl.com>.
		OSF/1 running on Intel Paragon from Jeff A. Earickson
			<jeff@ssd.intel.com> of Intel Scalable Systems
			Division.
		Amdahl UTS System V 2.1.5 (SVr3-based) from Janet Jackson

		ConvexOS 11.0 from Christophe Wolfhugel.
		IRIX 4.0.5 from David Ashton-Reader of CADcentre.
		ISC UNIX from J. J. Bailey.
		HP-UX 9.xx on the 8xx series machines from Remy Giraud
			of Meteo France.
		HP-UX configuration from Tom Lane <tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us>.
		IRIX 5.2 and 5.3 from Kari E. Hurtta.
		FreeBSD 2.0 from Mike Hickey of Federal Data Corporation.

		NeXT 2.1 from Bryan Costales.
		AUX patch thanks to Mike Erwin of Apple Computer.
		HP-UX 10.0 from John Beck of Hewlett-Packard.
		Ultrix: allow -DBROKEN_RES_SEARCH=0 if you are using a
			non-DEC resolver.  Suggested by Allan Johannesen.
		UnixWare 2.0 fixes from Petr Lampa of the Technical
			University of Brno (Czech Republic).
		KSR OS 1.2.2 support from Todd Miller of the University
			of Colorado.
		UX4800 support from Kazuhisa Shimizu of NEC.
	MAKEMAP: allow -d flag to allow insertion of duplicate aliases
		in type ``btree'' maps.  The semantics of this are undefined
		for regular maps, but it can be useful for the user database.
	MAKEMAP: lock database file while rebuilding to avoid sendmail
		lookups while the rebuild is going on.  There is a race
		condition between the open(... O_TRUNC ...) and the lock
		on the file, but it should be quite small.
	SMRSH: sendmail restricted shell added to the release.  This can
		be used as an alternative to /bin/sh for the "prog" mailer,
		giving the local administrator more control over what
		programs can be run from sendmail.
	MAIL.LOCAL: add this local mailer to the tape.  It is not really
		part of the release proper, and isn't fully supported; in
		particular, it does not run on System V based systems and
		never will.
	CONTRIB: a patch to rmail.c from Bill Gianopoulos of Raytheon
		to allow rmail to compile on systems that don't have
		function prototypes and systems that don't have snprintf.
	CONTRIB: add the "mailprio" scripts that will help you sort mailing
		lists by transaction delay times so that addresses that
		respond quickly get sent first.  This is to prevent very
		sluggish servers from delaying other peoples' mail.
		Contributed by Tony Sanders of BSDI.
	CONTRIB: add the "bsdi.mc" file as contributed by Tony Sanders
		of BSDI.  This has a lot of comments to help people out.
	CONFIG: Don't have .mc files include(../m4/cf.m4) -- instead,
		put this on the m4 command line.  On GNU m4 (which
		supports the __file__ primitive) you can run m4 in an
		arbitrary directory -- use either:
			m4 ${CFDIR}/m4/cf.m4 config.mc > config.cf
		or
			m4 -I${CFDIR} m4/cf.m4 config.mc > config.cf
		On other versions of m4 that don't support __file__, you
		can use:
			m4 -D_CF_DIR_=${CFDIR}/ ${CFDIR}/m4/cf.m4 ...
		(Note the trailing slash on the _CF_DIR_ definition.)
		Old versions of m4 will default to _CF_DIR_=.. for back
		compatibility.
	CONFIG: fix mail from <> so it will properly convert to
		MAILER-DAEMON on local addresses.
	CONFIG: fix code that was supposed to catch colons in host
		names.  Problem noted by John Gardiner Myers of CMU.
	CONFIG: allow use of SMTP_MAILER_MAX in nullclient configuration.
		From Paul Riddle of the University of Maryland, Baltimore
		County.
	CONFIG: Catch and reject "." as a host address.
	CONFIG: Generalize domaintable to look up all domains, not
		just unqualified ones.
	CONFIG: Delete OLD_SENDMAIL support -- as near as I can tell, it
		was never used and didn't work anyway.
	CONFIG: Set flags A, w, 5, :, /, |, and @ on the "local" mailer
		and d on all mailers in the UUCP class.
	CONFIG: Allow "user+detail" to be aliased specially: it will first
		look for an alias for "user+detail", then for "user+*", and
		finally for "user".  This is intended for forwarding mail
		for system aliases such as root and postmaster to a
		centralized hub.
	CONFIG: add confEIGHT_BIT_HANDLING to set option 8 (see above).
	CONFIG: add smtp8 mailer; this has the F=8 (just-send-8) flag set.
		The F=8 flag is also set on the "relay" mailer, since
		this is expected to be another sendmail.
	CONFIG: avoid qualifying all UUCP addresses sent via SMTP with
		the name of the UUCP_RELAY -- in some cases, this is the
		wrong value (e.g., when we have local UUCP connections),
		and this can create unreplyable addresses.  From Chip
		Rosenthal of Unicom.
	CONFIG: add confRECEIVED_HEADER to change the format of the
		Received: header inserted into all messages.  Suggested by
		Gary Mills of the University of Manitoba.
	CONFIG: Make "notsticky" the default; use FEATURE(stickyhost)
		to get the old behavior.  I did this upon observing
		that almost everyone needed this feature, and that the
		concept I was trying to make happen didn't work with
		some user agents anyway.  FEATURE(notsticky) still works,
		but it is a no-op.
	CONFIG: Add LUSER_RELAY -- the host to which unrecognized user
		names are sent, rather than immediately diagnosing them
		as User Unknown.
	CONFIG: Add SMTP_MAILER_ARGS, ESMTP_MAILER_ARGS, SMTP8_MAILER_ARGS,
		and RELAY_MAILER_ARGS to set the arguments for the
		indicated mailers.  All default to "IPC $h".  Patch from
		Larry Parmelee of Cornell University.
	CONFIG: pop mailer needs F=n flag to avoid "annoying side effects
		on the client side" and F=P to get an appropriate
		return-path.  From Kimmo Suominen.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(local_procmail) to use the procmail program
		as the local mailer.  For addresses of the form "user+detail"
		the "detail" part is passed to procmail via the -a flag.
		Contributed by Kimmo Suominen.
	CONFIG: add MAILER(procmail) to add an interface to procmail for
		use from mailertables.  This lets you execute arbitrary
		procmail scripts.  Contributed by Kimmo Suominen.
	CONFIG: add T= fields (MTS type) to local, smtp, and uucp mailers.
	CONFIG: add OSTYPE(ptx2) for DYNIX/ptx 2.x from Sequent.  From
		Paul Southworth of CICNet Systems Support.
	CONFIG: use -a$g as default to UUCP mailers, instead of -a$f.
		This causes the null return path to be rewritten as
		MAILER-DAEMON; otherwise UUCP gets horribly confused.
		From Michael Hohmuth of Technische Universitat Dresden.
	CONFIG: Add FEATURE(bestmx_is_local) to cause any hosts that
		list us as the best possible MX record to be treated as
		though they were local (essentially, assume that they
		are included in $=w).  This can cause additional DNS
		traffic, but is easier to administer if this fits your
		local model.  It does not work reliably if there are
		multiple hosts that share the best MX preference.
		Code contributed by John Oleynick of Rutgers.
	CONFIG: Add FEATURE(smrsh) to use smrsh (the SendMail Restricted
		SHell) instead of /bin/sh as the program used for delivery
		to programs.  If an argument is included, it is used as
		the path to smrsh; otherwise, /usr/local/etc/smrsh is
		assumed.
	CONFIG: Add LOCAL_MAILER_MAX and PROCMAILER_MAILER_MAX to limit the
		size of messages to the local and procmail mailers
		respectively.  Contributed by Brad Knowles of the Defense
		Information Systems Agency.
	CONFIG: Handle leading ``phrase:'' and trailing ``;'' as comments
		(just like text outside of angle brackets) in order to
		properly deal with ``group: addr1, ... addrN;'' syntax.
	CONFIG: Require OSTYPE macro (the defaults really don't apply to
		any real systems any more) and tweak the DOMAIN macro
		so that it is less likely that users will accidentally use
		the Berkeley defaults.  Also, create some generic files
		that really can be used in the real world.
	CONFIG: Add new configuration macros to set character sets for
		messages _arriving from_ various mailers: LOCAL_MAILER_CHARSET,
		SMTP_MAILER_CHARSET, and UUCP_MAILER_CHARSET.
	CONFIG: Change UUCP_MAX_SIZE to UUCP_MAILER_MAX for consistency.
		The old name will still be accepted for a while at least.
	CONFIG: Implement DECNET_RELAY as spec for host to which DECNET
		mail (.DECNET pseudo-domain or node::user) will be sent.
		As with all relays, it can be ``mailer:hostname''.  Suggested
		by Scott Hutton.
	CONFIG: Add MAILER(mail11) to get DECnet support.  Code contributed
		by Barb Dijker of Labyrinth Computer Services.
	CONFIG: change confCHECK_ALIASES to default to False -- it has poor
		performance for large alias files, and this confused many
		people.
	CONFIG: Add confCF_VERSION to append local information to the
		configuration version number displayed during SMTP startup.
	CONFIG: fix some.newsgroup.usenet@local.host syntax (previously it
		would only work when locally addressed.  Fix from
		Edvard Tuinder of Cistron Internet Services.
	CONFIG: use ${opMode} to avoid error on .REDIRECT addresses if option
		"n" (CheckAliases) is set when rebuilding alias database.
		Based on code contributed by Claude Marinier.
	CONFIG: Allow mailertable to have values of the form
		``error:code message''.  The ``code'' is a status code
		derived from the sysexits codes -- e.g., NOHOST or UNAVAILABLE.
		Contributed by David James <dwj@agw.bt.co.uk>.
	CONFIG: add MASQUERADE_DOMAIN(domain list) to extend the list of
		sender domains that will be replaced with the masquerade name.
		These domains will not be treated as local, but if mail passes
		through with sender addresses in those domains they will be
		replaced by the masquerade name.  These can also be specified
		in a file using MASQUERADE_DOMAIN_FILE(filename).
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(masquerade_envelope) to masquerade the envelope
		as well as the header.  Substantial improvements to this
		code were contributed by Per Hedeland.
	CONFIG: add MAILER(phquery) to define a new "ph" mailer; this can be
		accessed from a mailertable to do CCSO ph lookups.  Contributed
		by Kimmo Suominen.
	CONFIG: add MAILER(cyrus) to define a new Cyrus mailer; this can be
		used to define cyrus and cyrusbb mailers (for IMAP support).

8.6.13/8.6.12	1996/01/25
	SECURITY: In some cases it was still possible for an attacker to
		insert newlines into a queue file, thus allowing access to
		any user (except root).
	CONFIG: no changes -- it is not a bug that the configuration
		version number is unchanged.

8.6.12/8.6.12	1995/03/28
	Fix to IDENT code (it was getting the size of the reply buffer
		too small, so nothing was ever accepted).  Fix from several
		people, including Allan Johannesen, Shane Castle of the
		Boulder County Information Services, and Jeff Smith of
		Warwick University (all arrived within a few hours of
		each other!).
	Fix a problem that could cause large jobs to run out of
		file descriptors on systems that use vfork() rather
		than fork().

8.6.11/8.6.11	1995/03/08
	The ``possible attack'' message would be logged more often
		than necessary if you are using Pine as a user agent.
	The wrong host would be reported in the ``possible attack''
		message when attempted from IDENT.
	In some cases the syslog buffer could be overflowed when
		reporting the ``possible attack'' message.  This can
		cause denial of service attacks.  Truncate the message
		to 80 characters to prevent this problem.
	When reading the IDENT response a loop is needed around the
		read from the network to ensure that you don't get
		partial lines.
	Password entries without any shell listed (that is, a null
		shell) wouldn't match as "ok".  Problem noted by
		Rob McMahon.
	When running BIND 4.9.x a problem could occur because the
		_res.options field is initialized differently than it
		was historically -- this requires that sendmail call
		res_init before it tweaks any bits.
	Fix an incompatibility in openxscript() between the file open mode
		and the stdio mode passed to fdopen.  This caused UnixWare
		2.0 to have conniptions.  Fix from Martin Sohnius of
		Novell Labs Europe.
	Fix problem with static linking of local getopt routine when
		using GNU's ld command.  Fix from John Kennedy of
		Cal State Chico.
	It was possible to turn off privacy flags.  Problem noted by
		*Hobbit*.
	Be more paranoid about writing files.  Suggestions by *Hobbit*
		and Liudvikas Bukys.
	MAKEMAP: fixes for 64 bit machines (DEC Alphas in particular)
		from Spider Boardman.
	CONFIG: No changes (version number only, to keep it in sync
		with the binaries).

8.6.10/8.6.10	1995/02/10
	SECURITY: Diagnose bogus values to some command line flags that
		could allow trash to get into headers and qf files.
	Validate the name of the user returned by the IDENT protocol.
		Some systems that really dislike IDENT send intentionally
		bogus information.  Problem pointed out by Michael Bushnell
		of the Free Software Foundation.  Has some security
		implications.
	Fix a problem causing error messages about DNS problems when
		the host name contained a percent sign to act oddly
		because it was passed as a printf-style format string.
		In some cases this could cause core dumps.
	Avoid possible buffer overrun in returntosender() if error
		message is quite long.  From Fletcher Mattox of the
		University of Texas.
	Fix a problem that would silently drop "too many hops" error
		messages if and only if you were sending to an alias.
		From Jon Giltner of the University of Colorado and
		Dan Harton of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
	Fix a bug that caused core dumps on some systems if -d11.2 was
		set and e->e_message was null.  Fix from Bruce Nagel of
		Data General.
	Fix problem that can still cause df files to be left around
		after "hop count exceeded" messages.  Fix from Andrew
		Chang and Shau-Ping Lo of SunSoft.
	Fix a problem that can cause buffer overflows on very long
		user names (as might occur if you piped to a program
		with a lot of arguments).
	Avoid returning an error and re-queueing if the host signature
		is null; this can occur on addresses like ``user@.''.
		Problem noted by Wesley Craig and the University of
		Michigan.
	Avoid possible calls to malloc(0) if MCI caching is turned
		off.  Bug fix from Pierre David of the Laboratoire
		Parallelisme, Reseaux, Systemes et Modelisation (PRiSM),
		Universite de Versailles - St Quentin, and Jacky
		Thibault.
	Make a local copy of the line being sent via senttolist() -- in
		some cases, buffers could get trashed by map lookups
		causing it to do unexpected things.  This also simplifies
		some of the map code.
	CONFIG: No changes (version number only, to keep it in sync
		with the binaries).

8.6.9/8.6.9	1994/04/19
	Do all mail delivery completely disconnected from any terminal.
		This provides consistency with daemon delivery and
		may have some security implications.
	Make sure that malloc doesn't get called with zero size,
		since that fails on some systems.  Reported by Ed
		Hill of the University of Iowa.
	Fix multi-line values for $e (SMTP greeting message).  Reported
		by Mike O'Connor of Ford Motor Company.
	Avoid syserr if no NIS domain name is defined, but the map it
		is trying to open is optional.  From Win Bent of USC.
	Changes for picky compilers from Ed Gould of Digital Equipment.
	Hesiod support for UDB from Todd Miller of the University of
		Colorado.  Use "hesiod" as the service name in the U
		option.
	Fix a problem that failed to set the "authentic" host name (that
		is, the one derived from the socket info) if you called
		sendmail -bs from inetd.  Based on code contributed by
		Todd Miller (this problem was also reported by Guy Helmer
		of Dakota State University).  This also fixes a related
		problem reported by Liudvikas Bukys of the University of
		Rochester.
	Parameterize "nroff -h" in all the Makefiles so people with
		variant versions can use them easily.  Suggested by
		Peter Collinson of Hillside Systems.
	SMTP "MAIL" commands with multiple ESMTP parameters required two
		spaces between parameters instead of one.  Reported by
		Valdis Kletnieks of Virginia Tech.
	Reduce the number of system calls during message collection by
		using global timeouts around the collect() loop.  This
		code was contributed by Eric Wassenaar.
	If the initial hostname name gathering results in a name
		without a dot (usually caused by NIS misconfiguration)
		and BIND is compiled in, directly access DNS to get
		the canonical name.  This should make life easier for
		Solaris systems.  If it still can't be resolved, and
		if the name server is listed as "required", try again
		in 30 seconds.  If that also fails, exit immediately to
		avoid bogus "config error: mail loops back to myself"
		messages.
	Improve the "MAIL DELETED BECAUSE OF LACK OF DISK SPACE" error
		message to explain how much space was available and
		sound a bit less threatening.  Suggested by Stan Janet
		of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
	If mail is delivered to an alias that has an owner, deliver any
		requested return-receipt immediately, and strip the
		Return-Receipt-To: header from the subsequent message.
		This prevents a certain class of denial of service
		attack, arguably gives more reasonable semantics, and
		moves things more towards what will probably become a
		network standard.  Suggested by Christopher Davis of
		Kapor Enterprises.
	Add a "noreceipts" privacy flag to turn off all return receipts
		without recompiling.
	Avoid printing ESMTP parameters as part of the error message
		if there are errors during parsing.  This change is
		purely cosmetic.
	Avoid sending out error messages during the collect phase of
		SMTP; there is an MVS mailer from UCLA that gets
		confused by this.  Of course, I think it's their bug....
	Check for the $j macro getting undefined, losing a dot, or getting
		lost from $=w in the daemon before accepting a connection;
		if it is, it dumps state, prints a LOG_ALERT message,
		and drops core for debugging.  This is an attempt to
		track down a bug that I thought was long since gone.
		If you see this, please forward the log fragment to
		sendmail@sendmail.ORG.
	Change OLD_NEWDB from a #ifdef to a #if so it can be turned off
		with -DOLD_NEWDB=0 on the command line.  From Christophe
		Wolfhugel.
	Instead of trying to truncate the listen queue for the server
		SMTP port when the load average is too high, just close
		the port completely and reopen it later as needed.
		This ensures that the other end gets a quick "connection
		refused" response, and that the connection can be
		recovered later.  In particular, some socket emulations
		seem to get confused if you tweak the listen queue
		size around and can never start listening to connections
		again.  The down side is that someone could start up
		another daemon process in the interim, so you could
		have multiple daemons all not listening to connections;
		this could in turn cause the sendmail.pid file to be
		incorrect.  A better approach might be to accept the
		connection and give a 421 code, but that could break
		other mailers in mysterious ways and have paging behavior
		implications.
	Fix a glitch in TCP-level debugging that caused flag 16.101 to
		set debugging on the wrong socket.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	When creating a df* temporary file, be sure you truncate any
		existing data in the file -- otherwise system crashes
		and the like could result in extra data being sent.
	DOC: Replace the CHANGES-R5-R8 readme file with a paper in the
		doc directory.  This includes some additional
		information.
	CONFIG: change UUCP rules to never add $U! or $k! on the front
		of recipient envelope addresses.  This should have been
		handled by the $&h trick, but broke if people were
		mixing domainized and UUCP addresses.  They should
		probably have converted all the way over to uucp-uudom
		instead of uucp-{new,old}, but the failure mode was to
		loop the mail, which was bad news.
	Portability fixes:
		Newer BSDI systems (several people).
		Older BSDI systems from Christophe Wolfhugel.
		Intergraph CLIX, from Paul Southworth of CICNet.
		UnixWare, from Evan Champion.
		NetBSD from Adam Glass.
		Solaris from Quentin Campbell of the University of
			Newcastle upon Tyne.
		IRIX from Dean Cookson and Bill Driscoll of Mitre
			Corporation.
		NCR 3000 from Kevin Darcy of Chrysler Financial Corporation.
		SunOS (it has setsid() and setvbuf() calls) from
			Jonathan Kamens of OpenVision Technologies.
		HP-UX from Tor Lillqvist.

8.6.8/8.6.6	1994/03/21
	SECURITY: it was possible to read any file as root using the
		E (error message) option.  Reported by Richard Jones;
		fixed by Michael Corrigan and Christophe Wolfhugel.

8.6.7/8.6.6	1994/03/14
	SECURITY: it was possible to get root access by using weird
		values to the -d flag.  Thanks to Alain Durand of
		INRIA for forwarding me the notice from the bugtraq
		list.

8.6.6/8.6.6	1994/03/13
	SECURITY: the ability to give files away on System V-based
		systems proved dangerous -- don't run as the owner
		of a :include: file on a system that allows giveaways.
		Unfortunately, this also applies to determining a
		valid shell.
	IMPORTANT: Previous versions weren't expiring old connections
		in the connection cache for a long time under some
		circumstances.  This could result in resource exhaustion,
		both at your end and at the other end.  This checks the
		connections for timeouts much more frequently.  From
		Doug Anderson of NCSC.
	Fix a glitch that snuck in that caused programs to be run as
		the sender instead of the recipient if the mail was
		from a local user to another local user.  From
		Motonori Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	Fix "wildcard" on /etc/shells matching -- instead of looking
		for "*", look for "/SENDMAIL/ANY/SHELL/".  From
		Bryan Costales of ICSI.
	Change the method used to declare the "statfs" availability;
		instead of HASSTATFS and/or HASUSTAT with a ton of
		tweaking in conf.c, there is a single #define called
		SFS_TYPE which takes on one of six values (SFS_NONE
		for no statfs availability, SFS_USTAT for the ustat(2)
		syscall, SFS_4ARGS for a four argument statfs(2) call,
		and SFS_VFS, SFS_MOUNT, or SFS_STATFS for a two argument
		statfs(2) call with the declarations in <sys/vfs.h>,
		<sys/mount.h>, or <sys/statfs.h> respectively).
	Fix glitch in NetInfo support that could return garbage if
		there was no "/locations/sendmail" property.  From
		David Meyer of the University of Virginia.
	Change HASFLOCK from defined/not-defined to a 0/1 definition
		to allow Linux to turn it off even though it is a
		BSD-like system.
	Allow setting of "ident" timeout to zero to turn off the ident
		protocol entirely.
	Make 7-bit stripping local to a connection (instead of to a
		mailer); this allows you to specify that SMTP is a
		7-bit channel, but revert to 8-bit should it advertise
		that it supports 8BITMIME.  You still have to specify
		mailer flag 7 to get this stripping at all.
	Improve makesendmail script so it handles more cases automatically.
	Tighten up restrictions on taking ownership of :include: files
		to avoid problems on systems that allow you to give away
		files.
	Fix a problem that made it impossible to rebuild the alias
		file if it was on a read-only file system.  From
		Harry Edmon of the University of Washington.
	Improve MX randomization function.  From John Gardiner Myers
		of CMU.
	Fix a minor glitch causing a bogus message to be printed (used
		%s instead of %d in a printf string for the line number)
		when a bad queue file was read.  From Harry Edmon.
	Allow $s to remain NULL on locally generated mail.  I'm not
		sure this is necessary, but a lot of people have complained
		about it, and there is a legitimate question as to whether
		"localhost" is legal as an 822-style domain.
	Fix a problem with very short line lengths (mailer L= flag) in
		headers.  This causes a leading space to be added onto
		continuation lines (including in the body!), and also
		tries to wrap headers containing addresses (From:, To:,
		etc) intelligently at the shorter line lengths.  Problem
		Reported by Lars-Johan Liman of SUNET Operations Center.
	Log the real user name when logging syserrs, since these can have
		security implications.  Suggested by several people.
	Fix address logging of cached connections -- it used to always
		log the numeric address as zero.  This is a somewhat
		bogus implementation in that it does an extra system
		call, but it should be an inexpensive one.  Fix from
		Motonori Nakamura.
	Tighten up handling of short syslog buffers even more -- there
		were cases where the outgoing relay= name was too long
		to share a line with delay= and mailer= logging.
	Limit the overhead on split envelopes to one open file descriptor
		per envelope -- previously the overhead was three
		descriptors.  This was in response to a problem reported
		by P{r (Pell) Emanuelsson.
	Fixes to better handle the case of unexpected connection closes;
		this redirects the output to the transcript so the info
		is not lost.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Fix potential string overrun if you macro evaluate a string that
		has a naked $ at the end.  Problem noted by James Matheson
		<jmrm@eng.cam.ac.uk>.
	Make default error number on $#error messages 553 (``Requested
		action not taken: mailbox name not allowed'') instead of
		501 (``Syntax error in parameters or arguments'') to
		avoid bogus "protocol error" messages.
	Strip off any existing trailing dot on names during $[ ... $]
		lookup.  This prevents it from ending up with two dots
		on the end of dot terminated names.  From Wesley Craig
		of the University of Michigan and Bryan Costales of ICSI.
	Clean up file class reading so that the debugging information is
		more informative.  It hadn't been using setclass, so you
		didn't see the class items being added.
	Avoid core dump if you are running a version of sendmail where
		NIS is compiled in, and you specify an NIS map, but
		NIS is not running.  Fix from John Oleynick of
		Rutgers.
	Diagnose bizarre case where res_search returns a failure value,
		but sets h_errno to a success value.
	Make sure that "too many hops" messages are considered important
		enough to send an error to the Postmaster (that is, the
		address specified in the P option).  This fix should
		help problems that cause the df file to be left around
		sometimes -- unfortunately, I can't seem to reproduce
		the problem myself.
	Avoid core dump (null pointer reference) on EXPN command; this
		only occurred if your log level was set to 10 or higher
		and the target account was an alias or had a .forward file.
		Problem noted by Janne Himanka.
	Avoid "denial of service" attacks by someone who is flooding your
		SMTP port with bad commands by shutting the connection
		after 25 bad commands are issued.  From Kyle Jones of
		UUNET.
	Fix core dump on error messages with very long "to" buffers;
		fmtmsg overflows the message buffer.  Fixed by trimming
		the to address to 203 characters.  Problem reported by
		John Oleynick.
	Fix configuration for HASFLOCK -- there were some spots where
		a #ifndef was incorrectly #ifdef.  Pointed out by
		George Baltz of the University of Maryland.
	Fix a typo in savemail() that could cause the error message To:
		lists to be incorrect in some places.  From Motonori
		Nakamura.
	Fix a glitch that can cause duplicate error messages on split
		envelopes where an address on one of the lists has a
		name server failure.  Fix from Voradesh Yenbut of the
		University of Washington.
	Fix possible bogus pointer reference on ESMTP parameters that
		don't have an ``=value'' part.
	CNAME loops caused an error message to be generated, but also
		re-queued the message.  Changed to just re-queue the
		message (it's really hard to just bounce it because
		of the weird way the name server works in the presence
		of CNAME loops).  Problem noted by James M.R.Matheson
		of Cambridge University.
	Avoid giving ``warning: foo owned process doing -bs'' messages
		if they use ``MAIL FROM:<foo>'' where foo is their true
		user name.  Suggested by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI.
	Change the NAMED_BIND compile flag to be a 0/1 flag so you can
		override it easily in the Makefile -- that is, you can
		turn it off using -DNAMED_BIND=0.
	If a gethostbyname(...) of an address with a trailing dot fails,
		try it without the trailing dot.  This is because if
		you have a version of gethostbyname() that falls back
		to NIS or the /etc/hosts file it will fail to find
		perfectly reasonable names that just don't happen to
		be dot terminated in the hosts file.  You don't want to
		strip the dot first though because we're trying to ensure
		that country names that match one of your subdomains get
		a chance.
	PRALIASES: fix bogus output on non-null-terminated strings.
		From Bill Gianopoulos of Raytheon.
	CONFIG: Avoid rewriting anything that matches $w to be $j.
		This was in code intended to only catch the self-literal
		address (that is, [1.2.3.4], where 1.2.3.4 is your
		IP address), but the code was broken.  However, it will
		still do this if $M is defined; this is necessary to
		get client configurations to work (sigh).  Note that this
		means that $M overrides :mailname entries in the user
		database!  Problem noted by Paul Southworth.
	CONFIG: Fix definition of Solaris help file location.  From
		Steve Cliffe <steve@gorgon.cs.uow.edu.au>.
	CONFIG: Fix bug that broke news.group.USENET mappings.
	CONFIG: Allow declaration of SMTP_MAILER_MAX, FAX_MAILER_MAX,
		and USENET_MAILER_MAX to tweak the maximum message
		size for various mailers.
	CONFIG: Change definition of USENET_MAILER_ARGS to include argv[0]
		instead of assuming that it is "inews" for consistency
		with other mailers.  From Michael Corrigan of UC San Diego.
	CONFIG: When mail is forwarded to a LOCAL_RELAY or a MAIL_HUB,
		qualify the address in the SMTP envelope as user@{relay|hub}
		instead of user@$j.  From Bill Wisner of The Well.
	CONFIG: Fix route-addr syntax in nullrelay configuration set.
	CONFIG: Don't turn off case mapping of user names in the local
		mailer for IRIX.  This was different than most every other
		system.
	CONFIG: Avoid infinite loops on certainly list:; syntaxes in
		envelope.  Noted by Thierry Besancon
		<besancon@excalibur.ens.fr>.
	CONFIG: Don't include -z by default on uux line -- most systems
		don't want it set by default.  Pointed out by Philippe
		Michel of Thomson CSF.
	CONFIG: Fix some bugs with mailertables -- for example, if your
		host name was foo.bar.ray.com and you matched against
		".ray.com", the old implementation bound %1 to "bar"
		instead of "foo.bar".  Also, allow "." in the mailertable
		to match anything -- essentially, take over SMART_HOST.
		This also moves matching of explicit local host names
		before the mailertable so they don't have to be special
		cased in the mailertable data.  Reported by Bill
		Gianopoulos of Raytheon; the fix for the %1 binding
		problem was contributed by Nicholas Comanos of the
		University of Sydney.
	CONFIG: Don't include "root" in class $=L (users to deliver
		locally, even if a hub or relay exists) by default.
		This is because of the known bug where definition of
		both a LOCAL_RELAY and a MAIL_HUB causes $=L to ignore
		both and deliver into the local mailbox.
	CONFIG: Move up bitdomain and uudomain handling so that they
		are done before .UUCP class matching; uudomain was
		reported as ineffective before.  This also frees up
		diversion 8 for future use.  Problem reported by Kimmo
		Suominen.
	CONFIG: Don't try to convert dotted IP address (e.g., [1.2.3.4])
		into host names.  As pointed out by Jonathan Kamens,
		these are often used because either the forward or reverse
		mapping is broken; this translation makes it broken again.
	DOC: Clarify $@ and $: in the Install & Op Guide.  From Kimmo
		Suominen.

		Unicos from David L. Kensiski of Sterling Software.

8.6.5/8.6.5	1994/01/13
	Security fix:  /.forward could be owned by anyone (the test
		to allow root to own any file was backwards).  From
		Bob Campbell at U.C. Berkeley.
	Security fix: group ids were not completely set when programs
		were invoked.  This caused programs to have group
		permissions they should not have had (usually group
		daemon instead of their own group).  In particular,
		Perl scripts would refuse to run.
	Security: check to make sure files that are written are not
		symbolic links (at least under some circumstances).
		Although this does not respond to a specific known
		attack, it's just a good idea.  Suggested by
		Christian Wettergren.
	Security fix: if a user had an NFS mounted home directory on
		a system with a restricted shell listed in their
		/etc/passwd entry, they could still execute any
		program by putting that in their .forward file.
		This fix prevents that by insisting that their shell
		appear in /etc/shells before allowing a .forward to
		execute a program or write a file.  You can disable
		this by putting "*" in /etc/shells.  It also won't
		permit world-writable :include: files to reference
		programs or files (there's no way to disable this).
		These behaviors are only one level deep -- for
		example, it is legal for a world-writable :include:
		file to reference an alias that writes a file, on
		the assumption that the alias file is well controlled.
	Security fix: root was not treated suspiciously enough when
		looking into subdirectories.  This would potentially
		allow a cracker to examine files that were publicly
		readable but in a non-publicly searchable directory.
	Fix a problem that causes an error on QUIT on a cached
		connection to create problems on the current job.
		These are typically unrelated, so errors occur in
		the wrong place.
	Reset CurrentLA in sendall() -- this makes sendmail queue
		runs more responsive to load average, and fixes a
		problem that ignored the load average in locally
		generated mail.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Fix possible core dump on aliases with null LHS.  From
		John Orthoefer of BB&N.
	Revert to using flock() whenever possible -- there are just
		too many bugs in fcntl() locking, particularly over
		NFS, that cause sendmail to fail in perverse ways.
	Fix a bug that causes the connection cache to get confused
		when sending error messages.  This resulted in
		"unexpected close" messages.  It should fix itself
		on the following queue run.  Problem noted by
		Liudvikas Bukys of the University of Rochester.
	Include $k in $=k as documented in the Install & Op Guide.
		This seems odd, but it was documented....  From
		Michael Corrigan of UCSD.
	Fix problem that caused :include:s from alias files to be
		forced to be owned by root instead of daemon
		(actually DefUid).  From Tim Irvin.
	Diagnose unrecognized I option values -- from Mortin Forssen
		of the Chalmers University of Technology.
	Make "error" mailer work consistently when there is no error
		code associated with it -- previously it returned OK
		even though there was a real problem.  Now it assumes
		EX_UNAVAILABLE.
	Fix bug that caused the last header line of messages that had
		no body and which were terminated with EOF instead of
		"." to be discarded.  Problem noted by Liudvikas Bukys.
	Fix core dump on SMTP mail to programs that failed -- it tried
		to go to a "next MX host" when none existed, causing
		a core dump.  From der Mouse at McGill University.
	Change IDENTPROTO from a defined/not defined to a 0/1 switch;
		this makes it easier to turn it off (using
		-DIDENTPROTO=0 in the Makefile).  From der Mouse.
	Fix YP_MASTER_NAME store to use the unupdated result of
		gethostname() (instead of myhostname(), which tries
		to fully qualify the name) to be consistent with
		SunOS.  If your hostname is unqualified, this fixes
		transfers to slave servers.  Bug noted by Keith
		McMillan of Ameritech Services, Inc.
	Fix Ultrix problem: gethostbyname() can return a very large
		(> 500) h_length field, which causes the sockaddr
		to be trashed.  Use the size of the sockaddr instead.
		Fix from Bob Manson of Ohio State.
	Don't assume "-a." on host lookups if NAMED_BIND is not
		defined -- this confuses gethostbyname on hosts
		file lookups, which doesn't understand the trailing
		dot convention.
	Log SMTP server subprocesses that die with a signal instead
		of from a clean exit.
	If you don't have option "I" set, don't assume that a DNS
		"host unknown" message is authoritative -- it
		might still be found in /etc/hosts.
	Fix a problem that would cause Deferred: messages to be sent
		as the subject of an error message, even though the
		actual cause of a message was more severe than that.
		Problem noted by Chris Seabrook of OSSI.
	Fix race condition in DBM alias file locking.  From Kyle
		Jones of UUNET.
	Limit delivery syslog line length to avoid bugs in some
		versions of syslog(3).  This adds a new compile time
		variable SYSLOG_BUFSIZE.  From Jay Plett of Princeton
		University, which is in turn derived from IDA.
	Fix quotes inside of comments in addresses -- previously
		it insisted that they be balanced, but the 822 spec
		says that they should be ignored.
	Dump open file state to syslog upon receiving SIGUSR1 (for
		debugging).  This also evaluates ruleset 89, if set
		(with the null input), and logs the result.  This
		should be used sparingly, since the rewrite process
		is not reentrant.
	Change -qI, -qR, and -qS flags to be case-insensitive as
		documented in the Bat Book.
	If the mailer returned EX_IOERR or EX_OSERR, sendmail did not
		return an error message and did not requeue the message.
		Fix based on code from Roland Dirlewanger of
		Reseau Regional Aquarel, Bordeaux, France.
	Fix a problem that caused a seg fault if you got a 421 error
		code during some parts of connection initialization.
		I've only seen this when talking to buggy mailers on
		the other end, but it shouldn't give a seg fault in
		any case.  From Amir Plivatsky.
	Fix core dump caused by a ruleset call that returns null.
		Fix from Bryan Costales of ICSI.
	Full-Name: field was being ignored.  Fix from Motonori Nakamura
		of Kyoto University.
	Fix a possible problem with very long input lines in setproctitle.
		From P{r Emanuelsson.
	Avoid putting "This is a warning message" out on return receipts.
		Suggested by Douglas Anderson.
	Detect loops caused by recursive ruleset calls.  Suggested by
		Bryan Costales.
	Initialize non-alias maps during alias rebuilds -- they may be
		needed for parsing.  Problem noted by Douglas Anderson.
	Log sender address even if no message was collected in SMTP
		(e.g., if all RCPTs failed).  Suggested by Motonori
		Nakamura.
	Don't reflect the owner-list contents into the envelope sender
		address if the value contains ", :, /, or | (to avoid
		illegal addresses appearing there).
	Efficiency hack for toktype macro -- from Craig Partridge of
		BB&N.
	Clean up DNS error printing so that a host name is always
		included.
	Remember to set $i during queue runs.  Reported by Stephen
		Campbell of Dartmouth University.
	If the environment variable HOSTALIASES is set, use it during
		canonification as the name of a file with per-user host
		translations so that headers are properly mapped.  Reported
		by Anne Bennett of Concordia University.
	Avoid printing misleading error message if SMTP mailer (not
		using [IPC]) should die on a core dump.
	Avoid incorrect diagnosis of "file 1 closed" when it is caused
		by the other end closing the connection.  From
		Dave Morrison of Oracle.
	Improve several of the error messages printed by "mailq"
		to include a host name or other useful information.
	Add NetInfo preliminary support for NeXT systems.  From Vince
		DeMarco.
	Fix a glitch that sometimes caused :include:s that pointed to
		NFS filesystems that were down to give an "aliasing/
		forwarding loop broken" message instead of queueing
		the message for retry.  Noted by William C Fenner of
		the NRL Connection Machine Facility.
	Fix a problem that could cause a core dump if the input sequence
		had (or somehow acquired) a \231 character.
	Make sure that route-addrs always have <angle brackets> around
		them in non-SMTP envelopes (SMTP envelopes already do
		this properly).
	Avoid weird headers on unbalanced punctuation of the form:
		``Joe User <user)'' -- this caused reference to the
		null macro.  Fix from Rick McCarty of IO.COM.
	Fix a problem that caused an alias "user: user@local.host" to
		not have the QNOTREMOTE bit set; this caused configs
		to act as if FEATURE(notsticky) was defined even when
		it was not.  The effect of the problem was to make it
		very hard to to set up satellite sites that had a few
		local accounts, with everything else forwarded to a
		corporate hub.  Reported by Detlef Drewanz of the
		University of Rostock and Mark Frost of NCD.
	Change queuing to not call rulesets 3, {1 or 2}, 4 on header
		addresses.  This is more efficient (fewer name server
		calls) and fixes certain unusual configurations, such
		as those that have ruleset 4 do something that is
		non-idempotent unless a mailer-specific ruleset did
		something else.  Problem reported by Brian J. Coan
		of the Institute for Global Communications.
	Fix the "obsolete argument" routine in main to better understand
		new arguments.  For example, if you used ``sendmail
		-C config -v -q'' it would choke on the -q because
		the -C would stop looking for old-format arguments.
	Fix the code that was intended to allow two users to forward their
		mail to the same program and have them appear unique.
	Portability fixes for:
		SCO UNIX from Murray Kucherawy.
		SCO Open Server 3.2v4 from Philippe Brand.
		System V Release 4 from Rick Ellis and others.
		OSF/1 from Steve Campbell.
		DG/UX from Ben Mesander of the USGS and Bryan Curnutt
			of Stoner Associates.
		Motorola SysV88 from Kevin Johnson of Motorola.
		Solaris 2.3 from Casper H.S. Dik of the University
			of Amsterdam and John Caruso of University
			of Maryland.
		FreeBSD from Ollivier Robert.
		NetBSD from Adam Glass.
		TitanOS from Kate Hedstrom of Rutgers University.
		Irix from Bryan Curnutt.
		Dynix from Jim Davis of the University of Arizona.
		RISC/os.
		Linux from John Kennedy of California State University
			at Chico.
		Solaris 2.x from Tony Boner of the U.S. Air Force.
		NEXTSTEP 3.x from Vince DeMarco.
		HP-UX from various people.  NOTA BENE:  the location
			of the config file has moved to /usr/lib
			to match the HP-UX version of sendmail.
	CONFIG: Don't do any recipient rewriting on relay mailer;
		since this is intended only for internal use, the
		usual RFC 821/822/1123 rules can be relaxed.  The
		main point of this is to avoid munging (ugh) UUCP
		addresses when relaying internally.
	CONFIG: fix typo in mailer/uucp.m4 that mutilates list:;
		syntax addresses delivered via UUCP.  Solution
		provided by Peter Wemm.
	CONFIG: fix thumb-fumble in default UUCP relaying in ruleset
		zero; it caused double @ signs in addresses.  From
		Irving Reid of the University of Toronto.
	CONFIG: Portability fixes for SCO Unix 3.2 with TCP/IP 1.2.1
		from Markku Toijala of ICL Personal Systems Oy.
	CONFIG: Add trailing "." on pseudo-domains for consistency;
		this fixes a problem (noted by Al Whaley of Sunnyside)
		that made it hard to recognize your own pseudodomain
		names.
	CONFIG: catch "@host" syntax errors (i.e., null local-parts)
		rather than letting them get "local configuration
		error"s.  Problem noted by John Gardiner Myers.
	CONFIG: add uucp-uudom mailer variant, based on code posted
		by Spider Boardman <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>; this
		has uucp-dom semantics but old UUCP syntax.  This
		also permits "uucp-old" as an alias for "uucp" and
		"uucp-new" as a synonym for "suucp" for consistency.
	CONFIG: add POP mailer support (from Kimmo Suominen
		<kim@grendel.lut.fi>).
	CONFIG: drop CSNET_RELAY support -- CSNET is long gone.
	CONFIG: fix bug caused with domain literal addresses (e.g.,
		``[128.32.131.12]'') when FEATURE(allmasquerade)
		was set; it would get an additional @masquerade.host
		added to the address.  Problem noted by Peter Wan
		of Georgia Tech.
	CONFIG: make sure that the local UUCP name is in $=w.  From
		Jim Murray of Stratus.
	CONFIG: changes to UUCP rewriting to simulate IDA-style "V"
		mailer flag.  Briefly, if you are sending to host
		"foo", then it rewrites "foo!...!baz" to "...!baz",
		"foo!baz" remains "foo!baz", and anything else has
		the local name prepended.
	CONFIG: portability fixes for HP-UX.
	DOC: several minor problems fixed in the Install & Op Guide.
	MAKEMAP: fix core dump problem on lines that are too long or
		which lack newline.  From Mark Delany.
	MAILSTATS: print sums of columns (total messages & kbytes
		in and out of the system).  From Tom Ferrin of UC
		San Francisco Computer Graphics Lab.
	SIGNIFICANT USER- OR SYSAD-VISIBLE CHANGES:
		On HP-UX, /etc/sendmail.cf has been moved to
			/usr/lib/sendmail.cf to match HP sendmail.
		Permissions have been tightened up on world-writable
			:include: files and accounts that have shells
			that are not listed in /etc/shells.  This may
			cause some .forward files that have worked
			before to start failing.
		SIGUSR1 dumps some state to the log.

8.6.4/8.6.4	1993/10/31
	Repair core-dump problem (write to read-only memory segment)
		if you fall back to the return-to-Postmaster case in
		savemail.  Problem reported by Richard Liu.
	Immediately diagnose bogus sender addresses in SMTP.  This
		makes quite certain that crackers can't use this
		class of attack.
	Reliability Fix:  check return value from fclose() and fsync()
		in a few critical places.
	Minor problem in initsys() that reversed a condition for
		redirecting the output channel on queue runs.  It's
		not clear this code even does anything.  From Eric
		Wassenaar of the Dutch National Institute for Nuclear
		and High-Energy Physics.
	Fix some problems that caused queue runs to do "too much work",
		such as double-reading the Errors-To: header.  From
		Eric Wassenaar.
	Error messages on writing the temporary file (including the
		data file) were getting suppressed in SMTP -- this
		fix causes them to be properly reported.  From Eric
		Wassenaar.
	Some changes to support AF_UNIX sockets -- this will only
		really become relevant in the next release, but some
		people need it for local patches.  From Michael
		Corrigan of UC San Diego.
	Use dynamically allocated memory (instead of static buffers)
		for macros defined in initsys() and settime(); since
		these can have different values depending on which
		envelope they are in.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Improve logging to show ctladdr on to= logging; this tells you
		what uid/gid processes ran as.
	Fix a problem that caused error messages to be discarded if
		the sender address was unparseable for some reason;
		this was supposed to fall back to the "return to
		postmaster" case.
	Improve aliaswait backoff algorithm.
	Portability patches for Linux (8.6.3 required another header
		file) (from Karl London) and SCO UNIX.
	CONFIG: patch prog mailer to not strip host name off of envelope
		addresses (so that it matches local again).  From
		Christopher Davis.
	CONFIG: change uucp-dom mailer so that "<>" translates to $n;
		this prevents uux from seeing lines with null names like
		``From   Sat Oct 30 14:55:31 1993''.  From Motonori
		Nakamura of Kyoto University.
	CONFIG: handle <list:;> syntax correctly.  This isn't legal, but
		it shouldn't fail miserably.  From Motonori Nakamura.

8.6.2/8.6.2	1993/10/15
	Put a "successful delivery" message in the transcript for
		addresses that get return-receipts.
	Put a prominent "this is only a warning" message in warning
		messages -- some people don't read carefully enough
		and end up sending the message several times.
	Include reason for temporary failure in the "warning" return
		message.  Currently, it just says "cannot send for
		four hours".
	Fix the "Original message received" time generated for
		returntosender messages.  It was previously listed as
		the current time.  Bug reported by Eric Hagberg of
		Cornell University Medical College.
	If there is an error when writing the body of a message,
		don't send the trailing dot and wait for a response
		in sender SMTP, as this could cause the connection to
		hang up under some bizarre circumstances.  From Eric
		Wassenaar.
	Fix some server SMTP synchronization problems caused when
		connections fail during message collection.  From
		Eric Wassenaar.
	Fix a problem that can cause srvrsmtp to reject mail if the
		name server is down -- it accepts the RCPT but rejects
		the DATA command.  Problem reported by Jim Murray of
		Stratus.
	Fix a problem that can cause core dumps if the config file
		incorrectly resolves to a null hostname.  Reported by
		Allan Johannesen of WPI.
	Non-root use of -C flag, dangerous -f flags, and use of -oQ
		by non-root users were not put into
		X-Authentication-Warning:s as intended because the
		config file hadn't set the PrivacyOptions yet.  Fix
		from Sven-Ove Westberg of the University of Lulea.
	Under very odd circumstances, the alias file rebuild code
		could get confused as to whether a database was
		open or not.
	Check "vendor code" on the end of V lines -- this is
		intended to provide a hook for vendor-specific
		configuration syntax.  (This is a "new feature",
		but I've made an exception to my rule in a belief
		that this is a highly exceptional case.)
	Portability fixes for DG/UX (from Douglas Anderson of NCSC),
		SCO Unix (from Murray Kucherawy), A/UX, and OSF/1
		(from Jon Forrest of UC Berkeley)
	CONFIG: fix ``mailer:host'' form of UUCP relay naming.

8.6.1/8.6	1993/10/08
	Portability fixes for A/UX and Encore UMAX V.
	Fix error message handling -- if you had a name server down
		causing an error during parsing, that message was never
		propagated to the queue file.

8.6/8.6		1993/10/05
	Configuration cleanup: make it easier to undo IDENTPROTO in
		conf.h (other systems have the same bug).
	If HASGETDTABLESIZE and _SC_OPEN_MAX are both defined, assume
		getdtablesize() instead of sysconf(); a disturbingly
		large number of systems defined _SC_OPEN_MAX in the
		header files but don't have the syscall.
	Another patch to really truly ignore MX records in getcanonname
		if trymx == FALSE.
	Fix problem that caused the "250 IAA25499 Message accepted for
		delivery" message to be omitted if there was an error
		in the header of the message (e.g., a bad Errors-To:
		line).  Pointed out by Michael Corrigan of UCSD.
	Announce name of host we are chatting when we get errors; this
		is an IDA-ism suggested by Christophe Wolfhugel.
	Portability fixes for Alpha OSF/1 (from Anthony Baxter of the
		Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute), SCO Unix
		(from Murray Kucherawy of Hookup Communication Corp.),
		NeXT (from Vince DeMarco and myself), Linux (from
		Karl London <karl@borg.demon.co.uk>), BSDI (from
		Christophe Wolfhugel, and SVR4 on Dell (from Kimmo
		Suominen), AUX 3.0 on Macintosh, and ANSI C compilers.
	Some changes to get around gcc optimizer bugs.  From Takahiro
		Kanbe.
	Fix error recovery in queueup if another tf file of the same
		name already exists.  Problem stumbled over by Bill
		Wisner of The Well.
	Output YP_MASTER_NAME and YP_LAST_MODIFIED without null bytes.
		Problem noted by Keith McMillan of Ameritech Services.
	Deal with group permissions properly when opening .forward and
		:include: files.  This relaxes the 8.1C restrictions
		slightly more.  This includes proper setting of groups
		when reading :include: files, allowing you to read some
		files that you should be able to read but have previously
		been denied unless you owned them or they had "other"
		read permission.
	Make certain that $j is in $=w (after the .cf is read) so that
		if the user is forced to override some silly system,
		MX suppression will still work.
	Fix a couple of efficiency problems where newstr was double-
		calling expensive routines.  In at least one case, it
		wasn't guaranteed that they would always return the
		same result.  Problem noted by Christophe Wolfhugel.
	Fix null pointer dereference in putoutmsg -- only on an error
		condition from a non-SMTP mailer.  From Motonori
		Nakamura.
	Macro expand "C" line class definitions before scanning so that
		"CX $Z" works.
	Fix problem that caused error message to be sent while still
		trying to send the original message if the connection
		is closed during a DATA command after getting an error
		on an RCPT command (pretty obscure).  Problem reported
		by John Myers of CMU.
	Fix reply to NOOP to be 250 instead of 200 -- this is a long
		term bug.
	Fix a nasty bug causing core dumps when returning the "warning:
		cannot deliver for N hours -- will keep trying" message;
		it only occurred if you had PostmasterCopy set and
		only on some architectures.  Although sendmail would
		keep trying, it would send error messages on each
		queue interval.  This is an important fix.
	Allow u and g options to take user and group names respectively.
	Don't do a chdir into the queue directory in -bt mode to make
		ruleset testing a bit easier.
	Don't allow users to turn off logging (using -oL) on the command
		line -- command line can only raise, not lower, logging
		level.
	Set $u to the original recipient on the SMTP transaction or on
		the command line.  This is only done if there is exactly
		one recipient.  Technically, this does not meet the
		specs, because it does not guarantee a domain on the
		address.
	Fix a problem that dumped error messages on bad addresses if
		you used the -t flag.  Problem noted by Josh Smith of
		Harvey Mudd College.
	Given an address such as ``<foo> <bar>'', auto-quote the first
		``<foo>'' part, giving ``"<foo>" <bar>''.  This is to
		avoid the problem of people who use angle brackets in
		their full name information.
	Fix a null pointer dereference if you set option "l", have
		an Errors-To: header in the message, and have Errors-To:
		defined in the config file H lines.  From J.R. Oldroyd.
	Put YPCOMPAT on #ifdef NIS instead -- it's one less thing to get
		wrong when compiling.  Suggested by Rick McCarty of TI.
	Fix a problem that could pass negative SIZE parameter if the
		df file got lost; this would cause servers to always
		give a temporary failure, making the problem even worse.
		Problem noted by Allan Johannesen of WPI.
	Add "ident" timeout (one of the "r" option selectors) for IDENT
		protocol timeouts (30s default).  Requested by Murray
		Kucherawy of HookUp Communication Corp. to handle bogus
		PC TCP/IP implementations.
	Change $w default definition to be just the first component of
		the domain name on config level 5.  The $j macro defaults
		to the FQDN; $m remains as before.  This lets well-behaved
		config files use any of the short, long, or subdomain
		names.
	Add makesendmail script in src to try to automate multi-architecture
		builds.  I know, this is sub-optimal, but it is still
		helpful.
	Fix very obscure race condition that can cause a queue run to
		get a queue file for an already completed job.  This
		problem has existed for years.  Problem noted by the
		long suffering Allan Johannesen of WPI.
	Fix a problem that caused the raw sender name to be passed to
		udbsender instead of the canonified name -- this caused
		it to sometimes miss records that it should have found.
	Relax check of name on HELO packet so that a program using -bs
		that claims to be itself works properly.
	Restore rewriting of $: part of address through 2, R, 4 in
		buildaddr -- this requires passing a lot of flags to get
		it right.  Unlike old versions, this ONLY rewrites
		recipient addresses, not sender addresses.
	Fix a bug that caused core dumps in config files that cannot
		resolve /file/name style addresses.  Fix from Jonathan
		Kamens of OpenVision Technologies.
	Fix problem with fcntl locking that can cause error returns to
		be lost if the lock is lost; this required fully
		queueing everything, dropping the envelope (so errors
		would get returned), and then re-reading the queue from
		scratch.
	Fix a problem that caused aliases that redefine an otherwise
		true address to still send to the original address
		if and only if the alias failed in certain bizarre
		ways (e.g, if they pointed at a list:; syntax address).
		Problem pointed out by Jonathan Kamens.
	Remove support for frozen configuration files.  They caused
		more trouble than it was worth.
	Fix problem that can cause error messages to get ignored when
		using both -odb and -t flags.  Problem noted by Rob
		McNicholas at U.C. Berkeley.
	Include all "normal" variations on hostname in $=w.  For example,
		if the host name is vangogh.cs.berkeley.edu, $=w will
		contain vangogh, vangogh.cs, and vangogh.cs.berkeley.edu.
	Add "restrictqrun" privacy flag -- without this, anyone can run
		the queue.
	Reset SmtpPhase global on initial connection creation so that
		messages don't come out with stale information.
	Pass an "ext" argument to lockfile so that error/log messages
		will properly reflect the true filename being locked.
	Put all [...] address forms into $=w -- this eliminates the need
		for MAXIPADDR in conf.h.  Suggested by John Gardiner
		Myers of CMU.
	Fix a bug that can cause qf files to be left around even after
		an SMTP RSET command.  Problem and fix from Michael
		Corrigan.
	Don't send a PostmasterCopy to errors when the Precedence: is
		negative.  Error reports still go to the envelope
		sender address.
	Add LA_SHORT for load averages.
	Lock sendmail.st file when posting statistics.
	Add "SendBufSize" and "RcvBufSize" suboptions to "O" option to
		set the size of the TCP send and receive buffers; if you
		run over a slow slip line you may need to set these down
		(although it would be better to fix the SLIP implementation
		so that it's not necessary to recompile every program
		that does bulk data transfer).
	Allow null defaults on $( ... $) lookups.  Problem reported by
		Amir Plivatsky.
	Diagnose crufty S and V config lines.  This resulted from an
		observation that some people were using the SITE macro
		without the SITECONFIG macro first, which was causing
		bogus config files that were not caught.
	Fix makemap -f flag to turn off case folding (it was turning it
		on instead).  THIS IS A USER VISIBLE CHANGE!!!
	Fix a problem that caused multiple error messages to be sent if
		you used "sendmail -t -oem -odb", your system uses fcntl
		locking, and one of the recipient addresses is unknown.
	Reset uid earlier in include() so that recursive .forwards or
		:include:s don't use the wrong uid.
	If file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 was closed when sendmail was
		called, the code to recover the descriptor was broken.
		This sometimes (only sometimes) caused problems with the
		alias file.  Fix from Motonori Nakamura.
	Fix a problem that caused aliaswait to go into infinite recursion
		if the @:@ metasymbol wasn't found in the alias file.
	Improve error message on newaliases if database files cannot be
		opened or if running with no database format defined.
	Do a better estimation of the size of error messages when NoReturn
		is set.  Problem noted by P{r (Pell) Emanuelsson.
	Fix a problem causing the "c" option (don't connect to expensive
		mailers) to be ignored in SMTP.  Problem noted and the
		solution suggested by Robert Elz of The University of
		Melbourne.
	Improve connection caching algorithm by passing "[host]" to
		hostsignature, which strips the square brackets and
		returns the real name.  This allows mailertable entries
		to match regular entries.
	Re-enable Return-Receipt-To: -- people seem to want this stupid
		feature, even if it doesn't work right.
	Catch and log attempts to try the "wiz" command in server SMTP.
		This also ups the log level from LOG_NOTICE to LOG_CRIT.
	Be more generous at assigning $z to the home directory -- do this
		for programs that are specified through a .forward file.
		Fix from Andrew Chang of Sun Microsystems.
	Always save a fatal error message in preference to a non-fatal
		error message so that the "subject" line of return
		messages is the best possible.
	CONFIG: reduce the number of quotes needed to quote configuration
		parameters with commas: two quotes should work now, e.g.,
		define(ALIAS_FILE, ``/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.local'').
	CONFIG: class $=Z is a set of UUCP hosts that use uucp-dom
		connections (domain-ized UUCP).
	CONFIG: fix bug in default maps (-o must be before database file
		name).  Pointed out by Christophe Wolfhugel.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(nodns) to state that we are not relying on
		DNS.  This would presumably be used in UUCP islands.
	CONFIG: add OSTYPE(nextstep) and OSTYPE(linux).
	CONFIG: log $u in Received: line.  This is in technical violation
		of the standards, since it doesn't guarantee a domain
		on the address.
	CONFIG: don't assume "m" in local mailer flags -- this means that
		if you redefine LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS you will have to include
		the "m" flag should you want it.  Apparently some Solaris 2.2
		installations can't handle multiple local recipients.
		Problem noted by Josh Smith.
	CONFIG: add confDOMAIN_NAME to set $j (if undefined, $j defaults).
	CONFIG: change default version level from 4 to 5.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(nullclient) to create a config file that
		forwards all mail to a hub without ever looking at the
		addresses in any detail.
	CONFIG: properly strip mailer: information off of relays when
		used to change .BITNET form into %-hack form.
	CONFIG: fix a problem that caused infinite loops if presented
		with an address such as "!foo".
	CONFIG: check for self literal (e.g., [128.32.131.12]) even if
		the reverse "PTR" mapping is broken.  There's a better
		way to do this, but the change is fairly major and I
		want to hold it for another release.  Problem noted by
		Bret Marquis.

8.5/8.5		1993/07/23
	Serious bug: if you used a command line recipient that was unknown
		sendmail would not send a return message (it was treating
		everything as though it had an SMTP-style client that
		would do the return itself).  Problem noted by Josh Smith.
	Change "trymx" option in getcanonname() to ignore all MX data,
		even during a T_ANY query.  This actually didn't break
		anything, because the only time you called getcanonname
		with !trymx was if you already knew there were no MX
		records, but it is somewhat cleaner.  From Motonori
		Nakamura.
	Don't call getcanonname from getmxrr if you already know there
		are no DNS records matching the name.
	Fix a problem causing error messages to always include "The
		original message was received ... from localhost".
		The correct original host information is now included.
	Previous change to cf/sh/makeinfo.sh doesn't port to Ultrix (their
		version of "test" doesn't have the -x flag).  Change it
		to use -f instead.  From John Myers.
	CONFIG: 8.4 mistakenly set the default SMTP-style mailer to
		esmtp -- it should be smtp.
	CONFIG: send all relayed mail using confRELAY_MAILER (defaults
		to "relay" (a variant of "smtp") if MAILER(smtp) is used,
		else "suucp" if MAILER(uucp) is used, else "unknown");
		this cleans up the configs somewhat.  This fixes a serious
		problem that caused route-addrs to get mistaken as relays,
		pointed out by John Myers.  WARNING: this also causes
		the default on SMART_HOST to change from "suucp" to
		"relay" if you have MAILER(smtp) specified.

8.4/8.4		1993/07/22
	Add option `w'.  If you receive a message that comes to you because
		you are the best (lowest preference) target of an MX, and
		you haven't explicitly recognized the source MX host in
		your .cf file, this option will cause you to try the target
		host directly (as if there were no MX for it at all).  If
		`w' is not set, this case is a configuration error.
		Beware: if `w' is set, senders may get bogus errors like
		"message timed out" or "host unknown" for problems that
		are really configuration errors.  This option is
		disrecommended, provided only for compatibility with
		UIUC sendmail.
	Fix a problem that caused the incoming socket to be left open
		when sendmail forks after the DATA command.  This caused
		calling systems to wait in FIN_WAIT_2 state until the
		entire list was processed and the child closed -- a
		potentially prodigious amount of time.  Problem noted
		by Neil Rickert.
	Fix problem (created in 6.64) that caused mail sent to multiple
		addresses, one of which was a bad address, to completely
		suppress the sending of the message.  This changes
		handling of EF_FATALERRS somewhat, and adds an
		EF_GLOBALERRS flag.  This also fixes a potential problem
		with duplicate error messages if there is a syntax error
		in the header of a message that isn't noticed until late
		in processing.  Original problem pointed out by Josh Smith
		of Harvey Mudd College.  This release includes quite a bit
		of dickering with error handling (see below).
	Back out SMTP transaction if MAIL gets nested 501 error.  This
		will only hurt already-broken software and should help
		humans.
	Fix a problem that broke aliases when neither NDBM nor NEWDB were
		compiled in.  It would never read the alias file.
	Repair unbalanced `)' and `>' (the "open" versions are already
		repaired).
	Logging of "done" in dropenvelope() was incorrect: it would
		log this even when the queue file still existed.  Change
		this to only log "done" (at log level 11) when the
		queue file is actually removed.  From John Myers.
	Log "lost connection" in server SMTP at log level 20 if there
		is no pending transaction.  Some senders just close the
		connection rather than sending QUIT.
	Fix a bug causing getmxrr to add a dot to the end of unqualified
		domains that do not have MX records -- this would cause
		the subsequent host name lookup to fail.  The problem
		only occurred if you had FEATURE(nocanonify) set.
		Problem noted by Rick McCarty of Texas Instruments.
	Fix invocation of setvbuf when passed a -X flag -- I had
		unwittingly used an ANSI C extension, and this caused
		core dumps on some machines.
	Diagnose self-destructive alias loops on RCPT as well as EXPN.
		Previously it just gave an empty send queue, which
		then gave either "Need RCPT (recipient)" at the DATA
		(confusing, since you had given an RCPT command which
		returned 250) or just dropped the email, depending on
		whether you were running VERBose mode.  Now it usually
		diagnoses this case as "aliasing/forwarding loop broken".
		Unfortunately, it still doesn't adequately diagnose
		some true error conditions.
	Add internal concept of "warning messages" using 6xx codes.
		These are not reported only to Postmaster.  Unbalanced
		parens, brackets, and quotes are printed as 653 codes.
		They are always mapped to 5xx codes before use in SMTP.
	Clean up error messages to tell both the actual address that
		failed and the alias they arose from.  This makes it
		somewhat easier to diagnose problems.  Difficulty noted
		by Motonori Nakamura.
	Fix a problem that inappropriately added a ctladdr to addresses
		that shouldn't have had one during a queue run.  This
		caused error messages to be handled differently during
		a queue run than a direct run.
	Don't print the qf name and line number if you get errors during
		the direct run of the queue from srvrsmtp -- this was
		just extra stuff for users to crawl through.
	Put command line flags on second line of pid file so you can
		auto-restart the daemon with all appropriate arguments.
		Use "kill `head -1 /etc/sendmail.pid`" to stop the
		daemon, and "eval `tail -1 /etc/sendmail.pid`" to
		restart it.
	Remove the ``setuid(getuid())'' in main -- this caused the
		IDENT daemon to screw up.  This required that I change
		HASSETEUID to HASSETREUID and complicate the mode
		changing somewhat because both Ultrix and SunOS seem
		to have a bug causing seteuid() to set the saved uid
		as well as the effective.  The program test/t_setreuid.c
		will test to see if your implementation of setreuid(2)
		is appropriately functional.
	The FallBackMX (option V) handling failed to properly identify
		fallback to yourself -- most of the code was there,
		but it wasn't being enabled.  Problem noted by Murray
		Kucherawy of the University of Waterloo.
	Change :include: open timeout from ETIMEDOUT to an internal
		code EOPENTIMEOUT; this avoids adding "during SmtpPhase
		with CurHostName" in error messages, which can be
		confusing.  Reported by Jonathan Kamens of OpenVision
		Technologies.
	Back out setpgrp (setpgid on POSIX systems) call to reset the
		process group id.  The original fix was to get around
		some problems with recalcitrant MUAs, but it breaks
		any call from a shell that creates a process group id
		different from the process id.  I could try to fix
		this by diddling the tty owner (using tcsetpgrp or
		equivalent) but this is too likely to break other
		things.
	Portability changes:
		Support -M as equivalent to -oM on Ultrix -- apparently
			DECnet calls sendmail with -MrDECnet -Ms<HOST> -bs
			instead of using standard flags.  Oh joy.  This
			behavior reported by Jon Giltner of University
			of Colorado.
		SGI IRIX  -- this includes several changes that should
			help other strict ANSI compilers.
		SCO Unix -- from Murray Kucherawy of HookUp Communication
			Corporation.
		Solaris running the Sun C compiler (which despite the
			documentation apparently doesn't define
			__STDC__ by default).
		ConvexOS from Eric Schnoebelen of Convex.
		Sony NEWS workstations and Omron LUNA workstations from
			Motonori Nakamura.
	CONFIG: add confTRY_NULL_MX_LIST to set option `w'.
	CONFIG: delete `C' and `e' from default SMTP mailers flags;
		several people have made a good argument that this
		creates more problems than it solves (although this
		may prove painful in the short run).
	CONFIG: generalize all the relays to accept a "mailer:host"
		format.
	CONFIG: move local processing in ruleset 0 into a new ruleset
		98 (8 on old sendmail).  Domain literal [a.b.c.d]
		addresses are also passed through this ruleset.
	CONFIG: if neither SMART_HOST nor MAILER(smtp) were defined,
		internet-style addresses would "fall off the end" of
		ruleset zero and be interpreted as local -- however,
		the angle brackets confused the recursive call.
		These are now diagnosed as "Unrecognized host name".
	CONFIG: USENET rules weren't included in S0 because of a mistaken
		ifdef(`_MAILER_USENET_') instead of
		ifdef(`_MAILER_usenet_').  Problem found by Rein Tollevik
		of SINTEF RUNIT, Oslo.
	CONFIG: move up LOCAL_RULE_0 processing so that it happens very
		early in ruleset 0; this allows .mc authors to bypass
		things like the "short circuit" code for local addresses.
		Prompted by a comment by Bill Wisner of The Well.
	CONFIG: add confSMTP_MAILER to define the mailer used (smtp or
		esmtp) to send SMTP mail.  This allows you to default
		to esmtp but use a mailertable or other override to
		deal with broken servers.  This logic was pointed out
		to me by Bill Wisner.  Ditto for confLOCAL_MAILER.
	Changes to cf/sh/makeinfo.sh to make it portable to SVR4
		environments.  Ugly as sin.

8.3/8.3		1993/07/13
	Fix setuid problems introduced in 8.2 that caused messages
		like "Cannot create qfXXXXXX: Invalid argument"
		or "Cannot reopen dfXXXXXX: Permission denied".  This
		involved a new compile flag "HASSETEUID" that takes
		the place of the old _POSIX_SAVED_IDS -- it turns out
		that the POSIX interface is broken enough to break
		some systems badly.  This includes some fixes for
		HP-UX.  Also fixes problems where the real uid is
		not reset properly on startup (from Neil Rickert).
	Fix a problem that caused timed out messages to not report the
		addresses that timed out.  Error messages are also more
		"user friendly".
	Drop required bandwidth on connections from 64 bytes/sec to
		16 bytes/sec.
	Further Solaris portability changes -- doesn't require the BSD
		compatibility library.  This also adds a new
		"HASGETDTABLESIZE" compile flag which can be used if
		you want to use getdtablesize(2) instead of sysconf(2).
		These are loosely based on changes from David Meyer at
		University of Oregon.  This now seems to work, at least
		for quick test cases.
	Fix a problem that can cause duplicate error messages to be
		sent if you are in SMTP, you send to multiple addresses,
		and at least one of those addresses is good and points
		to an account that has a .forward file (whew!).
	Fix a problem causing messages to be discarded if checkcompat()
		returned EX_TEMPFAIL (because it didn't properly mark
		the "to" address).  Problem noted by John Myers.
	Fix dfopen to return NULL if the open failed; I was depending
		on fdopen(-1) returning NULL, which isn't the case.  This
		isn't serious, but does result in weird error diagnoses.
		From Michael Corrigan.
	CONFIG: add UUCP_MAX_SIZE M4 macro to set the maximum size of
		messages sent through UUCP-family mailers.  Suggested
		by Bill Wisner of The Well.
	CONFIG: if both MAILER(uucp) and MAILER(smtp) are specified,
		include a "uucp-dom" mailer that uses domain-style
		addressing.  Suggested by Bill Wisner.
	CONFIG: Add LOCAL_SHELL_FLAGS and LOCAL_SHELL_ARGS to match
		LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS and LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS.  Suggested by
		Christophe Wolfhugel.
	CONFIG: Add OSTYPE(aix3).  From Christophe Wolfhugel.

8.2/8.2		1993/07/11
	Don't drop out on config file parse errors in -bt mode.
	On older configuration files, assume option "l" (use Errors-To
		header) for back compatibility.  NOTE:  this DOES NOT
		imply an endorsement of the Errors-To: header in any way.
	Accept -x flag on AIX-3 as well as OSF/1.  Why, why, why???
	Don't log errors on EHLO -- it isn't a "real" error for an old
		SMTP server to give an error on this command, and
		logging it in the transcript can be confusing.  Fix
		from Bill Wisner.
	IRIX compatibility changes provided by Dan Rich
		<drich@sandman.lerc.nasa.gov>.
	Solaris 2 compatibility changes.  Provided by Bob Cunningham
		<bob@kahala.soest.hawaii.edu>, John Oleynick
		<juo@klinzhai.rutgers.edu>
	Debugging: -d17 was overloaded (hostsignature and usersmtp.c);
		move usersmtp (smtpinit and smtpmailfrom) to -d18 to
		match the other flags in that file.
	Flush transcript before fork in mailfile().  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Save h_errno in mci struct and improve error message display.
		Changes from Eric Wassenaar.
	Open /dev/null for the transcript if the create of the xf file
		failed; this avoids at least one possible null pointer
		reference in very weird cases.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Clean up statistics gathering; it was over-reporting because of
		forks.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Fix problem that causes old Return-Path: line to override new
		Return-Path: line (conf.c needs H_FORCE to avoid
		re-using old value).  From Motonori Nakamura.
	Fix broken -m flag in K definition -- even if -m (match only)
		was specified, it would still replace the key with the
		value.  Noted by Rick McCarty of Texas Instruments.
	If the name server timed out over several days, no "timed out"
		message would ever be sent back.  The timeout code
		has been moved from markfailure() to dropenvelope()
		so that all such failures should be diagnosed.  Pointed
		out by Christophe Wolfhugel and others.
	Relax safefile() constraints: directories in an include or
		forward path must be readable by self if the controlling
		user owns the entry, readable by all otherwise (e.g.,
		when reading your .forward file, you have to own and
		have X permission in it; everyone needs X permission in
		the root and directories leading up to your home);
		include files must be readable by anyone, but need not
		be owned by you.
	If _POSIX_SAVED_IDS is defined, setuid to the owner before
		reading a .forward file; this gets around some problems
		on NFS mounts if root permission is not exported and
		the user's home directory isn't x'able.
	Additional NeXT portability enhancements from Axel Zinser.
	Additional HP-UX portability enhancements from Brian Bullen.
	Add a timeout around SMTP message writes; this assumes you can
		get throughput of at least 64 bytes/second.  Note that
		this does not impact the "datafinal" default, which
		is separate; this is just intended to work around
		network clogs that will occur before the final dot
		is sent.  From Eric Wassenaar.
	Change map code to set the "include null" flag adaptively --
		it initially tries both, but if it finds anything
		matching without a null it never tries again with a
		null and vice versa.  If -N is specified, it never
		tries without the null and creates new maps with a
		null byte.  If -O is specified, it never tries with
		the null (for efficiency).  If -N and -O are specified,
		you get -NO (get it?) lookup at all, so this would
		be a bad idea.  If you don't specify either -N or -O,
		it adapts.
	Fix recognition of "same from address" so that MH submissions
		will insert the appropriate full name information;
		this used to work and got broken somewhere along the
		way.
	Some changes to eliminate some unnecessary SYSERRs in the
		log.  For example, if you lost a connection, don't
		bother reporting that fact on the connection you lost.
	Add some "extended debugging" flags to try to track down
		why we get occasional problems with file descriptor
		one being closed when execing a mailer; it seems to
		only happen when there has been another error in the
		same transaction.  This requires XDEBUG, defined
		by default in conf.h.
	Add "-X filename" command line flag, which logs both sides of
		all SMTP transactions.  This is intended ONLY for
		debugging bad implementations of other mailers; start
		it up, send a message from a mailer that is failing,
		and then kill it off and examine the indicated log.
		This output is not intended to be particularly human
		readable.  This also adds the HASSETVBUF compile
		flag, defaulted on if your compiler defines __STDC__.
	CONFIG: change SMART_HOST to override an SMTP mailer.  If you
		have a local net that should get direct connects, you
		will need to use LOCAL_NET_CONFIG to catch these hosts.
		See cf/README for an example.
	CONFIG: add LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS (default: `mail -d $u') to handle
		sites that don't use the -d flag.
	CONFIG: hide recipient addresses as well as sender addresses
		behind $M if FEATURE(allmasquerade) is specified; this
		has been requested by several people, but can break
		local aliases.  For example, if you mail to "localalias"
		this will be rewritten as "localalias@masqueradehost";
		although initial delivery will work, replies will be
		broken.  Use it sparingly.
	CONFIG: add FEATURE(domaintable).  This maps unqualified domains
		to qualified domains in headers.  I believe this is
		largely equivalent to the IDA feature of the same name.
	CONFIG: use $U as UUCP name instead of $k.  This permits you
		to override the "system name" as your UUCP name --
		in particular, to use domain-ized UUCP names.  From
		Bill Wisner of The Well.
	CONFIG: create new mailer "esmtp" that always tries EHLO
		first.  This is currently unused in the config files,
		but could be used in a mailertable entry.

8.1C/8.1B	1993/06/27
	Serious security bug fix: it was possible to read any file on
		the system, regardless of ownership and permissions.
	If a subroutine returns a fully qualified address, return it
		immediately instead of feeding it back into rewriting.
		This fixes a problem with mailertable lookups.
	CONFIG: fix some M4 frotz (concat => CONCAT)

8.1B/8.1A	1993/06/12
	Serious bug fix: pattern matching backup algorithm stepped by
		two tokens in classes instead of one.  Found by Claus
		Assmann at University of Kiel, Germany.

8.1A/8.1A	1993/06/08
	Another mailertable fix....

8.1/8.1		1993/06/07
	4.4BSD freeze.  No semantic changes.
