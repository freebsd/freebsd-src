			Installing sendmail

**Note**: Starting with sendmail 8.12, sendmail is no longer set-user-ID
root by default.  As a result of this, you need to install two .cf files.
See steps 4 and 6 in this document.  We also strongly recommend reading
sendmail/SECURITY for more installation information.

1. Read all the README files noted in the INTRODUCTION section of the README
   file in this top-level directory.

2. Create any necessary site configuration build files, as noted in
   devtools/Site/README.

3. In the sendmail/ directory, run "sh ./Build" (see sendmail/README for
   details).

4. Change to the cf/cf/ directory (that's not a typo): Copy whichever .mc
   file best matches your environment to sendmail.mc.  Next, tailor it
   as explained in cf/README.  Then run
   "sh ./Build sendmail.cf".

5. Back up your current /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and the sendmail binary (whose
   location varies from operating system to operating system, but is usually
   in /usr/sbin or /usr/lib).

6. Install sendmail.cf as /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and submit.cf as
   /etc/mail/submit.cf.  This can be done in the cf/cf by using
   "sh ./Build install-cf".

   Please read sendmail/SECURITY before continuing; you may have to create
   a new user smmsp and a new group smmsp for the default installation
   if you are updating from a really old version.
   Then install the sendmail binary built in step 3 by cd-ing back to
   sendmail/ and running "sh ./Build install".

7. For each of the associated sendmail utilities (makemap, mailstats,
   etc.), read the README in the utility's directory if it exists.  When
   you are ready to install it, back up your installed version and type
   "sh ./Build install".

8. If you are upgrading from an older version of sendmail and are using any
   database maps, be sure to rebuild them with the new version of makemap,
   in case you are now using a different (and thereby incompatible) version
   of Berkeley DB.
