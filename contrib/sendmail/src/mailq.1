.SH NAME
.B mailq
\- print the mail queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mailq
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mailq
prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.
.PP
The first line printed for each message 
shows the internal identifier used on this host 
for the message with a possible status character, 
the size of the message in bytes,
the date and time the message was accepted into the queue, 
and the envelope sender of the message.  
The second line shows the error message that caused this message 
to be retained in the queue; 
it will not be present if the message is being processed 
for the first time.  
The status characters are either
.B *
to indicate the job is being processed;
.B X
to indicate that the load is too high to process the job; and
.B -
to indicate that the job is too young to process.
The following lines show message recipients, 
one per line.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-v
Print verbose information.  
This adds the priority of the message and 
a single character indicator (``+'' or blank) 
indicating whether a warning message has been sent 
on the first line of the message.
Additionally, extra lines may be intermixed with the recipients
indicating the ``controlling user'' information; 
this shows who will own any programs that are executed 
on behalf of this message 
and the name of the alias this command expanded from, if any.
.PP
The
.B mailq
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
