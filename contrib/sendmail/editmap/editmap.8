.SH SYNOPSIS
.B editmap

.RB [ \-N ]
.RB [ \-f ]
.RB [ \-q|\-u|\-x ]
maptype mapname
key [ "value ..." ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Editmap
queries or edits one record in database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
sendmail(8).
Arguments are passed on the command line and output (for queries) is
directed to standard output.
.PP
Depending on how it is compiled,
.B editmap
handles different database formats, 
selected using the
.I maptype
parameter.  
They may be
.TP
dbm
DBM format maps.  
This requires the 
ndbm(3) 
library.
.TP
btree
B-Tree format maps.  
This requires the new Berkeley DB 
library.
.TP
hash
Hash format maps.  
This also requires the Berkeley DB 
library.
.TP
cdb
CDB (Constant DataBase) format maps.  
This requires the tinycdb library.
.PP
If the
.I TrustedUser
option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
.B editmap
is invoked as root, the generated files will be owned by
the specified
.IR TrustedUser.
.SS Flags
.TP
.B \-C
Use the specified
.B sendmail
configuration file for looking up the TrustedUser option.
.TP
.B \-N
Include the null byte that terminates strings
in the map (for alias maps).
.TP
.B \-f
Normally all upper case letters in the key
are folded to lower case.
This flag disables that behaviour.
This is intended to mesh with the
\-f flag in the
.B K
line in sendmail.cf.
The value is never case folded.
.TP
.B \-q
Query the map for the specified key.  If found, print value to standard
output and exit with 0.  If not found then print an error
message to stdout and exit with EX_UNAVAILABLE.
.TP
.B \-u
Update the record for
.I key
with
.I value
or inserts a new record if one doesn't exist.  Exits with 0 on success
or EX_IOERR on failure.
.TP
.B \-x
Deletes the specific key from the map.  Exits with 0 on success or
EX_IOERR on failure.
.TP
