This directory contains several programs to test various OS calls.
If your OS is not listed in the Results file, you should run those
test programs. Most of them have instructions at the begin of source
code, at least those which are important.

Notice: most of these programs require set-user-ID or set-group-ID
installation.  Hence they are not tested automatically.

t_dropgid.c	test how to drop saved-gid for a set-group-ID program
t_exclopen.c	test for security-defeating semantics that an open with
		O_CREAT|O_EXCL set will successfully open a file named
		by a symbolic link that to a non-existent file
t_pathconf.c	test whether pathconf(2) works
t_seteuid.c	test whether seteuid(2) works
t_setgid.c	test whether setgid(2) works
t_setreuid.c	test whether setreuid(2) works
t_setuid.c	test whether setuid(2) works
