This directory contains the source files for libmilter.

The sendmail Mail Filter API (Milter) is designed to allow third-party
programs access to mail messages as they are being processed in order to
filter meta-information and content.

This README file describes the steps needed to compile and run a filter,
through reference to a sample filter which is attached at the end of this
file.  It is necessary to first build libmilter.a, which can be done by
issuing the './Build' command in SRCDIR/libmilter .

NOTE: Both libmilter and the callouts in sendmail are marked as an FFR (For
Future Release).  If you intend to use them in 8.10.X, you must compiled
both libmilter and sendmail with -D_FFR_MILTER defined.  You can do this by
adding the following to your devtools/Site/site.config.m4 file:

	dnl Milter
	APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-D_FFR_MILTER=1')
	APPENDDEF(`conf_libmilter_ENVDEF', `-D_FFR_MILTER=1') 

You will also need to define _FFR_MILTER when building your .cf file using
m4.

+-------------------+
| BUILDING A FILTER |
+-------------------+

The following command presumes that the sample code from the end of this
README is saved to a file named 'sample.c' and built in the local platform-
specific build subdirectory (SRCDIR/obj.*/libmilter).

	cc -I../../sendmail -I../../include -o sample sample.c libmilter.a ../libsmutil/libsmutil.a -pthread

It is recommended that you build your filters in a location outside of
the sendmail source tree.  Modify the compiler include references (-I)
and the library locations accordingly.  Also, some operating systems may
require additional libraries.  For example, SunOS 5.X requires '-lresolv
-lsocket -lnsl'.  Depending on your OS you may need a library instead
of the option -pthread, e.g., -lpthread.

Filters must be thread-safe!  Many operating systems now provide support for
POSIX threads in the standard C libraries.  The compiler flag to link with
threading support differs according to the compiler and linker used.  Check
the Makefile in your appropriate obj.*/libmilter build subdirectory if you
are unsure of the local flag used.


+----------------------------------------+
| SPECIFYING FILTERS IN SENDMAIL CONFIGS |
+----------------------------------------+

Filters are specified with a key letter ``X'' (for ``eXternal'').

For example:

	Xfilter1, S=local:/var/run/f1.sock, F=R
	Xfilter2, S=inet6:999@localhost, F=T, T=S:1s;R:1s;E:5m
	Xfilter3, S=inet:3333@localhost

specifies three filters.  Filters can be specified in your .mc file using
the following:

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter1', `S=local:/var/run/f1.sock, F=R')
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter2', `S=inet6:999@localhost, F=T, T=S:1s;R:1s;E:5m')
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter3', `S=inet:3333@localhost')

The first attaches to a Unix-domain socket in the /var/run directory; the
second uses an IPv6 socket on port 999 of localhost, and the third uses an
IPv4 socket on port 3333 of localhost.  The current flags (F=) are:

	R		Reject connection if filter unavailable
	T		Temporary fail connection if filter unavailable

Finally, you can override the default timeouts used by sendmail when
talking to the filters using the T= equate.  There are three fields inside
of the T= equate:

Letter          Meaning
  S             Timeout for sending information from the MTA to a filter
  R             Timeout for reading reply from the filter
  E             Overall timeout between sending end-of-message to filter
                and waiting for the final acknowledgment

Note the separator between each is a ';' as a ',' already separates equates
and therefore can't separate timeouts.  The default values (if not set in the config) are:

T=S:10s;R:10s;E:5m

where 's' is seconds and 'm' is minutes.

Actual sequencing is handled by the InputMailFilters option which is set
automatically according to the order of the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER commands
in your .mc file.  Alternatively, you can reset its value by setting
confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS in your .mc file.  This options causes the three
filters to be called in the same order they were specified.  It allows
for possible future filtering on output (although this is not intended
for this release).

Also note that a filter can be defined without adding it to the input
filter list by using MAIL_FILTER() instead of INPUT_MAIL_FILTER() in your
.mc file.

To test sendmail with the sample filter, the following might be added (in
the appropriate locations) to your .mc file:

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`sample', `S=local:/var/run/f1.sock')


+------------------+
| TESTING A FILTER |
+------------------+

Once you have compiled a filter, modified your .mc file and restarted
the sendmail process, you will want to test that the filter performs as
intended.

The sample filter takes one argument -p, which indicates the local port
on which to create a listening socket for the filter.  Maintaining
consistency with the suggested options for sendmail.cf, this would be the
UNIX domain socket located in /var/run/f1.sock.

	% ./sample -p local:/var/run/f1.sock

If the sample filter returns immediately to a command line, there was either
an error with your command or a problem creating the specified socket.
Further logging can be captured through the syslogd daemon.  Using the
'netstat -a' command can ensure that your filter process is listening on
the appropriate local socket.

Email messages must be injected via SMTP to be filtered.  There are two
simple means of doing this; either using the 'sendmail -bs' command, or
by telnetting to port 25 of the machine configured for milter.  Once
connected via one of these options, the session can be continued through
the use of standard SMTP commands.

% sendmail -bs

Sample body

QUIT
221 2.0.0 test.sendmail.com closing connection

In the above example, the lines beginning with numbers are output by the
mail server, and those without are your input.  If everything is working
properly, you will find a file in /tmp by the name of msg.XXXXXXXX (where
the Xs represent any combination of letters and numbers).  This file should
contain the message body and headers from the test email entered above.

If the sample filter did not log your test email, there are a number of
methods to narrow down the source of the problem.  Check your system
logs written by syslogd and see if there are any pertinent lines.  You
may need to reconfigure syslogd to capture all relevant data.  Additionally,
the logging level of sendmail can be raised with the LogLevel option.
See the sendmail(8) manual page for more information.
