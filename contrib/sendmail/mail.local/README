This directory contains the source files for mail.local.

This is not intended to be used on *stock* System V derived systems such as
Solaris or HP-UX, since they use a totally different approach to mailboxes
(essentially, they have a setgid program rather than setuid, and they rely
on the ability to "give away"  files to do their work). 

If you choose to run *this* mail.local on these systems then you may also
need to replace the existing MUAs, as well as IMAP and POP servers, with
ones that are compatible with the BSD interface.  You have been warned!
