.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mail.local
.RB [ \-7 "] [" \-B "] [" \-b "] [" \-d "] [" \-D
.IR mbdb ]
.RB [ \-l "] [" \-s "] [" \-f 
\fIfrom\fR|\fB\-r\fR

.I "user ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mail.local
reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it to each
.I user's
.B mail 
file.  The
.I user
must be a valid user name.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 1i
.B \-7
Do not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.
.TP 
.B \-B
Turn off the attempts to notify the ``biff'' service.
.TP 
.B \-b
Return a permanent error instead of a temporary error
if a mailbox exceeds quota.
.TP 
.B \-d
Specify this is a delivery (for backward compatibility).
This option has no effect.
.TP 
.BI \-D " mbdb"
Specify the name of the mailbox database
which is used to look up local recipient names.
This option defaults to "pw", which means use getpwnam().
.TP 
.BI \-f " from"
Specify the sender's name.
.TP
.B \-l
Turn on LMTP mode.
.TP
.B \-s
Turn off the fsync(2) call that forces the mailbox to be committed
to disk before returning a "success" status.
.TP 
.BI \-r " from"
Specify the sender's name (for backward compatibility).
Same as \-f.
.TP
.BI \-h " filename"
Store incoming mail in \fIfilename\fR in the user's home directory instead
of a system mail spool directory.
.PP
The next options are only available if
.B mail.local
has been compiled with -DHASHSPOOL.
.TP
.BI \-H " hashtypehashdepth"
Select hashed mail directories.
Valid hash types are
.B u
for user name and
.B m
for MD5 (requires compilation with -DHASHSPOOLMD5).
Example:
.BI \-H " u2"
selects user name hashing with a hash depth of 2.
Note: there must be no space between the hash type and the depth.
.TP
.BI \-p " path"
Specify an alternate mail spool path.
.TP
.BI \-n
Specify that the domain part of recipient addresses in LMTP mode
should not be stripped.
.PP
Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty
line followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.
A line containing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp
is prepended to each delivered mail message.
A blank line is appended to each message.
A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the message
which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line
(that is,
a line beginning with the five characters
``From '' following a blank line).
.PP
The mail files are exclusively locked with 
flock(2) 
while mail is appended, 
and a
.B user.lock
file also is created while the mailbox is locked 
for compatibility with older MUAs.
.PP
If the ``biff'' service is returned by 
getservbyname(3), 
the biff server is notified of delivered mail.
.PP
The
.B mail.local
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP TZ
Used to set the appropriate time zone on the timestamp.
.SH FILES

/tmp/local.XXXXXX

(handling mailbox reading as well as mail delivery)
appeared in

as the program
