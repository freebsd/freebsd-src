<h2>Documentaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84aWtseb2-4">Daylight
Saving Time Explained</a>" (2011; 6:39) lightly covers daylight saving
time's theory, history, pros and cons. Among other things, it explains
Arizona's daylight-saving enclaves quite well.</li>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY">The Problem
with Time &amp; Timezones &ndash; Computerphile</a>" (2013; 10:12) delves
into problems that programmers have with timekeeping.</li>
<li>
"<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/28375932.html">All The Time In The World:
Explaining The Mysteries Of Time Zones</a>" (2017; 2:15)
briefly says why France has more time zones than Russia.
<li>
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRz-Dl60Lfc">Why Denmark used to be

<li>
"About Time" (1962; 59 minutes) is part of the
Bell Science extravaganza, with Frank Baxter, Richard Deacon, and Les Tremayne.
Its advisor was Richard Feynman, and it was voiced by Mel Blanc.
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154110/">IMDb entry</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In the 1946 movie <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em>
(U.S. title <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>)
there is a reference to British Double Summer Time.
The time does not play a large part in the plot;
it's just a passing reference to the time when one of the
characters was supposed to have died (but didn't).
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038733/">IMDb entry.</a>)
(Dave Cantor)
<li>
The 1953 railway comedy movie <em>The Titfield Thunderbolt</em> includes a
play on words on British Double Summer Time. Valentine's wife wants
him to leave the pub and asks him, "Do you know what time it is?"
And he, happy where he is, replies: "Yes, my love. Summer double time."
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046436/">IMDb entry.</a>)
(Mark Brader, 2009-10-02)
</li>
<li>
The premise of the 1999 caper movie <em>Entrapment</em> involves computers
in an international banking network being shut down briefly at
midnight in each time zone to avoid any problems at the transition
from the year 1999 to 2000 in that zone. (Hmmmm.) If this shutdown
is extended by 10 seconds, it will create a one-time opportunity for
a gigantic computerized theft. To achieve this, at one location the
crooks interfere with the microwave system supplying time signals to
the computer, advancing the time by 0.1 second each minute over the
last hour of 1999. (So this movie teaches us that 0.1 &times; 60 = 10.)
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137494/">IMDb entry.</a>)

<li>
One mustn't forget the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4EUTMPuvHo">trailer</a>
(2014; 2:23) for the movie <em>Daylight Saving</em>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>TV episodes</h2>

</li>
<li>
"In what time zone would you find New York City?" was a $200 question on

zones?" was a $32,000 question on the 2001-05-23 United States airing of
the same show. At this rate, the million-dollar time-zone
question should have been asked 2002-06-04.

<li>
In the "Run by the Monkeys" episode of <em>Da Vinci's Inquest</em>
(first broadcast 2002-11-17),

</li>
<li>
In "The Todd Couple" episode of <em>Outsourced</em> (first aired 2011-02-10),
Manmeet sets up Valentine's Day teledates for 6:00 and 9:00pm;
since one is with a New Yorker and the other with a San Franciscan,
hilarity ensues.
(Never mind that this should be 7:30am in Mumbai, yet for some reason the show
proceeds as though it's also mid-evening there.)
</li>

<em>You, Me and the Apocalypse</em>
(first aired 2015-11-11 in the UK, 2016-03-10 in the US),

<h2>Jokes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The idea behind daylight saving time was first proposed as a joke by
Benjamin Franklin. To enforce it, he suggested, "Every
morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church
be set ringing; and if that is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in
every street, to wake the sluggards effectually, and make them open
their eyes to see their true interest. All the difficulty will be in
the first two or three days: after which the reformation will be as
natural and easy as the present irregularity; for, <em>ce n'est que le
premier pas qui co&ucirc;te</em>."
<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/franklin3.html">Franklin's
joke</a> was first published on 1784-04-26 by the
<em>Journal de Paris</em> as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Franklin-Benjamin-Journal-de-Paris-1784.jpg">an
anonymous letter translated into French</a>.
</li>
<li>
"We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving."
(Groucho Marx as Captain Spaulding in <em>Animal Crackers</em>, 1930,
as noted by Will Fitzgerald)
