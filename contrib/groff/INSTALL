To install groff, follow the instructions in the file INSTALL.gen.

This file contains information that supplements those instructions.

(For instructions how to build groff with DJGPP tools for MS-DOS and
MS-Windows, see the file arch/djgpp/README.)

groff is written in C++, so you will need a C++ compiler.  The C++
source files use a suffix of `.cc', so your C++ compiler must be able
to handle this.  If you don't already have a C++ compiler, I suggest
gcc 2.7.1 or later (gcc version 2 includes GNU C++ as well as GNU C).
From gcc 2.5, it is no longer necessary to install libg++: the C++
header files needed by groff are created by the gcc installation
process.  To override configure's choice of C++ compiler, you can set
the CXX environment variable.

If you have a library that provides a faster malloc than your system's
usual malloc, it is good idea to include it in LIBS.  For example,
using the malloc that comes with GNU Emacs version 20 can give a
worthwhile (and sometimes spectacular) performance improvement.

If you want A4 or letter paper format and the configure script produces
an incorrect guess, say

  PAGE=xxx ./configure

where `xxx' should be either `A4' or `letter'.  Note that this will only
affect the paper selection for grops.  For compatibility with ditroff,
the default page length in gtroff is always 11 inches.  The page length
can be changed with the `pl' request.

When you have built groff, you can use the test-groff script to try
groff out on one of the man pages.  (Use the .n files not the .man
files.)  The test-groff script sets up environment variables to allow
groff to run without being installed.  The current directory must be
the build directory when the script is run.  For example, you could do

  ./test-groff -man -Tascii src/roff/groff/groff.n | less

If you want to compile and install gxditview (an X11 previewer),
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file in the src/xditview
subdirectory.

To get a DVI, PDF, or HTML version of the groff texinfo manual, say `make
groff.dvi', `make groff.pdf', or `make groff.html', respectively, in the
`doc' subdirectory (after compiling the groff package).  Note that you
need texinfo version 4.2 or newer as a prerequisite.

If you have problems, read the PROBLEMS file.  If this doesn't help
send a bug report using the form in the file BUG-REPORT.
