3) Documentation

The groff documentation is scattered upon several places.

- The main directory contains documents related to the groff source.
  The README file contains the information needed to get the groff
  package, report bugs, and contact the developers.

- The man-page of each program (section 1) is kept in the source
  directory of the program.

- The man-pages for the other sections are found in `src/man'.

- Documentation in other formats are located in the `doc' directory,
  including the groff info file, tutorials, and manuals.


4) The roff parser

The parsing of the roff language is done by troff.  The input is
transformed into "nodes" by `src/roff/troff/node.cc'.  From these, the
intermediate output is generated.


5) Postprocessing

The parser for the intermediate output and the postprocessing is in
`src/libs/libdriver/input.cc'.  This is used by all postprocessors.
