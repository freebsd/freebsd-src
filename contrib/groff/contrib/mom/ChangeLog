*Sun Aug 25 2002

o Changed .IX to .IQ.  The older form still works, but emits a message
  advising the user to update to the newer.  (The macro in om.tmac
  still remains IX; IQ is an alias.)  Docs updated to reflect the
  change.

*Tue Aug 20 2002

o Added new (better) way to handle inline kerning.  \*[BU #] and
  \*[FU #] allow passing an argument to the inline string.  The older
  forms \*[BU#] and \*[FU#] still work, though.

o Changed handling of inline horizontal and vertical movements.
  Horizontal movements are now done with \*[BCK #<unit>] and
  \*[FWD #<unit>]; verticals with \*[UP #<unit>] and \*[DOWN #<unit>].
  The older forms \*[FP#] and \*[BP#] still work (horizontals), as do
  \*[ALD#] and \*[RLD#] (verticals).

*Mon Aug 19 2002

o Fixed ENDNOTES so footnotes output properly when ENDNOTES is called

o Added ENDNOTES_HDRFTR_CENTER so that default no-print of header
  center string on endnotes page(s) when DOCTYPE is CHAPTER can
  be disabled (i.e. header center will be printed).

*Sat Aug 10 2002

o Added .nf to top of PAD, with a test beforehand for current fill
  mode.  If fill mode was on, it's restored after PAD completes
  processing.  Updated reserved.html to include number register
  #FILL_MODE.

*Mon Jul 29 2002

o Makefile.sub (FFLAG, TFLAG): Add paths to source directories.

*Wed Jul 24 2002

o Makefile.sub (groff_bin_path): Don't use ' \+' but '  *' for sed.
  (GROFF): Set GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX to empty value.

*Fri Jul 12 2002

o More fixes to underlining.

*Fri Jul 5 2002

o Added capability of endnotes and pertinent control macros to om.tmac.

o Added document entries pertaining to endnote macros.

o Incorporated endnote macros into elvis_syntax.

o Small doc fixes.

o Tidied up indenting of om.tmac.

o Fixed handling of underlining of italics in PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE
  (there was a problem with footnotes getting underlined when they
  shouldn't have been).

o Removed ENDNOTES from TODO

o Fixed the character translations for UNDERLINE so they work properly
  with digraphs.

*Mon Jul 1 2002

o Expanded docprocessing.html entry "Special Note on Chapters".  Tidied
  up html a bit.

*Tue Jun 18 2002

o examples/macros.mom: Fix path to penguin.ps.

*Sat Jun 15 2002

o Small fix to PAD to make the use of inlines within the pad string
  more intuitive.

o Added \*[RULE] ( = \l'\n(.lu' ) so that full measure rules (either to
  full line length or within tabs) are easier to set.

*Sat Jun  8 2002

o Macro .PS renamed to .PT_SIZE.  Alias .TS removed.

o .tr bits in .CAPS rewritten in the form .tr é\['E].

o General cleanup of docs to reflect changes.

o Small changes/additions to `elvis_syntax'.

*Thu Jun  6 2002

o In DOCTYPE, in .if '\\$1'LETTER', added .FOOTER_RIGHT_SIZE +0.
  Without it, the suite page was printing at the default
  FOOTER_RIGHT_SIZE of -.5, which didn't look good.

*Wed Jun  5 2002

o Makefile.sub (TFLAG): Add `$(top_builddir)/tmac'.

*Tue Jun  4 2002

o Makefile.sub (groff_bin_dirs): Fix typo (forgotten `src' element).

*Mon Jun  3 2002

o Makefile.sub (uninstall_sub): Don't use `momdocdir' but `htmldocdir'.
  Add missing backslash.

*Sat Jun  1 2002

o Makefile.in (prepare_make_examples): Test for `penguin.ps', not
  `examples/penguin.ps'.

*Wed May 29 2002

o Rewrote portions of PAGENUM_STYLE and COPYSTYLE so that PAGENUM_STYLE
  behaves as advertised.

*Fri May 24 2002

o /Makefile.sub (momdocdir): Removed.
  (HTMLDOCFILES): Prepend `momdoc/'.
  (EXTRAEXAMPLEFILES): Removed.  Added entries to...
  (EXAMPLEFILES): This.
  (.SUFFIXES, .mom.ps): New.
  (prepare_make_examples): Updated.
  (examples/*.ps): Removed; .mom.ps will handle this.
  (install_data): Updated.  

*Thu May 23 2002

o Applied two small bug fixes to om.tmac (patches 1.1.1a and 1.1.1b).

o mom is now part of groff.

o Some renaming to avoid problems with 8+3 filesystems:

    examples/docprocessing_typeset.mom   -> examples/typeset.mom
    examples/docprocessing_typewrite.mom -> examples/typewrite.mom
    examples/typesetting_macros.mom      -> examples/macros.mom
    examples/penguin_small2_bw.ps        -> examples/penguin.ps

o Removed `INSTALL' and `README' since groff takes care of installation
  now.

o Added Makefile.sub.

o Added mom.tmac (which simply calls om.tmac).

o Added groff_mom.man for orthogonality; it simply points to the HTML
  documentation.

*Thu May 16 2002

o Added macro DRAFT_WITH_PAGENUMBER so user can have draft/revision
  info attached to the pagenumber in COPYSTYLE DRAFT, instead of having
  it HEADER center.  Always having it HEADER center was creating problems
  with long doc titles, esp. with PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE (which is when
  COPYSTYLE DRAFT is most likely to be used).  Now user has the choice,
  in these circumstances, either to reduce HEADER_SIZE, or to displace
  the draft/revision info.  Also rewrote portions of COPYSTYLE so that
  if no revision number is given in the reference macros, "Rev. #"
  doesn't appear when COPYSTYLE DRAFT.

*Fri May 10 2002

o Added capability of user-defined, single string recto/verso
  headers/footers.

o Added new entries to docs about the above.  Made some additional
  small changes to toc.html, rectoverso.html, and headfootpage.html
  to supplement the new entries.

o Small fix to handling of footer separator rule -- was 1 point too low
  owing to fuzziness of #CAP_HEIGHT as returned by SIZESPECS.

o Added some more useful stuff to elvis_syntax.

*Sun May 05 2002

o Fix to DEFAULTS so that L_MARGIN and R_MARGIN are reprocessed if
  DOCTYPE LETTER.  R_MARGIN, as set by DOCTYPE LETTER had no preceding
  PAGEWIDTH or PAPER from which to get #PAGE_WIDTH for figuring out
  line length.

o Additional fix to DEFAULTS in handling DOCTYPE LETTER so that if user
  sets line length prior to START, no reprocessing of R_MARGIN occurs.
  This necessitated adding a new number register: #USER_SET_L_LENGTH

*Sat May 04 23:48:05 EDT 2002

o Added .cflags 4 /\(en -- was driving me nuts that lines wouldn't
  break after these characters; I'm assuming others feel the same way

* Fri May 03 2002

o Made some small fixes to space handling around quotes, mostly to do
  with quotes immediately after START and quotes after (sub)heads.

* Wed May 01 2002

o Fixed a small bug that was causing the first .PP after START to begin
  at the top margin of the page regardless of any type that preceded
  .PP when docheaders were off.

o Fixed HEADER so that when HEADERS are off the first line of type on
  pages after the first falls properly at the top margin

*Sat Apr 27 2002

o Renamed docprocessing_macros.mom in /examples to
  docprocessing_typeset.mom.  Added docprocessing_typewrite.mom, as
  well as a README file.

o Fixed UNDERLINE_QUOTES (for PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE) so they really are
  on by default as the docs say.

o Changes to doc entry on COLLATE:

    - removed bit about using COLLATE after a cover page (I wrote the
      entry *before* I wrote the macro!).  Cover pages should be
      followed by NEWPAGE, not COLLATE.

    - added caution about mixing PRINTSTYLEs

    - added caution about using DOC_FAMILY to change family of all
      document elements after COLLATE

o Made HEADER_SIZE (and, by extension, FOOTER_SIZE) available to
  PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE.  Changed appropriate doc entries to reflect
  this.

*Wed Apr 24 2002

o Small change to DO_QUOTE to correct a problem with quotes and
  blockquotes that fall in the middle of paragraphs (i.e. text after
  the quote is not a new para).  Basically, added a bit that stores the
  current para indent, sets para indent to 0, invokes a PP, then
  restores the original para indent.

o Added new macro, BREAK_QUOTE, to deal with the problem of
  footnotes in quotes and blockquotes that cross pages or columns.

  Quotes and blockquotes are read into diversions, which means they
  get their footnote information from the page/column on which they
  were started.  If a footnoted quote crosses a page/column, what
  sometimes happens is that the footnote itself is output at the
  bottom of page/column where the quote started, whereas the text
  marker for the footnote appears on the next page/column where the
  quote ends.  Furthermore, the text marker is the one appropriate
  to the previous page.  BREAK_QUOTE is a workaround.

o Added directory /examples to archive.

o Added typesetting_macros.mom, docprocessing_macros.mom, elvis_syntax
  and penguin_small2_bw.ps to /examples.

o Added BREAK_QUOTE to docs, made some additions to reserved words
  list, and corrected a few little doc errors.

*Mon Apr 22 2002

o Added default .L_MARGIN 1i and .R_MARGIN 1i to PAPER, PAGE, and
  PAGEWIDTH.  L_MARGIN is essential otherwise left indents and tabs
  don't have a register #L_MARGIN to work with.  The default right
  margin is a convenience only.  Updated the doc entries for L_MARGIN
  and R_MARGIN to reflect the change.

*Sun Apr 21 2002

o Changes to COLLATE:

    - added some "resets" (LL, LS, QUAD)
    - added a check for whether pagination is at page top (either
      because FOOTERS are on or because PAGENUM_POS was user set).
      If pagination is on, and PAGENUM_POS is TOP, it's turned off
      for next page (start of next collated document) and restored
      for subsequent pages unless PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE is on, in
      which case the page number appears at page top.

o The macro TRAPS is always invoked at the end of DEFAULTS (which is
  called by START).  Formerly, TRAPS was only invoked at the start
  of a doc, not after COLLATE.  Now runs after COLLATE as well.

o Distance from $DOC_TYPE in DOCTYPE NAMED "<string>" to start of
  running text was one linespace too deep.  Fixed (in START).

o When 1st arg to PAGENUM_POS was user set to TOP, running text was
  printing 1 linespace too high, even when PAGINATION was OFF.  Same
  problem when HEADERS were OFF (i.e. nothing in the header margin at
  all).  Fixed by removing -\\n[#DOC_LEAD]u from all .sp |\\n[#T_MARGIN]u
  calls of .el portion after .ie \\n[#HEADERS_ON].

o Added new macro: PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE.  Normally, when FOOTERS are
  being used instead of HEADERS, mom doesn't print the page number at
  the top of the first page of a doc, or the first page of collated
  docs.  New macro allows user to get mom to put the page number on
  "first" pages if that's desired.  Updated docs to include the macro.

o More little fixes to docs.

*Thu Apr 18 2002

o Fixed TI (temporary indent) so that it continues to work as expected,
  even when called while another type of indent is in effect.

*Tue Apr 16 2002

o String tabs weren't working as advertised when set from within
  a tab.  Fixed.  Two new registers added: #ST_OFFSET and #IN_TAB.
  String tabs now behave poperly and intuitively when set within tabs.

o Added a note to docs about surrounding \w'...' escape with double-
  quotes when it's used as an argument to macros

o Added a note to docs that SILENT does not deposit a .br

*Mon Apr 15  2002

o Added new macro BR_AT_LINE_KERN if user wants mom to deposit .br's
  before .RW and/or .EW.

o Added 1/4 points to inline escapes \*[ALD] and \*[RLD].

o Added 1/4 points to inline escapes \*[FP] and \*[BP]

o Updated docs to reflect the above changes.

*Fri Apr 12 2002

o Fixed .RW and .EW which weren't working because of a missing \ in
  \\n(.f register.  Also made it so that .RW and .EW affect all fonts
  in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 at once, hence line kerning now affects
  all fonts that appear after it, not just the font that was current at
  the time of the macros' invocation.

o .SS and .WS now working properly.  .WS no longer has any effect on
  .SS, which remains constant regardless of .WS.  Furthermore, .SS no
  longer gets its value by adding \*[$SS_VAR] + \n[.ss].  Instead,
  it remains constant.  Don't know what I was thinking when I wrote
  the routine in the first place.

o Updated and rewrote doc entry pertaining to SS

*Wed Apr 10 2002

o Renamed tmac.om to om.tmac to bring macro file's name into line
  with current groff policy

o Added more standard paper sizes to PAPER.

o Fixed T_MARGIN, LS, and AUTOLEAD so that if T_MARGIN is set before LS
  or AUTOLEAD at the top of a file, the first line of type falls
  properly on the baseline set by T_MARGIN.  Previously, LS and
  AUTOLEAD automatically advanced by the value passed to them before
  setting the first line of type, meaning that the first line of type
  fell at T_MARGINu+1v instead of T_MARGIN.

o Updated docs to reflect changes.

o Removed #TEST_FOR_NUMERIC from list of reserved words.

o Added "t" and #T_MARGIN_SET to list of reserved words.

*Sat Apr 6 2002

o Added FACTOR arg to AUTOLEAD, so if user wants autolead to be a factor
  of point size, instead of being the sum of pointsize + autolead, s/he
  has the choice.  Incorporated appropriate changes to PS and LS.

o Added new register #AUTOLEAD_FACTOR to reserved words.  Modified
  comments for AUTOLEAD, PS, and LS to reflect changes.  Also
  corrected an error where #AUTOLEAD_VALUE had mistakenly been written
  $AUTOLEAD_VALUE in comments in the macro file, and removed erroneous
  | <anything>.  Updated AUTOLEAD entry in momdoc/typesetting.html
  to reflect the changes.

*Wed Apr 3 2002

o Cleaned up html errors in the docs.

o Added "Next," "Prev" and "Top" links to top and bottom of doc files.

o Fixed some typos in the docs.
