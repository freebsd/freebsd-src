	*   The documentation for the argument to .AS was incorrect for MT 4.
	*   \*(EM should be a double-dash for nroff.
	*   \nS is in points, not units.
	*   If \nO isn't set, the default page offset should be .75i for nroff
		and .963i for troff.
	*   .S D should set the point size to \nS, not 10.
	*   .S was setting the vertical spacing based on the old point size
		instead of the new point size.

		working.
	*   Reset the .SP counters in pg@header so that spacing on one page
		won't affect spacing on subsequent pages.
