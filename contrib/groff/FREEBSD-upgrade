$FreeBSD: src/contrib/groff/FREEBSD-upgrade,v 1.3 2000/01/12 10:35:57 asmodai Exp $

This directory contains virgin copies of the original distribution files
on a "vendor" branch.  Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to upgrade
the files in this directory via patches and a cvs commit.

To upgrade to a newer version of groff, when it is available:
	1. Unpack the new version into an empty directory.
	   [Do not make ANY changes to the files.]

	2. Use the command:
		cvs import -m 'Virgin import of FSF groff v<version>' \
			src/contrib/groff FSF v<version>

	   For example, to do the import of version 1.10, I typed:
		cvs import -m 'Virgin import of FSF groff v1.10' \
			src/contrib/groff FSF v1_10

	3. Follow the instructions printed out in step 2 to resolve any
	   conflicts between local FreeBSD changes and the newer version.

Do not, under any circumstances, deviate from this procedure.

To make local changes to groff, simply patch and commit to the main
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the FSF branch.

All local changes should be submitted to "wl@gnu.org" or 
"Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk" for inclusion in the next vendor release.
