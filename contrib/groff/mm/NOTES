Beware!
This may be old information. Trust only the source. :-)

Implementation notes. (Or how to make your own national mm)

Different commands:

COVER [arg]
MT [arg [addressee]]
The arg is part of a filename in mm/*.MT or mm/*.cov.
This file is read when the macro is executed. Therefore it must be
put before any text output.
In each file there are definitions of all extra macros needed for the
cover sheet. MT files is only for compatibility reasons, and has several
limits due to that it don't know when the cover starts, and cannot
change sizes. Use COVER for new coversheet macros.

But with MT it is possible to write all of the AT&T covers.
An example can be found in mm/0.MT.

When writing a new cover using COVER, have in mind that the cover
should print the page with the COVEND macro. This macro
should be defined by the new macrofile.

Here is a part of ms.cov:
> .\"-----------------
> .de COVEND
> .sp |4.2c
> .cov@print-title
> .cov@print-authors
> .cov@print-firm
> .cov@print-abstract
> .cov@print-date
This is important, since COVER disables the page header.
> .pg@enable-top-trap
Should begin with page one (normally).
> .bp 1
And enable the trap at the page footer.
> .pg@enable-trap
> ..
