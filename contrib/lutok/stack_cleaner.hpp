/// A RAII model for values on the Lua stack.

/// At creation time, the object records the current depth of the Lua stack and,
/// during destruction, restores the recorded depth by popping as many stack
/// entries as required.  As a corollary, the stack can only grow during the
/// lifetime of a stack_cleaner object (or shrink, but cannot become shorter
/// than the depth recorded at creation time).
///
/// Use this class as follows:
///
/// state s;
/// {
///     stack_cleaner cleaner1(s);
///     s.push_integer(3);
///     s.push_integer(5);
///     ... do stuff here ...
///     for (...) {
///         stack_cleaner cleaner2(s);
///         s.load_string("...");
///         s.pcall(0, 1, 0);
///         ... do stuff here ...
///     }
///     // cleaner2 destroyed; the result of pcall is gone.
/// }
/// // cleaner1 destroyed; the integers 3 and 5 are gone.
///
/// You must give a name to the instantiated objects even if they cannot be
/// accessed later.  Otherwise, the instance will be destroyed right away and
