Although supplied with the perl package, the perl scripts in this eg
directory and its subdirectories are placed in the public domain, and
you may do anything with them that you wish.

This stuff is supplied on an as-is basis--little attempt has been made to make
any of it portable.  It's mostly here to give you an idea of what perl code
looks like, and what tricks and idioms are used.

System administrators responsible for many computers will enjoy the items
down in the g directory very much.  The scan directory contains the beginnings
of a system to check on and report various kinds of anomalies.

If you machine doesn't support #!, the first thing you'll want to do is
replace the #! with a couple of lines that look like this:

	eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
		if $running_under_some_shell;

being sure to include any flags that were on the #! line.  A supplied script
called "nih" will translate perl scripts in place for you:

	nih g/g??
