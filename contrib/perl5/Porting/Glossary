This file contains a description of all the shell variables whose value is
determined by the Configure script.  Variables intended for use in C
programs (e.g. I_UNISTD) are already described in config_h.SH.  [`configpm'
generates pod documentation for Config.pm from this file--please try to keep
the formatting regular.]

_a (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for ordinary libraries.
	For unix, it is '.a'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.lib'.

_exe (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
	For unix it is empty.  Other possible values include '.exe'.

_o (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for object files.
	For unix, it is '.o'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.obj'.

afs (afs.U):
	This variable is set to 'true' if AFS (Andrew File System) is used
	on the system, 'false' otherwise.  It is possible to override this
	with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
	what you are doing.

alignbytes (alignbytes.U):
	This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
	double-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
	2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

ansi2knr (ansi2knr.U):
	This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.  
	Currently, this is not supported, so we just abort.

aphostname (d_gethname.U):
	This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
	host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
	it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

api_revision (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_revision is the '5'.
	Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
	like 5.00563.
		perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically search in
	$sitelib/.. for older directories back to the limit specified
	by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
	perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
	directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
	possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
	system is determined in inc_version_list.U.
		XXX To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
	options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
	(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
	Currently, we read a hard-wired value from patchlevel.h.
	Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
	patchlevel.h but then modify it if the current Configure
	options warrant.  patchlevel.h then would use an #ifdef guard.

api_subversion (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_subversion is the '1'.  See api_revision for
	full details.

api_version (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_version is the '6'.  See api_revision for
	full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
	old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
	this was the only versioned directory in $sitelib.)

api_versionstring (patchlevel.U):
	This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
	for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

ar (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "ar" and is not useful.

archlib (archlib.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put architecture-dependent public library files for $package.
	It is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/lib.
	Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
	with filename expansion.

archlibexp (archlib.U):
	This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
	filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.

archname64 (use64bits.U):
	This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

	This variable is a short name to characterize the current
	architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.

archobjs (Unix.U):
	This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
	in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
	empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
	or other facilities.  For perl on OS/2, for example, this would
	include os2/os2.obj.

	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
	is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/bin. Programs using
	this variable must be prepared to deal with ~name substitution.

bincompat5005 (bincompat5005.U):
	This variable contains y if this version of Perl should be
	binary-compatible with Perl 5.005.

	on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

c (n.U):
	This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

	flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
	the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be 'workshop'.

ccsymbols (Cppsym.U):

	This variable contains the command which will invoke a C preprocessor
	on standard input and put the output to stdout. It is guaranteed not
	to be a wrapper and may be a null string if no preprocessor can be
	made directly available. This preprocessor might be different from the
	one used by the C compiler. Don't forget to append cpplast after the
	preprocessor options.

	This variable specifies the list of subdirectories in over
	which perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search when adding directories to @INC.  The elements in

	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

installbin (bin.U):
	This variable is the same as binexp unless AFS is running in which case
	the user is explicitely prompted for it. This variable should always
	be used in your makefiles for maximum portability.

installman1dir (man1dir.U):
	This variable is really the same as man1direxp, unless you are using
	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installman3dir (man3dir.U):
	This variable is really the same as man3direxp, unless you are using
	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas
	man3direxp only points to the read-only access location. For extra
	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installprefix (installprefix.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory below which 
	"make install" will install the package.  For most users, this
	is the same as prefix.  However, it is useful for

	a system running AFS, in which case they may differ slightly. You
	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.

installsitelib (sitelib.U):
	This variable is really the same as sitelibexp but may differ on
	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

installstyle (installstyle.U):
	This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.
	This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
	manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
	this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
	stored directly in Config.pm.  Currently, there are only two
	styles:  "lib" and "lib/perl5".  The default library locations
	(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $prefix/lib or
	$prefix/lib/perl5.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
	directory dedicated to perl (e.g. /opt/perl), while the latter
	is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
	$prefix=/usr/local.
		This may later be extended to include other information, so
	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.
		For compatibility with perl5.005 and earlier, the default
	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
	"perl".

loclibpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds the paths (space-separated) used to find local
	libraries.  It is prepended to libpth, and is intended to be easily
	set from the command line.

man3ext (man3dir.U):
	This variable contains the extension that the manual page should
	have: one of 'n', 'l', or '3'.  The Makefile must supply the '.'.
	See man3dir.

Mcc (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the Mcc program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "Mcc" and is not useful.

	int, unsigned short, or whatever type is used to declare file 
	modes for system calls.

	full pathname (if any) of the more program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "more" and is not useful.

multiarch (multiarch.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the MULTIARCH symbol
	which signifies the presence of multiplatform files.
	This is normally set by hints files.

mv (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

myarchname (archname.U):
	This variable holds the architecture name computed by Configure in
	a previous run. It is not intended to be perused by any user and
	should never be set in a hint file.

mydomain (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYDOMAIN symbol,
	which is the domain of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain must be appended to myhostname to form a complete host name.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myhostname (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYHOSTNAME symbol,
	which is the name of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain is not kept with hostname, but must be gotten from mydomain.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myuname (Oldconfig.U):
	The output of 'uname -a' if available, otherwise the hostname. On Xenix,
	pseudo variables assignments in the output are stripped, thank you. The
	whole thing is then lower-cased.

n (n.U):
	This variable contains the '-n' flag if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

need_va_copy (need_va_copy.U):
	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores
	the variable argument list datatype, va_list, in a format
	that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some
	other means must be used when copying is required.
	As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision)
	of copying mechanisms, handy.h defines a platform-
	independent macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

netdb_hlen_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 2nd argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is int or size_t or unsigned.
	This is only useful if you have gethostbyaddr(), naturally.

	This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is char * or void *,  possibly
	with or without a const prefix.

	getnetbyaddr().  Usually, this is int or long.
	This is only useful if you have getnetbyaddr(), naturally.

nm (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the nm program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "nm" and is not useful.

nm_opt (usenm.U):
	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm.

nm_so_opt (usenm.U):
	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm
	to work on a shared library but that can not be used on an
	archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where
	nm --dynamic is *required* to get symbols from an ELF library which
	has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal* on an archive library.
	Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

nonxs_ext (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions included
	in the package.  All of them will be built.

nroff (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the

o_nonblock (nblock_io.U):
	This variable bears the symbol value to be used during open() or fcntl()
	to turn on non-blocking I/O for a file descriptor. If you wish to switch
	between blocking and non-blocking, you may try ioctl(FIOSNBIO) instead,
	but that is only supported by some devices.

obj_ext (Unix.U):
	This is an old synonym for _o.

old_pthread_create_joinable (d_pthrattrj.U):
	This variable defines the constant to use for creating joinable
	(aka undetached) pthreads.  Unused if pthread.h defines
	PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.  If used, possible values are
	PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED and __UNDETACHED.

optimize (ccflags.U):
	This variable contains any optimizer/debugger flag that should be used.
	It is up to the Makefile to use it.

orderlib (orderlib.U):
	This variable is "true" if the components of libraries must be ordered
	(with `lorder $* | tsort`) before placing them in an archive.  Set to
	"false" if ranlib or ar can generate random libraries.

osname (Oldconfig.U):
	This variable contains the operating system name (e.g. sunos,
	solaris, hpux, etc.).  It can be useful later on for setting
	defaults.  Any spaces are replaced with underscores.  It is set
	to a null string if we can't figure it out.

osvers (Oldconfig.U):
	This variable contains the operating system version (e.g.
	4.1.3, 5.2, etc.).  It is primarily used for helping select
	an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for
	setting defaults.  It is set to '' if we can't figure it out.
	We try to be flexible about how much of the version number
	to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the
	same for this package, hints files might just be os_4.0 or
	os_4.1, etc., not keeping separate files for each little release.

otherlibdirs (otherlibdirs.U):
	This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl
	binary to search for additional library files or modules.
	These directories will be tacked to the end of @INC.
	Perl will automatically search below each path for version-

	for more details.
	A value of ' ' means 'none' and is used to preserve this value
	for the next run through Configure.

package (package.U):
	This variable contains the name of the package being constructed.
	It is primarily intended for the use of later Configure units.

pager (pager.U):
	This variable contains the name of the preferred pager on the system.
	Usual values are (the full pathnames of) more, less, pg, or cat.

passcat (nis.U):
	This variable contains a command that produces the text of the
	/etc/passwd file.  This is normally "cat /etc/passwd", but can be
	"ypcat passwd" when NIS is used.
	On some systems, such as os390, there may be no equivalent
	command, in which case this variable is unset.

patchlevel (patchlevel.U):
	The patchlevel level of this package.
	The value of patchlevel comes from the patchlevel.h file.
	In a version number such as 5.6.1, this is the "6".
	In patchlevel.h, this is referred to as "PERL_VERSION".

path_sep (Unix.U):
	This is an old synonym for p_ in Head.U, the character
	used to separate elements in the command shell search PATH.

perl5 (perl5.U):
	This variable contains the full path (if any) to a previously
	installed perl5.005 or later suitable for running the script
	to determine inc_version_list.

	In a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 2.
	Values greater than 50 represent potentially unstable
	development subversions.
	This value is manually set in patchlevel.h

PERL_VERSION (Oldsyms.U):
	In a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 6.
	This value is manually set in patchlevel.h

perladmin (perladmin.U):

	shell scripts and in the "eval 'exec'" idiom.

pg (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the pg program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "pg" and is not useful.

phostname (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the PHOSTNAME symbol,
	which is a command that can be fed to popen() to get the host name.
	The program should probably not presume that the domain is or isn't
	there already.

pidtype (pidtype.U):
	This variable defines PIDTYPE to be something like pid_t, int, 
	ushort, or whatever type is used to declare process ids in the kernel.

plibpth (libpth.U):
	Holds the private path used by Configure to find out the libraries.
	Its value is prepend to libpth. This variable takes care of special
	machines, like the mips.  Usually, it should be empty.

pm_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl
	compatible with the present perl.  (That is, pure perl modules
	written for $pm_apiversion will still work for the current
	version).  perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search in $sitelib for older directories across major versions
	back to pm_apiversion.  This is only useful if you have a perl
	library directory tree structured like the default one.  The
	versioned site_perl library was introduced in 5.005, so that's
	the default setting for this variable.  It's hard to imagine
	it changing before Perl6.  It is included here for symmetry
	with xs_apiveprsion -- the searching algorithms will
	(presumably) be similar.
	See the INSTALL file for how this works.

pmake (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

	user will install the package.  Usually, this is /usr/local, and
	executables go in /usr/local/bin, library stuff in /usr/local/lib,
	man pages in /usr/local/man, etc.  It is only used to set defaults
	for things in bin.U, mansrc.U, privlib.U, or scriptdir.U.

prefixexp (prefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below
	which the user will install the package.  Derived from prefix.

privlib (privlib.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the PRIVLIB symbol,
	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).

privlibexp (privlib.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of privlib, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

	generate normalized random numbers.

randfunc (randfunc.U):
	Indicates the name of the random number function to use.
	Values include drand48, random, and rand. In C programs,

	random numbers over the range [0., 1.[ (see drand01 and nrand).

randseedtype (randfunc.U):
	Indicates the type of the argument of the seedfunc.

ranlib (orderlib.U):
	This variable is set to the pathname of the ranlib program, if it is
	needed to generate random libraries.  Set to ":" if ar can generate
	random libraries or if random libraries are not supported

rd_nodata (nblock_io.U):
	This variable holds the return code from read() when no data is
	present. It should be -1, but some systems return 0 when O_NDELAY is
	used, which is a shame because you cannot make the difference between
	no data and an EOF.. Sigh!

revision (patchlevel.U):
	The value of revision comes from the patchlevel.h file.
	In a version number such as 5.6.1, this is the "5".
	In patchlevel.h, this is referred to as "PERL_REVISION".

	This variable defines the way to yield the execution
	of the current thread.

scriptdir (scriptdir.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put publicly scripts for the package in question.  It is either
	the same directory as for binaries, or a special one that can be
	mounted across different architectures, like /usr/share. Programs
	must be prepared to deal with ~name expansion.

scriptdirexp (scriptdir.U):
	This variable is the same as scriptdir, but is filename expanded
	at configuration time, for programs not wanting to bother with it.

sed (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the sed program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "sed" and is not useful.

	Indicates the random number generating seed function.
	Values include srand48, srandom, and srand.

selectminbits (selectminbits.U):
	This variable holds the minimum number of bits operated by select.
	That is, if you do select(n, ...), how many bits at least will be
	cleared in the masks if some activity is detected.  Usually this
	is either n or 32*ceil(n/32), especially many little-endians do
	the latter.  This is only useful if you have select(), naturally.

selecttype (selecttype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
	arguments to select.  Usually, this is 'fd_set *', if HAS_FD_SET

	/bin/pdksh, /bin/ash, /bin/bash, or even something such as
	D:/bin/sh.exe.
	This unit comes before Options.U, so you can't set sh with a '-D'
	option, though you can override this (and startsh)
	with '-O -Dsh=/bin/whatever -Dstartsh=whatever'

shar (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

sharpbang (spitshell.U):
	This variable contains the string #! if this system supports that
	construct.

shmattype (d_shmat.U):
	This symbol contains the type of pointer returned by shmat().
	It can be 'void *' or 'char *'.

shortsize (intsize.U):
	This variable contains the value of the SHORTSIZE symbol which
	indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a short.

shrpenv (libperl.U):
	If the user builds a shared libperl.so, then we need to tell the
	'perl' executable where it will be able to find the installed libperl.so. 
	One way to do this on some systems is to set the environment variable
	LD_RUN_PATH to the directory that will be the final location of the
	shared libperl.so.  The makefile can use this with something like
	$shrpenv $(CC) -o perl perlmain.o $libperl $libs
	Typical values are
	shrpenv="env LD_RUN_PATH=$archlibexp/CORE"
	or
	shrpenv=''
	See the main perl Makefile.SH for actual working usage.
	Alternatively, we might be able to use a command line option such

	terminated with a plain 0.  The leading SIG in signal names
	is removed. See sig_num.

sig_num (sig_name.U):
	This variable holds the signal numbers, space separated. A ZERO is
	prepended to the list (corresponding to the fake SIGZERO), and

	sig_name list.

sig_num_init (sig_name.U):
	This variable holds the signal numbers, enclosed in double quotes and
	separated by commas, suitable for use in the SIG_NUM definition

sitearch (sitearch.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the SITEARCH symbol,
	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
	architecture-dependent modules in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
	executables in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

	of bytes or an error condition.  It must be a signed type.
	We will pick a type such that sizeof(SSize_t) == sizeof(Size_t).

startperl (startperl.U):
	This variable contains the string to put on the front of a perl
	script to make sure (hopefully) that it runs with perl and not some
	shell. Of course, that leading line must be followed by the classical
	perl idiom:
	eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
	if $running_under_some_shell;
	to guarantee perl startup should the shell execute the script. Note
	that this magic incatation is not understood by csh.

	script to make sure (hopefully) that it runs with sh and not some
	other shell.

	stdio to refill it's internal buffers (?).  This will
	be used to define the macro FILE_filbuf(fp).

stdio_ptr (d_stdstdio.U):
	This variable defines how, given a FILE pointer, fp, to access the

	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

subversion (patchlevel.U):
	The subversion level of this package.
	The value of subversion comes from the patchlevel.h file.
	In a version number such as 5.6.1, this is the "1".
	In patchlevel.h, this is referred to as "PERL_SUBVERSION".
	This is unique to perl.

sysman (sysman.U):
	This variable holds the place where the manual is located on this
	system. It is not the place where the user wants to put his manual
	pages. Rather it is the place where Configure may look to find manual
	for unix commands (section 1 of the manual usually). See mansrc.

timetype (d_time.U):
	This variable holds the type returned by time(). It can be long,
	or time_t on BSD sites (in which case <sys/types.h> should be
	included). Anyway, the type Time_t should be used.

touch (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the touch program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "touch" and is not useful.

tr (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the tr program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "tr" and is not useful.

trnl (trnl.U):
	This variable contains the value to be passed to the tr(1)
	command to transliterate a newline.  Typical values are
	'\012' and '\n'.  This is needed for EBCDIC systems where

	threading implementation.

use64bitall (use64bits.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the USE_64_BIT_ALL symbol,
	and indicates that 64-bit integer types should be used
	when available.  The maximal possible
	64-bitness is employed: LP64 or ILP64, meaning that you will
	be able to use more than 2 gigabytes of memory.  This mode is
	even more binary incompatible than USE_64_BIT_INT. You may not
	be able to run the resulting executable in a 32-bit CPU at all or
	you may need at least to reboot your OS to 64-bit mode.

use64bitint (use64bits.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the USE_64_BIT_INT symbol,
	and indicates that 64-bit integer types should be used
	when available.  The minimal possible 64-bitness
	is employed, just enough to get 64-bit integers into Perl.
	This may mean using for example "long longs", while your memory
	may still be limited to 2 gigabytes.

	This variable indicates if the system supports dynamic
	loading of some sort.  See also dlsrc and dlobj.

	This variable conditionally defines the MULTIPLICITY symbol,
	and indicates that Perl should be built to use multiplicity.

usemymalloc (mallocsrc.U):
	This variable contains y if the malloc that comes with this package
	is desired over the system's version of malloc.  People often include
	special versions of malloc for effiency, but such versions are often
	less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.
	If this is 'y', then -lmalloc is removed from $libs.

usenm (usenm.U):
	This variable contains 'true' or 'false' depending whether the
	nm extraction is wanted or not.

useopcode (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds either 'true' or 'false' to indicate
	whether the Opcode extension should be used.  The sole
	use for this currently is to allow an easy mechanism
	for users to skip the Opcode extension from the Configure
	command line.

useperlio (useperlio.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the USE_PERLIO symbol,
	and indicates that the PerlIO abstraction should be
	used throughout.

useposix (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds either 'true' or 'false' to indicate
	whether the POSIX extension should be used.  The sole
	use for this currently is to allow an easy mechanism
	for hints files to indicate that POSIX will not compile
	on a particular system.

usesfio (d_sfio.U):
	This variable is set to true when the user agrees to use sfio.
	It is set to false when sfio is not available or when the user
	explicitely requests not to use sfio.  It is here primarily so
	that command-line settings can override the auto-detection of
	d_sfio without running into a "WHOA THERE".

useshrplib (libperl.U):
	This variable is set to 'yes' if the user wishes
	to build a shared libperl, and 'no' otherwise.

usesocks (usesocks.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the USE_SOCKS symbol,
	and indicates that Perl should be built to use SOCKS.

usethreads (usethreads.U):
	This variable conditionally defines the USE_THREADS symbol,
	and indicates that Perl should be built to use threads.

usevendorprefix (vendorprefix.U):
	This variable tells whether the vendorprefix
	and consequently other vendor* paths are in use.

usevfork (d_vfork.U):
	This variable is set to true when the user accepts to use vfork.
	It is set to false when no vfork is available or when the user
	explicitely requests not to use vfork.

usrinc (usrinc.U):
	This variable holds the path of the include files, which is
	usually /usr/include. It is mainly used by other Configure units.

	This variable contains the format string used for printing
	a Perl UV as an unsigned hexadecimal integer in lowercase abcdef.

uvXUformat (perlxvf.U):
	This variable contains the format string used for printing
	a Perl UV as an unsigned hexadecimal integer in uppercase ABCDEF.

vendorarch (vendorarch.U):
	This variable contains the value of the PERL_VENDORARCH symbol.
	It may have a ~ on the front. 
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
	architecture-dependent modules and extensions in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor 
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorarchexp (vendorarch.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorarch, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

vendorbin (vendorbin.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the VENDORBIN symbol.
	It may have a ~ on the front.
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place additional
	binaries in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor 
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorbinexp (vendorbin.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorbin, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

vendorlib (vendorlib.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the VENDORLIB symbol,
	which is the name of the private library for this package.
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
	modules in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor 
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorlib_stem (vendorlib.U):
	This variable is $vendorlibexp with any trailing version-specific component
	removed.  The elements in inc_version_list (inc_version_list.U) can
	be tacked onto this variable to generate a list of directories to search.

vendorlibexp (vendorlib.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorlib, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

vendorprefix (vendorprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below
	which the vendor will install add-on packages.
	See INSTALL for usage and examples.

vendorprefixexp (vendorprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below
	which the vendor will install add-on packages.  Derived from vendorprefix.

version (patchlevel.U):
	The full version number of this package, such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1).
	This combines revision, patchlevel, and subversion to get the
	full version number, including any possible subversions.
	This is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is
	filesystem dependent.

versiononly (versiononly.U):
	If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific
	components of a perl installation should be installed.
	This may be useful for making a test installation of a new
	version without disturbing the existing installation.
	Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's -v option.
	In particular, the non-versioned scripts and programs such as
	a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are not installed
	(see INSTALL for a more complete list).  Nor are the man
	pages installed.
	Usually, this is undef.

	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

voidflags (voidflags.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the VOIDFLAGS symbol,
	which indicates how much support of the void type is given by this
	compiler.  See VOIDFLAGS for more info.

xlibpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds extra path (space-separated) used to find
	libraries on this platform, for example CPU-specific libraries
	(on multi-CPU platforms) may be listed here.

xs_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  perl.c:incpush() and
	lib/lib.pm will automatically search in $sitearch for older
	directories across major versions back to xs_apiversion.
	This is only useful if you have a perl library directory tree
	structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.
	The versioned site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005,
	so that is the lowest possible value.
	Since this can depend on compile time options (such as
	bincompat) it is set by Configure.  Other non-default sources
	of potential incompatibility, such as multiplicity, threads,
	debugging, 64bits, sfio, etc., are not checked for currently,
	though in principle we could go snooping around in old
	Config.pm files.

zcat (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is a plain '' and is not useful.

zip (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the zip program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "zip" and is not useful.
