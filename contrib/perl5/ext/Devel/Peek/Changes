0.86:
	By Gisle Aas:
	   - Updated the documentation.
	   - Move string printer to it's own function: fprintpv()
	   - Use it to print PVs, HV keys, MG_PTR
	   - Don't print IV for hashes as KEY is the same field
	   - Tag GvSTASH as "GvSTASH" in order to not confuse it with
	     the other STASH field, e.g.  Dump(bless \*foo, "bar")
0.87:
	Extra indentation of SvRV.
	AMAGIC removed.
	Head of OOK data printed too.
0.88:
	PADLIST and OUTSIDE of CVs itemized.

			  print hash fill statistics.
0.89:
	Changes by Gisle: optree dump.
0.90:
	DumpWithOP, DumpProg exported.
