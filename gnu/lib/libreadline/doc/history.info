History Interaction
===================

   The History library provides a history expansion feature that is
similar to the history expansion provided by `csh'.  The following text
describes the syntax used to manipulate the history information.

   History expansion takes place in two parts.  The first is to
determine which line from the previous history should be used during
substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line for
inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the previous
history is called the "event", and the portions of that line that are
acted upon are called "words".  The line is broken into words in the
same fashion that Bash does, so that several English (or Unix) words
surrounded by quotes are considered as one word.

Event Designators
-----------------

   An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the
history list.

`!'
     Start a history substitution, except when followed by a space, tab,
     the end of the line, = or (.

`!!'
     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.

`!n'
     Refer to command line N.

`!-n'
     Refer to the command N lines back.

`!string'
     Refer to the most recent command starting with STRING.

`!?string'[`?']
     Refer to the most recent command containing STRING.

`!#'
     The entire command line typed so far.

`^string1^string2^'
     Quick Substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing STRING1
     with STRING2.  Equivalent to `!!:s/string1/string2/'.


File: history.info,  Node: Word Designators,  Next: Modifiers,  Prev: Event Designators,  Up: History Interaction

Word Designators
----------------

   A : separates the event specification from the word designator.  It
can be omitted if the word designator begins with a ^, $, * or %.
Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word
being denoted by a 0 (zero).

`0 (zero)'
     The `0'th word.  For many applications, this is the command word.

`n'
     The Nth word.

`^'
     The first argument;  that is, word 1.

`$'
     The last argument.

`%'
     The word matched by the most recent `?string?' search.

`x-y'
     A range of words; `-Y' abbreviates `0-Y'.

`*'
     All of the words, except the `0'th.  This is a synonym for `1-$'.
     It is not an error to use * if there is just one word in the event;
     the empty string is returned in that case.

`x*'
     Abbreviates `x-$'

`x-'
     Abbreviates `x-$' like `x*', but omits the last word.


File: history.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Prev: Word Designators,  Up: History Interaction

Modifiers
---------

   After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or
more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a :.

`h'
     Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.

`r'
     Remove a trailing suffix of the form `.'SUFFIX, leaving the
     basename.

`e'
     Remove all but the trailing suffix.

`t'
     Remove all leading  pathname  components, leaving the tail.

`p'
     Print the new command but do not execute it.

`s/old/new/'
     Substitute NEW for the first occurrence of OLD in the event line.
     Any delimiter may be used in place of /.  The delimiter may be
     quoted in OLD and NEW with a single backslash.  If & appears in
     NEW, it is replaced by OLD.  A single backslash will quote the &.
     The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character on the
     input line.

`&'
     Repeat the previous substitution.

`g'
     Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  Used in
     conjunction with `s', as in `gs/old/new/', or with `&'.

Introduction to History
=======================

   Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU
History library is able to keep track of those lines, associate
arbitrary data with each line, and utilize information from previous
lines in composing new ones.

   The programmer using the History library has available functions for
remembering lines on a history list, associating arbitrary data with a
line, removing lines from the list, searching through the list for a
line containing an arbitrary text string, and referencing any line in
the list directly.  In addition, a history "expansion" function is
available which provides for a consistent user interface across
different programs.

   The user using programs written with the History library has the
benefit of a consistent user interface with a set of well-known
commands for manipulating the text of previous lines and using that text
in new commands.  The basic history manipulation commands are similar to
the history substitution provided by `csh'.

   If the programmer desires, he can use the Readline library, which
includes some history manipulation by default, and has the added
advantage of command line editing.

History Storage
===============

   The history list is an array of history entries.  A history entry is
declared as follows:

     typedef struct _hist_entry {
       char *line;
       char *data;
     } HIST_ENTRY;

   The history list itself might therefore be declared as

     HIST_ENTRY **the_history_list;

   The state of the History library is encapsulated into a single
structure:

     /* A structure used to pass the current state of the history stuff around. */
     typedef struct _hist_state {
       HIST_ENTRY **entries;         /* Pointer to the entries themselves. */
       int offset;                   /* The location pointer within this array. */
       int length;                   /* Number of elements within this array. */
       int size;                     /* Number of slots allocated to this array. */
       int flags;
     } HISTORY_STATE;

   If the flags member includes `HS_STIFLED', the history has been
stifled.

Initializing History and State Management
-----------------------------------------

   This section describes functions used to initialize and manage the
state of the History library when you want to use the history functions
in your program.

 - Function: void using_history ()
     Begin a session in which the history functions might be used.  This
     initializes the interactive variables.

 - Function: HISTORY_STATE * history_get_history_state ()
     Return a structure describing the current state of the input
     history.

 - Function: void history_set_history_state (HISTORY_STATE *state)
     Set the state of the history list according to STATE.


File: history.info,  Node: History List Management,  Next: Information About the History List,  Prev: Initializing History and State Management,  Up: History Functions

History List Management
-----------------------

   These functions manage individual entries on the history list, or set
parameters managing the list itself.

 - Function: void add_history (char *string)
     Place STRING at the end of the history list.  The associated data
     field (if any) is set to `NULL'.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * remove_history (int which)
     Remove history entry at offset WHICH from the history.  The
     removed element is returned so you can free the line, data, and
     containing structure.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * replace_history_entry (int which, char *line,
          char *data)
     Make the history entry at offset WHICH have LINE and DATA.  This
     returns the old entry so you can dispose of the data.  In the case
     of an invalid WHICH, a `NULL' pointer is returned.

 - Function: void stifle_history (int max)
     Stifle the history list, remembering only the last MAX entries.

 - Function: int unstifle_history ()
     Stop stifling the history.  This returns the previous amount the
     history was stifled.  The value is positive if the history was
     stifled, negative if it wasn't.

 - Function: int history_is_stifled ()
     Returns non-zero if the history is stifled, zero if it is not.


File: history.info,  Node: Information About the History List,  Next: Moving Around the History List,  Prev: History List Management,  Up: History Functions

Information About the History List
----------------------------------

   These functions return information about the entire history list or
individual list entries.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY ** history_list ()
     Return a `NULL' terminated array of `HIST_ENTRY' which is the
     current input history.  Element 0 of this list is the beginning of
     time.  If there is no history, return `NULL'.

 - Function: int where_history ()
     Returns the offset of the current history element.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * current_history ()
     Return the history entry at the current position, as determined by
     `where_history ()'.  If there is no entry there, return a `NULL'
     pointer.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * history_get (int offset)
     Return the history entry at position OFFSET, starting from
     `history_base'.  If there is no entry there, or if OFFSET is
     greater than the history length, return a `NULL' pointer.

 - Function: int history_total_bytes ()
     Return the number of bytes that the primary history entries are
     using.  This function returns the sum of the lengths of all the
     lines in the history.


File: history.info,  Node: Moving Around the History List,  Next: Searching the History List,  Prev: Information About the History List,  Up: History Functions

Moving Around the History List
------------------------------

   These functions allow the current index into the history list to be
set or changed.

 - Function: int history_set_pos (int pos)
     Set the position in the history list to POS, an absolute index
     into the list.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * previous_history ()
     Back up the current history offset to the previous history entry,
     and return a pointer to that entry.  If there is no previous
     entry, return a `NULL' pointer.

 - Function: HIST_ENTRY * next_history ()
     Move the current history offset forward to the next history entry,
     and return the a pointer to that entry.  If there is no next
     entry, return a `NULL' pointer.


File: history.info,  Node: Searching the History List,  Next: Managing the History File,  Prev: Moving Around the History List,  Up: History Functions

Searching the History List
--------------------------

   These functions allow searching of the history list for entries
containing a specific string.  Searching may be performed both forward
and backward from the current history position.  The search may be
"anchored", meaning that the string must match at the beginning of the
history entry.

 - Function: int history_search (char *string, int direction)
     Search the history for STRING, starting at the current history
     offset.  If DIRECTION < 0, then the search is through previous
     entries, else through subsequent.  If STRING is found, then the
     current history index is set to that history entry, and the value
     returned is the offset in the line of the entry where STRING was
     found.  Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a -1 is returned.

 - Function: int history_search_prefix (char *string, int direction)
     Search the history for STRING, starting at the current history
     offset.  The search is anchored: matching lines must begin with
     STRING.  If DIRECTION < 0, then the search is through previous
     entries, else through subsequent.  If STRING is found, then the
     current history index is set to that entry, and the return value
     is 0.  Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a -1 is returned.

 - Function: int history_search_pos (char *string, int direction, int
          pos)
     Search for STRING in the history list, starting at POS, an
     absolute index into the list.  If DIRECTION is negative, the search
     proceeds backward from POS, otherwise forward.  Returns the
     absolute index of the history element where STRING was found, or
     -1 otherwise.


File: history.info,  Node: Managing the History File,  Next: History Expansion,  Prev: Searching the History List,  Up: History Functions

Managing the History File
-------------------------

   The History library can read the history from and write it to a file.
This section documents the functions for managing a history file.

 - Function: int read_history (char *filename)
     Add the contents of FILENAME to the history list, a line at a
     time.  If FILENAME is `NULL', then read from `~/.history'.
     Returns 0 if successful, or errno if not.

 - Function: int read_history_range (char *filename, int from, int to)
     Read a range of lines from FILENAME, adding them to the history
     list.  Start reading at line FROM and end at TO.  If FROM is zero,
     start at the beginning.  If TO is less than FROM, then read until
     the end of the file.  If FILENAME is `NULL', then read from
     `~/.history'.  Returns 0 if successful, or `errno' if not.

 - Function: int write_history (char *filename)
     Write the current history to FILENAME, overwriting FILENAME if
     necessary.  If FILENAME is `NULL', then write the history list to
     `~/.history'.  Values returned are as in `read_history ()'.

 - Function: int append_history (int nelements, char *filename)
     Append the last NELEMENTS of the history list to FILENAME.

 - Function: int history_truncate_file (char *filename, int nlines)
     Truncate the history file FILENAME, leaving only the last NLINES
     lines.


File: history.info,  Node: History Expansion,  Prev: Managing the History File,  Up: History Functions

History Expansion
-----------------

   These functions implement `csh'-like history expansion.

 - Function: int history_expand (char *string, char **output)
     Expand STRING, placing the result into OUTPUT, a pointer to a
     string (*note History Interaction::.).  Returns:
    `0'
          If no expansions took place (or, if the only change in the
          text was the de-slashifying of the history expansion
          character);

    `1'
          if expansions did take place;

    `-1'
          if there was an error in expansion;

    `2'
          if the returned line should only be displayed, but not
          executed, as with the `:p' modifier (*note Modifiers::.).

     If an error ocurred in expansion, then OUTPUT contains a
     descriptive error message.

 - Function: char * history_arg_extract (int first, int last, char
          *string)
     Extract a string segment consisting of the FIRST through LAST
     arguments present in STRING.  Arguments are broken up as in Bash.

 - Function: char * get_history_event (char *string, int *cindex, int
          qchar)
     Returns the text of the history event beginning at STRING +
     *CINDEX.  *CINDEX is modified to point to after the event
     specifier.  At function entry, CINDEX points to the index into
     STRING where the history event specification begins.  QCHAR is a
     character that is allowed to end the event specification in
     addition to the "normal" terminating characters.

 - Function: char ** history_tokenize (char *string)
     Return an array of tokens parsed out of STRING, much as the shell
     might.  The tokens are split on white space and on the characters
     `()<>;&|$', and shell quoting conventions are obeyed.

History Variables
=================

   This section describes the externally visible variables exported by
the GNU History Library.

 - Variable: int history_base
     The logical offset of the first entry in the history list.

 - Variable: int history_length
     The number of entries currently stored in the history list.

 - Variable: int max_input_history
     The maximum number of history entries.  This must be changed using
     `stifle_history ()'.

 - Variable: char history_expansion_char
     The character that starts a history event.  The default is `!'.

 - Variable: char history_subst_char
     The character that invokes word substitution if found at the start
     of a line.  The default is `^'.

 - Variable: char history_comment_char
     During tokenization, if this character is seen as the first
     character of a word, then it and all subsequent characters up to a
     newline are ignored, suppressing history expansion for the
     remainder of the line.  This is disabled by default.

 - Variable: char * history_no_expand_chars
     The list of characters which inhibit history expansion if found
     immediately following HISTORY_EXPANSION_CHAR.  The default is
     whitespace and `='.
