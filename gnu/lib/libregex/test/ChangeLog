Thu Mar 25 21:23:43 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* debugmalloc.c: #include <string.h>, and remove declaration of
	memcpy.

Sun Dec 13 20:59:32 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

        * tregress.c (test_regress): Add regression test for matching
        "[a-a]" against "a" with the upcase translation map.

        * iregex.c (print_regs): Don't print a newline after the register
        contents.
        (main): Instead, write out newlines here after printing match and
        search results; this way, we get a newline whether or not the
        pattern matched.

Fri Dec 11 03:30:50 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* tregress.c (test_regress): Add new test to catch bug fixed by
	change to regex.c today.

	* Makefile.in (dregex.o): Depend on `../regex.[ch]', not `regex.[ch]'.

Sun Nov 15 07:51:40 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* debugmalloc.c (memcpy): Declare; also, include <assert.h>.

	* psx-interf.c (fill_pmatch): Declare offsets as `regoff_t'
	instead of `off_t'.

Thu Nov 12 11:29:58 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* iregex.c (main): Remove unused variable `c'; initialize
	the char array in C code; only call print_regs if the match and
	search succeeded.
        (strlen): Declare.

	* tregress.c (test_regress): Bug from enami.

Tue Nov 10 10:36:53 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* tregress.c (test_regress): Remove Emacs 19 diff bug from rms, as
	it was never the right thing to test anyway, and the test itself
	had bugs in it.

Mon Nov  9 10:09:40 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* tregress.c (test_regress): Bug from meyering.

Thu Sep 24 10:48:34 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

        * Makefile.in: avoid $< (except in implicit rule).

Sat Sep 19 15:38:29 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@hayley)

        * Makefile.in (TAGS): include regex.c and regex.h.

Wed Sep 16 09:29:27 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@hayley)

        * xmalloc.c (xmalloc): use char *, not void *, as some compilers
          bomb out on the latter.

        * Makefile.in (LOADLIBES): use LIBS instead, as that what's
          Autoconf wants to define.

        * other.c: remove tests for ^/$ around newlines.

Tue Sep 15 11:01:15 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@hayley)

        * fileregex.c (main): call re_search_2 instead of re_search.

        * Makefile.in (regex.o): make target dregex.o, so VPATH doesn't
          find ../regex.o.

Sun Sep 13 06:50:03 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@hayley)

        * Created.
