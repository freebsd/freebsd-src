Note:
	There is a feature which can be optionally compiled into
mkisofs that allows you to merge arbitrary directory trees into the
image you are creating.  You need to compile with -DADD_FILES for my
changes to take effect.   Thanks to Ross Biro biro@yggdrasil.com.

	This program requires a lot of virtual memory to run since it
builds all of the directories in memory.  The exact requirements
depend upon a lot of things, but for Rock Ridge discs 12Mb would not
be unreasonable.  Without RockRidge and without the translation
tables, the requirements would be considerably less.

	The cdwrite utility is maintained separately from mkisofs by
yggdrasil.com.  It is enclosed here as a convenience, since the two programs
are often useful together.  

*****************************
Notes for version 1.2.

	Minor bugfixes here and there.  Support for compiled in
defaults for many of the text fields in the volume header are now
present, and there is also support for a file ".mkisofsrc" that can
also read settings for these parameters.

	A short script "Configure" was added to allow us to set up special
compile options that depend upon the system that we are running on.
This should help stamp out the sphaghetti-isms that were starting to grow
up in various places in the code.

	You should get more meaningful error messages if you run out of
memory.

*****************************
Notes for version 1.1.

	The big news is that SUSP CE entries are now generated for
extremely long filenames and symlink names.  This virtually guarantees
that there is no limit (OK, well, about 600Mb) for file name lengths.
I have tested this as well as I can, and it seems to work with linux.
This would only be used very rarely I suspect.

	Also, I believe that support for VMS is done.  You must be
careful, because only Stream-LF and FIxed length record files can be
recorded.  The rest are rejected with error messages.  Perhaps I am
being too severe here.

	There is a bugfix in the sorting of entries on the disc - we
need to stop comparing once we reach the ';' character.

	There are four new options -z -d -D -l -V.  Some of these tell
mkisofs to relax some of the iso9660 restrictions, and many systems
apparently do not really seem to mind.  Use these with caution.

	Some diagnostic programs to scan disc images are in the diag
directory.  These are not as portable as mkisofs, and may have some
bugs.  Still they are useful because they can check for bugs that I might
have introduced as I add new features.

*****************************
Notes for version 1.0.

	In version 1.0, the date fields in the TF fields were fixed -
previously I was storing st_ctime as the file creation time instead of
the file attribute change time.  Thanks to Peter van der Veen for
pointing this out.  I have one slight concern with this change,
however.  The Young Minds software is definitely supplying 3 dates
(creation, modification and access), and I would strongly suspect that
they are incorrectly putting the file attribute change time in the
file creation slot.  I would be curious to see how the different RRIP
filesystems treat this.  Anyway, this is something to keep in the back
of your mind.

	The symlink handling was not quite correct in 0.99 - this is
now fixed.  Only some systems seemed to have been affected by this bug.

	A command line option is now present to allow you to
specifically exclude certain files from the distribution.

	The case where you do not have permissions to read a directory
is now handled better by mkisofs.  The directory that cannot be opened
is converted into a zero-length file, and processing continues normally.

	A few portability things have been fixed (hopefully).
