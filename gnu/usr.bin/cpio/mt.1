.SH NAME
mt \- control magnetic tape drive operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mt
[\-V] [\-f device] [\-\-file=device] [\-\-version]
operation [count]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR mt .
.B mt
performs the given
.IR operation ,
which must be one of the tape operations listed below, on a tape
drive.
.PP
The default tape device to operate on is taken from the file
.I /usr/include/sys/mtio.h
when
.B mt
is compiled.  It can be overridden by giving a device file name in
the environment variable
.BR TAPE
or by a command line option (see below), which also overrides the
environment variable.
.PP
The device must be either a character special file or a
remote tape drive.  To use a tape drive on another machine as the
archive, use a filename that starts with `HOSTNAME:'.  The
hostname can be preceded by a username and an `@' to access the remote
tape drive as that user, if you have permission to do so (typically an
entry in that user's `~/.rhosts' file).
.PP
The available operations are listed below.  Unique abbreviations are
accepted.  Not all operations are available on all systems, or work on
all types of tape drives.
Some operations optionally take a repeat count, which can be given
after the operation name and defaults to 1.

failed.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-f, \-\-file=device"
Use
.I device
as the file name of the tape drive to operate on.
To use a
tape drive on another machine, use a filename that
starts with `HOSTNAME:'.  The hostname can be preceded by a
username and an `@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if
you have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's
`~/.rhosts' file).
