# manpath.config
#
# This file is read by manpath to configure the mandatory manpath, to
# map each path element to a manpath element and to determine where the
# "man" binary lives.  The format is:
#
# MANBIN				pathname
# MANDATORY_MANPATH			manpath_element
# MANPATH_MAP		path_element	manpath_element
#
# MANBIN is optional
#
#MANBIN		/usr/local/bin/man
#
# every automatically generated MANPATH includes these fields
#
MANDATORY_MANPATH	/usr/share/man
MANDATORY_MANPATH	/usr/local/man
MANDATORY_MANPATH	/usr/X386/man
MANDATORY_MANPATH	/usr/X11R6/man
#
# set up PATH to MANPATH mapping
#
