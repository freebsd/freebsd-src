Sat Dec  9 22:01:41 1995  Dan O'Connor  <doconnor@tii.com>

        * commit.c (check_fileproc): pass RUN_REALLY flag to run_exec,
        because it's okay to examine the file with noexec set.

Sat Dec  9 20:28:01 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (update_entries): new var, `bin, init to 0.
        Use it in determining whether to convert the file.
        (send_modified): same as above.

Fri Dec  8 17:47:39 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (downcase_string): removed.
        (check_repository_password): don't deal with case-insensitivity
        anymore.

        * options.h.in (CVS_PASSWORDS_CASE_SENSITIVE): deleted this.  No
        need for it anymore.

Thu Dec  7 21:08:39 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (check_repository_password): when checking for false
        prefix-matches, look for ':', not '@'.  Duh.

Thu Dec  7 18:44:51 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h.in (CVS_PASSWORDS_CASE_SENSITIVE): replaces
        CVS_PASSWORDS_CASE_INSENSITIVE; passwords are now insensitive by
        default.  Expanded explanatory comment.

        * login.c (get_cvs_password): Use memset(), not bzero().  I
        botched this change earlier.

        * server.c (check_repository_password): no need to check
        xmalloc()'s return value.
        (check_repository_password): check for false prefix-matches (for
        example, username is "theo" and linebuf contains user
        "theocracy").

Thu Dec  7 14:49:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* filesubr.c (isaccessible): Rename from isaccessable.
	Update callers.
	* cvs.h: Update prototype.
	* main.c (main): Update callers.
	* server.c (main): Update callers.

Thu Dec  7 12:50:20 1995  Adam Glass <glass@NetBSD.ORG>

        * cvs.h: "isaccessible" is the correct spelling.
        Also add "const" to second arg to make prototype match
        declaration.

Thu Dec  7 11:06:51 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c, login.c: memset() instead of bzero().

Thu Dec  7 00:08:53 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): document server's side of
        the Authentication Protocol too.

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): when printing out "unrecognized
        response", also print out the offending response.

        * server.c (check_password): take `repository' arg too now.
        Call check_repository_password() before checking /etc/passwd.
        (check_repository_password): new func.

        * options.h.in (CVS_PASSWORDS_CASE_INSENSITIVE): new define, unset
        by default.

Wed Dec  6 18:51:16 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (check_password): If user has a null password, then
        return 1 if arg is also null.
        Reverse sense of return value.  Caller changed.

Wed Dec  6 14:42:57 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (check_password): new func.
        (authenticate_connection): call above new func.

        * login.c (login): use construct_cvspass_filename().
        If CVSroot is not "fully-qualified", then insist the user qualify
        it before going on.
        (get_cvs_password): fleshed out.  Now reads from ~/.cvspass, or
        prompts if no appropriate password found.
        (construct_cvspass_filename): new func.

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): send ACK or NACK to client.

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): check for ACK vs NACK response
        from server after sending authorization request.

        * login.c (get_cvs_password): new func.

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): use new func get_cvs_password().
        Prototype it at top of file.  Hmmm.

Wed Dec  6 13:29:22 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c: same as below (AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT).

        * main.c: same as below (AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT where appropriate).

        * login.c: same same as below.

        * cvs.h: same as below.

        * client.c: use AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT, not CVS_LOGIN.

        * options.h.in (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT, AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT): these
        replace CVS_LOGIN.

Wed Dec  6 00:04:58 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): expanded comment.

Tue Dec  5 23:37:39 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): read password from prompt for
        now.

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): if the password passes
        muster, then don't abort.

Tue Dec  5 22:46:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * subr.c (strip_trailing_newlines): new func.

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): took out print statements.

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): removed print statments.
        Use new func strip_trailing_newlines() to purify `repository',
        `username', and `password'.
        Run a primitive password check, just for testing.

        * client.c (connect_to_pserver): use CVS_AUTH_PORT.
        Take tofdp, fromfdp, and log args.  Caller changed.
        (get_responses_and_close): either kerberos and CVS_LOGIN might
        have one fd for both directions, so adjust #ifdef accordingly.

        * cvs.h (CVS_AUTH_PORT): new define, default to 2401.
        Prototype strip_trailing_newlines().

Tue Dec  5 16:53:35 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * server.c (authenticate_connection): new func.

        * client.c (init_sockaddr): func moved here from login.c.
        (connect_to_pserver): same as above.  Take no args, now.
        Include <sys/socket.h>, <netinet/in.h>, <netdb.h>, if CVS_LOGIN.

        * cvs.h: Declare use_authenticating_server, as extern int.
        Declare connect_to_pserver().

        * main.c (main): call authenticate_connection().  Removed testing
        code.
        Add 'a' to the short-option string in the getopt() call.

        * login.c (connect_to_pserver): moved to client.c.

Tue Dec  5 16:01:42 1995  Peter Chubb <peterc@bookworm.sw.oz.au>
                          (patch applied by Karl Fogel <kfogel@cyclic.com>)

        * update.c (join_file): if vers->vn_user is "0", file has been
        removed on the current branch, so print an error and return.

Mon Dec  4 14:27:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.3.

Mon Dec  4 16:28:25 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* release.c (release): add return (0) as last line

	* cvs.h: declare program_path

	* main.c define program_path
	  (main): set program_path

	* release.c (release): use program_path for update_cmd

Mon Dec  4 11:22:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.6.2.

Sun Dec  3 20:02:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* rcs.h (struct rcsnode), rcs.c (freercsnode): Add expand field.
	* rcs.h (RCSEXPAND): New #define.
	* rcs.c (RCS_reparsercsfile): Record keyword expansion in expand
	field of struct rcsnode.
	* update.c (checkout_file): Set keyword expansion in Entries file
	from rcs file if there is nowhere else to set it from.
	* client.c (send_modified, update_entries) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]:
	If -kb is in effect, don't convert.

	* update.c (update_file_proc), commit.c (check_fileproc),
	rcscmds.c (RCS_merge): Direct stdout to DEVNULL rather than
	passing -s option to grep.  This avoids trouble with respect to
	finding a grep which support -s and whether we should use the (GNU
	grep) -q option if it exists.
	* options.h.in: Change "@ggrep_path@" to "grep".

Fri Dec  1 11:53:19 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* rcs.c (RCS_gettag): new parameter return_both force return both
	  tags: the symbolic and the numeric one.
	  (RCS_getversion): new parameter return_both is forwarded to
	  RCS_gettag.

	* rtag.c, tag.c, commit.c, patch.c, update.c: pass 0 as additional
	  last parameter to RCS_getversion and RCS_gettag

	* rcs.h (RCS_gettag): new parameter return_both.
	  (RCS_getversion): new parameter return_both.

	* cvs.h (struct vers_ts): add vn_tag slot for symbolic tag name

	* vers_ts.c (Version_TS): call RCS_getversion with 1 for
	  return_both and split output into vn_rcs and vn_tag
	  (freevers_ts): free vn_tag

	* update.c (checkout_file): use vn_tag instead of vn_rcs when
	  calling 'rcs co' to allow rcs expansion of :$Name :

Thu Nov 30 20:44:30 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (get_responses_and_close): undo previous change
        regarding waitpid().  The problem has been solved by modifying
        os2/waitpid.c instead of its callers.

Thu Nov 30 16:37:10 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c: All these changes are for OS/2, which will no longer have
        a separate client.c:
        (start_kerberos_server): new func, contains code that
        used to be in start_server().
        (start_server): moved kerberos code to above function, reorganized
        the rest.  Added authentication clause.
        (call_in_directory): test errno against EACCESS, if EACCESS is
        defined (this is for OS/2's oddball mkdir).
        (change_mode): don't set execute permission on anything if
        EXECUTE_PERMISSION_LOSES is defined.
        (get_responses_and_close): if START_RSH_WITH_POPEN_RW, then use
        pclose() instead of fclose().
        If waitpid errors with ECHILD, don't die.  This is okay.
        (start_rsh_server): alternate definition if
        START_RSH_WITH_POPEN_RW.

        * main.c: [all these changes conditional on CVS_LOGIN: ]
        Don't prototype connect_to_pserver, don't enter it in cmds[]
        (actually, it was never in there, I don't know why my previous
        change said it was).
        (use_authenticating_server): new global var.
        (main): if "-a", then set above new var to TRUE.
        (usg): document "-a" option.

Wed Nov 29 12:55:10 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * main.c: Prototype connect_to_pserver(), and enter it in cmds[].
        (main): test some extremely primitive authentication.

        * login.c: Include <sys/socket.h>
        (connect_to_pserver): new func.
        (init_sockaddr): new func.

Mon Nov 20 14:07:41 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TAGFILES): Separate out from DISTFILES, for C code.
	(TAGS,tags): Use TAGFILES not DISTFILES.

Sun Nov 19 11:22:43 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* recurse.c (do_recursion): Don't call server_pause_check if there
	are writelocks around.  Revise comment to reflect fact we are no
	longer relying on a writelock'd operations being "unable" to
	generate enough data to pause.

Sun Nov 19 10:04:50 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.DIALix.COM>

	* server.c, server.h, options.h.in: Implement hooks for doing
	simple flow control on the server to prevent VM exhaustion on a
	slow network with a fast server.
	* recurse.c: Call the flow control check at a convenient location
	while no locks are active.  This is a convenience tradeoff against
	accurate flow control - if you have a large directory it will all
	be queued up, bypassing the flow control check until the next
	directory is processed.

Sat Nov 18 16:22:06 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c, update.c, vers_ts.c, server.c, rcs.c, lock.c,
        ignore.c, entries.c, diff.c, commit.c, checkin.c:
        Use new macro `existence_error', instead of comparing errno to
        ENOENT directly.

Fri Nov 17 14:56:12 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (start_server): removed alternate version of this func,
        since os2/client.c will now be used under OS/2.

Thu Nov 16 22:57:12 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (start_server): ifdef HAVE_POPEN_RW, use a different
        version of start_server().  This is maybe not the cleanest cut to
        make, but it's better than mucking around with yet more #ifdefs in
        the middle of the old start_server() function.  Once things are
        up, I may reposition this code.

Wed Nov 15 15:33:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * main.c (main): ifdef NEED_CALL_SOCKINIT, then call SockInit().
        Only OS/2 needs this initialization.

Tue Nov 14 18:54:01 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* patch.c:
	- fix orientation of test for result of getline() call
	- use fputs() not printf() when just copying file out

	* cvsbug.sh:
	- add space after #!
	- new rcs id
	- allow version to be edited by Makefile.

	* Makefile.in:
	- make Makefile a dependent of all (this might not be perfect, but
	it at least gives you a chance to catch up on the second
	go-around).
	- filter cvsbug.sh in a manner similar to cvsinit.sh to get the
	version number set from version.c

Tue Nov 14 13:28:17 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh: Call old log file check.plog, not check.olog.

	* sanity.sh: Convert remaining tests from old-style ('***' on fail
	and nothing on pass), to new-style (FAIL on fail and PASS on pass).

	* sanity.sh: Fix ability to run only some of the tests (always run
	tests 1-4.75 to set up repository, document better how it works).

	* sanity.sh: Change "completed successfully" to "completed" in
	message--many tests, but not all, exit if they fail.

Tue Nov 14 15:10:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* sanity.sh: test 63 doesn't work and probably can't

Tue Nov 14 12:22:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* sanity.sh: many minor tweaks:
	- make the optional arguments almost work
	- use a function 'directory_cmp' instead of 'diff -r'
	- fix up a few more tests that weren't working....

Mon Nov 13 07:33:55 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * cvs.h: ifdef USE_OWN_POPEN, #include "popen.h".  Only OS/2 has
        its own popen()/pclose() right now.

Mon Nov 13 04:06:10 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * cvs.h: conform to 80 column standard (yes, I'm a pedant).

Sat Nov 11 13:45:13 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (process_prune_candidates): use unlink_file_dir() to
        remove the directory, instead of invoking "rm" via run_exec().

Fri Nov 10 14:38:56 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * main.c (main): removed "#define KF_GETOPT_LONG 1", since that
        change is no longer in testing.

Thu Nov  9 20:32:12 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * release.c (release): Use Popen(), not popen().

Wed Nov  8 10:20:20 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* entries.c (ParseTag): Remove dcl of unused local.

	* patch.c: Include getline.h.

Wed Nov  8 11:57:31 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* options.h.in: add configuration option STEXID_SUPPORT (default
	  is off i.e. old semantics)

	* filesubr.c (isaccessable): new function.  Checks access-rights
	for files like access(), but is getxid-safe.  Falls back to
	access() if SETXID_SUPPORT is not enabled.
	(isfile): replace stat() by isaccessable(file, F_OK)
	(isreadable): replace access() by isaccessable()
	(iswritable): ditto
	(make_directory): rename local variable buf to sb

	* cvs.h: add prototype for new function isaccessable.

	* server.c (serve_root): replace access() by isaccessable()

	* cvsrc.c (read_cvsrc): replace access() by isreadable()

	* main.c (main): replace access() by isaccessable()

Wed Nov  8 10:22:41 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* entries.c (fgetentent): change definition to static to match the
	declaration at the top of the file

Tue Nov  7 16:59:25 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@lestat.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.c (RCS_getbranch, RCS_getdate, RCS_getrevtime, RCS_gettag,
 	RCS_getversion, RCS_head): Use assert() instead of attempting to
	"do the right thing" with a bogus RCSNode argument.

Mon Nov  6 14:24:34 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* vers_ts.c: Remove ctime define.  It is just asking for trouble.

Mon Nov  6 11:58:26 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * vers_ts.c: ifdef ctime, undef it before redefining it.  It is a
        macro on some systems.

        * lock.c: don't prototype ctime() here.  (See note below about
        fgetentent() in entries.c.)

Sun Nov  5 16:06:01 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * entries.c (fgetentent): don't prototype ctime here; we include
        cvs.h, which includes system.h, which includes <time.h>
        unconditionally (either as <time.h> or <sys/time.h>).  Anyway, IBM
        C/C++ chokes on mid-function, or even mid-file, prototypes.  Sigh.

Thu Nov  2 21:51:04 1995  Dan Wilder  <dan@gasboy.com>

	* rtag.c (rtag): Fix typo ("-T" -> "-F").

Tue Oct 31 19:09:11 1995  Dan Wilder <dan@gasboy.com>

        * diff.c (diff_dirproc): just return R_SKIP_ALL if dir not exist.
        (diff_file_nodiff): don't complain if file doesn't exist, just
        ignore.

Tue Oct 31 09:25:10 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* sanity.sh: Use absolute pathname for mkmodules.

Sat Oct 28 01:01:41 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* entries.c (ParseTag): Use getline instead of fgets.

Fri Oct 27 13:44:20 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * cvs.h: do nothing about alloca ifdef ALLOCA_IN_STDLIB.  I am
        rather suspicious of this solution, and will not be surprised to
        find out that there's a Right Way to handle this situation ("this
        situation" being that OS/2 simply declares alloca in <stdlib.h>).
        Suggestions are welcome; see src/cvs.h and lib/system.h to see why
        I was getting a conflict in the first place.

Wed Oct 25 16:03:20 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@slave.cygnus.com>

	* cvs.h (struct entnode): Add user field.
	* entries.c (fputentent): New function, write entries line.
	(write_ent_proc): Call fputentent to write entries line.
	(Entnode_Create): New function, construct new Entnode.
	(Entnode_Destroy): New function, destruct old Entnode.
	(AddEntryNode): Changed to take an Entnode argument instead of
	separate user, version, timestamp, etc. arguments.
	(fgetentent): Changed to return Entnode.
	(struct entent, free_entent): Removed.

Wed Oct 25 12:44:32 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* admin.c (admin): Don't rely on ANSI C string concatenation;
	SunOS 4.1.3 /bin/cc doesn't support it.

Tue Oct 24 22:34:22 1995  Anthony J. Lill  <ajlill@ajlc.waterloo.on.ca>

	* import.c (expand_at_signs): Check errno as well as return value
	from putc.  Some systems bogusly return EOF when successfully
	writing 0xff.

Tue Oct 24 14:32:45 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* admin.c (admin): use getcaller() instead of getpwuid

	* subr.c (getcaller): prefer getlogin() to $USER and $LOGNAME
	  (especially useful for NT where getuid always returns 0)

Tue Oct 24 06:22:08 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cvsrc.c (read_cvsrc): Use getline instead of fgets.
	* patch.c (patch_fileproc): Use getline instead of fgets.

	* entries.c (fgetentent): Use getline instead of fgets.
	Use xmalloc to allocate space for each returned entry.
	Since LINE is no longer static, save it in struct entent.
	(struct entent): New member, line.
	(free_entent): New function.
	(Entries_Open): Call it after each call to fgetentent.

Tue Oct 24 11:13:15 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* cvs.h: Declare valloc again, but this time with the right
	  signature (also changed in libs/valloc.c)

Mon Oct 23 12:17:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Check for errors from stdio calls.

Mon Oct 23 12:37:06 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.h: Don't declare valloc.  Some systems (e.g. linux) declare
	it in stdlib.h in a conflicting way.

Mon Oct 23 08:41:25 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* commit.c (commit_filesdoneproc): Use getline instead of fgets.

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Use getline instead of fgets.
	(rcsinfo_proc): Likewise.

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Lose if fclose of temp file output
	stream fails.

Mon Oct 23 11:59:41 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* cvs.h: add valloc declaration

	* server.h: add server_cleanup prototype

	* server.c: remove server_cleanup prototype

	* mkmodules.c (server_cleanup): fix parameter type

	  code which is also encapsulated in #ifdef sun)

	* rcscmds.c (RCS_deltag, RCS_lock): add definition of noerr
	  parameter

	* error.c: include cvs.h instead of config.h, add USE(rcsid)

	* error.c (error): fix parameter type

	* update.c (join_file): encapsulate recent changes from garyo
	  within #ifdef SERVER_SUPPORT

Sun Oct 22 13:47:53 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@slave.cygnus.com>

	* client.c (update_entries): Fix memory leak; free mode_string and
	file_timestamp.
	(send_fileproc): Fix memory leak; call freevers_ts before exiting.

	* module.c (do_module): Partially fix memory leak; added
	variable so that the address of memory allocated by line2argv
	is retained, but comment out the call to free_names.  Freeing
 	the vector at that point loses because some of the elements
	may be used later in the function.
	(cat_module): fix memory leak.

	* recurse.c (start_recursion): Fix memory leak; free return
	value of Name_Repository after it has been used.

Sat Oct 21 23:24:26 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* client.c (send_modified) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]: Comment text

	* lock.c: Add prototype for Check_Owner

Thu Oct 19 16:38:14 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* lock.c (Check_Owner): Declare function `static int'.

Thu Oct 19 14:58:40 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* expand_path.c (expand_variable): Fix typo ('*'->'(').

	* commit.c (commit_filesdoneproc): Check for errors from fopen,
	fgets, and fclose.

	* rcscmds.c (RCS_merge): Remove comment about rcsmerge -E.
	Hacking CVS was never a very good solution; the situation is fixed
	in RCS 5.7, and is documented in ../INSTALL.

Thu Oct 19 15:06:15 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* filesubr.c (xchmod): Parenthesize arithmetic in operand of |
	to placate gcc -Wall.

	* expand_path.c (expand_path): Parenthesize assignments used as
	truth values to placate gcc -Wall.

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): Remove dcls of unused variables.

Wed Oct 18 11:19:40 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@slave.cygnus.com>

	* lock.c (unlock): Change order of comparison so that Check_Owner
	is called only if other conditions are true.  This performance
	enhancement was broken when the AFS support was added.

Wed Oct 18 12:51:33 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * main.c (main): check if argv[0] is "pserver" with else-if, not
        if, since we've already asked if it's "kserver".

Tue Oct 17 18:09:23 1995  Warren Jones <wjones@tc.fluke.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh: Deal with supplying a relative cvs filename, or
	with a cvs filename which doesn't have basename "cvs".

Mon Oct 16 15:58:31 1995  Vince Demarco <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* parseinfo.c (Parse_Info): if the Keyword isn't ALL the current
	version doesn't use the expanded variable, It should.

Mon Oct 16 15:58:31 1995  Gary Oberbrunner <garyo@avs.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* server.c (server_register): Don't pass NULL to printf if tag,
	date, or conflict is NULL.

Thu Oct 12 12:13:42 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * main.c (main): begin to handle "pserver"; support not complete
        yet, however.

Thu Oct 12 02:52:13 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* expand_path.c: Don't #include <pwd.h>, since cvs.h already does,
	and not all systems' <pwd.h>s are protected from multiple inclusion.
	* login.c: Likewise.

Wed Oct 11 15:23:24 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * login.c (login): handle everything correctly now.

Wed Oct 11 12:02:48 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* rcs.c (RCS_gettag): support RCS keyword Name

Tue Oct 10 19:11:16 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h.in (CVS_LOGIN): discuss, but leave commented out.
        The "cvs login" command is still under construction; however, the
        repository was changing so fast that instead of creating a branch
        and dealing with the attendant hair, I'm just developing on the
        trunk, making sure that everything is surrounded by "#ifdef
        CVS_LOGIN ... #endif" so I don't get in anyone's way.

        * login.c: include cvs.h before checking CVS_LOGIN, so it has a
        chance to get defined before we ask if it's defined.
        (login): oops, use semi not comma in `for' loop init.

        * Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): include login.c, login.o.

        * main.c: added protoype for login().
        Added "login" entry to cmds[].
        (usg): added line about "login".

        * login.c: new file.

Tue Oct 10 18:33:47 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (COMMON_OBJECTS): added error.o.
        (OBJECTS): took error.o out; it's in COMMON_OBJECTS now.

Tue Oct 10 12:02:37 1995  Thorsten Lockert  <tholo@sigmasoft.com>

	* cvsbug.sh: Cater to lame versions of sh (4.4BSD ash) by using
	${foo-bar} instead of `if....`.

	* admin.c (admin): If group CVS_ADMIN_GROUP exists, allow only
	users in that group to use "cvs admin".

Sat Oct  7 23:05:24 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* add.c, checkout.c, commit.c, cvs.h, filesubr.c, import.c,
	lock.c, main.c, modules.c, options.h.in: New variable cvsumask
	which is used to set mode of files in repository (regardless of
	umask in effect when cvs is run).

Sat Oct  7 22:40:17 1995  Stephen Bailey  <sjbailey@sand.npl.washington.edu>

	* lock.c: Include AFSCVS ifdefs to deal with AFS's lack of
	correspondance between userid's from stat and from geteuid.

	Prototype when dealing in pointers to functions.

Fri Oct  6 21:07:22 1995  Mark H. Wilkinson  <mhw@minster.york.ac.uk>

	* cvsrc.c (read_cvsrc): fix look up of command names in cvsrc file
	to use full name from command table rather than possible nickname
	in argv. Fixes errors with things like `cvs di' when cvsrc has
	`diff -u5' in it.

Thu Aug  3 01:03:52 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* parseinfo.c (Parse_Info): Add code to call expand_path function
	instead of using built in code.

	* wrapper.c (wrap_add): Add code to call expand_path function to
	expand all built in variables.

	expand_path.o.

Fri Oct  6 14:03:09 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* ignore.c (ign_setup): Don't try to look for a file in CVSroot if
	client.  (The recent tightening of the error checking detects this).

Thu Oct  5 18:29:17 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* remove.c, add.c, commit.c, cvs.h: Remove CVSEXT_OPT stuff; it

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): New argument options; pass it to RCS.

Sun Oct  1 14:51:59 1995  Harlan Stenn  <Harlan.Stenn@pfcs.com>

        * main.c: don't #include <pwd.h>; cvs.h does that already.

Fri Sep 29 15:21:35 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * version.c: upped to 1.5.91 for another pre-1.6 release.

        * ALL FILES: add semicolon, as indicated below.

        * cvs.h (USE): don't provide semicolon in the expansion of the USE
        macro; we'd rather the callers provided it themselves because that
        way etags doesn't get fooled.

Mon Sep  4 23:30:41 1995  Magnus Hyllander  <mhy@os.se>

	* checkout.c: cvs export now takes -k option and does not default
	to -kv.

Wed Aug 30 12:36:37 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh (basic1): Make sure first-dir is deleted before
	running this set of tests.

        * subr.c: Extract file twiddling functions to a different file,
	because we want to use different versions of many of these
	routines under Windows NT.
	(copy_file, isdir, islink, isfile, isreadable, iswritable,
	open_file, make_directory, make_directories, xchmod,
	rename_file, link_file, unlink_file, xcmp, tmpnam,
	unlink_file_dir, deep_remove_dir): Moved to...
	* filesubr.c: ...this file, which is new.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Mention filesubr.c.
	(COMMON_OBJECTS): Mention filesubr.o.

	* subr.c: Extract process execution guts to a different file,
	because we want to replace these routines entirely under
	Windows NT.
	(VA_START, va_alist, va_dcl): Move this stuff...
	(run_add_arg, run_init_prog): and these declarations...
	(run_prog, run_argv, run_argc, run_argc_allocated): and these
	variables...
	(run_setup, run_arg, run_args, run_add_arg, run_init_prog,
	run_exec, run_print, Popen): and these functions...
	* run.c: To this file, which is new.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Mention run.c.
	(COMMON_OBJECTS): Mention run.o.

	* status.c (status): Call ign_setup, if client_active.  Otherwise,
	we don't end up ignoring CVS directories and such.

	* server.c (mkdir_p, dirswitch): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* repos.c (Name_Repository): Use the isabsolute function instead of
	checking the first character of the path.

	* release.c (release): Use fncmp instead of strcmp to compare
	filenames.

	* rcs.c (RCS_parse, RCS_parsercsfile) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]:
	Abort, because we have strong reason to believe this code is
	wrong.

	* patch.c (patch): Register signal handlers iff the signal name is
	#defined.

	* no_diff.c (No_Difference): Don't try to include server_active in
	trace message unless SERVER_SUPPORT is #defined.

	* modules.c (do_module): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* mkmodules.c (main): Call last_component instead of writing it out.

	* main.c (main): Call last_component instead of writing it out.
	Break up the long copyright string into several strings; Microsoft
	Visual C++ can't handle a line that long.  Feh.
	Use fncmp instead of strcmp to compare filenames.
	Register signal handlers iff the signal name is #defined.

	* lock.c (readers_exist): Don't check return value of closedir.
	Most of the rest of the code doesn't, and some systems don't
	provide a return value anyway.
	(set_lock): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* import.c (import): Use the isabsolute function instead of
	checking the first character of the path.
	Try to delete the temporary file again after we close it, so it'll
	get deleted on systems that don't let you delete files that are
	open.
	(add_rev): Instead of making a hard link to the working file and
	checking in the revision with ci -r, use ci -u and restore the
	permission bits.
	(comtable): Include lines from SYSTEM_COMMENT_TABLE, if it is
	#defined.
	(add_rcs_file) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]: Abort, because we have
	strong reason to believe this code is wrong.

	(sortlist): Add prototype for COMP argument.

	they're used in import.c and update.c.
	* wrapper.c (wrap_add_file, wrap_add): Remove them from here.

	* cvs.h (RUN_NORMAL, RUN_COMBINED, RUN_REALLY, RUN_STDOUT_APPEND,
	RUN_STDERR_APPEND, RUN_SIGNIGNORE, RUN_TTY, run_arg, run_print,
	run_setup, run_args, run_exec, Popen, piped_child, close_on_exec,
	filter_stream_through_program, waitpid): Move all these
	declarations and definitions to the same section.

	* cvs.h (error_set_cleanup): Fix prototype.

	above the point where we #include rcs.h, since rcs.h tests them
	(or DEATH_SUPPORT, at least).

	* cvs.h (DEVNULL): #define this iff it isn't already #defined.
	config.h may want to override it.

	* cvs.h (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Don't #define these
	here; let config.h do that.  On some systems, we don't have any
	server support.

	* cvs.h: Don't #include <io.h> or <direct.h>; we take care of
	those in lib/system.h.

	* commit.c (commit): Open logfile with the OPEN_BINARY flag.
	(precommit_proc): Use the isabsolute function, instead of
	comparing the first character with /.
	(remove_file, checkaddfile): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

        * client.c (send_repository): Use larger line buffers.

        * client.c [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED] (update_entries): If we've just
	received a gzipped file, copy it over, converting LF to CRLF,
	instead of just renaming it into place.
	[LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED] (send_modified): Convert file to LF format
	before sending with gzip.
	(send_modified): Don't be disturbed if we get fewer than
	sb.st_size characters when we read.  The read function may be
	collapsing CRLF to LF for us.

	* client.c: Add forward declarations for all the cvs command
	functions we call.

	* client.c: Add forward static declarations for all the
	handle_mumble functions.

	On some systems, RSH converts LF to CRLF; this screws us up.
	* client.c (rsh_pid): Declare this iff RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not
	#defined.
	(get_responses_and_close): Use SHUTDOWN_SERVER if it is #defined.
	Only wait for rsh process to exit if RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not
	#defined.
	(start_rsh_server): Declare and define only if
	RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not #defined.  Use piped_child, instead of
	writing all that out.
	(start_server): Only try to call start_rsh_server if
	RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not #defined.  Use START_SERVER if it is
	#defined.  Convert file descriptors to stdio file pointers using
	the FOPEN_BINARY_WRITE and FOPEN_BINARY_READ strings.

	* client.h (rsh_pid): Don't declare this; it's never used elsewhere.
	(supported_request): Add external declaration for this;
	it's used in checkout.c.

	Move process-running functions to run.c; we need to totally
	replace these on other systems, like Windows NT.
	* client.c (close_on_exec, filter_stream_through_program): Moved
	to run.c.
	* run.c (close_on_exec, filter_stream_through_program): Here they
	are.

	* add.c (add_directory): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of straight mkdir.
	* checkout.c (checkout, build_dirs_and_chdir): Same.
	(checkout_proc): Use fncmp instead of strcmp.
	* client.c (call_in_directory): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of straight
	mkdir.

	* client.c (handle_checksum): Cast return value of strtol.

Wed Aug 30 10:35:46 1995  Stefan Monnier <stefan.monnier@epfl.ch>

        * main.c (main): Allow -d to override CVSROOT_ENV.

Thu Aug 24 18:57:49 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.h, rcscmds.c (RCS_unlock, RCS_deltag, RCS_lock): Add extra
	parameter for whether to direct stderr to DEVNULL.
	* checkin.c, tag.c, rtag.c, import.c, commit.c: Pass extra
	argument.  1 if stderr had been directed to DEVNULL before
	rcscmds.c was in use, 0 if it was RUN_TTY.

	* cvs.h: Add comment regarding attic.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@smarts.com>

	* rcs.c (whitespace): Cast to unsigned char in case char is signed
	and value is negative.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Kirby Koster  <koster@sctc.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* update.c (join_file): If vers->vn_user is NULL, just return.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* server.c, client.c: Add comments about modes and umasks.

	* update.c (update_filesdone_proc): If pipeout, don't try to
	create CVS/Root.

Mon Aug 21 12:54:14 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): Don't pass -d to "cvs server"
	invocation via rsh.

	* server.c (serve_root): Report errors via pending_error_text.
	(serve_valid_requests): Check for pending errors.

Sun Aug 20 00:59:46 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h.in: Document usage of DIFF in update.c
	* update.c: Use DIFF -c, not DIFF -u.  The small improvement in
	diff size is not worth the hassle in terms of everyone having to
	make sure that DIFF is GNU diff (IMHO).

Sat Aug 19 22:05:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* recurse.c (start_recursion): Doc fix.

	* server.c (do_cvs_command): Clear error_use_protocol in the
	child.

	(options.h): Depend on ../config.status and options.h.in.
	Add rule to build it from dependents.

	(add_directory): Use save_cwd and restore_cwd instead of
	explicit getwd then chdir.
	* import.c (import_descend_dir): Likewise.
	* modules.c (do_module): Likewise.

	* recurse.c (save_cwd, restore_cwd, free_cwd): Remove functions.
	New versions have been broken out into save-cwd.c.
	(do_dir_proc): Adapt to handle status code returned by new versions
	of save_cwd and restore_cwd -- and one fewer argument to restore_cwd.
	(unroll_files_proc): Likewise.

	* wrapper.c (wrap_name_has): Add default: abort () to switch
	statement to avoid warning from gcc -Wall.
	(wrap_matching_entry): Remove dcl of unused TEMP.
	(wrap_tocvs_process_file): Remove dcl of unused ERR.
	(wrap_fromcvs_process_file): Likewise.

	* cvs.h: Remove prototype for error.  Instead, include error.h.

        * history.c: put ifdef SERVER_SUPPORT around tracing code incase
        the client/server code is not compiled into the program.

Sat Jul 29 16:59:49 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* subr.c (deep_remove_dir): Use struct dirent, not struct direct.

Sat Jul 29 18:32:06 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* add.c: Check wrap_name_has.

	* diff.c, checkin.c, import.c: have code call unlink_file_dir in
	the appropriate places instead of just calling unlink_file.

        * checkin.c: Remove one unlink call.

	* import.c (comtable): Add .m .psw .pswm.

	* import.c (add_rcs_file): Remove tocvsPath before returning.

	* subr.c (unlink_file_dir):  Add new function. unlinks the file if
	it is a file. or will do a recursive delete if the path is
	actually a directory.
	(deep_remove_dir): New function, helps unlink_file_dir.

	* mkmodules.c:  Added CVSROOTADM_WRAPPER (cvswrappers file) to the
	checkout file list.

Fri Jul 28 16:27:56 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location): Use PATH_MAX not MAXPATHLEN.

Fri Jul 28 19:37:03 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* log.c (cvslog, log_fileproc): Pass all options (except -l)
	to rlog as-is, so that users can put spaces in options,
	can specify multiple -d options, etc.
	(ac, av): New variables.
	(log_option_with_arg, options): Remove.

	(log_fileproc): Don't prepend `/' to file name if update_dir is empty.

Tue Jul 25 00:52:26 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location): Don't use PROTO in function definition.

Mon Jul 24 18:32:06 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location):  fix a compiler warning. (Declare
	safe_location). Changed code in safe_location to call getwd
	instead of getcwd. getwd is declared in the ../lib directory and
	used exclusively thoughout the code. (this helps portability on
	non POSIX systems).

	* wrapper.c: updated Andrew Athan's email address.

	* main.c:  fix an ifdef so the code will compile. syntax error in
	the ifdef for CVS_NOADMIN.

Mon Jul 24 13:25:00 1995  Del <del@babel.dialix.oz.au>

	Ensures that you don't check out into the repository
	itself.

	* tag.c, rtag.c, cvs.h, mkmodules.c:  Added a "taginfo" file in
	CVSROOT to perform pre-tag checks.

	* main.c, options.h.in:  Added a compile time option to
	disable the admin command.

Fri Jul 21 17:07:42 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* update.c, status.c, patch.c, checkout.c, import.c, release.c,
	rtag.c, tag.c: Now -q and -Q options just print an error message
	telling you to use global -q and -Q options.  The non-global
	options were a mess because some commands accepted them and some
	did not, and they were redundant with -q and -Q global options.

	* rcs.c, cvs.h, commit.c, log.c, find_names.c: Remove CVS.dea
	stuff.  It is slower than the alternatives and I don't think
	anyone ever actually used it.

Fri Jul 21 10:35:10 1995  Vince DeMarco <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add wrapper.c, wrapper.o.
	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, import.c, log.c,

	variable and associated handling.
	* no_diff.c: Add tocvsPath variable and associated handling.
	* recurse.c (start_recursion): Check wrap_name_has.
	* update.c: Copy, don't merge, copy-by-merge files.  Attempt to
	use -j on a copy-by-merge file generates a warning and no further
	action.
	* update.c: Add CVSDOTWRAPPER handling.
	* wrapper.c: Added.

Fri Jul 21 00:20:52 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c: Revert David Lamkin patch, except for the bits about
	removing temp_filename and the .rej file.
	* sanity.sh (errmsg1): Test for the underlying bug which Lamkin
	kludged around.
	* client.c (call_in_directory): Set short_pathname to include the
	filename, not just the directory.  Improve comments regarding what
	is passed to FUNC.

Thu Jul 20 17:51:54 1995  David Lamkin  <drl@net-tel.co.uk>

	* client.c (short_pathname): Fixes the fetching of the whole file
	after a patch to bring it up to date has failed:
	   - failed_patches[] now holds short path to file that failed
	   - patch temp files are unlinked where the patch is done

	* cvs.h: Declare error_set_cleanup
	* main.c: Call it.

	client.h, commit.c, create_adm.c, cvs.h, diff.c, entries.c,
	history.c, import.c, log.c, main.c, modules.c, no_diff.c, patch.c,
	release.c, remove.c, repos.c, rtag.c, server.c, server.h,
	status.c, subr.c, tag.c, update.c, vers_ts.c, version.c: Put
	client code inside #ifdef CLIENT_SUPPORT, server code inside
	#ifdef SERVER_SUPPORT.  When reporting version, report whether
	client and/or server are compiled in.

Wed Jul 19 18:00:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* subr.c (copy_file): Declare local var n to be an int,
	not a size_t.  size_t is unsigned, and the return values
	of read and write are definitely not unsigned.

	* cvs.h [HAVE_IO_H]: #include <io.h>.
	[HAVE_DIRECT_H]: #include <direct.h>.

Fri Jul 14 22:28:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* server.c (dirswitch, serve_static_directory, serve_sticky,
	serve_lost, server_write_entries, serve_checkin_prog,
	serve_update_prog): Include more information in error messages.
	(Thanks, DJM.)

	* cvsbug.sh: Use /usr/sbin/sendmail, unless it doesn't
	exist, in which case use /usr/lib/sendmail.  (Thanks, DJM.)

	* server.c (server, server_cleanup): Use "/tmp" instead of
	"/usr/tmp" when the TMPDIR environment variable isn't set.  This
	is what the rest of the code uses.

Thu Jul 13 11:03:17 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* recurse.c (free_cwd): New function.
	(save_cwd, restore_cwd): Use it instead of simply freeing any
	string.  The function also closes any open file descriptor.

	* import.c (comtable): Now static.
	(comtable): Put braces around each element of initializer.

	* cvs.h: Add prototype for xgetwd.
	* recurse.c (save_cwd, restore_cwd): New functions to encapsulate
	run-time solution to secure-SunOS vs. fchown problem.
	(do_dir_proc, unroll_files_proc): Use new functions instead of
	open-coded fchdir/chdir calls with cpp directives.

        * sanity.sh: Change out of TESTDIR before removing it.
	Some versions of rm fail when asked to delete the current directory.

Wed Jul 12 22:35:04 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* client.c (get_short_pathname): Add const qualifier to parameter dcl.

	* cvs.h: to here.

Wed Jul 12 19:45:24 1995  Dominik Westner (dominik@gowest.ppp.informatik.uni-muenchen.de)

        * client.c (server_user): new var.
        (parse_cvsroot): set above if repo is "user@host:/dir".

Tue Jul 11 14:20:00 1995  Loren James Rittle  <rittle@supra.comm.mot.com>

	* import.c (add_rev), commit.c (remove_file, ci_new_rev),
	checkin.c (Checkin), subr.c (make_message_rcslegal), cvs.h:
	Always perform sanity check and fix-up on messages to be passed
 	directly to RCS via the '-m' switch.  RCS 5.7 requires that a
 	non-total-whitespace, non-null message be provided or it will
 	abort with an error.  CVS is not setup to handle any returned
 	error from 'ci' gracefully and, thus, the repository entered a
 	trashed state.

	* sanity.sh: Add regression tests for new code and interactions
	with RCS 5.7.

Sun Jul  9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	- Jun Hamano's xchmod() patch to prevent writable files
	(from previous local changes)

	- clean up some string handling code...
	(from previous local changes)

	* parseinfo.c: add hack to expand $CVSROOT in an *info file.
	- document "ALL" and "DEFAULT" in opening comment for Parse_Info()
	- fix the code to match the comments w.r.t. callbacks for "ALL"
	- add a line of trace output...
	(from previous local changes)

	* mkmodules.c: add support for comments in CVSROOT/checkoutlist
	- add CVSroot used by something other .o, ala main.c
	(from previous local changes)

	* main.c, cvs.h: add support for $VISUAL as log msg editor
	(from previous local changes)

	* status.c: add support for -q and -Q (from previous local changes)


Sun Jul  9 18:44:32 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * log.c: trivial change to test ChangeLog stuff.

Sat Jul  8 20:33:57 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* history.c: (history_write): Don't assume that fopen(..., "a")
	lets one interleave writes to the history file from different processes
	without interlocking.  Use open's O_APPEND option instead.

	* cvs.h, subr.c (Fopen): Remove.

	* rcs.c (RCS_parsercsfile_i): Rename error to l_error; SunOS4 /bin/cc
	doesn't like a label and function with the same name.

Sun Jul  2 12:51:33 1995  Fred Appelman <Fred.Appelman@cv.ruu.nl>

	* logmsg.c: Rename strlist to str_list to avoid conflict with
	Unixware 2.01.

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove RCS-patches and convert.sh.

Fri Jun 23 13:38:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* README-rm-add: Do not talk about patching RCS, that only
	confuses people.

	"Ok." when it's done.

Fri Jun 16 11:23:44 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* entries.c (fgetentent): Parenthesize assignment in if-conditional.

Thu Jun 15 17:33:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* server.c (get_buffer_data, buf_append_char, buf_append_data):
	  Don't conditionalize use of "inline".  Autoconf takes care of
	  defining it away on systems that don't grok it.

Thu Jun 15 13:43:38 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* options.h.in (DIFF): Default to "diff" not "diff -a" since diff
	might not support the -a option.

Wed Jun 14 11:29:42 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* import.c (import_descend): Initialize dirlist to NULL.

	* subr.c (copy_file): Fix infinite loop.

	* server.c (serve_directory): fix a memory leak.

	* checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, history.c, import.c, log.c,
	  patch.c, release.c, remove.c, rtag.c, status.c, tag.c, update.c:
	  Use send_arg() to send command line arguments to server.

	* commit.c (fsortcmp), find_names (fsortcmp), hash.c (hashp,
	  findnode), hash.h (findnode), rcs.c (RCS_addnode,
	  RCS_check_kflag, RCS_check_tag, RCS_isdead, RCS_parse,
	  RCS_parsercsfile_i), rcs.h (RCS_addnode, RCS_check_kflag,
	  RCS_check_tag, RCS_parse): Added const qualifiers as
	  appropriate.
	* rcs.h (RCS_isdead): Added prototype.

	* hash.h (walklist, sortlist): correct function prototypes.

	* ignore.c (ign_setup): don't bother checking to see if file
	  exists before calling ign_add_file.

Fri Jun  9 11:24:06 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* all source files (rcsid): Added const qualifer.
	* ignore.c (ign_default): Added const qualifier.
	* subr.c (numdots): Added const qualifier to function argument.
	* cvs.h (numdots): Added const qualifier to prototype argument.

	* client.c (change_mode): Tied consecutive if statements testing
	  the same variable together with else if.

	* import.c (import_descend): Build list of subdirectories when
	  reading directory, and then process the subdirectories in that
	  list.  This change avoids I/O overhead of rereading directory
	  and reloading ignore list (.cvsignore) for each subdirectory.

Thu Jun  8 11:54:24 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* import.c (import_descend): Use 4.4BSD d_type field if it is
	  present.

	* lock.c (set_lockers_name): Use %lu in format and cast st_uid
	  field to unsigned long.

	* import.c (import): Use RCS_check_kflag() to check -k options.
	  (keyword_usage, str2expmode, strn2expmode, expand_names):
	  Removed.
	* rcs.c (RCS_check_kflag): Added keyword_usage array from import.c
	  for more descriptive error messages.

	* subr.c (run_setup, run_args): Changed variable argument
	  processing to work on machines that use <varargs.h>.

	* subr.c (copy_file, xcmp): Changed to read the file(s) by blocks
	  rather than by reading the whole file into a huge buffer.  The
	  claim that this was reasonable because source files tend to be
	  small does not hold up in real world situations.   CVS is used
	  to manage non-source files, and mallocs of 400K+ buffers (x2
	  for xcmp) can easily fail due to lack of available memory or
	  even memory pool fragmentation.
	  (block_read): New function, taken from GNU cmp and slightly
	  modified.

	* subr.c (xcmp): Added const qualifier to function arguments.
	* cvs.h (xcmp): Added const qualifer to prototype arguments.

Wed Jun  7 11:28:31 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* cvs.h (Popen): Added prototype.
	  (Fopen, open_file, isreadable, iswritable, isdir, isfile,
	  islink, make_directory, make_directories, rename_file,
	  link_file, unlink_file, copy_file): Added const qualifer to
	  prototype arguments.
	* subr.c (Fopen, Popen, open_file, isreadable, iswritable, isdir,
	  isfile, islink, make_directory, make_directories, rename_file,
	  link_file, unlink_file, copy_file): Added const qualifier to
	  function arguments.

	* logmsg.c (logfile_write), recurse.c (do_recursion, addfile):
	  Don't cast void functions to a void expression.  There is at
	  least one compiler (MPW) that balks at this.

	* rcs.c (keysize, valsize): Change type to size_t.

	* add.c (add_directory): Don't cast umask() argument to int.

	* import.c (add_rcs_file): Changed type of mode to mode_t.

	* rcscmds.c (RCS_merge): New function.
	* cvs.h (RCS_merge): Declare.
	* update.c (merge_file, join_file): Call RCS_merge instead of
	  invoking rcsmerge directly.

	* cvs.h: Include <stdlib.h> if HAVE_STDC_HEADERS, otherwise
	  declared getenv().
	* cvsrc.c, ignore.c, main.c: Removed getenv() declaration.

	* client.c (mode_to_string): Changed to take mode_t instead of
	  struct statb argument.  Simplified implementation, no longer
	  overallocates storage for returned mode string.
	* client.h (mode_to_string): Updated declaration.
	* server.c (server_updated): Updated for new calling conventions,
	  pass st_mode instead of pointer to struct statb.

	* cvs.h (CONST): Removed definition, use of const qualifier is
	  determined by autoconf.
	* history.c, modules.c, parseinfo.c: Use const instead of CONST.

	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, import.c, log.c,
	  main.c, mkmodules.c, patch.c, recurse.c, remove.c, rtag.c,
	  server.c, status.c, subr.c, tag.c, update.c: Changed function
	  arguments "char *argv[]" to "char **argv" to silence lint
	  warnings about performing arithmetic on arrays.

Tue Jun  6 18:57:21 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* version.c: Fix up version string, to say that this is Cyclic
        CVS.

Tue Jun  6 15:26:16 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* subr.c (run_setup, run_args, run_add_arg, xstrdup): Add const
	  qualifier to format argument.
	* cvs.h (run_setup, run_args, xstrdup): Likewise.

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Added rcscmds.c.
	  (OBJECTS): Added rcscmds.o.

	* rcscmds.c: New file, with new functions RCS_settag, RCS_deltag,
	  RCS_setbranch, RCS_lock, RCS_unlock.
	* checkin.c, commit.c, import.c, rtag.c, tag.c: Call above
	  functions instead of exec'ing rcs commands.
	* cvs.h: Declare new functions.

Mon May 29 21:40:54 1995  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* recurse.c (start_recursion, do_recursion): Set entries to NULL
	  after calling Entries_Close().

Sat May 27 08:08:18 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (check): Export RCSBIN only if there exists an
	`rcs' executable in ../../rcs/src.  Before, tests would fail when
	the directory existed but contained no executables.
	(distclean): Remove options.h, now that it's generated.
	(Makefile): Regenerate only *this* file when Makefile.in is
	out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri May 26 14:34:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* entries.c (Entries_Open): Added missing fclose().
	  (Entries_Close): Don't write Entries unless Entries.Log exists.

	* entries.c (Entries_Open): Renamed from ParseEntries; changed to
	  process Entries Log files left over from previous crashes or
	  aborted runs.
	  (Entries_Close): New function, write out Entries file if
	  neccessary and erase Log file.
	  (Register): Append changed records to Log file instead of
	  re-writing file.
	  (fgetentent): New function, parse one Entry record from a file.
	  (AddEntryNode): It's no longer an error for two records with the
	  same name to be added to the list.  New records replace older
	  ones.
	* cvs.h (Entries_Open, Entries_Close): Add prototypes.
	  (CVSADM_ENTLOG): New constant, name of Entries Log file.
	* add.c, checkout.c, client.c, find_names.c, recurse.c: Use
	  Entries_Open()/Entries_Close() instead of ParseEntries()/dellist().

	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, client.c, commit.c, diff.c,
	  history.c, import.c, log.c, patch.c, release.c, remove.c,
	  rtag.c, server.c, status.c, tag.c, update.c: Changed
	  conditionals so that return value of *printf is tested less than
	  0 instead of equal to EOF.

Thu May 25 08:30:12 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Never try to malloc zero bytes; if the user
	asks for zero bytes, malloc one instead.

Wed May 24 12:44:25 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Don't complain about NULL if zero bytes were
	requested.

Tue May 16 21:49:05 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Never try to malloc zero bytes; if the user
	asks for zero bytes, malloc one instead.

Mon May 15 14:35:11 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* lock.c (L_LOCK_OWNED): Removed.

	* add.c, checkout.c, client.c, create_adm.c, cvs.h, entries.c,
	  find_names.c modules.c, recurse.c, release.c, repos.c, update.c:
	  removed CVS 1.2 compatibility/upgrade code.

Mon May  8 11:25:07 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* lock.c (write_lock): Missed one instance where rmdir(tmp) should
	  have been changed to clear_lock().

Wed May  3 11:08:32 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* create_adm.c, entries.c, import.c, root.c: Changed conditionals
	  so that return value of *printf is tested less than 0 instead of
	  equal to EOF --- That's all Standard C requires.

Wed May  3 18:03:37 1995  Samuel Tardieu  <tardieu@emma.enst.fr>

	* rcs.h: removed #ifdef CVS_PRIVATE and #endif because cvs didn't
	  compile anymore.

Mon May  1 13:58:53 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.c, rcs.h: Implemented lazy parsing of rcs files.
	  RCS_parsercsfile_i modified to read only the first two records
	  of rcs files, a new function RCS_reparsercsfile is called only
	  when additional information (tags, revision numbers, dates,
	  etc.) is required.

Mon May  1 12:20:02 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Include -I. for options.h.

Fri Apr 28 16:16:33 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, HEADERS, DISTFILES): Updated.
	(dist-dir): Renamed from dist; changed to work with DISTDIR
	variable passed from parent.

	We don't want to include a file the user has to edit in the
	distribution.
	* options.h: No longer distributed.
	* options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* ../INSTALL, ../README: Installation instructions updated.

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): Send the remote command to rsh as a
	single string.

Fri Apr 28 00:29:49 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

	* commit.c: Added initializer for FORCE_CI

        * sanity.sh: Fix tests added 25 Apr -- they were expecting the
        server to make noise, but the CVS_SERVER variable had been
        accidentally set with the `-Q' flag.  Ran all tests -- both
        locally and remotely -- to verify that the change didn't break
        anything.

Thu Apr 27 12:41:52 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Revise comment regarding check vs. remotecheck.

Thu Apr 27 12:52:28 1995  Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@cyclic.com>

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): If the CVS_RSH environment variable
	is set, use its contents as the name of the program to invoke
	instead of `rsh'.

Thu Apr 27 12:18:38 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

	* checkout.c (checkout): To fix new bug created by Apr 23 change,
        re-enabled "expand-module" functionality, because it has the side
        effect of setting the checkin/update programs for a directory.  To
        solve the local/remote checkout problem that prompted this change
        in the first place, I performed the next change.
	* server.c (expand_proc): Now returns expansions for aliases only.

Wed Apr 26 12:07:42 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.c (getrcskey): Rewritten to process runs of whitespace chars
	  and rcs @ strings instead of using state variables "white" and
	  "funky".

Fri Apr  7 15:49:25 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* lock.c (unlock): Only call stat if we need to.

Wed Apr 26 10:48:44 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (new_entries_line): Don't prototype.

Tue Apr 25 22:19:16 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* sanity.sh: Add new tests to catch bugs in Apr 23 change.

Tue Apr 25 17:10:55 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* create_adm.c (Create_Admin): Use getwd instead of getcwd.

Sun Apr 23 20:58:32 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

       	* checkout.c (checkout): Disabled "expand-module" functionality on
        remote checkout, since it makes modules behave like aliases (see
        longer note there).  This change necessitated the change below.
        Also merged the like parts of a conditional.

	* client.c (call_in_directory): Changed the algorithm that created
        nested and directories and the "CVS" administration directories
        therein.  The algoithm wrongly assumed that the name of the
        directory that that was to be created and the repository name were
        the same, which breaks modules.

	* create_adm.c (Create_Admin), module.c (do_module), server.c
        (server_register), subr.c, entries.c: Added fprintfs for trace-mode
	debugging.

	* client.c (client_send_expansions): Argument to function didn't
        have a type -- added one.

	* server.c (new_entries_line): Arguments to this function are
        never used -- reoved them and fixed callers.

Sat Apr 22 11:17:20 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* rcs.c (RCS_parse): If we can't open the file, give an error
	message (except for ENOENT in case callers rely on that).

Wed Apr 19 08:52:37 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (send_repository): Check for CVSADM_ENTSTAT in `dir', not
	in `.'.

	* sanity.sh: Add TODO list.  Revise some comments.  Add tests of
	one working directory adding a file and other updating it.

Sat Apr  8 14:52:55 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Fri Apr  7 15:49:25 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* root.c (Name_Root): merge identical adjacent conditionals.

	* create_admin.c (Create_Admin): Rearranged check for CVSADM and
	  OCVSADM directories so that CVSADM pathname is only built once.

	* update.c (update_dirleave_proc): Removed code to remove CVS
	  administration directory if command_name == "export" and to
	  create CVS/Root file if it is not present.  Identical code
	  in update_filesdone_proc() will perform these same actions.
	  Also removed code that read and verfied CVS/Root.  This is
	  expensive, and if it is necessary should happen in the
	  general recursion processor rather than in the update
	  callbacks.

	* lock.c (masterlock): New variable, pathname of master lockdir.
	  (set_lock): removed lockdir argument, now constructs it itself
	  and stores it in masterlock.
	  (clear_lock): new function, removes master lockdir.
	  (Reader_Lock, write_lock): call clear_lock instead of removing
	  master lockdir.
	  (Reader_Lock, write_lock): #ifdef'd out CVSTFL code.

	* main.c (main): register Lock_Cleanup signal handler.
	* lock.c (Reader_Lock, write_lock): no longer register
	  Lock_Cleanup.

	* main.c (main): initialize new array hostname.
	* lock.c (Reader_Lock, write_lock): Use global hostname array.
	* logmsg.c (logfile_write): Likewise.

	* recurse.c (do_dir_proc, unroll_files_proc): Use open()/fchdir()
	  instead of getwd()/chdir() on systems that support the fchdir()
	  system call.

Fri Apr  7 06:57:20 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c: Include the word "server" in error message for memory
	exhausted, so the user knows which machine ran out of memory.

	* sanity.sh: For remote, set CVS_SERVER to test the right server,
	rather than a random one from the PATH.

	* commit.c [DEATH_STATE]: Pass -f to `ci'.

Thu Apr  6 13:05:15 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): If we didn't manage to fopen the file,
	don't try to fclose it.

	* client.c (handle_m, handle_e): Use fwrite, rather than a loop of
	putc's.  Sometimes these streams are unbuffered.

Tue Apr  4 11:33:56 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* (DISTFILES): Include cvsbug.sh, ChangeLog, NOTES, RCS-patches,
	README-rm-add, ChangeLog.fsf, sanity.sh, sanity.el, and
	.cvsignore.

Mon Mar 27 08:58:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* rcs.c (RCS_parsercsfile_i): Accept `dead' state regardless of
	DEATH_STATE define.  Revise comments regarding DEATH_STATE versus
	CVSDEA versus the scheme which uses a patched RCS.
	* README-rm-add, RCS-patches: Explain what versions of CVS need
	RCS patches.

Sat Mar 25 18:51:39 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* server.c (server_cleanup): Only do the abysmal kludge of waiting
 	for command and draining the pipe #ifdef sun.  The code makes
 	assumptions not valid on all systems, and is only there to
 	workaround a SunOS bug.

Wed Mar 22 21:55:56 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (mkdir_p): Call stat only if we get the EACCES.  Faster
	and more elegant.

Tue Jan 31 20:59:19 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* server.c: Try to avoid starting the "rm -rf" at cleanup time
	until after subprocesses have finished.
	(command_fds_to_drain, max_command_fd): New variables.
	(do_cvs_command): Set them.
	(command_pid_is_dead): New variable.
	(wait_sig): New function.
	(server_cleanup): If command_pid is nonzero, wait for it to die,
	draining output from it in the meantime.  If nonzero SIG was
	passed, send a signal to the subprocess, to encourage it to die
	soon.

	* main.c (usage): Argument is now `const char *const *'.
	* cvs.h (usage): Changed prototype.
	(USE): Make new variable `const'.
	* add.c (add_usage), admin.c (admin_usage), checkout.c
	(checkout_usage, export_usage, checkout), commit.c (commit_usage),
	diff.c (diff_usage), history.c (history_usg), import.c
	(import_usage, keyword_usage), log.c (log_usage), main.c (usg),
	patch.c (patch_usage), release.c (release_usage), remove.c
	(remove_usage), rtag.c (rtag_usage), server.c (server), status.c
	(status_usage), tag.c (tag_usage), update.c (update_usage): Usage
	messages are now const arrays of pointers to const char.

	* import.c (comtable): Now const.
	* main.c (rcsid): Now static.
	(cmd): Now const.
	(main): Local variable CM now points to const.
	* server.c (outbuf_memory_error): Local var MSG now const.

	* client.c (client_commit_usage): Deleted.

Sat Dec 31 15:51:55 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Allocate enough space for trailing '\0'.

Fri Mar  3 11:59:49 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* cvsbug.sh: Call it "Cyclic CVS" now, not "Remote CVS".  Call it
	version C1.4A, not 1.4A2-remote.  Send bugs to cyclic-cvs, not
	remote-cvs.

	* classify.c (Classify_File): Put check for dead file inside
	"#ifdef DEATH_SUPPORT".

Thu Feb 23 23:03:43 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* update.c (join_file): Don't pass the -E option to rcsmerge here,
	either (see Jan 22 change).

Mon Feb 13 13:28:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* cvsbug.sh: Send bug reports to remote-cvs@cyclic.com, rather
	than to the ordinary CVS bug address.  This does mean we'll have
	to wade through GNATS-style bug reports, sigh.

Wed Feb  8 06:42:27 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* server.c: Don't include <sys/stat.h>; system.h already does, and
 	4.3BSD can't take it twice.

	* subr.c [! HAVE_VPRINTF] (run_setup, run_args): Don't use va_dcl
 	in declaration.  Declare the a1..a8 args which are used in the
 	sprintf call.
	* cvs.h [! HAVE_VPRINTF] (run_setup, run_args): Don't prototype
 	args, to avoid conflicting with the function definitions
 	themselves.

Tue Feb  7 20:10:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* client.c (update_entries): Pass the patch subprocess the switch
	"-b ~", not "-b~"; the latter form seems not to work with patch
	version 2.0 and earlier --- it takes the next argv element as the
	backup suffix, and thus doesn't notice that the patch file's name
	has been specified, thus doesn't find the patch, thus...  *aargh*

Fri Feb  3 20:28:21 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* log.c (log_option_with_arg): New function.
	(cvslog): Use it and send_arg to handle the rlog options that take
	arguments.  The code used to use send_option_string for
	everything, which assumes that "-d1995/01/02" is equivalent to
	"-d -1 -9 -9 -5 ...".

Tue Jan 31 15:02:01 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.life.uiuc.edu>

	* server.c: #include <sys/stat.h> for the new stat call in mkdir_p.
	(mkdir_p): Don't try to create the intermediate directory if it
	exists already.  Some systems return EEXIST, but others return
	EACCES, which we can't otherwise distinguish from a real access
	problem.

Sun Jan 22 15:25:45 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* update.c (merge_file): My rcsmerge doesn't accept a -E option,
	and it doesn't look too important, so don't pass it.

Fri Jan 20 14:24:58 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* client.c (do_deferred_progs): Don't try to chdir to toplevel_wd
	if it has not been set.
	(process_prune_candidates): Likewise.

Mon Nov 28 09:59:14 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (client_commit): Move guts of function from here...
	* commit.c (commit): ...to here.

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): Instead of calling isdir before
	attempting to create the directory, just ignore EEXIST errors from
	mkdir.  (This removes some DEATH_SUPPORT ifdefs which actually had

	* commit.c: Reinstate got_message variable
	(commit_filesdoneproc, commit_fileproc, commit_direntproc): Use it.

	* diff.c (diff_fileproc): Set top_rev from vn_user, not vn_rcs.
	Rename it to user_file_rev because it need not be the head of any
	branch.
	(diff_file_nodiff): After checking user_file_rev, if we have both
	use_rev1 and use_rev2, compare them instead of going on to code
	which assumes use_rev2 == NULL.

	* client.c (update_entries): Run "patch" with input from
	/dev/null, so if it's the wrong version, it fails quickly rather
	than waiting for EOF from terminal before failing.

Sat Aug 20 04:16:33 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	print it at all if server_active, because it won't have any useful

	filtering is being done.  Wait for rsh_pid specifically.
	(start_server): Use filter_stream_through_program for "tee"

	* diff.c (diff_fileproc): if ts_user and ts_rcs match, then the
	file is at the top of the tree -- so we might not even have a
	copy. Put the revision into diff_rev1 or diff_rev2.

Wed Aug 10 14:55:38 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (do_cvs_command): Use waitpid.

	trigger this code next time around, if the file is modified.

	* vers_ts.c (time_stamp): Only put st_mtime field into timestamp,
	and use GMT time for it.  With st_ctime or in local time, copying
	trees between machines in different time zones makes all the files

	upgrades.)
	(send_fileproc): if use_unchanged didn't get set, send an
	old-style "Lost" request, otherwise send an "Unchanged" request.
	* server.c (serve_unchanged): new function, same as serve_lost,
	but used in the opposite case.
	(requests): add new UseUnchanged and Unchanged requests, and make

	* import.c (update_rcs_file): Change temporary file name in TMPDIR
	from FILE_HOLDER to cvs-imp<process-id>.

	* sanity.sh: Add ">/dev/null" and "2>/dev/null" many places to
	suppress spurious output.  Comment out tests which don't work (cvs
	add on top-level directory, cvs diff when non-committed adds or
	removes have been made, cvs release, test 53 (already commented as
	broken), retagging without deleting old tag, test 63).  Now 'make
	check' runs without any failures.

	it is set to 1, fall through to T_CHECKOUT case.
	(patch_file): Add docheckout argument.  Set it to 1 if we can't
	make a patch.  Check out the files and run diff rather than
	rcsdiff.  If either file does not end in a newline, we can't make
	a patch.  If the patch starts with the string "Binary", assume
	one or the other is a binary file, and that we can't make a patch.
