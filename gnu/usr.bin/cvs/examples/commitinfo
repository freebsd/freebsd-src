#
# The "commitinfo" file is used to control pre-commit checks.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the repository and a list 
# of files to check.  A non-zero exit of the filter program will 
# cause the commit to be aborted.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is the 
# name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name ALL appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or DEFAULT.

DEFAULT			checkforid
