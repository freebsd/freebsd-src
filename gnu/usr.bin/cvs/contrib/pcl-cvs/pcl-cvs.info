GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                        Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
     distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
     "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
     "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
     derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
     containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
     with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
     (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
     term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
     act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
     from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a
     work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
     running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
     Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
     Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
     copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
     exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
     1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any
          change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
          that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
          Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
          no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
          License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands
          interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
          running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
          to print or display an announcement including an
          appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
          warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
          that users may redistribute the program under these
          conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
          License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
          but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
          based on the Program is not required to print an
          announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
     separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
     do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
     separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
     part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
     distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
     whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
     whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
     it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
     on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
     the other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
     terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
     the following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
          under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
          your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
          complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
          code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
          above on a medium customarily used for software
          interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
          offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
          alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
          and only if you received the program in object code or
          executable form with such an offer, in accord with
          Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
     complete source code means all the source code for all modules
     it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
     plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of
     the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
     code distributed need not include anything that is normally
     distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
     on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
     accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
     not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
     is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
     modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These
     actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
      Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
     work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
     distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
     would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
     then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
     would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
     apply in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
     any patents or other property right claims or to contest
     validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
     of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
     system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
     people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
     software distributed through that system in reliance on
     consistent application of that system; it is up to the
     author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
     software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
     that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
     believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
     interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
     under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
     limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
     permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such
     case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
     the body of this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
     may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
     the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
     the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                               NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
     AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
     OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
     ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want
to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
License.

Installation
************

   This section describes the installation of pcl-cvs, the GNU Emacs
CVS front-end.  You should install not only the elisp files
themselves, but also the on-line documentation so that your users
will know how to use it.  You can create typeset documentation from
the file `pcl-cvs.texinfo' as well as an on-line info file.  The
following steps are also described in the file `INSTALL' in the source
directory.

* Menu:

* Pcl-cvs installation::        How to install pcl-cvs on your system.
* On-line manual installation::  How to install the on-line manual.
* Typeset manual installation::  How to create typeset documentation
                                 about pcl-cvs.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Pcl-cvs installation,  Next: On-line manual installation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

Installation of the pcl-cvs program
===================================

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site.
     The only things you have to change is the definition of `lispdir'
     and `infodir'.  The elisp files will be copied to `lispdir', and
     the info file to `infodir'.

  2. Configure pcl-cvs.el

     There are a couple of paths that you have to check to make sure
     that they match you system.  They appear early in the file
     pcl-cvs.el.

     *NOTE:*  If your system is running emacs 18.57 or earlier you
     MUST uncomment the line that says:

          (setq delete-exited-processes nil)

     Setting `delete-exited-processes' to `nil' works around a bug in
     emacs that causes it to dump core.  The bug was fixed in emacs
     18.58.

  3. Release 1.05 and later of pcl-cvs requires parts of the Elib
     library, version 0.07 or later.  Elib is available via anonymous
     ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in `pub/gnu/elib-0.07.tar.z', and from
     a lot of other sites that mirrors prep.  Get Elib, and install
     it, before proceeding.

  4. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy both the `.el' and the
     `.elc' into the directory you specified in step 1.

     If you don't want to install the `.el' files but only the `.elc'
     files (the byte-compiled files), you can type ``make
     install_elc'' instead of ``make install''.

     If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
     want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles' instead. 
     This is what happens if you only type `make' without parameters.

  5. Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/gnu/emacs/lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.

Installation of the on-line manual.
===================================

  1. Create the info file `pcl-cvs' from `pcl-cvs.texinfo' by typing
     `make info'.  If you don't have the program `makeinfo' you can
     get it by anonymous ftp from e.g. `ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu' as
     `pub/gnu/texinfo-2.14.tar.Z' (there might be a newer version
     there when you read this), or you could use the preformatted
     info file `pcl-cvs.info' that is included in the distribution
     (type `cp pcl-cvs.info pcl-cvs').

  2. Move the info file `pcl-cvs' to your standard info directory.
     This might be called something like `/usr/gnu/emacs/info'.

  3. Edit the file `dir' in the info directory and enter one line to
     contain a pointer to the info file `pcl-cvs'.  The line can, for
     instance, look like this:

          * Pcl-cvs: (pcl-cvs).       An Emacs front-end to CVS.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Typeset manual installation,  Prev: On-line manual installation,  Up: Installation

How to make typeset documentation from pcl-cvs.texinfo
======================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset
manual from `pcl-cvs.texinfo'.

  1. Run TeX by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  You will not get the
     indices unless you have the `texindex' program.

  2. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     postscript printer there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does. 
     There is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips',
     which you can use.

Contributors to pcl-cvs
=======================

   Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to
work on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you
contribute to me to this package (*note Bugs::.).

   The following persons have made contributions to pcl-cvs.

   * Brian Berliner wrote CVS, together with some other contributors.
     Without his work on CVS this package would be useless...

   * Per Cederqvist wrote most of the otherwise unattributed
     functions in pcl-cvs as well as all documentation.

   * Inge Wallin (`inge@lysator.liu.se') wrote the skeleton to
     `pcl-cvs.texinfo', and gave useful comments on it.  He also wrote
     the files `elib-node.el' and `compile-all.el'.  The file
     `cookie.el' was inspired by Inge.

   * Linus Tolke (`linus@lysator.liu.se') contributed useful comments
     on both the functionality and the documentation.

   * Jamie Zawinski (`jwz@lucid.com') contributed `pcl-cvs-lucid.el'.

   * Leif Lonnblad contributed RCVS support.

   Apart from these, a lot of people have send me suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without your
there would be no new releases of pcl-cvs.

Where can I get pcl-cvs?
========================

   The latest release of pcl-cvs can be fetched via anonymous ftp from
`ftp.lysator.liu.se', (IP no. 130.236.254.1) in the directory
`pub/emacs'.  If you don't live in Scandinavia you should probably
check with archie to see if there is a site closer to you that
archives pcl-cvs.

   New releases will be announced to appropriate newsgroups.  If you
send your email address to me I will add you to my list of people to
mail when I make a new release.

Getting started
***************

   This document assumes that you know what CVS is, and that you at
least knows the fundamental concepts of CVS.  If that is not the case
you should read the man page for CVS.

   Pcl-cvs is only useful once you have checked out a module.  So
before you invoke it you must have a copy of a module somewhere in
the file system.

   You invoke pcl-cvs by typing `M-x cvs-update RET'.  If your emacs
responds with `[No match]' your system administrator has not
installed pcl-cvs properly.  Try `M-x load-library RET pcl-cvs RET'.
If that also fails - talk to your root.  If it succeeds you might put
this line in your `.emacs' file so that you don't have to type the
`load-library' command every time you wish to use pcl-cvs:

     (autoload 'cvs-update "pcl-cvs" nil t)

   The function `cvs-update' will ask for a directory.  The command
`cvs update' will be run in that directory.  (It should contain files
that have been checked out from a CVS archive.)  The output from
`cvs' will be parsed and presented in a table in a buffer called
`*cvs*'.  It might look something like this:

     PCL-CVS release 1.05.
     
     In directory /users/ceder/FOO/test:
       Updated     bar
       Updated     file.txt
       Modified ci namechange
       Updated     newer
     
     In directory /users/ceder/FOO/test/sub:
       Modified ci ChangeLog
     ---------- End -----

   In this example the three files (`bar', `file.txt' and `newer')
that are marked with `Updated' have been copied from the CVS
repository to `/users/ceder/FOO/test/' since someone else have
checked in newer versions of them.  Two files (`namechange' and
`sub/ChangeLog') have been modified locally, and needs to be checked
in.

   You can move the cursor up and down in the buffer with `C-n' and
`C-p' or `n' and `p'.  If you press `c' on one of the `Modified'
files that file will be checked in to the CVS repository. *Note
Committing changes::.  You can press `x' to get rid of the
"uninteresting" files that have only been `Updated' (and don't
require any further action from you).

   You can also easily get a `diff' between your modified file and the
base version that you started from, and you can get the output from
`cvs log' and `cvs status' on the listed files simply by pressing a
key (*note Getting info about files::.).

Buffer contents
***************

   The display contains four columns.  They contain, from left to
right:

   * An asterisk when the file is "marked" (*note Selected files::.).

   * The status of the file.  See *Note File status::, for more
     information.

   * A "need to be checked in"-marker (`ci').

   * The file name.

File: pcl-cvs,  Node: File status,  Next: Selected files,  Prev: Buffer contents,  Up: Buffer contents

File status
===========

   The `file status' field can have the following values:

`Updated'
     The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository. 
     This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not
     in your source, and for files that you haven't changed but are
     not the most recent versions available in the repository.

`Modified'
     The file is modified in  your  working  directory, and there was
     no modification to the same file in the repository.

`Merged'
     The file is modified in your working directory, and there were
     modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but
     they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your working
     directory.

`Conflict'
     A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to
     FILE with changes from the source repository.  FILE (the copy in
     your working directory) is now the output of the `rcsmerge'
     command on the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is
     also in your working directory, with the name `.#FILE.VERSION',
     where VERSION is the RCS revision that your modified file started
     from.  *Note Viewing differences::, for more details.

`Added'
     The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be checked
     in to the repository.

`Removed'
     The file has been removed by you, but it needs to be checked in
     to the repository.  You can resurrect it by typing `a' (*note
     Adding and removing files::.).

`Unknown'
     A file that was detected in your directory, but that neither
     appears in the repository, nor is present on the list of files
     that CVS should ignore.

   There are also a few special cases, that rarely occur, which have
longer strings in the fields:

`Removed from repository'
     The file has been removed from your directory since someone has
     removed it from the repository.  (It is still present in the
     Attic directory, so no permanent loss has occurred).  This,
     unlike the other entries in this table, is not an error
     condition.

`Removed from repository, changed by you'
     You have modified a file that someone have removed from the
     repository. You can correct this situation by removing the file
     manually (see *note Adding and removing files::.).

`Removed by you, changed in repository'
     You have removed a file, and before you committed the removal
     someone committed a change to that file.  You could use `a' to
     resurrect the file (see *note Adding and removing files::.).

`Move away FILE - it is in the way'
     For some reason CVS does not like the file FILE.  Rename or
     remove it.

`This repository is missing! Remove this dir manually.'
     It is impossible to remove a directory in the CVS repository in
     a clean way.  Someone have tried to remove one, and CVS gets
     confused.  Remove your copy of the directory.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Selected files,  Prev: File status,  Up: Buffer contents

Selected files
==============

   Many of the commands works on the current set of "selected" files.

   * If there are any files that are marked they constitute the set of
     selected files.

   * Otherwise, if the cursor points to a file, that file is the
     selected file.

   * Otherwise, if the cursor points to a directory, all the files in
     that directory that appears in the buffer are the selected files.

   This scheme might seem a little complicated, but once one get used
to it, it is quite powerful.

   *Note Marking files:: tells how you mark and unmark files.

File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Updating the directory,  Next: Movement commands,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Commands

Updating the directory
======================

`M-x cvs-update'
     Run a `cvs update' command.  You will be asked for the directory
     in which the `cvs update' will be run.  The output will be
     parsed by pcl-cvs, and the result printed in the `*cvs*' buffer
     (see *note Buffer contents::. for a description of the contents).

     By default, `cvs-update' will descend recursively into
     subdirectories.  You can avoid that behavior by giving a prefix
     argument to it (e.g., by typing `C-u M-x cvs-update RET').

     All other commands in pcl-cvs requires that you have a `*cvs*'
     buffer.  This is the command that you use to get one.

     CVS uses lock files in the repository to ensure the integrity of
     the data files in the repository.  They might be left behind
     i.e. if a workstation crashes in the middle of a CVS operation. 
     CVS outputs a message when it is waiting for a lock file to go
     away.  Pcl-cvs will show the same message in the *cvs* buffer,
     together with instructions for deleting the lock files.  You
     should normally not have to delete them manually -- just wait a
     little while and the problem should fix itself.  But if the lock
     files doesn't disappear you can delete them with `M-x
     cvs-delete-lock RET'.

`g'
     This will run `cvs update' again.  It will always use the same
     buffer that was used with the previous `cvs update'.  Give a
     prefix argument to avoid descending into subdirectories.  This
     runs the command `cvs-mode-update-no-prompt'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Movement commands,  Next: Marking files,  Prev: Updating the directory,  Up: Commands

Movement Commands
=================

   You can use most normal Emacs commands to move forward and
backward in the buffer.  Some keys are rebound to functions that take
advantage of the fact that the buffer is a pcl-cvs buffer:

`SPC'
`C-n'
`n'
     These keys move the cursor one file forward, towards the end of
     the buffer (`cookie-next-cookie').

`C-p'
`p'
     These keys move one file backward, towards the beginning of the
     buffer (`cookie-previous-cookie').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Marking files,  Next: Committing changes,  Prev: Movement commands,  Up: Commands

Marking files
=============

   Pcl-cvs works on a set of "selected files" (*note Selected
files::.). You can mark and unmark files with these commands:

`m'
     This marks the file that the cursor is positioned on.  If the
     cursor is positioned on a directory all files in that directory
     will be marked. (`cvs-mode-mark').

`u'
     Unmark the file that the cursor is positioned on. If the cursor
     is on a directory, all files in that directory will be unmarked.
     (`cvs-mode-unmark').

`M'
     Mark *all* files in the buffer (`cvs-mode-mark-all-files').

`ESC DEL'
     Unmark *all* files (`cvs-mode-unmark-all-files').

`DEL'
     Unmark the file on the previous line, and move point to that line
     (`cvs-mode-unmark-up').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Committing changes,  Next: Editing files,  Prev: Marking files,  Up: Commands

Committing changes
==================

`c'
     All files that have a "need to be checked in"-marker (*note
     Buffer contents::.) can be checked in with the `c' command.  It
     checks in all selected files (*note Selected files::.) (except
     those who lack the "ci"-marker - they are ignored).  Pressing
     `c' causes `cvs-mode-commit' to be run.

     When you press `c' you will get a buffer called
     `*cvs-commit-message*'.  Enter the log message for the file(s) in
     it.  When you are ready you should press `C-c C-c' to actually
     commit the files (using `cvs-edit-done').

     Normally the `*cvs-commit-message*' buffer will retain the log
     message from the previous commit, but if the variable
     `cvs-erase-input-buffer' is set to a non-`nil' value the buffer
     will be erased.  Point and mark will always be located around the
     entire buffer so that you can easily erase it with `C-w'
     (`kill-region').

     If you are editing the files in your emacs an automatic
     `revert-buffer' will be performed.  (If the file contains `$Id$'
     keywords `cvs commit' will write a new file with the new values
     substituted.  The auto-revert makes sure that you get them into
     your buffer). The revert will not occur if you have modified
     your buffer, or if `cvs-auto-revert-after-commit' is set to
     `nil'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Editing files,  Next: Getting info about files,  Prev: Committing changes,  Up: Commands

Editing files
=============

   There are currently three commands that can be used to find a file
(that is, load it into a buffer and start editing it there).  These
commands work on the line that the cursor is situated at.  They
ignore any marked files.

`f'
     Find the file that the cursor points to.  Run `dired' (*note
     Dired: (Emacs)Dired.) if the cursor points to a directory
     (`cvs-mode-find-file').

`o'
     Like `f', but use another window
     (`cvs-mode-find-file-other-window').

`A'
     Invoke `add-change-log-entry-other-window' to edit a `ChangeLog'
     file.  The `ChangeLog' will be found in the directory of the
     file the cursor points to.
     (`cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Getting info about files,  Next: Adding and removing files,  Prev: Editing files,  Up: Commands

Getting info about files
========================

   Both of the following commands can be customized. *Note
Customization::.

`l'
     Run `cvs log' on all selected files, and show the result in a
     temporary buffer (`cvs-mode-log').

`s'
     Run `cvs status' on all selected files, and show the result in a
     temporary buffer (`cvs-mode-status').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Adding and removing files,  Next: Undoing changes,  Prev: Getting info about files,  Up: Commands

Adding and removing files
=========================

   The following commands are available to make it easy to add and
remove files from the CVS repository.

`a'
     Add all selected files.  This command can be used on `Unknown'
     files (see *note File status::.).  The status of the file will
     change to `Added', and you will have to use `c'
     (`cvs-mode-commit', see *note Committing changes::.) to really
     add the file to the repository.

     This command can also be used on `Removed' files (before you
     commit them) to resurrect them.

     Selected files that are neither `Unknown' nor `Removed' will be
     ignored by this command.

     The command that is run is `cvs-mode-add'.

`r'
     This command removes the selected files (after prompting for
     confirmation).  The files are `rm'ed from your directory and
     (unless the status was `Unknown'; *note File status::.) they will
     also be `cvs remove'd.  If the files were `Unknown' they will
     disappear from the buffer.  Otherwise their status will change to
     `Removed', and you must use `c' (`cvs-mode-commit', *note
     Committing changes::.) to commit the removal.

     The command that is run is `cvs-mode-remove-file'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Undoing changes,  Next: Removing handled entries,  Prev: Adding and removing files,  Up: Commands

Undoing changes
===============

`U'
     If you have modified a file, and for some reason decide that you
     don't want to keep the changes, you can undo them with this
     command.  It works by removing your working copy of the file and
     then getting the latest version from the repository
     (`cvs-mode-undo-local-changes'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Removing handled entries,  Next: Ignoring files,  Prev: Undoing changes,  Up: Commands

Removing handled entries
========================

`x'
     This command allows you to remove all entries that you have
     processed. More specifically, the lines for `Updated' files
     (*note File status::. and files that have been checked in (*note
     Committing changes::.) are removed from the buffer.  If a
     directory becomes empty the heading for that directory is also
     removed.  This makes it easier to get an overview of what needs
     to be done.

     The command is called `cvs-mode-remove-handled'.  If
     `cvs-auto-remove-handled' is set to non-`nil' this will
     automatically be performed after every commit.

`C-k'
     This command can be used for lines that
     `cvs-mode-remove-handled' would not delete, but that you want to
     delete (`cvs-mode-acknowledge').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Ignoring files,  Next: Viewing differences,  Prev: Removing handled entries,  Up: Commands

Ignoring files
==============

`i'
     Arrange so that CVS will ignore the selected files.  The file
     names are added to the `.cvsignore' file in the corresponding
     directory.  If the `.cvsignore' doesn't exist it will be created.

     The `.cvsignore' file should normally be added to the repository,
     but you could ignore it also if you like it better that way.

     This runs `cvs-mode-ignore'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Viewing differences,  Next: Emerge,  Prev: Ignoring files,  Up: Commands

Viewing differences
===================

`d'
     Display a `cvs diff' between the selected files and the RCS
     version that they are based on.  *Note Customization:: describes
     how you can send flags to `cvs diff'.  If CVS-DIFF-IGNORE-MARKS
     is set to a non-`nil' value or if a prefix argument is given
     (but not both) any marked files will not be considered to be
     selected. (`cvs-mode-diff-cvs').

`b'
     If CVS finds a conflict while merging two versions of a file
     (during a `cvs update', *note Updating the directory::.) it will
     save the original file in a file called `.#FILE.VERSION' where
     FILE is the name of the file, and VERSION is the RCS version
     number that your file was based on.

     With the `b' command you can run a `diff' on the files
     `.#FILE.VERSION' and `FILE'.  You can get a context- or Unidiff
     by setting `cvs-diff-flags' - *note Customization::..  This
     command only works on files that have status `Conflict' or
     `Merged'.

     If CVS-DIFF-IGNORE-MARKS is set to a non-`nil' value or if a
     prefix argument is given (but not both) any marked files will
     not be considered to be selected.  (`cvs-mode-diff-backup').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Emerge,  Next: Reverting your buffers,  Prev: Viewing differences,  Up: Commands

Running emerge
==============

`e'
     Invoke `emerge' on one file.  This command works slightly
     different depending on the file status.

    `Modified'
          Run `emerge-files' with your working file as file A, and
          the latest revision in the repository as file B.

    `Merged'
    `Conflict'
          Run `emerge-files-with-ancestor' with your working file (as
          it was prior to your invocation of `cvs-update') as file A,
          the latest revision in the repository as file B, and the
          revision that you based your local modifications on as
          ancestor.

     *Note:* CVS has already performed a merge.  The resulting file is
     not used in any way if you use this command.  If you use the `q'
     command inside `emerge' (to successfully terminate the merge) the
     file that CVS created will be overwritten.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Reverting your buffers,  Next: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Emerge,  Up: Commands

Reverting your buffers
======================

`R'
     If you are editing (or just viewing) a file in a buffer, and
     that file is changed by CVS during a `cvs-update', all you have
     to do is type `R' in the *cvs* buffer to read in the new
     versions of the files.

     All files that are `Updated', `Merged' or in `Conflict' are
     reverted from the disk.  Any other files are ignored.  Only files
     that you were already editing are read.

     An error is signalled if you have modified the buffer since it
     was last changed. (`cvs-mode-revert-updated-buffers').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Reverting your buffers,  Up: Commands

Miscellaneous commands
======================

`M-x cvs-byte-compile-files'
     Byte compile all selected files that end in .el.

`M-x cvs-delete-lock'
     This command can be used in any buffer, and deletes the lock
     files that the *cvs* buffer informs you about.  You should
     normally never have to use this command since CVS tries very
     carefully to always remove the lock files itself.

     You can only use this command when a message in the *cvs* buffer
     tells you so.  You should wait a while before using this command
     in case someone else is running a cvs command.

`q'
     Bury the *cvs* buffer. (`bury-buffer').

Customization
*************

   If you have an idea about any customization that would be handy but
isn't present in this list, please tell me!  *Note Bugs:: for info on
how to reach me.

`cvs-erase-input-buffer'
     If set to anything else than `nil' the edit buffer will be erased
     before you write the log message (*note Committing changes::.).

`cvs-inhibit-copyright-message'
     The copyright message that is displayed on startup can be
     annoying after a while.  Set this variable to `t' if you want to
     get rid of it. (But don't set this to `t' in the system defaults
     file - new users should see this message at least once).

`cvs-diff-flags'
     A list of strings to pass as arguments to the `cvs diff' and
     `diff' programs.  This is used by `cvs-mode-diff-cvs' and
     `cvs-mode-diff-backup' (key `b', *note Viewing differences::.). 
     If you prefer the Unidiff format you could add this line to your
     `.emacs' file:

          (setq cvs-diff-flags '("-u"))

`cvs-diff-ignore-marks'
     If this variable is non-`nil' or if a prefix argument is given
     (but not both) to `cvs-mode-diff-cvs' or `cvs-mode-diff-backup'
     marked files are not considered selected.

`cvs-log-flags'
     List of strings to send to `cvs log'.  Used by `cvs-mode-log'
     (key `l', *note Getting info about files::.).

`cvs-status-flags'
     List of strings to send to `cvs status'.  Used by
     `cvs-mode-status' (key `s', *note Getting info about files::.).

`cvs-auto-remove-handled'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value
     `cvs-mode-remove-handled' will be called every time you check in
     files, after the check-in is ready.  *Note Removing handled
     entries::.

`cvs-auto-revert-after-commit'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value any buffers you
     have that visit a file that is committed will be automatically
     reverted. This variable is default `t'. *Note Committing
     changes::.

`cvs-update-prog-output-skip-regexp'
     The `-u' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a command
     whenever a `cvs update' is performed (see cvs(5)).  This regexp
     is used to search for the last line in that output.  It is
     normally set to `"$"'.  That setting is only correct if the
     command outputs nothing.  Note that pcl-cvs will get very
     confused if the command outputs *anything* to `stderr'.

`cvs-cvsroot'
     This variable can be set to override `CVSROOT'.  It should be a
     string. If it is set then everytime a cvs command is run it will
     be called as `cvs -d CVS-CVSROOT...'  This can be useful if your
     site has several repositories.

`TMPDIR'
     Pcl-cvs uses this *environment variable* to decide where to put
     the temporary files it needs.  It defaults to `/tmp' if it is
     not set.

`cvs-commit-buffer-require-final-newline'
     When you enter a log message in the `*cvs-commit-message*' buffer
     pcl-cvs will normally automatically insert a trailing newline,
     unless there already is one.  This behavior can be controlled via
     `cvs-commit-buffer-require-final-newline'.  If it is `t' (the
     default behavior), a newline will always be appended.  If it is
     `nil', newlines will never be appended.  Any other value causes
     pcl-cvs to ask the user whenever there is no trailing newline in
     the commit message buffer.

`cvs-sort-ignore-file'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value the `.cvsignore'
     will always be sorted whenever you use `cvs-mode-ignore' to add
     a file to it.  This option is on by default.

Future enhancements
*******************

   Pcl-cvs is still under development and needs a number of
enhancements to be called complete.  Below is my current wish-list
for future releases of pcl-cvs.  Please, let me know which of these
features you want most. They are listed below in approximately the
order that I currently think I will implement them in.

   * Rewritten parser code.  There are many situations where pcl-cvs
     will fail to recognize the output from CVS.  The situation could
     be greatly increased.

   * `cvs-status'.  This will run `cvs status' in a directory and
     produce a buffer that looks pretty much like the current *cvs*
     buffer. That buffer will include information for all
     version-controlled files. (There will be a simple keystroke to
     remove all "uninteresting" files, that is, files that are
     "Up-to-date").  In this new buffer you will be able to update a
     file, commit a file, et c.  The big win with this is that you
     will be able to watch the differences between your current
     working file and the head revision in the repository before you
     update the file, and you can then choose to update it or let it
     wait for a while longer.

   * Log mode.  When this mode is finished you will be able to move
     around (using `n' and `p') between the revisions of a file, mark
     two of them, and run a diff between them.  You will be able to
     hide branches (similar to the way you can hide sub-paragraphs in
     outline-mode) and do merges between revisions.  Other ideas
     about this are welcome.

   * The current model for marks in the *cvs* buffer seems to be
     confusing. I am considering to use the VM model instead, where
     marks are normally inactive.  To activate the mark, you issue a
     command like `cvs-mode-next-command-uses-marks'.  I might
     implement a flag so that you can use either version.  Feedback
     on this before I start coding it is very welcome.

   * It should be possible to run commands such as `cvs log', `cvs
     status' and `cvs commit' directly from a buffer containing a
     file, instead of having to `cvs-update'.  If the directory
     contains many files the `cvs-update' can take quite some time,
     especially on a slow machine.  I planed to put these kind of
     commands on the prefix `C-c C-v', but that turned out to be used
     by for instance c++-mode. If you have any suggestions for a
     better prefix key, please let me know.

   * Increased robustness.  For instance, you can not currently press
     `C-g' when you are entering the description of a file that you
     are adding without confusing pcl-cvs.

   * Support for multiple active *cvs* buffers.

   * Dired support.  I have an experimental `dired-cvs.el' that works
     together with CVS 1.2.  Unfortunately I wrote it on top of a
     non-standard `dired.el', so it must be rewritten.

   * An ability to send user-supplied options to all the cvs commands.

   * Pcl-cvs is not at all clever about what it should do when `cvs
     update' runs a program (due to the `-u' option in the `modules'
     file -- see `cvs(5)').  The current release uses a regexp to
     search for the end.  At the very least that regexp should be
     configured for different modules.  Tell me if you have any idea
     about what is the right thing to do.  In a perfect world the
     program should also be allowed to print to `stderr' without
     causing pcl-cvs to crash.

   If you miss something in this wish-list, let me know!  I don't
promise that I will write it, but I will at least try to coordinate
the efforts of making a good Emacs front end to CVS.  See *Note
Bugs:: for information about how to reach me.

   So far, I have written most of pcl-cvs in my all-to-rare spare
time. If you want pcl-cvs to be developed faster you can write a
contract with Signum Support to do the extension.  You can reach
Signum Support by email to `info@signum.se' or via mail to Signum
Support AB, Box 2044, S-580 02 Linkoping, Sweden. Phone: +46 (0) 13 -

Bugs (known and unknown)
************************

   If you find a bug or misfeature, don't hesitate to tell me!  Send
email to `ceder@lysator.liu.se'.

   If you have ideas for improvements, or if you have written some
extensions to this package, I would like to hear from you.  I hope
that you find this package useful!

   Below is a partial list of currently known problems with pcl-cvs
version 1.05.

Commit causes Emacs to hang
     Emacs waits for the `cvs commit' command to finish before you can
     do anything.  If you start a background job from the loginfo
     file you must take care that it closes `stdout' and `stderr' if
     you do not want to wait for it.  (You do that with
     `background-command &>- 2&>- &' if you are starting
     `background-command' from a `/bin/sh' shell script).

     Your emacs will also hang if there was a lock file in the
     repository. In this case you can type `C-g' to get control over
     your emacs again.

Name clash in Emacs 19
     This is really a bug in Elib or the Emacs 19 distribution.  Both
     Elib and Emacs 19.6 through at least 19.10 contains a file named
     `cookie.el'.  One of the files will have to be renamed, and we
     are currently negotiating about which of the files to rename.

Commands while cvs-update is running
     It is possible to type commands in the *cvs* buffer while the
     update is running, but error messages is all that you will get. 
     The error messages should be better.

Unexpected output from CVS
     Unexpected output from CVS confuses pcl-cvs.  It will currently
     create a bug report that you can mail to me.  It should do
     something more civilized.
