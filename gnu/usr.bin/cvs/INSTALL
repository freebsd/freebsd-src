(footnote 1)
	AIX 4.1 systems fail to run "configure" due to bugs in their
	"/bin/sh" implementation.  You might want to try feeding the
	configure script to "bash" ported to AIX 4.1.  (about 1.4A2).

(footnote 2)
	Some Irix 4.0 systems may core dump in malloc while running
	CVS.  We believe this is a bug in the Irix malloc.  You can
	workaround this bug by linking with "-lmalloc" if necessary.
	(about 1.4A2).

(footnote 3)
        There are some warnings about pointer casts which can safely be
        ignored.  (about 1.4.90).

(footnote 4) Comment out the include of sys/time.h in src/server.c. (1.4.93)
	You also may have to make sure TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is undef'ed.

(footnote 5) Change /usr/tmp to /var/tmp in src/server.c (2 places) (1.4.93).

(footnote 6) Build in ucb universe with COFF compiler tools.  Put
	/usr/local/bin first in PATH while doing a configure, make
	and install of GNU diffutils-2.7, rcs-5.7, then cvs-1.5.

(footnote 7) Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@pilgrim.umass.edu> reports
        success with this configure command:
  CC=cc CFLAGS='-O2 -Olimit 2000 -std1' ./configure --verbose alpha-dec-osf

(footnote 8) Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@pilgrim.umass.edu> reports
        success with this configure command:
  CC=cc CFLAGS='+O2 -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE' ./configure --verbose hppa1.1-hp-hpux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation under Unix:

1)  Run "configure":

	$ ./configure

    You can specify an alternate destination to override the default with
    the --prefix option:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu

    or some path that is more appropriate for your site.  The default prefix
    value is "/usr/local", with binaries in sub-directory "bin", manual
    pages in sub-directory "man", and libraries in sub-directory "lib".

    This release of CVS also requires RCS commands to be installed in
    the user's PATH (or a path you have configured in src/options.h).
    If you don't have RCS, you will need to get it from GNU as well.  It
    is best to get the version 5.7 (or later) version of RCS, available
    from prep.ai.mit.edu in the file pub/gnu/rcs-5.7.tar.gz.  It is best
    (although not essential) to avoid RCS versions 5.6.[5-7] beta
    because the rcsmerge therein defaults to -A instead of -E which
    affects the way CVS handles conflicts (this is fixed in RCS 5.6.8
    and RCS 5.7).

    Along with RCS, you will want to run GNU diffutils.  This will allow
    revision control of files with binary data (a real nice feature).
    You will need at least version 1.15 of GNU diff for this to work.
    The current version of GNU diffutils is 2.7, and it is also
    available from prep.ai.mit.edu in the file pub/gnu/diffutils-2.7.tar.gz.

    WARNING:  Be sure that you (have) configure(d) RCS to work correctly
    with GNU diff to avoid other configuration problems.

    Configure will attempt to discern the location of your most capable
    version of diff, and tries to find the GNU Diffutils version first.
    You can explicitly tell configure to use the diffutils that's
    installed in the same place you intend to install CVS:

	$ ./configure --with-diffutils

    Or, if you've installed it somewhere else, you can give configure
    the full pathname:

	$ ./configure --with-diffutils=/usr/gnu/bin/diff

    Configure will also try to find a version of grep that supports the
    '-s' option, and tries to find the GNU Grep version first.  You can
    similarly tell it where to find GNU Grep:

	$ ./configure --with-gnugrep
	$ ./configure --with-gnugrep=/usr/gnu/bin/grep

    If you are using the remote client, you will need a version of patch
    which understands unidiffs (such as any recent version of GNU
    patch).  Configure does not yet check to see if you've got this, so
    be careful!

    NOTE: The configure program will cache the results of the previous
    configure execution.  If you need to re-run configure from scratch, you
    may need to run "make distclean" first to remove the cached
    configuration information.

    Try './configure --help' for further information on its usage.

    NOTE ON CVS's USE OF NDBM:

	By default, CVS uses some built-in ndbm emulation code to allow
	CVS to work in a heterogeneous environment.  However, if you have
	a very large modules database, this may not work well.  You will
	need to edit src/options.h to turn off the MY_NDBM #define and
	re-run configure.  If you do this, the following comments apply.
	If not, you may safely skip these comments.

	If you configure CVS to use the real ndbm(3) libraries and
	you do not have them installed in a "normal" place, you will
	probably want to get the GNU version of ndbm (gdbm) and install
	that before running the CVS configure script.  Be aware that the
	GDBM 1.5 release does NOT install the <ndbm.h> header file included
	with the release automatically.  You may have to install it by hand.

	If you configure CVS to use the ndbm(3) libraries, you cannot
	compile CVS with GNU cc (gcc) on Sun-4 SPARC systems.  However, gcc
	2.0 may have fixed this limitation if -fpcc-struct-return is
	defined.  When using gcc on other systems to compile CVS, you *may*
	need to specify the -fpcc-struct-return option to gcc (you will
	*know* you have to if "cvs checkout" core dumps in some ndbm
	function).  You can do this as follows:

	    $ CC='gcc -fpcc-struct-return' ./configure

	for sh, bash, and ksh users and:

	    % setenv CC 'gcc -fpcc-struct-return'
	    % ./configure

	for csh and tcsh users.

    END OF NOTE FOR NDBM GUNK.

2)  Edit src/options.h.  Appropriate things to look at may be the
    invocation locations of programs like DIFF, GREP, RM, and SORT.
    Also glance at the default values for the environment variables
    that CVS uses, in particular, the RCSBIN variable, which holds the
    path to where the RCS programs live on your system.  The
    likelihood is that you don't have to change anything here, except
    perhaps adding the -a option to DIFF if you are using GNU diff.

3)  Try to build it:

	$ make

    This will (hopefully) make the needed CVS binaries within the "src"
    directory.  If something fails for your system, using the "cvsbug"
    script submit your "config.status" file together with your host
    type, operating system and compiler information, make output, and
    anything else you think will be helpful.

    You may also wish to validate the correctness of the new binary by
    running the regression tests:

	$ make check

    Note that if your /bin/sh doesn't support shell functions, you'll
    have to try something like this, where "/bin/sh5" is replaced by the
    pathname of a shell which handles normal shell functions:

	$ make SHELL=/bin/sh5 check

    WARNING:  This test can take quite a while to run, esp. if your
    disks are slow or over-loaded.

    If you receive any un-expected output from the regression tests,
    using the "cvsbug" script please submit your "config.status" file,
    together with your host type, operating system and compiler
    information, the contents of /tmp/cvs-sanity/check.log, and any
    "make check" output.

4)  Install the binaries/documentation:

	$ make install

    Depending on your installation's configuration, you may need to be
    root to do this.

5)  Take a look at the CVS documentation.

	$ man cvs

    and

	$ info cvs  

    See what it can do for you, and if it fits your environment (or can
    possibly be made to fit your environment).  If things look good,
    continue on...

6)  Setup the master source repository.  Choose a directory with ample disk
    space available for source files.  This is where the RCS ",v" files
    will be stored.  Note that this should be some shared directory for your
    site.  It should probably be auto-mounted, if you're running NFS.

    Say you choose "/src/master" as the root of your source repository.
    Run the "cvsinit" script to help you set it up.  It will ask you to
    enter the path to your CVSROOT area.  You would enter /src/master in
    this example.

	$ ./cvsinit

    The cvsinit script will setup a reasonable CVSROOT area to start with.
    It is also valuable to folks who already have a CVSROOT area setup from
    using earlier releases of CVS.  It assumes that you have installed CVS
    already (step 4) and that the RCS programs (co and ci) are in your
    PATH.  There are many ways to customize CVS for your site.  Read the
    cvs(5) manual page when you get the chance.

7)  Have all users of the CVS system set the CVSROOT environment
    variable appropriately to reflect the placement of your source
    repository.  If the above example is used, the following commands
    can be placed in user's ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile file; or in the
    site-wide /etc/profile:

	CVSROOT=/src/master; export CVSROOT

    for sh/bash/ksh users, or place the following commands in the user's
    ~/.cshrc, ~/.login, or /etc/chsrc file:

	setenv CVSROOT /src/master

    for csh/tcsh users.  If these environment variables are not already set
    in your current shell, set them now (or source the login script you
    just edited).  You will need to have the CVSROOT environment variable
    set to continue on to the next step.

8)  It might be a good idea to jump right in and put the CVS distribution
    directly under CVS control.  From within the top-level directory of the
    CVS distribution (the one that contains this README file) do the
    following commands:

	$ make distclean
	$ cvs import -m 'CVS 1.6 distribution' cvs CVS CVS-1_6

9)  Having done step 8, one should be able to checkout a fresh copy of the
    CVS distribution and hack away at the sources with the following command:

	$ cd
	$ cvs checkout cvs

    This will make the directory "cvs" in your current directory and
    populate it with the appropriate CVS files and directories.

10) Remember to edit the modules file manually when sources are checked in
    with "cvs import" or "cvs add".  A copy of the modules file for editing
    can usually be retrieved with the "cvs checkout modules" command, and
    definitely with the "cvs checkout CVSROOT" command.  See cvs(5).

11) Read the NEWS file to see what's new.

12) Hack away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed information about your interaction with "configure":

The "configure" script and its interaction with its options and the
environment is described here.  For more detailed documentation about
"configure", please refer to the GNU Autoconf documentation.

Supported options are:

	--srcdir=DIR		Useful for compiling on many different
				machines sharing one source tree.
	--prefix=DIR		The root of where to install the
				various pieces of CVS (/usr/local).
	--exec_prefix=DIR	If you want executables in a
				host-dependent place and shared
				things in a host-independent place.
	--with-diffutils[=PATH]	Assume use of GNU diffutils is possible.
	--with-gnugrep[=PATH]	Assume use of GNU grep is possible.

The following environment variables override configure's default
behaviour:

	CC			If not set, tries to use gcc first,
				then cc.  Also tries to use "-g -O"
				as options, backing down to -g
				alone if that doesn't work.
	INSTALL			If not set, tries to use "install", then
				"./install-sh" as a final choice.
	RANLIB			If not set, tries to determine if "ranlib"
				is available, choosing "echo" if it doesn't
				appear to be.
	YACC			If not set, tries to determine if "bison"
				is available, choosing "yacc" if it doesn't
				appear to be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation under Windows NT:

You may find interesting information in windows-NT/README.

1) Using Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.1, open the project `cvsnt.mak',
   in the top directory of the CVS distribution.
2) Choose "Build cvs.exe" from the "Project" menu.
3) MSVC will place the executable file cvs.exe in WinDebug, or whatever
   your target directory is.
