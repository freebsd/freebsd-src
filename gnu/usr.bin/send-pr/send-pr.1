.SH DESCRIPTION
.B send-pr
is a tool used to submit 
.I problem reports 
.\" SITE ADMINISTRATORS - change this if you use a local default
(PRs) to a central support site.  In most cases the correct 
.I site
will be the default.  This argument indicates the support site which
is responsible for the category of problem involved.  Some sites may
use a local address as a default.  
.I site
values are defined by using the 
.BR aliases (5).
.LP
.B send-pr
invokes an editor on a problem report template (after trying to fill
in some fields with reasonable default values).  When you exit the
editor,
.B send-pr 
sends the completed form to the
.I Problem Report Management System
(\fBGNATS\fR) at a central support site.  At the support site, the PR
is assigned a unique number and is stored in the \fBGNATS\fR database
according to its category and submitter-id.  \fBGNATS\fR automatically
replies with an acknowledgement, citing the category and the PR
number.
.LP
To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should contain
one of the available \fIcategories\fR to identify the
problem area.  (Use
.B `send-pr -L'
to see a list of categories.)
.LP
The more precise your problem description and the more complete your
information, the faster your support team can solve your problems.
.LP
.B send-pr
depends on a correctly configured mail submission system to work correctly.
If, for any reason, sending mail is not working, problem reports can be
submitted over the web, through:
.IP
.I http://www.freebsd.org/send-pr.html
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-f " problem-report"
specify a file (\fIproblem-report\fR) which already contains a
complete problem report.
.B send-pr
sends the contents of the file without invoking the editor.  If 
the value for 
.I problem-report
is
.BR `\|\-\|' ,
then
.B send-pr
reads from standard input.
.TP
.BI \-s " severity"
Give the problem report the severity
.IR severity .
.TP
.BI \-t " mail-address"
Change mail address at the support site for problem reports.  The
default 
.I mail-address
is the address used for the default 
.IR site .  
Use the
.I site
argument rather than this option in nearly all cases.
.TP
.BI \-c " address"
Put
.I address
in the 
.B Cc:
header of the message.
.TP
.BI \-a " file"
Copy the specified
.I file
into the
.B Fix:
section.
Binary files are uuencoded.
.TP
.B \-P
print the form specified by the environment variable 
.B PR_FORM 
on standard output.  If 
.B PR_FORM
is not set, print the standard blank PR template.  No mail is sent.
.TP
.B \-L
print the list of available categories.  No mail is sent.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the 
.B send-pr
version number.
This may also be specified as
.B \-\-version.
.LP
Note: use
.B send-pr
to submit problem reports rather than mailing them directly.  Using
both the template and
.B send-pr
itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach the
support site.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable 
.B EDITOR
specifies the editor to invoke on the template.
.br
default:
.B vi
.sp
If the environment variable
.B MAIL_AGENT
is set, its value is used as the path + command line arguments of the
executable to be invoked for sending the problem report (which will be
provided via standard input).
.br
This can be useful if you either use a MTA other than sendmail or need
to provide additional parameters, such as the envelope sender on
machines without a valid FQDN.
.br
Default value:
.B /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t
.sp
If the environment variable 
.B PR_FORM
is set, then its value is used as the file name of the template for
your problem-report editing session.  You can use this to start with a
partially completed form (for example, a form with the identification
fields already completed).
.SH "HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT"
Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that a program can
easily manage them.  Please remember the following guidelines:
.IP \(bu 3m 
describe only 
.B one problem
with each problem report.
.IP \(bu 3m
For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one in the automatic
acknowledgement. It consists of category, PR number and the original synopsis
line.  This allows the support site to relate several mail messages to a
particular PR and to record them automatically.
.IP \(bu 3m 
Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject and/or synopsis line.
.IP \(bu 3m 
The subject and the synopsis line are not confidential.  This is
because open-bugs lists are compiled from them.  Avoid confidential
information there.
.LP
See the GNU 
.B Info 
file
.B send-pr.info
or the document \fIReporting Problems With send-pr\fR\ for detailed
information on reporting problems
.SH "HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC."
Submit small code samples with the PR.  Contact the support site for
instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic source
code.
.SH FILES
.ta \w'/tmp/pbad$$  'u
/tmp/p$$	copy of PR used in editing session
