.TH hotspot.d 1m  "$Date:: 2007-08-05 #$" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
hotspot.d \- print disk event by location. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hotspot.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
hotspot.d is a simple DTrace script to determine if disk activity is 
occuring in the one place - a "hotspot". This helps us understand the 
system's usage of a disk, it does not imply that the existance or not 
of a hotspot is good or bad (often may be good, less seeking).

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
