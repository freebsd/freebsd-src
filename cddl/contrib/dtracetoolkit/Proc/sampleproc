# sampleproc - sample processes on the CPUs.
#              Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05).
#
# This program samples which process is on each CPU, at a particular
# configurable rate. This can be used as an estimate for which process
# is consuming the most CPU time.

# FIELDS:

### Usage
function usage
{
        cat <<-END >&2
	USAGE: sampleproc [hertz]
	   eg,
	       sampleproc               # defaults to 100 hertz
	       sampleproc 1000          # 1000 hertz
	END
	exit 1
}

### Process arguments
if (( $# == 0 )); then
        hertz=100
elif (( $# == 1 )); then
	hertz=$1
	if [[ "$hertz" = *[a-zA-Z]* ]]; then
		print "ERROR2: $hertz hertz is invalid." >&2
		exit 2
	fi
	if (( hertz > 5000 )); then
		print "ERROR3: $hertz hertz is too fast (max 5000)." >&2
		exit 3
	fi
	if (( hertz < 1 )); then
		print "ERROR4: $hertz hertz is too low (min 1)." >&2
		exit 4
	fi
else
	usage
fi

### Run DTrace
/usr/sbin/dtrace -n '
 #pragma D option quiet

 dtrace:::BEGIN
 {
	printf("Sampling at %d hertz... Hit Ctrl-C to end.\n",$1);
	self->start = timestamp;
 }

 profile:::profile-$1
 {
	@Proc[pid, execname] = count();
	@BigProc[pid, execname] = sum(1000); /* dont ask */
 }

 dtrace:::END
 {
	this->end = timestamp;

	printf("%5s %-20s %10s\n", "PID", "CMD", "COUNT");
	printa("%5d %-20s %10@d\n", @Proc);

	normalize(@BigProc, 
	    ((`ncpus_online * $1 * (this->end - self->start))/100000000));
	printf("\n%5s %-20s %10s\n", "PID", "CMD", "PERCENT");
