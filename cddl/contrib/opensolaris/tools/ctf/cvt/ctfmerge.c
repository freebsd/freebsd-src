/*
 * Given several files containing CTF data, merge and uniquify that data into
 * a single CTF section in an output file.
 *
 * Merges can proceed independently.  As such, we perform the merges in parallel
 * using a worker thread model.  A given glob of CTF data (either all of the CTF
 * data from a single input file, or the result of one or more merges) can only
 * be involved in a single merge at any given time, so the process decreases in
 * parallelism, especially towards the end, as more and more files are
 * consolidated, finally resulting in a single merge of two large CTF graphs.
 * Unfortunately, the last merge is also the slowest, as the two graphs being
 * merged are each the product of merges of half of the input files.
 *
 * The algorithm consists of two phases, described in detail below.  The first
 * phase entails the merging of CTF data in groups of eight.  The second phase
 * takes the results of Phase I, and merges them two at a time.  This disparity
 * is due to an observation that the merge time increases at least quadratically
 * with the size of the CTF data being merged.  As such, merges of CTF graphs
 * newly read from input files are much faster than merges of CTF graphs that
 * are themselves the results of prior merges.
 *
 * A further complication is the need to ensure the repeatability of CTF merges.
 * That is, a merge should produce the same output every time, given the same
 * input.  In both phases, this consistency requirement is met by imposing an
 * ordering on the merge process, thus ensuring that a given set of input files
 * are merged in the same order every time.
 *
 *   Phase I
 *
 *   The main thread reads the input files one by one, transforming the CTF
 *   data they contain into tdata structures.  When a given file has been read
 *   and parsed, it is placed on the work queue for retrieval by worker threads.
 *
 *   Central to Phase I is the Work In Progress (wip) array, which is used to
 *   merge batches of files in a predictable order.  Files are read by the main
 *   thread, and are merged into wip array elements in round-robin order.  When
 *   the number of files merged into a given array slot equals the batch size,
 *   the merged CTF graph in that array is added to the done slot in order by
 *   array slot.
 *
 *   For example, consider a case where we have five input files, a batch size
 *   of two, a wip array size of two, and two worker threads (T1 and T2).
 *
 *    1. The wip array elements are assigned initial batch numbers 0 and 1.
 *    2. T1 reads an input file from the input queue (wq_queue).  This is the
 *       first input file, so it is placed into wip[0].  The second file is
 *       similarly read and placed into wip[1].  The wip array slots now contain
 *       one file each (wip_nmerged == 1).
 *    3. T1 reads the third input file, which it merges into wip[0].  The
 *       number of files in wip[0] is equal to the batch size.
 *    4. T2 reads the fourth input file, which it merges into wip[1].  wip[1]
 *       is now full too.
 *    5. T2 attempts to place the contents of wip[1] on the done queue
 *       (wq_done_queue), but it can't, since the batch ID for wip[1] is 1.
 *       Batch 0 needs to be on the done queue before batch 1 can be added, so
 *       T2 blocks on wip[1]'s cv.
 *    6. T1 attempts to place the contents of wip[0] on the done queue, and
 *       succeeds, updating wq_lastdonebatch to 0.  It clears wip[0], and sets
 *       its batch ID to 2.  T1 then signals wip[1]'s cv to awaken T2.
 *    7. T2 wakes up, notices that wq_lastdonebatch is 0, which means that
 *       batch 1 can now be added.  It adds wip[1] to the done queue, clears
 *       wip[1], and sets its batch ID to 3.  It signals wip[0]'s cv, and
 *       restarts.
 *
 *   The above process continues until all input files have been consumed.  At
 *   this point, a pair of barriers are used to allow a single thread to move
 *   any partial batches from the wip array to the done array in batch ID order.
 *   When this is complete, wq_done_queue is moved to wq_queue, and Phase II
 *   begins.
 *
 *	Locking Semantics (Phase I)
 *
 *	The input queue (wq_queue) and the done queue (wq_done_queue) are
 *	protected by separate mutexes - wq_queue_lock and wq_done_queue.  wip
 *	array slots are protected by their own mutexes, which must be grabbed
 *	before releasing the input queue lock.  The wip array lock is dropped
 *	when the thread restarts the loop.  If the array slot was full, the
 *	array lock will be held while the slot contents are added to the done
 *	queue.  The done queue lock is used to protect the wip slot cv's.
 *
 *	The pow number is protected by the queue lock.  The master batch ID
 *	and last completed batch (wq_lastdonebatch) counters are protected *in
 *	Phase I* by the done queue lock.
 *
 *   Phase II
 *
 *   When Phase II begins, the queue consists of the merged batches from the
 *   first phase.  Assume we have five batches:
 *
 *	Q:	a b c d e
 *
 *   Using the same batch ID mechanism we used in Phase I, but without the wip
 *   array, worker threads remove two entries at a time from the beginning of
 *   the queue.  These two entries are merged, and are added back to the tail
 *   of the queue, as follows:
 *
 *	Q:	a b c d e	# start
 *	Q:	c d e ab	# a, b removed, merged, added to end
 *	Q:	e ab cd		# c, d removed, merged, added to end
 *	Q:	cd eab		# e, ab removed, merged, added to end
 *	Q:	cdeab		# cd, eab removed, merged, added to end
 *
 *   When one entry remains on the queue, with no merges outstanding, Phase II
 *   finishes.  We pre-determine the stopping point by pre-calculating the
 *   number of nodes that will appear on the list.  In the example above, the
 *   number (wq_ninqueue) is 9.  When ninqueue is 1, we conclude Phase II by
 *   signaling the main thread via wq_done_cv.
 *
 *	Locking Semantics (Phase II)
 *
 *	The queue (wq_queue), ninqueue, and the master batch ID and last
 *	completed batch counters are protected by wq_queue_lock.  The done
 *	queue and corresponding lock are unused in Phase II as is the wip array.
 *
 *   Uniquification
 *
 *   We want the CTF data that goes into a given module to be as small as
 *   possible.  For example, we don't want it to contain any type data that may
 *   be present in another common module.  As such, after creating the master
 *   tdata_t for a given module, we can, if requested by the user, uniquify it
 *   against the tdata_t from another module (genunix in the case of the SunOS
 *   kernel).  We perform a merge between the tdata_t for this module and the
 *   tdata_t from genunix.  Nodes found in this module that are not present in
 *   genunix are added to a third tdata_t - the uniquified tdata_t.
 *
 *   Additive Merges
 *
 *   In some cases, for example if we are issuing a new version of a common
 *   module in a patch, we need to make sure that the CTF data already present
 *   in that module does not change.  Changes to this data would void the CTF
 *   data in any module that uniquified against the common module.  To preserve
 *   the existing data, we can perform what is known as an additive merge.  In
 *   this case, a final uniquification is performed against the CTF data in the
 *   previous version of the module.  The result will be the placement of new
 *   and changed data after the existing data, thus preserving the existing type
 *   ID space.
 *
 *   Saving the result
 *
 *   When the merges are complete, the resulting tdata_t is placed into the
 *   output file, replacing the .SUNW_ctf section (if any) already in that file.
 *
 * The person who changes the merging thread code in this file without updating
 * this comment will not live to see the stock hit five.
