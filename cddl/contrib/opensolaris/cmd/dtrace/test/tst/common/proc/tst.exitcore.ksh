# This script tests that the proc:::exit probe fires with the correct argument
# when the process core dumps.  The problematic bit here is making sure that
# a process _can_ dump core -- if core dumps are disabled on both a global
# and per-process basis, this test will fail.  Rather than having this test
# muck with coreadm(1M) settings, it will fail explicitly in this case and
# provide a hint as to the problem.  In general, machines should never be
# running with both per-process and global core dumps disabled -- so this
# should be a non-issue in practice.
#
# If this fails, the script will run indefinitely; it relies on the harness
# to time it out.
