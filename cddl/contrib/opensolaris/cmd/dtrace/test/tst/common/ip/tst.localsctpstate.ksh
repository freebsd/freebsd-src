# Test sctp:::state-change and sctp:::{send,receive} by connecting to
# the local discard service.
# A number of state transition events along with SCTP send and
# receive events for the message should result.
#
# This may fail due to:
#
# 1. A change to the ip stack breaking expected probe behavior,
#    which is the reason we are testing.
# 2. The lo0 interface missing or not up.
# 3. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
#    variables to be corrupted.
#
# This test performs a SCTP connection and checks that at least the
# following packet counts were traced:
#
# 7 x ip:::send (4 during the setup, 3 during the teardown)
# 7 x sctp:::send (4 during the setup, 3 during the teardown)
# 7 x ip:::receive (4 during the setup, 3 during the teardown)
# 7 x sctp:::receive (4 during the setup, 3 during the teardown)
#
# The actual count tested is 7 each way, since we are tracing both
# source and destination events.
