	 * The temporary file/file descriptor usage is a little tricky here.
	 * 1:	We start off with two fd's, one for the master password
	 *	file (used to lock everything), and one for a temporary file.
	 * 2:	Display() gets an fp for the temporary file, and copies the
	 *	user's information into it.  It then gives the temporary file
	 *	to the user and closes the fp, closing the underlying fd.
	 * 3:	The user edits the temporary file some number of times.
	 * 4:	Verify() gets an fp for the temporary file, and verifies the
	 *	contents.  It can't use an fp derived from the step #2 fd,
	 *	because the user's editor may have created a new instance of
	 *	the file.  Once the file is verified, its contents are stored
	 *	in a password structure.  The verify routine closes the fp,
	 *	closing the underlying fd.
	 * 5:	Delete the temporary file.
	 * 6:	Get a new temporary file/fd.  Pw_copy() gets an fp for it
	 *	file and copies the master password file into it, replacing
	 *	the user record with a new one.  We can't use the first
	 *	temporary file for this because it was owned by the user.
	 *	Pw_copy() closes its fp, flushing the data and closing the
	 *	underlying file descriptor.  We can't close the master
	 *	password fp, or we'd lose the lock.
	 * 7:	Call pw_fastmkdb() (which renames the temporary file) and exit.
	 *	The exit closes the master passwd fp/fd.
