/*
 * Binary search for "string" in memory between "front" and "back".
 *
 * This routine is expected to return a pointer to the start of a line at
 * *or before* the first word matching "string".  Relaxing the constraint
 * this way simplifies the algorithm.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * 	front points to the beginning of a line at or before the first
 *	matching string.
 *
 * 	back points to the beginning of a line at or after the first
 *	matching line.
 *
 * Base of the Invariants.
 * 	front = NULL;
 *	back = EOF;
 *
 * Advancing the Invariants:
 *
 * 	p = first newline after halfway point from front to back.
 *
 * 	If the string at "p" is not greater than the string to match,
 *	p is the new front.  Otherwise it is the new back.
 *
 * Termination:
 *
 * 	The definition of the routine allows it return at any point,
 *	since front is always at or before the line to print.
 *
 * 	In fact, it returns when the chosen "p" equals "back".  This
 *	implies that there exists a string is least half as long as
 *	(back - front), which in turn implies that a linear search will
 *	be no more expensive than the cost of simply printing a string or two.
 *
 * 	Trying to continue with binary search at this point would be
 *	more trouble than it's worth.
