#	USAGE: connect-ppp <host>
#
#	Set up a PPP link to host. 
#
#	This script locks the tty so that faxd and uucp will not
#	interfere. If you are running with faxd as you "getty" then
#	faxd will remove the lock once it notices that pppd is gone.
#	This is the reason for pppd running in with the -detach flag, 
#	and you probably would run this script in the background.
#
#	I had to create the nodropdtr option to pppd in order to be
#	able to do what the script is doing here. Pathces has been
#	sent to the respective people, but I don't know if they like
#	them :-).
#
# 	Look for comments with <LOCAL> in the string. They identify 
#	things that you want to set for your system

#<LOCAL> define whatever your config file is.

# Do the actual work in a subshell so that we can turn off tostop and set
# the tty speed before chat dials. The second reason for doing in like
# is that if you aren't running BIDIR, and you are running faxd, clocal
# doesn't get turned on from pppd so chat will never work if you exec 
# it from within pppd. I found that I needed to run uucp with the
# HAVE_CLOCAL_BUG flag set to 1 in order to get it to work in conjunction
# with faxd. Anyway, this setup seem to work.
