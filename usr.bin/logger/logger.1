.Sh NAME
.Nm logger
.Nd make entries in the system log
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46Ais
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl H Ar hostname
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl P Ar port
.Op Fl p Ar pri
.Op Fl S Ar addr Ns \&: Ns Ar port
.Op Fl t Ar tag
.Op Ar message ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a shell command interface to the
.Xr syslog 3
system log module.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 4
Force
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Force
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl A
By default,
.Nm
tries to send the message to only one address,
even if the host has more than one A or AAAA record.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
tries to send the message to all addresses.
.It Fl i
Log the process id of the logger process
with each line.
This flag is ignored and the process id is always logged.
See also
.Fl t .
.It Fl s
Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.
.It Fl f Ar file
Read the contents of the specified file into syslog.
This option is ignored when a message is also specified.
.It Fl H Ar hostname
Set the hostname in the header of the message to specified value.
If not specified, host part of
.Xr gethostname 3
will be used.
.It Fl h Ar host
Send the message to the remote system
.Ar host
instead of logging it locally.
Note that
.Nm
currently supports
.Li AF_INET
.Pq IPv4 ,
.Li AF_INET6
.Pq IPv6 ,
and
.Li AF_LOCAL
.Pq Unix-domain socket
address families.
The following address formats are valid in
.Ar host :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "AF_LOCAL" -compact
.It Li AF_INET
192.168.2.1
.It Li AF_INET6
2001:db8::1
.It Li AF_LOCAL
.Pa /var/run/log
.El
.It Fl P Ar port
Send the message to the specified
.Ar port
number on a remote system,
which can be specified as a service name
or as a decimal number.
The default is
.Dq Li syslog .
If an unknown service name is used,
.Nm
prints a warning and falls back to port 514.
.It Fl p Ar pri
Enter the message with the specified priority.
The priority may be specified numerically or as a
.Li facility.level
pair.
For example,
.Dq Fl p Li local3.info
logs the message(s) as
.Ar info Ns rmational
level in the
.Ar local3
facility.
The default is
.Dq Li user.notice .
.It Fl S Ar addr Ns \&: Ns Ar port
Specify source address and/or source port when using
.Fl h
option.
The same address will be used for all of the remote addresses
when
.Fl A
flag is enabled.
Note that a numeric IPv6 address in
.Ar addr
must be enclosed with
.Dq \&[
and
.Dq \&] .
.It Fl t Ar tag
Mark every line in the log with the specified
.Ar tag
rather than the default of current login name.
Use
.Fl t Ar tag[N]
to insert specific decimal process id instead of id of
.Nm .
.It Ar message
Write the message to log; if not specified, and the
.Fl f
flag is not
provided, standard input is logged.
.El

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
