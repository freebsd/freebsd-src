.Sh NAME
.Nm mt
.Nd magnetic tape manipulating program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar tapename
.Ar command
.Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mt
is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.
By default
.Nm
performs the requested operation once.  Operations
may be performed multiple times by specifying
.Ar count  .
Note
that
.Ar tapename
must reference a raw (not block) tape device.
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.  Only as many
characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
.Bl -tag -width "eof, weof"
.It Cm weof
Write
.Ar count
end-of-file marks at the current position on the tape.
.It Cm fsf
Forward space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm fsr
Forward space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm bsf
Back space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm bsr
Back space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm rewind
Rewind the tape
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm offline , rewoffl
Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm erase
Erase the tape
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm retension
Re-tension the tape
(one full wind forth and back, Count is ignored).
.It Cm status
Print status information about the tape unit.
.It Cm blocksize
Set the block size for the tape unit.  Zero means variable-length
blocks.
.It Cm density
Set the density for the tape unit.  For the density codes, see below.
The density value could be given either numerically, or as a string,
corresponding to the
.Dq Reference
field.  If the string is abbreviated, it will be resolved in the order
shown in the table, and the first matching entry will be used.  If the
given string and the resulting canonical density name do not match
exactly, an informational message is printed about what the given
string has been taken for.
.It Cm eom
Forward space to end of recorded medium
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm comp
Set compression mode.
(Not yet implemented.)
.El
.Pp
If a tape name is not specified, and the environment variable
.Ev TAPE
does not exist;
.Nm
uses the device
.Pa /dev/nrst0 .
.Pp
.Nm Mt
returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful,
1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.
.Pp
The different density codes are as follows:
.Pp
.Dl 0x0	default for device
.Dl 0xE	reserved for ECMA
