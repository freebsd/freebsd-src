.Sh NAME
.Nm cpasswd
.Nd scramble passwords for csup authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar clientName
.Ar serverName
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates scrambled passwords for the
.Nm CVSup
server's authentication database.  It is invoked with a client name
and a server name.
.Ar ClientName
is the name the client uses to gain access to the
server.  By convention, e-mail addresses are used for all client
names, e.g.,
.Ql BillyJoe@FreeBSD.org .
Client names are case-insensitive.
.Pp 
.Ar ServerName
is the name of the
.Nm CVSup
server which the client wishes to access.  By convention,
it is the canonical fully-qualified domain name of the server, e.g.,
.Ql CVSup.FreeBSD.ORG .
This must agree with the server's own idea of its name.  The name is
case-insensitive.
.Pp
To set up authentication for a given server, one must perform the
following steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
Obtain the official
.Ar serverName
from the administrator of the server or from some other source.
.It
Choose an appropriate
.Ar clientName .
It should be in the form of a valid e-mail address, to make it easy
for the server administrator to contact the user if necessary.
.It
Choose an arbitrary secret
.Ar password .
.It
Run
.Nm cpasswd ,
and type in the
.Ar password
when prompted for it.  The utility will print out a line to send
to the server administrator, and instruct you how to modify your
.Li $ Ns Ev HOME Ns Pa /.csup/auth
file.  You should use a secure channel to send the line to the
server administrator.
.El
.Pp
Since
.Li $ Ns Ev HOME Ns Pa /.csup/auth
contains passwords, you should ensure that it is not readable by
anyone except yourself.
