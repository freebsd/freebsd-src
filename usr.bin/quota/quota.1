.Nm quota
.Nd display disk usage and limits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ghlu
.Op Fl f Ar path
.Op Fl v | q | r
.Nm
.Op Fl hlu
.Op Fl f Ar path
.Op Fl v | q | r
.Ar user ...
.Nm

.Ar group ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
Disk block usage and limits are shown in 1024-byte blocks.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar path
Only display quota information for the file system
that contains the specified path.
This can be any file within a mounted file system.
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group
of which the user is a member.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte.
.It Fl l
Do not report quotas on
.Tn NFS
file systems.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on file systems where usage is over quota.
The
.Fl q
flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.It Fl r
Display the raw quota information as it appears in the quota structure.
Non-zero time values will also be displayed in
.Xr ctime 3
format.
This option implies
.Fl v
and will override the
.Fl q
flag.
.It Fl u
Print the user quotas.
This is the default unless
.Fl g
is specified.
.It Fl v
Display quotas on file systems
where no storage is allocated.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
displays both the user quotas and the group quotas (for
the user).
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl u
flag and the optional
.Ar user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the
.Fl g
flag and optional
.Ar group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility tries to report the quotas of all mounted file systems.
If the file system is mounted via
.Tn NFS ,
it will attempt to contact the
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
daemon on the
.Tn NFS
server.
For
.Tn UFS
file systems, quotas must be turned on in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If
.Nm
exits with a non-zero status, one or more file systems
are over quota or the path specified with the
.Fl f
option does not exist.
.Pp
If the
.Fl l
flag is specified,
.Nm
will not check
.Tn NFS
file systems.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user
located at the file system root with user quotas
.It Pa quota.group
located at the file system root with group quotas
.It Pa /etc/fstab
to find file system names and locations
