The
.Nm
utility checks whether each of the specified
.Ar pathname
arguments is valid or portable.
.Pp
A diagnostic message is written for each argument that:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Is longer than
.Dv PATH_MAX
bytes.
.It
Contains any component longer than
.Dv NAME_MAX
bytes.
(The value of
.Dv NAME_MAX
depends on the underlying file system.)
.It
Contains a directory component that is not searchable.
.El
.Pp
It is not considered an error if a
.Ar pathname
argument contains a nonexistent component as long as a component by that
name could be created.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Perform portability checks on the specified
.Ar pathname
arguments.
Diagnostic messages will be written for each argument that:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Is longer than
.Dv _POSIX_PATH_MAX
.Pq 255
bytes.
.It
Contains a component longer than
.Dv _POSIX_NAME_MAX
.Pq 14
bytes.
.It
Contains any character not in the portable filename character set (that is,
alphanumeric characters,

.Ql _ ) .
No component may start with the hyphen
.Pq Ql \&-
character.
