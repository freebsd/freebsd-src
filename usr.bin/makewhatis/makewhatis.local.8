.Os FreeBSD 2.2
.Sh NAME
.Nm makewhatis.local , catman.local
.Nd start makewhatis for local file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/libexec/makewhatis.local
.Op options
.Ar directories ...
.Nm /usr/libexec/catman.local
.Op options
.Ar directories ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION 
.Nm
start 
.Xr makewhatis 1
only for file systems physically mounted on the system
where the 
.Nm
is being executed. Running makewhatis
from 
.Pa /etc/weekly 
for rw nfs-mounted /usr may kill
your NFS server -- all NFS clients start makewhatis at the same time!
So use this wrapper for 
.Xr cron 8
instead of calling makewhatis directly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/weekly.XXX -compact
.It Pa /etc/weekly 
run
.Nm
every week
