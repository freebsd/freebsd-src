This is release 2.4 of flex.  See "version.h" for the exact patch-level.

See the file "NEWS" to find out what is new in this Flex release.

Read the file "INSTALL" for general installation directives.  Peek near
the beginning of the file "Makefile.in" for special DEFS values.  On most
systems, you can just run the "configure" script and type "make" to build
flex; then "make check" to test whether it built correctly; and if it did,
then "make install" to install it.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can also issue "make bigcheck" (be
prepared to wait a while).

Note that flex is distributed under a copyright very similar to that of
BSD Unix, and not under the GNU General Public License (GPL), except for
the "configure" script, which is covered by the GPL.

Many thanks to the 2.4 pre-testers for finding a bunch of bugs and helping
increase/test portability: Francois Pinard, Nathan Zelle, Gavin Nicol,
Chris Thewalt, and Matthew Jacob.
