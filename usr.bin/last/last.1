.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Last
will list the sessions of specified
.Ar users ,
.Ar ttys ,
and
.Ar hosts ,
in reverse time order.  Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.  If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown,
.Nm last
will so indicate.

lines.
.It Fl t Ar tty

.Pp
If
multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g.,
.Dq Li "last root -t console"
would list all of
.Dq Li root Ns 's
sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal. If no
users, hostnames or terminals are specified,
.Nm last
prints a record of
all logins and logouts.
.Pp

.Ar reboot
logs in at reboots of the system, thus
.Dq Li last reboot
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

If
.Nm last
is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal
.Nm last
indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.
