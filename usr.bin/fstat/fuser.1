.Sh NAME
.Nm fuser
.Nd list IDs of all processes that have one or more files open
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cfkmu
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl s Ar signal
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes to stdout the PIDs of processes that have one or
more named files open.
For block and character special devices, all processes using files
on that device are listed.
A file is considered open by a process if it was explicitly opened,
is the working directory, root directory, jail root directory,
active executable text, kernel trace file or the controlling terminal
of the process.
If
.Fl m
option is specified, the
.Nm
utility will also look through mmapped files.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Treat files as mount points and report on any files open in the file system.
.It Fl f
The report must be only for named files.
.It Fl k
Send signal to reported processes
.Pq Dv SIGKILL No by default .
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl m
Search through mmapped files too.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default,
which is the kernel image the system has booted from.
.It Fl s Ar signal
Use given signal name instead of default
.Dv SIGKILL .
.It Fl u
Write the user name associated with each process to stderr.
.El
.Pp
The following symbols, written to stderr will indicate how files are used:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Sy a
The file is open as append only
.Pq Dv O_APPEND No was specified .
.It Sy c
The file is the current workdir directory of the process.
.It Sy d
The process bypasses fs cache while writing to this file
.Pq Dv O_DIRECT No was specified .
.It Sy e
Exclusive lock is hold.
.It Sy j
The file is the jail root of the process.
.It Sy m
The file is mmapped.
.It Sy r
The file is the root directory of the process.
.It Sy s
Shared lock is hold.
.It Sy t
The file is the kernel tracing file for the process.
.It Sy w
The file is open for writing.
.It Sy x
The file is executable text of the process.
.It Sy y
The process uses this file as its controlling tty.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Ql "fuser -fu \&."
writes to standard output the process IDs of processes that are using the
current directory and writes to stderr an indication of how those processes are
using the directory and user names associated with the processes that are using
this directory.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to conform to
.St -p1003.1-2004 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page was written by
.An Stanislav Sedov Aq Mt stas@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Nm
takes a snapshot of the system, it is only correct for a very short period
of time.
When working via
.Xr kvm 3
interface the report will be limited to filesystems the
.Nm
utility knows about (currently only cd9660, devfs, nfs, ntfs, nwfs, udf,
ufs and zfs).
