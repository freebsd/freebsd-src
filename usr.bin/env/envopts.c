/**
 * Routine to split a string into multiple parameters, while recognizing a
 * few special characters.  It recognizes both single and double-quoted
 * strings.  This processing is designed entirely for the benefit of the
 * parsing of "#!"-lines (aka "shebang" lines == the first line of an
 * executable script).  Different operating systems parse that line in very
 * different ways, and this split-on-spaces processing is meant to provide
 * ways to specify arbitrary arguments on that line, no matter how the OS
 * parses it.
 *
 * Within a single-quoted string, the two characters "\'" are treated as
 * a literal "'" character to add to the string, and "\\" are treated as
 * a literal "\" character to add.  Other than that, all characters are
 * copied until the processing gets to a terminating "'".
 *
 * Within a double-quoted string, many more "\"-style escape sequences
 * are recognized, mostly copied from what is recognized in the `printf'
 * command.  Some OS's will not allow a literal blank character to be
 * included in the one argument that they recognize on a shebang-line,
 * so a few additional escape-sequences are defined to provide ways to
 * specify blanks.
 *
 * Within a double-quoted string "\_" is turned into a literal blank.
 * (Inside of a single-quoted string, the two characters are just copied)
 * Outside of a quoted string, "\_" is treated as both a blank, and the
 * end of the current argument.  So with a shelbang-line of:
 *		#!/usr/bin/env -SA=avalue\_perl
 * the -S value would be broken up into arguments "A=avalue" and "perl".
