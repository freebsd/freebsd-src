.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm env
.Op Fl i
.Op Ar name=value ...
.Oo
.Ar utility
.Op argument ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm env
executes
.Ar utility
after modifying the environment as
specified on the command line.  The option
.Ar name=value
specifies
an environmental variable,
.Ar name  ,
with a value of
.Ar value  .
The option
.Sq Fl i
causes
.Nm env
to completely ignore the environment
it inherits.
.Pp
If no 
.Ar utility
is specified,
.Nm env
prints out the names and values
of the variables in the environment, with one 
.Ar name=value 
pair per line.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the 
.Ar utility
is invoked, the exit status of 
.Nm env
shall be the exit status of
.Ar utility; 
otherwise, the
.Nm env
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
The 
.Nm env
utility completed successfully
.It 1-125
An error occurred in the
.Nm env
utility.
.It 126
The utility specified by
.Ar utility 
was found, but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The utility specified by

doesn't handle commands with equal
.Pq Dq =
signs in their
