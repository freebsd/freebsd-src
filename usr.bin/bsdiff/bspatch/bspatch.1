.Sh NAME
.Nm bspatch
.Nd apply a patch built with
.Xr bsdiff 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar oldfile newfile patchfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
generates
.Ar newfile
from
.Ar oldfile
and
.Ar patchfile
where
.Ar patchfile
is a binary patch built by
.Xr bsdiff 1 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
uses memory equal to the size of
.Ar oldfile
plus the size of
.Ar newfile ,
but can tolerate a very small working set without a dramatic loss
of performance.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not verify that
.Ar oldfile
is the correct source file for
.Ar patchfile .
Attempting to apply a patch to the wrong file will usually produce
garbage; consequently it is strongly recommended that users of
.Nm
verify that
.Ar oldfile
matches the source file from which
.Ar patchfile
was built, by comparing cryptographic hashes, for example.
Users may also wish to verify after running
.Nm
that
.Ar newfile
matches the target file from which
.Ar patchfile
was built.
