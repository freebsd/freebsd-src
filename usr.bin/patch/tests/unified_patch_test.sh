# This test is motivated by long-standing bugs that occasionally slip by in
# commits.  If a file is created by a diff, patch(1) will happily duplicate the
# contents as many times as you apply the diff.  It should instead detect that
# a source of /dev/null creates the file, so it shouldn't exist.  Furthermore,
# the reverse of creation is deletion -- hence the next test, which ensures that
# the file is removed if it's empty once the patch is reversed.  The size checks
# are scattered throughout to make sure that we didn't get some kind of false
# error, and the first size check is merely a sanity check that should be
# trivially true as this is executed in a sandbox.
