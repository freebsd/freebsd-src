.Nm
.Op Fl abCHIijnPqSTtuvwz
.Op Fl d Ar count
.Op Fl J Ar jail
.Op Fl m Ar cpu | io
.Op Fl o Ar field
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl s Ar time
.Op Fl U Ar username
.Op Ar number
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the top
processes on the system and periodically updates this information.
If standard output is an intelligent terminal (see below) then
as many processes as will fit on the terminal screen are displayed
by default.
Otherwise, a good number of them are shown (around 20).
Raw cpu percentage is used to rank the processes.
If
.Ar number
is given, then the top
.Ar number
processes will be displayed instead of the default.
.Pp
.Nm
makes a distinction between terminals that support advanced capabilities
and those that do not.
This distinction affects the choice of defaults for certain options.
In the remainder of this document, an
.Dq intelligent
terminal is one that
supports cursor addressing, clear screen, and clear to end of line.
Conversely, a
.Dq dumb
terminal is one that does not support such
features.
If the output of
.Nm
is redirected to a file, it acts as if it were being run on a dumb
terminal.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display command names derived from the argv[] vector, rather than real
executable name.
It it useful when you want to watch applications, that
puts their status information there.
If the real name differs from argv[0],
it will be displayed in parenthesis.
Non-printable characters in the command line are
encoded in C-style backslash sequences or
a three digit octal sequences.
.It Fl b
Use
.Dq batch
mode.
In this mode, all input from the terminal is
ignored.
Interrupt characters (such as ^C and ^\e) still have an effect.
This is the default on a dumb terminal, or when the output is not a terminal.
.It Fl C
Toggle CPU display mode.
By default top displays the weighted CPU percentage in the WCPU column
(this is the same value that
.Xr ps 1
displays as CPU).
Each time
.Fl C
flag is passed it toggles between
.Dq raw cpu
mode and
.Dq weighted cpu
mode, showing the
.Dq CPU
or the
.Dq WCPU
column respectively.
.It Fl d Ar count
Show only
.Ar count
displays, then exit.
A display is considered to be one update of the
screen.
The default is 1 for dumb terminals.
Note that for
.Ar count
= 1
no information is available about the percentage of time spent by the CPU in every state.
.It Fl H
Display each thread for a multithreaded process individually.
By default a single summary line is displayed for each process.
.It Fl I
Do not display idle processes.
By default, top displays both active and idle processes.
.It Fl i
Use
.Dq interactive
mode.
In this mode, any input is immediately
read for processing.
See the section on
.Dq Interactive Mode
for an explanation of
which keys perform what functions.
After the command is processed, the
screen will immediately be updated, even if the command was not
understood.
This mode is the default when standard output is an
intelligent terminal.
.It Fl J Ar jail
Show only those processes owned by
.Ar jail .
This may be either the
.Ar jid
or
.Ar name
of the jail.
Use
0
to limit to host processes.
Using this option implies
.Fl j .
.It Fl j
Display the
.Xr jail 8
ID.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Display statistics in the specified
.Ar mode .
Available modes are
.Cm cpu
and
.Cm io .
Default is
.Cm cpu .
.It Fl n
Use
.Dq non-interactive
mode.
This is identical to
.Dq batch
mode.
.It Fl o Ar field
Sort the process display area on the specified field.
The field name
is the name of the column as seen in the output, but in lower case:
.Dq cpu ,
.Dq size ,
.Dq res ,
.Dq time ,
.Dq pri ,
.Dq threads ,
.Dq total ,
.Dq read ,
.Dq write ,
.Dq fault ,
.Dq vcsw ,
.Dq ivcsw ,
.Dq jid ,
.Dq swap ,
or
.Dq pid .
.It Fl P
Display per-cpu CPU usage statistics.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Show only the process
.Ar pid .
.It Fl q
Renice
.Nm
to -20 so that it will run faster.
This can be used when the system is
being very sluggish to improve the possibility of discovering the problem.
This option can only be used by root.
.It Fl S
Show system processes in the display.
Normally, system processes such as the pager and the swapper are not shown.
This option makes them visible.
.It Fl s Ar time
Set the delay between screen updates to
.Ar time
seconds, which may be fractional.
The default delay between updates is 1 second.
.It Fl T
Toggle displaying thread ID (tid) instead of process id (pid).
.It Fl t
Do not display the
.Nm
process itself.
.It Fl U Ar username
Show only those processes owned by
.Ar username .
This option currently only accepts usernames and will not understand
uid numbers.
.It Fl u
Do not map uid numbers to usernames.
Normally,
.Nm
will read as much of the file
.Pa /etc/passwd
as is necessary to map
all the user id numbers it encounters into login names.
This option disables all that, while possibly decreasing execution time.
The uid numbers are displayed instead of the names.
.It Fl v
Write version number information to stderr then exit immediately.
.It Fl w
Display approximate swap usage for each process.
.It Fl z
Do not display the system idle process.
.El
.Pp
Both
.Ar count
and
.Ar number
fields can be specified as
.Dq infinite ,
indicating that they can
stretch as far as possible.
This is accomplished by using any proper
prefix of the keywords
.Dq infinity ,
.Dq maximum ,
or
.Dq all .
Boolean flags are toggles.
A second specification of any of these options will negate the first.
.Sh INTERACTIVE MODE
When
.Nm
is running in
.Dq interactive mode ,
it reads commands from the
terminal and acts upon them accordingly.
In this mode, the terminal is
put in
.Dq CBREAK ,
so that a character will be
processed as soon as it is typed.
Almost always, a key will be
pressed when
.Nm
is between displays; that is, while it is waiting for
.Ar time
seconds to elapse.
If this is the case, the command will be
processed and the display will be updated immediately thereafter
.Pq reflecting any changes that the command may have specified .
This happens even if the command was incorrect.
If a key is pressed while
.Nm
is in the middle of updating the display, it will finish the update and
then process the command.
Some commands require additional information,
and the user will be prompted accordingly.
While typing this information
in, the user's erase and kill keys (as set up by the command
.Xr stty 1 )
are recognized, and a newline terminates the input.
.Pp
The bindings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic space

.It Ic /
Filter by command name.
Prompt for
.Ar string
or
.Ql Ic +
to show all processes.

respectively.
.It Ic w
Toggle display of swap usage.
.It Ic z
Toggle display of the system idle process.
.El
.Sh "THE DISPLAY"
The top few lines of the display show general information
about the state of the system, including
the last process id assigned to a process (on most systems),
the three load averages,
the current time,
the number of existing processes,
the number of processes in each state
(sleeping, running, starting, zombies, and stopped),
and a percentage of time spent in each of the processor states
(user, nice, system, and idle).
It also includes information about physical and virtual memory allocation.
.Pp
The remainder of the screen displays information about individual
processes.
This display is similar in spirit to
.Xr ps 1
but it is not exactly the same.
PID is the process id,
JID, when displayed, is the
.Xr jail 8
ID corresponding to the process,
USERNAME is the name of the process's owner (if
.Fl u
is specified, a UID column will be substituted for USERNAME),
PRI is the current priority of the process,
NICE is the
.Xr nice 1
amount,
SIZE is the total size of the process (text, data, and stack),
RES is the current amount of resident memory,
SWAP is the approximate amount of swap, if enabled
(SIZE, RES and SWAP are given in kilobytes),
STATE is the current state (one of
.Dq START ,
.Dq RUN
(shown as
.Dq CPUn
on SMP systems),
.Dq SLEEP ,
.Dq STOP ,
.Dq ZOMB ,
.Dq WAIT ,
.Dq LOCK ,
or the event on which the process waits),
C is the processor number on which the process is executing
(visible only on SMP systems),
TIME is the number of system and user cpu seconds that the process has used,
WCPU, when displayed, is the weighted cpu percentage (this is the same
value that
.Xr ps 1
displays as CPU),
CPU is the raw percentage and is the field that is sorted to determine
the order of the processes, and
COMMAND is the name of the command that the process is currently running
(if the process is swapped out, this column is marked
.Dq <swapped> ) .
.Pp
If a process is in the
.Dq SLEEP
or
.Dq LOCK
state,
the state column will report the name of the event or lock on which the
process is waiting.
Lock names are prefixed with an asterisk
.Dq *
while sleep events
are not.

The command name for swapped processes should be tracked down, but this
would make the program run slower.

As with
.Xr ps 1 ,
things can change while
.Nm
is collecting information for an update.
The picture it gives is only a close approximation to reality.
