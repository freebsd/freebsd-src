.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Ar host ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command produces output similar to

.Ar host Ns s
or all machines on the local
network.
For each
.Ar host
responding to the
.Nm
query,
the hostname with the names of the users currently logged
on is printed on each line.
The
.Nm
command will wait for
one minute to catch late responders.

The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Print all machines responding even if no one is currently logged in.
.It Fl l
Print a long format listing.
This includes the user name, host name,
tty that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user
logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard,
and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).
