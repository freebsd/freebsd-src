# Setup the environment for run_test
# - run_test looks for `#define YYBTYACC` in ../config.h
# - run_test assumes a yacc binary exists in ../yacc instead of running "yacc"
# - run_test spams the test dir with files (polluting subsequent test runs),
#   so it's better to copy all the files to a temporary directory created by
#   kyua
