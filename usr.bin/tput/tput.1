.Sh NAME
.Nm tput ,
.Nm clear
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Nm clear
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.  When invoked as the
.Nm clear
utility, the screen will be cleared as if
.Dl tput clear
had been executed.
The options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as specified in the
.Xr termcap
database, for example,
.Dq vt100
or
.Dq xterm .
If not specified,
.Nm
retrieves the
.Dq Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
command outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string; a number if it is of type integer.
Otherwise,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
without further action.
.Pp
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type string, and takes arguments (e.g. cursor movement,
the termcap
.Dq cm
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr termcap
.Dq cl
sequence).
.It init
Initialize the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
.Dq is
sequence).
.It longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It reset
Reset the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
.Dq rs
sequence).
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.Nm
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer,
.Nm
exits 0 if the attribute is defined for this terminal type and 1
if it is not.
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has this attribute, and 1 if it does not.
The
.Nm
command exits 2 if any error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr termcap 3 ,
.Xr termcap 5
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
.Pp
Some termcap entries depend upon having a
.Sq %
in them that is just a
.Sq %
and nothing more.  Right now we just warn about them if they don't
have a valid type declaration.  These warnings are sent to
stderr.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
