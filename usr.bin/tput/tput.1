.Sh NAME
.Nm tput
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tput
makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as specified in the
.Xr termcap
database, for example, ``vt100'' or ``xterm''.
If not specified,
.Nm tput
retrieves the
.Dq Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Tput
outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string; a number if it is of type integer.
Otherwise,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability and 1 if it does not,
without further action.
.Pp
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type string, and takes arguments (e.g. cursor movement,
the termcap
.Dq cm
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr termcap
``cl'' sequence).
.It init
Initialize the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
``is'' sequence).
.It longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It reset
Reset the terminal (the
.Xr termcap
``rs'' sequence).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.Nm tput
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the attribute is defined for this terminal type and 1
if it is not.
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm tput
exits 0 if the terminal has this attribute, and 1 if it does not.
.Nm Tput
exits 2 if any error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr termcap 3 ,
.Xr termcap 5
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Tput
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
.Pp
Some termcap entries depend upon having a
.Sq %
in them that is just a
.Sq %
and nothing more.  Right now we just warn about them if they don't
have a valid type declaration.  These warnings are sent to
stderr.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
