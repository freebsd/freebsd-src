.Nd display disk usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl A
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Op Fl a | s | d Ar depth | Fl t Ar threshold
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl h | k | m | B Ar blocksize

.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the file system block usage for each file argument
and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Display the apparent size instead of the disk usage.
This can be helpful when operating on compressed volumes or sparse files.
.It Fl B Ar blocksize
Calculate block counts in
.Ar blocksize
byte blocks.
This is different from the
.Fl k, m
options or setting
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
and gives an estimate of how much space the examined file hierarchy would
require on a filesystem with the given
.Ar blocksize .
Unless in
.Fl A
mode,
.Ar blocksize
is rounded up to the next multiple of 512.
.It Fl H
Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links in file
hierarchies are not followed.
.It Fl L
Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are followed.
.It Fl I Ar mask
Ignore files and directories matching the specified
.Ar mask .
.It Fl P
No symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl a
Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte.
.It Fl r
Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
that cannot be opened, and so on.
This is the default case.
This option exists solely for conformance with
.St -xpg4 .
.It Fl s
Display an entry for each specified file.
(Equivalent to
.Fl d Li 0 )
.It Fl t Ar threshold
Display only entries for which size exceeds
.Ar threshold .
If
.Ar threshold
is negative, display only entries for which size is less than the absolute
value of
.Ar threshold .
.It Fl d Ar depth
Display an entry for all files and directories
.Ar depth
directories deep.
.It Fl c
Display a grand total.
.It Fl k
Display block counts in 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks.
.It Fl l
If a file has multiple hard links, count its size many times.
The default behavior of
.Nm
is to count files with multiple hard links only once.
When the
.Fl l
option is specified, the hard link checks are disabled, and these files
are counted (and displayed) as many times as they are found.
.It Fl m
Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks.
.It Fl n
Ignore files and directories with user
.Dq nodump
flag
.Pq Dv UF_NODUMP
set.
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they
reference unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified.
If either the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are
followed is not counted or displayed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k, m
or
.Fl h
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of
that block size.
If
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is not set, and the
.Fl k, m
or
.Fl h
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in 512-byte
blocks.
