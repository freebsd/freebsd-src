.Dt SHAR 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm shar
.Nd create a shell archive of files
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
.Nm
is obsolete and may not be present in
.Fx 15
and later.
Because shell archives are simultaneously data and code and are typically
interpreted by
.Xr sh 1 ,
they can easily be trojan-horsed and pose a significant security risk to users.
The
.Xr tar 1
utility can still produce shar encodings of files if needed.
The
.Pa sysutils/freebsd-shar
port has been created to maintain this version of
.Nm
past its deprecation in base.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command writes a
.Xr sh 1
shell script to the standard output which will recreate the file
hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the
files they contain (the
.Xr find 1
utility does this correctly).
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally used for distributing files by
.Xr ftp 1
or
.Xr mail 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr ls 1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd ls
shar `find . -print` \&| mail -s "ls source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir ls
cd ls
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
sh archive
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr tar 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
magic characters.
The
.Nm
command cannot handle files without a newline ('\\n')
as the last character.
.Pp
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh 1 .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm
may be easily examined with the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
egrep -av '^[X#]' shar.file
.Ed
