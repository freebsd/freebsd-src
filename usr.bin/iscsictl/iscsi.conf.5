.It Cm AuthMethod
Sets the authentication type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar None ,
or
.Qq Ar CHAP .
Default is
.Qq Ar None .
When set to
.Cm CHAP ,
both
.Cm chapIName
and
.Cm chapSecret
must be defined.
.It Cm chapIName
Login for CHAP authentication.
.It Cm chapSecret
Secret for CHAP authentication.
.It Cm tgtChapName
Target login for Mutual CHAP authentication.
.It Cm tgtChapSecret
Target secret for Mutual CHAP authentication.
.It Cm HeaderDigest
Sets the header digest; a checksum calculated over the header of iSCSI
PDUs, and verified on receive.
Digest can be either
.Qq Ar None ,
or
.Qq Ar CRC32C .
Default is
.Qq Ar None .
.It Cm DataDigest
Sets the data digest; a checksum calculated over the Data Section of iSCSI
PDUs, and verified on receive.
Digest can be either
.Qq Ar None ,
or
.Qq Ar CRC32C .
Default is
.Qq Ar None .
.It Cm InitiatorName
Sets the initiator name.
By default, the name is concatenation of
.Qq Ar iqn.1994-09.org.freebsd:
with the hostname.
.It Cm TargetName
Sets the target name.
Not required for discovery sessions.
.It Cm TargetAddress
Sets the target address and port, in
.Sy address[:port]
format.
The
.Sy address
can be either an IP address, or hostname.
The optional port defaults to 3260.
.It Cm SessionType
Sets the session type.
Type can be either
.Qq Ar Discovery ,
or
.Qq Ar Normal .
Default is
.Qq Ar Normal .
For normal sessions, the
.Sy TargetName
must be defined.
Discovery sessions result in the initiator connecting to all the targets
returned by SendTargets iSCSI discovery with the defined
.Sy TargetAddress .
.It Cm Enable
Enable or disable the session.
State can be either
.Qq Ar On ,
or
.Qq Ar Off .
Default is
.Qq Ar On .
.It Cm Offload
Name of selected iSCSI hardware offload driver.

.Qq Ar None .
.It Cm Protocol
Name of selected protocol.
It can be either
.Qq Ar iSER ,
for iSCSI over RDMA, or
.Qq Ar iSCSI .
Default is
.Qq Ar iSCSI .
.It Cm dscp
The DiffServ Codepoint used for sending data.
The DSCP can be set to numeric, or hexadecimal values directly,
as well as the well-defined
.Qq Ar cs<n>
and
.Qq Ar af<xx>
codepoints.
Default is no specified dscp codepoint, which means the default
of the outgoing interface is used.
.It Cm pcp
The 802.1Q Priority CodePoint used for sending packets.
The PCP can be set to a value in the range between
.Qq Ar 0
to
.Qq Ar 7 .
When omitted, the default for the outgoing interface is used.
.It Cm PingTimeout
Specify the time in seconds to wait between pings (SCSI NOP), and
for a ping response before declaring the session as dead and
attempting a re-establishment.
If this entry is not present in the conf file, the default value
configured using
.Qq Ar kern.iscsi.ping_timeout
(default at
.Qq Ar 5
seconds) is taken by the driver.
If present, the PingTimeout can be set to any positive value
starting with
.Qq Ar 1 .
.It Cm LoginTimeout
Specify the time in seconds to wait for a login PDU to be sent or
received after trying to establish a new session.
When no login PDU is received within this time, the login on a
particular connection fails and a new reconnection attempt is made.
If this entry is not present in the conf file, the default value of
.Qq Ar 60
seconds is used, as configured by
.Qq Ar kern.iscsi.login_timeout .
The LoginTimeout can be set to any positive value starting with
.Qq Ar 1 .
