.Sh NAME
.Nm progress
.Nd feed input to a command, displaying a progress bar
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ez
.Op Fl b Ar buffersize
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ar cmd
.Op Ar args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens a pipe to
.Ar cmd
and feeds an input stream into it, while displaying a progress bar to
standard output.
If no filename is specified,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
Where feasible,
.Nm
.Xr fstat 2 Ns s
the input to determine the length, so a time estimate can be calculated.
.Pp
If no length is specified or determined,
.Nm
simply displays a count of the data and the data rate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XlXlengthXX
.It Fl b Ar buffersize
Read in buffers of the specified size (default 64k).
An optional suffix (per
.Xr strsuftoll 3 )
may be given.
.It Fl e
Display progress to standard error instead of standard output.
.It Fl f Ar file
Read from the specified
.Ar file
instead of standard input.
.It Fl l Ar length
Use the specified length for the time estimate, rather than attempting to
.Xr fstat 2
the input.
An optional suffix (per
.Xr strsuftoll 3 )
may be given.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Print the given
.Dq prefix
text before (left of) the progress bar.
.It Fl z
Filter the input through
.Xr gunzip 1 .
If
.Fl f
is specified, calculate the length using
.Ic gzip -l .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Dl progress -zf file.tar.gz tar xf -
will extract the
.Pa file.tar.gz
displaying the progress bar as time passes:
.Bd -literal
  0% |                               |     0        0.00 KiB/s    --:-- ETA
 40% |********                       |   273 KiB  271.95 KiB/s    00:01 ETA
 81% |***********************        |   553 KiB  274.61 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
100% |*******************************|   680 KiB  264.59 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
.Ed
.Pp
If it is preferred to monitor the progress of the decompression
process (unlikely), then
.Dl progress -f file.tar.gz tar zxf -
could be used.
.Pp
The command
.Dl dd if=/dev/rwd0d ibs=64k | \e
.Dl progress -l 120g dd of=/dev/rwd1d obs=64k
will copy the 120 GiB disk
.Sy wd0
.Pa ( /dev/rwd0d )
to
.Sy wd1
.Pa ( /dev/rwd1d ) ,
displaying a progress bar during the operation.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.6.1 and
.Fx 15 .
The dynamic progress bar display code is part of
.Xr ftp 1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm

.An John Hawkinson
.Aq jhawk@NetBSD.org .
.Xr ftp 1 Ns 's
dynamic progress bar was written by Luke Mewburn.
.Sh BUGS
Since the progress bar is displayed asynchronously, it may be
difficult to read some error messages, both those produced by the
pipeline, as well as those produced by
.Nm
itself.
