 * soelim - a filter to process n/troff input eliminating .so's
 *
 * Author: Bill Joy UCB July 8, 1977
 *
 * This program eliminates .so's from a n/troff input stream.
 * It can be used to prepare safe input for submission to the
 * phototypesetter since the software supporting the operator
 * doesn't let him do chdir.
 *
 * This is a kludge and the operator should be given the
 * ability to do chdir.
 *
 * This program is more generally useful, it turns out, because
 * the program tbl doesn't understand ".so" directives.
