.Sh DESCRIPTION
Connections to a NetWare server can be created and used independently from
.Xr mount_nwfs 8
command. Connection can be created by any user. Each user can have multiple
connections, but NetWareServer:NetWareUser pair should be unique.
.Pp
The
.Nm ncplogin
command used to create permanent connection to a NetWare server. Permanent
connection will stay connected even if no applications use it. This allows
user to run different ncp* programs without specifying file server and user
to use. This connection can be destroyed by
.Xr ncplogout 1 
command.
.Pp
Upper case options described in this manual are common for other ncp* programs
and referred as
.Ar connection options.
Options
.Fl U
and
.Fl S
are mutually exclusive with
.Ar /server:user
syntax.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl S Ar server
name of NetWare server to connect. This affect only IPX severs for native IP
see 
.Fl A
option.
.It Fl U Ar user
name of user used in login sequence.
.It Fl A Ar host
use UDP protocol to connect to NetWare 5.x server specified by
.Ar host
parameter.
.It Fl C
don't convert password to uppercase.
.It Fl D
Marks connection as primary. Can be used to modify already established 
connection. Only
.Nm
program accept that option.
.It Fl I Ar signature_level
try to use
.Ar signature_level .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Value   Meaning
0	disable signatures
1	enable, use if server require them.
2	ask server for signing, but agree to work without.
3	signatures are required.
.Ed
Please note that only packet headers signing are implemented.
.It Fl M Ar mode
Just like files connections can be shared by users. The bits in
.Ar mode
argument behaves much like file permissions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Mask    Meaning
4	READ    - connection will be visible.
2	WRITE   - connection can be closed/modified
1	EXECUTE - user allowed to execute requests.
.Ed
By default connection created with mode 0700 and only owner can do
anything with it. If you want to share the connection, for example with group 
you may specify 0750 value. This means group can do NCP request, but can't
destroy connection. When user doesn't explicitly specify server to use, ncp*
programs try to find suitable connection in the next order:
.Pp
1. Try to find connection owned by user. If there is more than one such 
connection it try to figure out which is primary. Primary flag controlled
by
.Fl D
option.
.Pp
2. If previous fail, first shared connection will be used.
.It Fl N
don't ask for a password. While loading
.Nm
reads ~/.nwfsrc file to get additional configuration parameters and
password. If no password found for the specified SERVER:USER pair,
.Nm
prompts for it.
.It Fl O
Just like files, connection has 
.Ar owner and
.Ar group
attributes. Newly created connection takes
.Ar owner
parameter from creator's userid and
.Ar group
paramter
from creator's primary group.
This can be overrided with this option. Only superuser can override an
.Ar owner
parameter.
.It Fl P
Marks connection as permanent.
.Nm
always create permanent connection. This option can be used in other ncp*
programs.
.It Fl R Ar retry_count
specifies number of retries before drop the connection. The default value is 10.

Note: after connection marked 'BAD' each request will try to restore it.
This process restore only NCP connection, but do not reopen any opened files.
.It Fl W Ar timeout
This specifies server request timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
.It Ar /server:user
This syntax provided for the sake of simplicity and mutually exclusive with
.Fl S
and
.Fl U
options.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa ~/.nwfsrc
keeps static parameters for connections and other information. See
.Pa /usr/share/examples/nwclient/dot.nwfsrc
for details.

.Sh NOTES
Low level connection management performed by ncp.ko module. For an IPX
protocol it is also necessary to load IPXrouted program.
