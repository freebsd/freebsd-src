.Sh DESCRIPTION
Connections to a
.Tn NetWare
server can be created and used independently of the
.Xr mount_nwfs 8
command.
Connections can be created by any user.
Each user can have multiple
connections, but each NetWareServer:NetWareUser pair should be unique.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is used to create a permanent connection to a
.Tn NetWare
server.
Permanent connections will stay connected even if no applications use them.
This allows users to run different ncp* programs
without specifying a file server and user to use.
Established connections can be destroyed with the
.Xr ncplogout 1 
command.
.Pp
Upper case options described in this manual
are common for other ncp* programs and are referred to as
.Qq connection options .
Options
.Fl U
and
.Fl S
are mutually exclusive with the
.No / Ns Ar server Ns : Ns Ar user
syntax.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl S Ar server
Specify the name of the
.Tn NetWare server to connect to.
This affect only
.Tn IPX
servers.
For native
.Tn IP
servers, see the
.Fl A
option.
.It Fl U Ar user
Specify the name of the user used in the login sequence.
.It Fl A Ar host
Use the
.Tn UDP
protocol to connect to a
.Tn NetWare
5.x server specified by the
.Ar host
argument.
.It Fl C
Do not convert the password to uppercase.
.It Fl D
Mark the connection as primary.
The option can be used to modify existing connections.
Only the
.Nm
program accepts this option.
.It Fl I Ar signature_level
Try to use
.Ar signature_level .
Available values are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Value   Meaning
0	disable signatures
1	enable (use if required by server)
2	request but do not require signing
3	require signatures
.Ed
.Pp
Note that only packet header signing is implemented.
.It Fl M Ar mode
Share this connection.
The bits in the
.Ar mode
argument are similar to standard file permissions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Mask    Meaning
4	READ    - connection will be visible.
2	WRITE   - connection can be closed/modified
1	EXECUTE - user allowed to execute requests.
.Ed
.Pp
By default, the connection is created with
.Ar mode
0700
and only the owner can use it.
Specifying 0750 as the argument to the
.Fl M
option would allow read-only group access as well.
This would allow the group to perform
.Tn NCP
requests,
but not to destroy the connection.
When a server is not explicitly specified,
ncp* programs try to find a suitable connection in the following order:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Try to find a connection owned by the user.
If there is more than one such 
connection, try to determine which one is primary.
The primary flag is set with the
.Fl D
option.
.It
If the primary connection could not be determined,
the first shared connection will be used.
.El
.It Fl N
Do not prompt for a password.
At run time,
.Nm
reads the
.Pa ~/.nwfsrc
file for additional configuration parameters and a password.
If no password is found for the specified
.Ar server Ns : Ns Ar user
pair,
.Nm
prompts for it.
.It Fl O
Specify the
.Ar owner
and
.Ar group
attributes for the connection.
Newly created connections take the
.Ar owner
attribute from the creating user's username and the
.Ar group
attribute from the creating user's primary group.
This option overrides that behaviour.
Only the superuser can override the
.Ar owner
attribute for a connection.
.It Fl P
Mark the connection as permanent.
.Nm
always creates permanent connections.
This option can be used in other ncp*
programs.
.It Fl R Ar retry_count
Specify the number of retries to be performed
before dropping the connection.
The default value is 10.
.Pp
Note: after a connection is marked
.Sq BAD ,
each request will try to restore it.
This process restores only the
.Tn NCP
connection;
it does not reopen any files that were open
at the time that the connection was marked
.Sq BAD .
.It Fl W Ar timeout
Specify the server request timeout in seconds.
The default is 5 seconds.
.It / Ns Ar server Ns : Ns Ar user
This syntax is provided for the sake of simplicity
and is mutually exclusive with the
.Fl S
and
.Fl U
options.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Low level connection management is implemented in the
.Pa ncp.ko
module.
The
.Xr IPXrouted 8
program is also required for
.Tn IPX
support.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa ~/.nwfsrc
keeps static parameters for connections and other information
See
.Pa /usr/share/examples/nwclient/dot.nwfsrc
for details.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
