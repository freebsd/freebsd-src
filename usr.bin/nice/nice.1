.Sh NAME
.Nm nice
.Nd execute a utility with an altered scheduling priority
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nice
.Op Fl n Ar increment
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nice
runs
.Ar utility
at an altered scheduling priority.
If an 
.Ar increment 
is given, it is used; otherwise
an increment of 10 is assumed.
The super-user can run utilities with priorities higher than normal by using
a negative 
.Ar increment .
The priority can be adjusted over a
range of -20 (the higest) to 20 (the lowest).
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n Ar increment
A positive or negative decimal integer used to modify the system scheduling
priority of 
.Ar utility.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm nice
utility shall exit with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 1-125
An error occurred in the 
.Nm nice
utility.
.It 126
The 
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The 
.Ar utility
could not be found.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of 
.Nm nice
shall be that of 
.Ar utility .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The historic 
.Fl Ns Ar increment 
option has been deprecated but is still supported in this implementation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr renice 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm nice
utility conforms to 
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm nice
utility appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Nice
is built into
.Xr csh  1
with a slightly different syntax than described here.  The form
.Ql nice +10
nices to positive nice, and
.Ql nice \-10
can be used
by the super-user to give a process more of the processor.
