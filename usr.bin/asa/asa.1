character.
The following characters are interpreted as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Aq space"
.It Aq space
Output the rest of the line without change.

.Aq formfeed
character before printing the rest of the line.
.It \&+
The trailing

of the previous line is replaced by a
.Aq carriage-return
before printing the rest of the line.
.El
.Pp
Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if they
begin with
.Aq space .
