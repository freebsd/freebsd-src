#
# Change the path for builtin shells. There are two methods to do this.
# This is the first of them when the basename of the path is equal to
# one of the builtin shells so that the .SHELL target automatically
# also selectes the shell without specifying the name.
#
# Be sure to include a meta-character into the command line, so that
# really our shell is executed.
