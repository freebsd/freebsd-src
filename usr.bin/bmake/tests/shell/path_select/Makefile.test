# Change the path for builtin shells. There are two methods to do this.
# This is the second of them when both a path and a name are specified.
# This selects a builtin shell according to the name, but executes it
# from the specified path.
#
# Be sure to include a meta-character into the command line, so that
# really our shell is executed.
