.Sh NAME
.Nm numactl
.Nd "manage NUMA policy configuration"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l Ar policy
.Op Fl m Ar domain
.Op Fl c Ar domain
.Ar cmd ...
.Nm
.Fl g
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl t Ar tid
.Nm
.Fl s
.Op Fl l Ar policy
.Op Fl m Ar domain
.Op Fl c Ar domain
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl t Ar tid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be used to assign NUMA policies to processes/threads,
run commands with a given NUMA policy, and query information
about NUMA policies on running processes.
.Pp
.Nm
requires a target to modify or query.
The target may be specified as a command, process id or a thread id.
Using
.Fl -get
the target's NUMA policy may be queried.
Using
.Fl -set
the target's NUMA policy may be queried.
If no target is specified,
.Nm
operates on itself.
Not all combinations of operations and targets are supported.
For example,
you may not set the id of an existing set or query and launch a command
at the same time.
.Pp
Each process and thread has a NUMA policy.
By default the policy is NONE.
If a thread policy is NONE, then the policy will fall back to the process.
If the process policy is NONE, then the policy will fall back to the
system default.
The policy may be queried by using
.Fl -get.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl -cpudomain Ar domain"
.It Fl -cpudomain Ar domain , Fl c Ar domain
Set the given CPU scheduling policy.
Constrain the the object (tid, pid, command) to run on CPUs
that belong to the given domain.
.It Fl -get , Fl g
Retrieve the NUMA policy for the given thread or process id.
.It Fl -set , Fl s
Set the NUMA policy for the given thread or process id.
.It Fl -memdomain Ar domain , Fl m Ar domain
Constrain the object (tid, pid, command) to the given
domain.
This is only valid for fixed-domain and fixed-domain-rr.
It must not be set for other policies.
.It Fl -mempolicy Ar policy , Fl l Ar policy
Set the given memory allocation policy.
Valid policies are none, rr, fixed-domain, fixed-domain-rr,
first-touch, and first-touch-rr.
A memdomain argument is required for fixed-domain and
fixed-domain-rr.
.It Fl -pid Ar pid , Fl p Ar pid
Operate on the given pid.
.It Fl -tid Ar tid , Fl t Ar tid
Operate on the given tid.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a
.Pa /bin/sh
process with memory coming from domain 0, but
CPUs coming from domain 1:
.Dl numactl --mempolicy=fixed-domain --memdomain=0 --cpudomain=1 /bin/sh
.Pp
Query the NUMA policy for the
.Aq sh pid :
.Dl numactl --get --pid=<sh pid>
.Pp
Set the NUMA policy for the given TID to round-robin:
.Dl numactl --set --mempolicy=rr --tid=<tid>
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr numa 4

The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
