.Sh NAME
.Nm devmenu
.Nd present a menu of available devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lsdev
.Op Fl c Ar class
.Op Fl f Ar outfile
.Op Fl h Ar helpfile
.Op Fl t Ar title
.Op Fl nid
.Op Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program uses the
.Xr dialog 3
library to present a menu of available devices meeting some set of
criteria.  The list of devices is obtained using the
.Xr sysctl 3
device configuration database
.Pq Dq devconf ,
and intersected with the list of
.Ar name s
if one was specified on the command line.  The following command-line
flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width mhmhelpfile
.It Fl c Ar class
specifies a class of devices to further restrict the available
choices.  Multiple
.Fl c
options can be specified, in which case the union of the specified
classes is used.  The following classes are currently supported:
.Bl -tag -width parallel
.It Li cpu
a processor
.It Li bus
a system bus, or a peripheral bus
.It Li disk
a read-write disk drive
.It Li rodisk
a read-only disk drive (e.g., CD-ROM)
.It Li display
a display device (usually there is only one)
.It Li serial
a serial port or multiport controller
.It Li parallel
a parallel printer port
.It Li netif
a network interface
.It Li misc
everything else
.El
.Pp
.It Fl f Ar outfile
specifies the name a file where the name of the selected device is
written.  If no file is specified, the name is written on the standard
output.
.It Fl h Ar helpfile
can be used to specify the name of a file to be displayed when the
user presses the `?' key.
.It Fl t Ar title
specifies the title of the window passed to the
.Xr dialog 3
library when creating the menu.
.El
.Pp
In addition, there are three flags to request special menus with
unique prompt text and possibly pseudo-devices (but this is not yet
implemented).  These are:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl n
requests a menu of network interfaces
.It Fl i
requests a menu of possible installation media (i.e., disks, CD-ROMs,
and tapes)
.It Fl d
requests a menu of disks
