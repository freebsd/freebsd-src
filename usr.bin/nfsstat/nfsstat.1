.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsstat
.Nd display
.Tn NFS
statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -libxo
.Op Fl cdEemqszW
.Op Fl w Ar wait
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays statistics kept about
.Tn NFS
client and server activity.
For the NFSv4 server, the statistics are for operations within the Compound
RPCs and not the count of RPCs.
If you wish to compare RPC counts between NFSv3 and NFSv4, you must use
statistics in the client(s).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-w wait"
.It Fl c
Only display client side statistics.
.It Fl d
Display statistics for the NFS server that are similar to those
displayed by
.Xr iostat 8 .
This includes kilobytes per transfer, transfers per second, and megabytes per
second for read, write, and all operations.
It also includes the current queue depth, the busy percentage, and latency
for all operations.
If the
.Fl W
flag is added, commits per second, commit latency, read latency, and write
latency are also added to the display.
The busy percentage shown can exceed 100 at times.
This is because of the way busy percentages are calculated.
The busy time is calculated by adding the elapsed time between the
last time an operation started or finished,
and the current time.
If there is only one operation outstanding, the "busy time" time
will get updated with the total time of that operation.
That means that the difference in the busy time between the two
measurement intervals (often 1 second)
will increase by more than the measurement interval.
.It Fl e
Report the extra statistics collected by the NFS client and
server for NFSv4.
.It Fl E
Similar to
.Fl e
except that the statistics include NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.2 and the numbers aren't
clipped at one billion.
Only one of
.Fl e
or
.Fl E
can be specified.
.It Fl M
Deprecated and ignored.
.It Fl m
Report the mount options for all NFS client mounts.
This option overrides all others and
.Nm
will exit after completing the report.
.It Fl N
Deprecated and ignored.
.It Fl s
Only display server side statistics.
.It Fl W
Use wide format with interval short summary.
This option is especially
useful when combined with
.Fl c ,
.Fl d ,
or
.Fl s
and a time delay.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Display a shorter summary of
.Tn NFS
activity for both the client and server at
.Ar wait
second intervals.
.It Fl z
Reset statistics after displaying them.
.It Fl q
Do not print headers.
.It Fl -libxo
Generate output via
.Xr libxo 3
in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.
See
.Xr xo_options 7
for details on command line arguments.
