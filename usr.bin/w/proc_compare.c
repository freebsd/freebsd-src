/*
 * Returns 1 if p2 is "better" than p1
 *
 * The algorithm for picking the "interesting" process is thus:
 *
 *	1) Only foreground processes are eligible - implied.
 *	2) Runnable processes are favored over anything else.  The runner
 *	   with the highest cpu utilization is picked (p_estcpu).  Ties are
 *	   broken by picking the highest pid.
 *	3) The sleeper with the shortest sleep time is next.  With ties,
 *	   we pick out just "short-term" sleepers (TDF_SINTR == 0).
 *	4) Further ties are broken by picking the highest pid.
 *
 * If you change this, be sure to consider making the change in the kernel
 * too (^T in kern/tty.c).
 *
 * TODO - consider whether pctcpu should be used.
