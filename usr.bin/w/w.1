.Sh NAME
.Nm w
.Nd "display who is logged in and what they are doing"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -libxo
.Op Fl dhin
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints a summary of the current activity on the system,
including what each user is doing.
The first line displays the current time of day, how long the system has
been running, the number of users logged into the system, and the load
averages.
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged
over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
.Pp
The fields output are the user's login name, the name of the terminal the
user is on, the host from which the user is logged in, the time the user
logged on, the time since the user last typed anything,
and the name and arguments of the current process.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -libxo
Generate output via
.Xr libxo 3
in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.
See
.Xr xo_options 7
for details on command line arguments.
.It Fl d
dumps out the entire process list on a per controlling
tty basis, instead of just the top level process.
.It Fl h
Suppress the heading.
.It Fl i
Output is sorted by idle time.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
core instead of the default
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
default
.Pa /boot/kernel/kernel .
.It Fl n
Do not attempt to resolve network addresses (normally
.Nm
interprets addresses and attempts to display them as names).
When
.Fl n
is specified more than once, hostnames stored in utmp are attempted to
resolve to display them as network addresses.
.El
.Pp
If one or more
.Ar user
names are specified, the output is restricted to those users.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/run/utx.active" -compact
.It Pa /var/run/utx.active
list of users on the system
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Show global activity of the system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

USER       TTY      FROM            LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT
fernape    v0       -               7:30PM     - tmux: client (/tmp/tmux-1001/default) (tmux)

fernape    pts/0    tmux(1391).%0   8:04PM     - w
.Ed
.Pp
Show the entire process list per tty:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ w -d
 8:12PM  up 42 mins, 3 users, load averages: 0.01, 0.11, 0.17
USER       TTY      FROM            LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT
                1199      login [pam] (login)

                1507      tmux: client (/tmp/tmux-1001/default) (tmux)
fernape    v0       -               7:30PM     - tmux: client (/tmp/tmux-1001/default) (tmux)

                1510      -bash (bash)
                1515      w -d
fernape    pts/0    tmux(1509).%0   8:11PM     - w -d
.Ed
.Pp
Same as above but only for the root user and omitting the heading:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ w -d -h root
		1183      login [pam] (login)
		1204      -bash (bash)
root       v1       -       7:15PM     - -bash (bash)

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The notion of the
.Dq current process
is muddy.
The current algorithm is
.Do
the highest numbered process on the terminal
that is not ignoring interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered
process on the terminal
.Dc .
This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs like the shell
and editor, or when faulty programs running in the background fork and fail
to ignore interrupts.
(In cases where no process can be found,
.Nm
prints
.Ql \- . )
.Pp
The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves a background
process running after logging out, the person currently on that terminal is
.Dq charged
with the time.
.Pp
Background processes are not shown, even though they account for
much of the load on the system.
.Pp
Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are printed with
null or garbaged arguments.
In these cases, the name of the command is printed in parentheses.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not know about the new conventions for detection of background
jobs.
It will sometimes find a background job instead of the right one.
