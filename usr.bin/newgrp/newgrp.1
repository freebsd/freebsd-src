Otherwise, the real, effective and supplementary group IDs are restored to
those from the current user's password database entry.

were successfully changed.

Group passwords are inherently insecure as there is no way to stop
users obtaining the password hash from the group database.
Their use is discouraged.
Instead, users should simply be added to the necessary groups.
