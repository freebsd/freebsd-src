.Sh NAME
.Nm zforce
.Nd force gzip files to have a .gz suffix
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zforce
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility renames

files to have a

suffix, so that
.Xr gzip 1
will not compress them twice.
This can be useful if file names were truncated during a file transfer.
Files that have an existing
.Sq .gz ,
.Sq -gz ,
.Sq _gz ,
.Sq .tgz
or
.Sq .taz
suffix, or that have not been compressed by
.Xr gzip 1 ,
are ignored.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gzip 1
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
overwrites existing files without warning.
