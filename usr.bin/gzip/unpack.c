 * pack(1) file format:
 *
 * The first 7 bytes is the header:
 *	00, 01 - Signature (US, RS), we already validated it earlier.
 *	02..05 - Uncompressed size
 *	    06 - Level for the huffman tree (<=24)
 *
 * pack(1) will then store symbols (leaf) nodes count in each huffman
 * tree levels, each level would consume 1 byte (See [1]).
 *
 * After the symbol count table, there is the symbol table, storing
 * symbols represented by corresponding leaf node.  EOB is not being
 * explicitly transmitted (not necessary anyway) in the symbol table.
 *
 * Compressed data goes after the symbol table.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * [1] If we count EOB into the symbols, that would mean that we will
 * have at most 256 symbols in the huffman tree.  pack(1) rejects empty
 * file and files that just repeats one character, which means that we
 * will have at least 2 symbols.  Therefore, pack(1) would reduce the
 * last level symbol count by 2 which makes it a number in
 * range [0..254], so all levels' symbol count would fit into 1 byte.
