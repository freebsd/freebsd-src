.Sh NAME
.Nm zmore ,
.Nm zless
.Nd view compressed files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zmore
.Op Ar flags
.Op Ar
.Nm zless
.Op Ar flags
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter that allows the viewing of files compressed with Lempel-Ziv
encoding.
Such files generally have a
.Dq Z
or
.Dq gz
extension (both the
.Xr compress 1
and
.Xr gzip 1
formats are supported).
Any
.Ar flags
that are specified are passed to the user's preferred
.Ev PAGER
(which is
.Pa /usr/bin/more
by default).
.Pp
.Nm zless
is equivalent to
.Nm zmore
but uses
.Xr less 1
as a pager instead of
.Xr more 1 .
.Pp
When multiple files are specified,
.Nm
will pause at the end of each file and present the following prompt to the user:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prev_file (END) - Next: next_file
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sy prev_file
is the file that was just displayed and
.Sy next_file
is the next file to be displayed.
The following keys are recognized at the prompt:
.Bl -tag -width "e or q" -offset indent
.It Ic e No or Ic q
quit
.Nm zmore .
.It Ic s
skip the next file (or exit if the next file is the last).
.El
.Pp
If no files are specified,
.Nm
will read from the standard input.
In this mode
.Nm
will assume
.Xr gzip 1
style compression since there is no suffix on which to make a decision.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PAGER"
.It Ev PAGER
Program used to display files.
If unset,
.Pa /usr/bin/more
is used
.Pq Nm zmore
or

.Pq Nm zless .
