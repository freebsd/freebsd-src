 * mode.c - mechanisms for dealing with SGI-style modal displays.
 *
 * There are four generally-understood useful modes for status displays
 * of the sort exemplified by the IRIX ``netstat -C'' and ``osview''
 * programs.  We try to follow their example, although the user interface
 * and terminology slightly differ.
 *
 * RATE - the default mode - displays the precise rate of change in
 * each statistic in units per second, regardless of the actual display
 * update interval.
 *
 * DELTA - displays the change in each statistic over the entire
 * display update interval (i.e., RATE * interval).
 *
 * SINCE - displays the total change in each statistic since the module
 * was last initialized or reset.
 *
 * ABSOLUTE - displays the current value of each statistic.
 *
 * In the SGI programs, these modes are selected by the single-character
 * commands D, W, N, and A.  In systat, they are the slightly-harder-to-type
 * ``mode delta'', etc.  The initial value for SINCE mode is initialized
 * when the module is first started and can be reset using the ``reset''
 * command (as opposed to the SGI way where changing modes implicitly
 * resets).  A ``mode'' command with no arguments displays the current
 * mode in the command line.
