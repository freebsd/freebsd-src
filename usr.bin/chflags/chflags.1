.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar flags
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl R
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.El
.Pp
The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list
of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width "opaque" -compact
.It Ar arch
set the archived flag (super-user only)
.It Ar opaque
set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
.It Ar nodump
set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
.It Ar sappnd
set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
.It Ar schg
set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
.It Ar sunlnk
set the system undeletable flag (super-user only)
.It Ar uappnd
set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
.It Ar uchg
set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
.It Ar uunlnk
set the user undeletable flag (owner or super-user only)
.It Ar archived , sappend , schange , Xo
.Ar simmutable , uappend , uchange , uimmutable ,
.Ar sunlink , uunlink
.Xc
aliases for the above
.El
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq Ar no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width "nouchg"
.It Ar nouchg
the immutable bit should be cleared
.El
.Pp
Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is set,
.Nm
on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
You can use "ls -lo" to see the flags of existing files.
