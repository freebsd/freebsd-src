.Sh NAME
.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chflags
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar flags
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.El
.Pp
The flags are specified as an octal number or a comma separated list
of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
arch	set the archived flag (super-user only)
opaque	set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
nodump	set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
sunlnk	set the system undeletable flag (super-user only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
uunlnk	set the user undeletable flag (owner or super-user only)
archived, sappend, schange, simmutable, uappend, uchange, uimmutable,
sunlink, uunlink
	aliases for the above
.Ed
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
nouchg	the immutable bit should be cleared
.Ed
.Pp
Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is set,
.Nm
on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
You can use "ls -lo" to see the flags of existing files.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ls 1 ,
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr symlink 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
