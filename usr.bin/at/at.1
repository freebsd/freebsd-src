.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch
utilities read commands from the standard input or a specified file
which are to be executed at a later time, using
.Xr sh 1 .
.Pp
The functions of the commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Nm at
Executes commands at a specified time.
.It Nm atq
Lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is
the superuser.  In that case, everybody's jobs are
listed.
.It Nm atrm
Deletes jobs.
.It Nm batch
executes commands when system load levels  permit.
In other words, it executes the commands when the load
average drops below a specified level.
.El
.Pp
For both
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch ,
the working directory, environment (except for the variables
.Nm TERM ,
.Nm TERMCAP ,
.Nm DISPLAY ,
and
.Nm _ )
and the umask are retained from the time of invocation.  The user
will be mailed the standard output and standard error from
his commands if any output is generated.  If
.Nm at
is executed from a
.Xr su 1
shell, the owner of the login whell will receive the mail.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
The available options are as follows:
.It Fl q Ar queue
Use the specified queue.  A queue designation consists
of a single letter; valid queue designation range from
.Ar a
to
.Ar l .
The
.Ar a
queue is the default, and
.Ar b
is the batch queue.  Queues with higher letters run with
increased niceness.  If
.Nm atq
is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending
in that queue.
.It Fl m
Send mail to the user when the job has completed, even if
there was no output.
.It Fl f Ar file
Reads the job from
.Ar file
rather than the standard input.
.It Fl v
Shows completed but not yet deleted jobs in the queue.
.Sh TIME SPECIFICATION
.Nm At
allows some moderately complex time specifications.
It accepts times of the form
.Ar HHMM
or
.Ar HH:MM
to run a job at a specific time of day.  If
that time is already passed, the next day is assumed.
You may also specify
.Nm midnight ,
.Nm noon ,
or
.Nm teatime
(4PM) and you can give a time of day suffixed with
.Nm AM
or
.Nm PM
for running in the morning or the evening.  You can
also specify the date on which the job will be run
by giving a date in the form
.Ar month-name day
with an optional
.Ar year ,
or giving a date of the form
.Ar MMDDYY ,
.Ar MM/DD/YY
or
.Ar DD.MM.YY .
You can also give times like
.Nm now +
.Ar count time-units ,
where the time units can be
.Nm minutes, hours, days,
or
.Nm weeks
You can suffix the time with
.Nm today
to run the job today, or
.Nm tomorrow
to run the job tomorrow.
.Pp
For example, to run a job at 4PM three days from now, you
would specify a time of
.Nm 4PM + 3 days .
To run a job at 10:00AM on on July 31, you would specify
a time of
.Nm 10AM Jul 31 .
Finally, to run a job at 1AM tomorrow, you would specify
a time of
.Nm 1AM tomorrow .

.Sh BUGS
Traditional access control to
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch
via the files
.Pa /var/at/at.allow
and
.Pa /var/at/at.deny
is not implemented.
.Pp
If the file
.Pa /var/run/utmp
is not available or corrupted, or if the user is not
logged in at the time
.Nm at
is invoked, the mail is sent to the userid found in the
environment variable
.Nm LOGNAME .
If that is undefined or empty, the current userid is assumed.
