.Sh NAME
.Nm sockstat
.Nd list open sockets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46clu
.Op Fl p Ar ports
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command lists open Internet or
.Ux
domain sockets.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl 4
Show
.Dv AF_INET
(IPv4) sockets.
.It Fl 6
Show
.Dv AF_INET6
(IPv6) sockets.
.It Fl c
Show connected sockets.
.It Fl l
Show listening sockets.
.It Fl p Ar ports
Only show Internet sockets if either the local or foreign port number
is on the specified list.
The
.Ar ports
argument is a comma-separated list of port numbers and ranges
specified as first and last port separated by a dash.
.It Fl u
Show
.Dv AF_LOCAL
.Pq Ux
sockets.
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl 4 , 6
or
.Fl u
is specified,
.Nm
will list sockets in all three domains.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl c
or
.Fl l
is specified,
.Nm
will list both listening and connected sockets.
.Pp
The information listed for each
socket is:
.Bl -tag -width "FOREIGN ADDRESS"
.It Li USER
The user who owns the socket.
.It Li COMMAND
The command which holds the socket.
.It Li PID
The process ID of the command which holds the socket.
.It Li FD
The file descriptor number of the socket.
.It Li PROTO
The transport protocol associated with the socket for Internet
sockets, or the type of socket (stream or datagram) for
.Ux
sockets.
.It Li LOCAL ADDRESS
For Internet sockets, this is the address the local end of the socket
is bound to (see
.Xr getsockname 2 ) .
For bound
.Ux
sockets, it is the socket's filename.
For other
.Ux
sockets, it is a right arrow followed by the endpoint's filename, or
.Dq Li ??
if the endpoint could not be determined.
.It Li FOREIGN ADDRESS
(Internet sockets only)
The address the foreign end of the socket is bound to (see
.Xr getpeername 2 ) .
.El
.Pp
Note that TCP sockets in the
.Dv AF_INET
or
.Dv AF_INET6
domains that are not in one of the
.Dv LISTEN , SYN_SENT ,
or
.Dv ESTABLISHED
states may not be shown by
.Nm ;
use
.Xr netstat 1
to examine them instead.
