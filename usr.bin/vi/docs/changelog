	  when the change command extended the line.
	+ Fix core dump in map/seq code if character larger than 7 bits.
	+ Block signals when manipulating the SCR chains.
	+ Fix memory allocation for machines with multiple pointer sizes.
1.31 -> 1.32 Mon Aug 15 14:27:49 1994
	+ Turn off recno mmap call for Solaris 2.4/SunOS 5.4.
1.30 -> 1.31 Sun Aug 14 13:13:35 1994
	+ Fix bug were cG on the last line of a file wasn't done in line mode,
	  and where the cursor wasn't positioned correctly after exiting text
	  insert mode.
	+ Add termcap workaround to make function keys greater than 9 work
	  correctly (or fail if old-style termcap support).
	+ Change ex/vi to not flush mapped keys on error -- this is historic
	  practice, and people depended on it.
	+ Rework vi parser so that no command including a mapped key ever
	  becomes the '.' command, matching historic practice.
	+ Make <escape> cancellation in the vi parser match POSIX 1003.2.
	+ Fix curses bug where standout string was written for each standout
	  character, and where standout mode was never exited explicitly.
	  Fix bugs in curses SF/sf and SR/sr scrolling, as seen on Sun and
	  x86 consoles.
	+ The v/global commands execute the print command by default.
	+ The number option historically applies to ex as well as vi.
1.29 -> 1.30 Mon Aug  8 10:30:42 1994
	+ Make first read into a temporary set the file's name.
	+ Permit any key to continue scrolling or ex commands -- this
	  allows stacked colon commands, and matches historic practice.
	+ Don't output normal ! command commentary in ex silent mode.
	+ Allow +/- flags after substitute commands, make line (flag)
	  offsets from vi mode match historic practice.
	+ Return <eof> to ex immediately, even if preceded by spaces.  Rework
	  ex parser to do erase the prompt instead of depending on the print
	  routines to do it.  Minor fixes to the ex parser for display of
	  default and scrolling commands.  MORE EX PARSER CHANGES.
1.28 -> 1.29 Fri Aug  5 10:18:07 1994
	+ Make the abbreviated ex delete command work (:dele---###lll for
	  example, is historically legal.
	+ When autoprint fires, multiple flags may be set, use ex_print
	  directly instead of the stub routines.
	+ Change v/global commands to turn off autoprint while running.
	+ Minor changes to make the ! command display match historic output.
	+ Rework the ex parser to permit multiple command separators without
	  commands -- MAJOR CHANGE, likely to introduce all sorts of new bugs.
	+ Fix cd command to expand argument in the context of each element
	  of the cdpath option, make relative paths always relative to the
	  current directory.
	+ Rework write/quit cases for temporary files, so that user's don't
	  discard them accidentally.
	+ Check for window size changes when continuing after a suspend.
	+ Fix memory problem in svi_screen, used free'd memory.
	+ Change the ex change, insert, append commands to match historic
	  cursor positions if no data entered by the user.
	+ Change ex format flags (#, l, p) to affect future commands, not
	  just the current one, to match historic practice.
	+ Make the user's EOF character an additional scroll character in ex.
	+ Fix ex ^D scrolling to be the value of the scroll option, not half
	  the screen.
	+ Fix buffer execution to match historic practice -- bugs where the
	  '*' command didn't work, and @<carriage-return> didn't work.
	+ Fix doubled reporting of deleted lines in filters.
	+ Rework the % ` / ? ( ) N n { and ^A commands to always cut into
	  numeric buffers regardless of the location or length of the cut.
	  This matches historic practice.
	+ Fix the { command to check the current line if the cursor doesn't
	  start on the first character of the line.
	+ Do '!' expansion in the ex read command arguments, it's historic
	  practice.  In addition, it sets the last '!' command.
1.27 -> 1.28 Wed Jul 27 21:29:18 1994
	+ Add support for scrolling using the CS and SF/sf/SR/sr termcap
	  strings to the 4BSD curses.
	+ Rework of getkey() introduced a bug where command interrupt put
	  nvi into an infinite loop.
	+ Piping through a filter historically cut the replaced lines into
	  the default buffer, although not the numeric ones.
	+ Read of a filter and !! historically moved to the first nonblank
	  of the resulting cursor line (most of the time).
	+ Rework cursor motion flags, to support '!' as a motion command.
1.26 -> 1.27 Tue Jul 26 10:27:58 1994
	+ Add the meta option, to specify characters the shell will expand.
	+ Fix the read command to match historic practice, the white space
	  and bang characters weren't getting parsed correctly.
	+ Change SIGALRM handler to save and restore errno.
	+ Change SunOS include/compat.h to include <vfork.h> so that the
	  ex/filter.c code works again.
	+ Don't put lines deleted by the ex delete command into the numeric
	  buffers, matching historic practice.
	+ Fix; if appending to a buffer, default buffer historically only
	  references the appended text, not the resulting text.
	+ Support multiple, semi-colon separated search strings, and 'z'
	  commands after search strings.
	+ Make previous context mark setting match historic practice (see
	  docs/internals/context).
	+ Fix the set command to permit whitespace between the option and
	  the question mark, fix question marks in general.
	+ Fix bug where ex error messages could be accidentally preceded
	  by a single space.
	+ Fix bug where curses reorganization could lose screen specific
	  mappings as soon as any screen exited.
	+ Fix bug in paragraph code where invalid macros could be matched.
	  Make paragraph motions stop at formfeed (^L) characters.
	+ Change 'c' to match historic practice, it cut text into numeric
	  buffers.
1.25 -> 1.26 Tue Jul 19 17:46:24 1994
	+ Ignore SIGWINCH if the screen size is unchanged; SunOS systems
	  deliver one when a screen is uncovered.
	+ Fix: don't permit a command with a motion component to wrap due
	  to wrapscan and return to the original cursor position.
	+ Fix: ^E wasn't beeping when reaching the bottom of the file.
	+ Fix bg/fg bug where tmp file exiting caused a NULL dereference.
	+ Rework file locking code to use fcntl(2) explicitly.
	+ Fix bug in section code where invalid macros could be matched.
	+ Fix bug where line number reset by vi's Q command.
	+ Add explicit character mode designation to character mode buffers.
	+ Add <sys/ioctl.h> include to sex/sex_window.c, needed by NET/2
	  vintage systems.
	+ Change to always flush a character during suspend, 4BSD curses
	  has the optimization where it doesn't flush after a standend().
	+ Fix bug on OSF1 where <curses.h> changes the values of VERASE,
	  VKILL and VWERASE to incorrect ones.
	+ Fix bug where optarg used incorrectly in main.c.
	+ Block all signals when acting on a signal delivery.
	+ Fix recovery bug where RCV_EMAIL could fire even if there wasn't
	  a backing file; format recovery message.
1.24 -> 1.25 Sun Jul 17 14:33:38 1994
	+ Stop allowing keyboard suspends (^Z) in insert mode, it's hard
	  to get autowrite correct, and it's not historic practice.
	+ Fix z^, z+ to match historic practice.
	+ Bug in message handling, "vi +35 non-existent_file" lost the
	  status message because the "+35" pushed onto the stack erased
	  it.  For now, change so that messages aren't displayed if there
	  are keys waiting -- may need to add a "don't-erase" bit to the
	  character in the stack instead.
	+ Bug in svi_msgflush(), where error messages could come out in
	  normal video.
1.23 -> 1.24 Sat Jul 16 18:30:18 1994
	+ Fix core dump in exf.c, where editing a non-existent file and
	  exiting could cause already free'd memory to be free'd.
	+ Clean up numerous memory errors, courtesy of Purify.
	+ Change process wait code to fail if wait fails, and not attempt
	  to interpret the wait return information.
	+ Open recovery and DB files for writing as well as reading, System
	  V (fcntl) won't let you acquire LOCK_EX locks otherwise.
	+ Fix substitute bug where could malloc 0 bytes (AIX breaks).
	+ Permit the mapping of <carriage-return>, it's historic practice.
	+ Historic vi didn't eat <blank> characters before the force
	  flag, match historic practice.
	+ Bug in ex argument parsing, corrected for literal characters
	  twice.
	+ Delete screen specific maps when the screen closes.
	+ Move to the first non-<blank> in the line on startup; historic
	  practice.
	+ Change the ex visual command to move directly to a line if no
	  trailing 'z' command.
	+ Fix "[[" and "]]" to match historic practice (yet again...).
	+ Fix "yb" and "y{" commands to update the cursor correctly.
	+ Change "~<motion>" to match the yank cursor movement semantics
	  exactly.
	+ Move all of the curses related code into sex/svi -- major rework,
	  but should help in future ports.
	+ Fix bug in split code caused by new file naming code, where would
	  drop core when a split screen exited.
	+ Change svi_ex_write to do character display translation, so that
	  messages with file names in them are displayed correctly.
	+ Display the file name on split screens instead of a divider line.
	+ Fix move bug, wasn't copying lines before putting them.
	+ Fix bug were :n dropped core if no arguments supplied.
	+ Don't quote characters in executed buffer: "ifoo<esc>" should leave
	  insert mode after the buffer is executed.
	+ Tagpop and tagpush should set the absolute mark in case only moving
	  within a file.
	+ Skip leading whitespace characters before tags and cursor word
	  searches.
	+ Fix bug in ex_global where re_conv() was allocating the temporary
	  buffer and not freeing it.
1.22 -> 1.23: Wed Jun 29 19:22:33 1994
	+ New <sys/cdefs.h> required "inline" to change to "__inline"
	+ Fix System V curses code for new ^Z support.
	+ Fix off-by-one in the move code, avoid ":1,$mo$" with only one
	  line in the buffer.
	+ Line orientation of motion commands was remembered too long,
	  i.e.  '.' command could be incorrectly marked as line oriented.
	+ Move file modification time into EXF, so it's shared across
	  split screens.
	+ Put the prev[ious] command back in, people complained.
	+ Random fixes to next/prev semantics changed in 1.22.
	+ Historically vi doesn't only move to the last address if there's
	  ANYTHING after the addresses, e.g. ":3" moves to line 3, ":3|"
	  prints line 3.
1.21 -> 1.22: Mon Jun 27 11:01:41 1994
	+ Make the line between split screens inverse video again.
	+ Delete the prev[ious] command, it's not useful enough to keep.
	+ Rework :args/file name handling from scratch -- MAJOR CHANGE,
	  likely to introduce all sorts of new bugs.
	+ Fix RE bug where no subexpressions in the pattern but there were
	  subexpressions referenced in the replacement, e.g. "s/XXX/\1/g".
	+ Change recovery to not leave unmodified files around after a
	  crash, by using the owner 'x' bit on unmodified backup files.
	  MAJOR CHANGE, the system recovery script has to change!
	+ Change -r option to delete recovery.* files that reference non-
	  existent vi.* files.
	+ Rework recovery locking so that fcntl(2) locking will work.
	+ Fix append (upper-case) buffers, broken by cut fixes.
	+ Fix | to not set the absolute motion mark.
	+ Read $HOME/.exrc file on startup if the effective user ID is
	  root.  This makes running vi while su(1)'d work correctly.
	+ Use the full pathname of the file as the recovery name, not
	  just the last component.  Matches historic practice.
	+ Keep marks in empty files from being destroyed.
	+ Block all caught signals before calling the DB routines.
	+ Make the line change report match historic practice (yanked
	  lines were different than everything else).
	+ Add section on multiple screens to the reference manual.
	+ Display all messages at once, combine onto a single line if
	  possible.  Delete the trailing period from all messages.
1.20 -> 1.21: Thu May 19 12:21:58 1994
	+ Delete the -l flag from the recover mail.
	+ Send the user email if ex command :preserve executed, this matches
	  historic practice.  Lots of changes to the preserve and recovery
	  code, change preserve to snapshot files (again, historic practice).
	+ Make buffers match historic practice: "add logically stores text
	  into buffer a, buffer 1, and the unnamed buffer.
	+ Print <tab> characters as ^I on the colon command line if the
	  list option set.
	+ Adjust ^F and ^B scroll values in the presence of split screens
	  and small windows.
	+ Break msg* routines out from util.c into msg.c, start thinking
	  about message catalogs.
	+ Add tildeop set option, based on stevie's option of the same name.
	  Changes  the ~ command into "[count] ~ motion", i.e. ~ takes a
	  trailing motion.
	+ Chose NOT to match historic practice on cursor positioning after
	  consecutive undo commands on a single line; see vi/v_undo.c for
	  the comment.
	+ Add a one line cache so that multiple changes to the same line
	  are only counted once (e.g. "dl35p" changes one line, not 35).
	+ Rework signals some more.  Block file sync signals in vi routines
	  that interface to DB, so can sync the files at interrupt time.
	  Write up all of the signal handling arguments, see signal.c.
1.19 -> 1.20: Thu May  5 19:24:57 1994
	+ Return ^Z to synchronous handling.  See the dicussion in signal.c
	  and svi_screen.c:svi_curses_init().
	+ Fix bug where line change report was wrong in util.c:msg_rpt().
1.18 -> 1.19: Thu May  5 12:59:51 1994
	+ Block DSUSP so that ^Y isn't delivered at SIGTSTP.
	+ Fix bug -- put into an empty file leaves the cursor at 1,0,
	  not the first nonblank.
	+ Fix bug were number of lines reported for the 'P' command was
	  off-by-one.
	+ Fix bug were 0^D wasn't being handled correctly.
	+ Delete remnants of ^Z as a raw character.
	+ Fix bug where if a map was an entire colon command, it may never
	  have been displayed.
	+ Final cursor position fixes for the vi T and t commands.
	+ The ex :next command took an optional ex command as it's first
	  argument similar to the :edit commands.  Match historic practice.
1.17 -> 1.18: Wed May  4 13:57:10 1994
	+ Rework curses information in the PORT/Makefile's.
	+ Minor fixes to ^Z asynchronous code.
1.16 -> 1.17: Wed May  4 11:15:56 1994
	+ Make ex comment handling match historic practice.
	+ Make ^Z work asynchronously, we can no longer use the SIGTSTP
	  handler in the curses library.
1.15 -> 1.16: Mon May  2 19:42:07 1994
	+ Make the 'p' and 'P' commands support counts, i.e. "Y10p" works.
	+ Make characters that map to themselves as the first part of the
	  mapping work, it's historic practice.
	+ Fix bug where "s/./\& /" discarded the space in the replacement
	  string.
	+ Add support for up/down cursor arrows in text input mode, rework
	  left/right support to match industry practice.
	+ Fix bug were enough character remapping could corrupt memory.
	+ Delete O_REMAPMAX in favor of setting interrupts after N mapped
	  characters without a read, delete the map counter per character.
	  MAJOR CHANGE.  All of the interrupt signal handling has been
	  reworked so that interrupts are always turned on instead of
	  being turned on periodically, when an interruptible operation is
	  pending.
	+ Fix bug where vi wait() was interrupted by the recovery alarm.
	+ Make +cmd's and initial commands execute with the current line
	  set to the last line of the file.  This is historic practice.
	+ Change "lock failed" error message to a file status message.
	  It always fails over NFS, and making all NFS files readonly
	  isn't going to fly.
	+ Use the historic line number format, but check for overflow.
	+ Fix bug where vi command parser ignored buffers specified as
	  part of the motion command.
	+ Make [@*]buffer commands on character mode buffers match historic
	  practice.
	+ Fix bug where the cmap/chf entries of the tty structure weren't
	  being cleared when new characters were read.
	+ Fix bug where the default command motion flags were being set
	  when the command was a motion component.
	+ Fix wrapmargin bug; if appending characters, and wrapmargin breaks
	  the line, an additional space is eaten.
1.14 -> 1.15: Fri Apr 29 07:44:57 1994
	+ Make the ex delete command work in any empty file.
	+ Fix bug where 't' command placed the cursor on the character
	  instead of to its left.
	+ ^D and ^U didn't set the scroll option value historically.
	  Note, this change means that any user set value (e.g. 15^D)
	  will be lost when splitting the screen, since the split code
	  now resets the scroll value regardless.
	+ Fix the ( command to set the absolute movement mark.
	+ Only use TIOCGWINSZ for window information if SIGWINCH signal
	  caught.
	+ Delete the -l flag, and make -r work for multiple arguments.
	  Add the ex "recover[!] file" command.
	+ Switch into ex terminal mode and use the sex routines when
	  append/change/insert called from vi mode.
	+ Make ^F and ^B match historic practice.  This required a fairly
	  extensive rework of the svi scrolling code.
	+ Cursor positioning in H, M, L, G (first non-blank for 1G) wasn't
	  being done correctly.  Delete the SETLFNB flag.  H, M, and L stay
	  logical movements (SETNNB) and G always moves to the first nonblank.
	+ System V uses "lines" and "cols", not "li" and "co", change as
	  necessary.  Check termcap function returns for errors.
	+ Fix `<character> command to do start/end of line correction,
	  and to set line mode if starting and stopping at column 0.
	+ Fix bug in delete code where dropped core if deleted in character
	  mode to an empty line.  (Rework the delete code for efficiency.)
	+ Give up on SunOS 4.1.X, and use "cc" instead of /usr/5bin/cc.
	+ Protect ex_getline routine from interrupted system calls (if
	  possible, set SA_RESTART on SIGALRM, too).
	+ Fix leftright scrolling bug, when moving to a shorter line.
	+ Do validity checking on the copy, move, t command target line
	  numbers.
	+ Change for System V % pattern broke trailing flags for empty
	  replacement strings.
	+ Fix bug when RCM flags retained in the saved dot structure.
	+ Make the ex '=' command work for empty files.
	+ Fix bug where special_key array was being free'd (it's no longer
	  allocated).
	+ Matches cut in line mode only if the starting cursor is at or
	  before the first nonblank in its line, and the ending cursor is
	  at or after the last nonblank in its line.
	+ Add the :wn command, so you can write a file and switch to a new
	  file in one command.
	+ Allow only a single key as an argument to :viusage.
	+ New movement code broke filter/paragraph operations in empty
	  files ("!}date" in an empty file was dropping core).
1.12 -> 1.14: Mon Apr 18 11:05:10 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION, 4.4BSD)
	+ Fix FILE structure leakage in the ex filter code.
	+ Rework suspend code for System V curses.  Nvi has to do the
	  the work, there's no way to get curses to do it right.
	+ Revert SunOS 4.1.X ports to the distributed curses.  There's
	  a bug in Sun's implementation that we can't live with.
	+ Quit immediately if row/column values are unreasonable.
	+ Fix the function keys to match vi historic behavior.
	+ Replace the echo/awk magic in the Makefile's with awk scripts.
1.11 -> 1.12: Thu Apr 14 11:10:19 1994
	+ Fix bug where only the first vi key was checked for validity.
	+ Make 'R' continue to overwrite after a <carriage-return>.
	+ Only display the "no recovery" message once.
	+ Rework line backup code to restore the line to its previous
	  condition.
	+ Don't permit :q in a .exrc file or EXINIT variable.
	+ Fix wrapscan option bug where forward searches become backward
	  searches and do cursor correction accordingly.
	+ Change "dd" to move the cursor to the first non-blank on the line.
	+ Delete cursor attraction to the first non-blank, change non-blank
	  motions to set the most attractive cursor position instead.
	+ Fix 'r' substitute option to set the RE to the last RE, not the
	  last substitute RE.
	+ Fix 'c' and 'g' substitute options to always toggle, and fix
	  edcompatible option to not reset them.
	+ Display ex error messages in inverse video.
	+ Fix errorbells option to match historic practice.
	+ Delete fixed character display table in favor of table built based
	  on the current locale.
	+ Add ":set octal" option, that displays unknown characters as octal
	  values instead of the default hexadecimal.
	+ Make all command and text input modes interruptible.
	+ Fix ex input mode to display error messages immediately, instead
	  of waiting for the lines to be resolved.
	+ Fix bug where vi calling append could overwrite the command.
	+ Fix off-by-one in the ex print routine tab code.
	+ Fix incorrect ^D test in vi text input routines.
	+ Add autoindent support for ex text insert routines.
	+ Add System V substitute command replacement pattern semantics,
	  where '%' means the last replacement pattern.
	+ Fix bug that \ didn't escape newlines in ex commands.
	+ Regularize the names of special characters to CH_*.
	+ Change hex insert character from ^Vx<hex_char> to ^X<hex_char>
	+ Integrate System V style curses, so SunOS and Solaris ports can
	  use the native curses implementation.
1.10 -> 1.11: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION)
	+ Change H, M, and L to set the absolute mark, historical practice.
	+ Fix bug in stepping through multiple tags files.
	+ Add "remapmax" option that turns off map counts so you can remap
	  infinitely.  If it's off, term_key() can be interrupted from the
	  keyboard, which will cause the buffers to flush.  I also dropped
	  the default max number of remaps to 50.  (Only Dave Hitz's TM
	  macros and maze appear to go over that limit.)
	+ Change :mkexrc to not dump w{300,1200,9600}, lisp options.
	+ Fix backward search within a line bug.
	+ Change all the includes of "pathnames.h" to use <>'s so that the
	  PORT versions can use -I. to replace it with their own versions.
	+ Make reads and writes interruptible.  Rework code that enters and
	  leaves ex for '!' and filter commands, rework all interrupt and
	  timer code.
	+ Fix core dump when user displayed option in .exrc file.
	+ Fix bug where writing empty files didn't update the saved 
	  modification time.
	+ Fix bug where /pattern/ addressing was always a backward search.
	+ Fix bug triggered by autoindent of more than 32 characters, where
	  nvi wasn't checking the right TEXT length.
	+ Fix bug where joining only empty lines caused a core dump.
1.09 -> 1.10: Sat Mar 19 15:40:29 EST 1994
	+ Fix "set all" core dump.
1.08 -> 1.09: Sat Mar 19 10:11:14 EST 1994
	+ If the tag's file path is relative, and it doesn't exist, check
	  relative to the tag file location.
	+ Fix ~ command to free temporary buffer on error return.
	+ Create vi.ref, a first cut at a reference document for vi.
	  The manual page and the reference document only document the
	  set options, so far.
	+ Fix 1G bug not always going to the first non-blank.
	+ Upgrade PORT/regex to release alpha3.4, from Henry Spencer.
	+ Add MKS vi's "cdpath" option, supporting a cd search path.
	+ Handle if search as a motion was discarded, i.e. "d/<erase>".
	+ Change nvi to not create multiple recovery files if modifying
	  a recovered file.
	+ Decide to ignore that the cursor is before the '$' when inserting
	  in list mode.  It's too hard to fix.
1.07 -> 1.08: Wed Mar 16 07:37:36 EST 1994
	+ Leftright and big line scrolling fixes.  This meant more changes
	  to the screen display code, so there may be new problems.
	+ Don't permit search-style addresses until a file has been read.
	+ "c[Ww]" command incorrectly handled the "in whitespace" case.
	+ Fix key space allocation bug triggered by cut/paste under SunOS.
	+ Ex move command got the final cursor position wrong.
	+ Delete "optimize option not implemented" message.
	+ Make the literal-next character turn off mapping for the next
	  character in text input mode.
1.06 -> 1.07: Mon Mar 14 11:10:33 EST 1994
	+ The "wire down" change in 1.05 broke ex command parsing, there
	  wasn't a corresponding change to handle multiple K_VLNEXT chars.
	+ Fix final position for vi's 't' command.
1.05 -> 1.06: Sun Mar 13 16:12:52 EST 1994
	+ Wire down ^D, ^H, ^W, and ^V, regardless of the user's termios
	  values.
	+ Add ^D as the ex scroll command.
	+ Support ^Q as a literal-next character.
	+ Rework abbreviations to be delimited by any !inword() character.
	+ Add options description to the manual page.
	+ Minor screen cache fix for svi_get.c.
	+ Rework beautify option support to match historical practice.
	+ Exit immediately if not reading from a tty and a command fails.
	+ Default the SunOS 4.* ports to the distributed curses, not SMI's.
1.04 -> 1.05: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994
	+ Make cursor keys work in input mode.
	+ Rework screen column code in vi curses screen.  MAJOR CHANGE --
	  after this, we'll be debugging curses screen presentation from
	  scratch.
	+ Explode include files in vi.h into the source files.
1.03 -> 1.04: Sun Mar  6 14:14:16 EST 1994
	+ Make the ex move command keep the marks on the moved lines.
	+ Change resize semantics so you can set the screen size to a
	  specific value.  A couple of screen fixes for the resize code.
	+ Fixes for foreground/background due to SIGWINCH.
	+ Complete rework of all of vi's cursor movements.  The underlying
	  assumption in the old code was that the starting cursor position
	  was part of the range of lines cut or deleted.  The command
	  "d[[" is an example where this isn't true.  Change it so that all
	  motion component commands set the final cursor position separately
	  from the range, as it can't be done correctly later.  This is a
	  MAJOR CHANGE -- after this change, we'll be debugging the cursor
	  positioning from scratch.
	+ Rewrite the B, b, E, e commands to use vi's getc() interface
	  instead of rolling their own.
	+ Add a second MARK structure, LMARK, which is the larger mark
	  needed by the logging and mark queue code.  Everything else uses
	  the reworked MARK structure, which is simply a line/column pair.
	+ Rework cut/delete to not expect 1-past-the-end in the range, but
	  to act on text to the end of the range, inclusive.
	+ Sync on write's, to force NFS to flush.
1.01 -> 1.03: Sun Jan 23 17:50:35 EST 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION)
	+ Tag stack fixes, was returning to the tag, not the position from
	  which the user tagged.
	+ Only use from the cursor to the end of the word in cursor word
	  searches and tags.  (Matches historical vi behavior.)
	+ Fix delete-last-line bug when line number option set.
	+ Fix usage line for :split command.
	+ If O_NUMBER set, long input lines would eventually fail, the column
	  count for the second screen of long lines wasn't set correctly.
	+ Fix for [[ reaching SOF with a column longer than the first line.
	+ Fix for multiple error messages if no screen displayed.
	+ Fix :read to set alternate file name as in historical practice.
	+ Fix cut to rotate the numeric buffers if line mode flag set.
1.00 -> 1.01: Wed Jan 12 13:37:18 EST 1994
	+ Don't put cut items into numeric buffers if cutting less than
	  parts of two lines.
0.94 -> 1.00: Mon Jan 10 02:27:27 EST 1994
	+ Read-ahead not there; BSD tty driver problem, SunOS curses
	  problem.
	+ Global command could error if it deleted the last line of
	  the file.
	+ Change '.' to only apply to the 'u' if entered immediately
	  after the 'u' command.  "1pu.u.u. is still broken, but I
	  expect that it's going to be sacrificed for multiple undo.
	+ If backward motion on a command, now move to the point; get
	  yank cursor positioning correct.
	+ Rework cut buffers to match historic practice -- yank/delete
	  numeric buffers redone sensibly, ignoring historic practice.
0.92 -> 0.93: Mon Dec 20 19:52:14 EST 1993
	+ Christos Zoulas reimplemented the script windows using pty's,
	  which means that they now work reasonably.   The down side of
	  this is that almost all ports other than 4.4BSD need to include
	  two new files, login_tty.c and pty.c from the PORT/clib directory.
	  I've added them to the Makefiles.
	+ All calloc/malloc/realloc functions now cast their pointers, for
	  SunOS -- there should be far fewer warning messages, during the
	  build.  The remaining messages are where CHAR_T's meet char *'s,
	  i.e. where 8-bit clean meets strcmp.
	+ The user's argument list handling has been reworked so that there
	  is always a single consistent position for use by :next, :prev and
	  :rewind.
	+ All of the historical options are now at least accepted, although
	  not all of them are implemented.   (Edcompatible, hardtabs, lisp,
	  optimize, redraw, and slowopen aren't implemented.)
	+ The RE's have been reworked so that matches of length 0 are handled
	  in the same way as vi used to handle them.
	+ Several more mapping fixes and ex parser addressing fixes.
