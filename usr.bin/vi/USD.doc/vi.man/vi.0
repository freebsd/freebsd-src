     VVii is a screen oriented text editor.  EExx is a line-oriented text editor.
     EExx and vvii are different interfaces to the same program, and it is possi-
     ble to switch back and forth during an edit session.  VViieeww is the equiva-
     lent of using the --RR (read-only) option of vvii.

     This manual page is the one provided with the nneexx//nnvvii versions of the
     eexx//vvii text editors.  NNeexx//nnvvii are intended as bug-for-bug compatible re-
     placements for the original Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD)
     eexx and vvii programs.  For the rest of this manual page, nneexx//nnvvii is used
     only when it's necessary to distinguish it from the historic implementa-
     tions of eexx//vvii.

     This manual page is intended for users already familiar with eexx//vvii. Any-
     one else should almost certainly read a good tutorial on the editor be-
     fore this manual page.  If you're in an unfamiliar environment, and you
     absolutely have to get work done immediately, read the section after the
     options description, entitled ``Fast Startup''. It's probably enough to
     get you going.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Execute _c_m_d immediately after starting the edit session.  Partic-
             ularly useful for initial positioning in the file, however _c_m_d is
             not limited to positioning commands.  This is the POSIX 1003.2
             interface for the historic ``+cmd'' syntax.  NNeexx//nnvvii supports
             both the old and new syntax.

     --ee      Start editing in ex mode, as if the command name were eexx.

     --FF      Don't copy the entire file when first starting to edit.  (The de-
             fault is to make a copy in case someone else modifies the file
             during your edit session.)

     --RR      Start editing in read-only mode, as if the command name was vviieeww,
             or the readonly option was set.

     --rr      Recover the specified files, or, if no files are specified, list
             the files that could be recovered.  If no recoverable files by
             the specified name exist, the file is edited as if the --rr option
             had not been specified.

     --ss      Enter batch mode; applicable only to eexx edit sessions.  Batch
             mode is useful when running eexx scripts.  Prompts, informative
             messages and other user oriented message are turned off, and no
             startup files or environmental variables are read.  This is the
             POSIX 1003.2 interface for the historic ``-'' argument.  NNeexx//nnvvii
             supports both the old and new syntax.

     --tt      Start editing at the specified tag.  (See ctags(1)).

     --ww      Set the initial window size to the specified number of lines.



     --vv      Start editing in vi mode, as if the command name was vvii or vviieeww.

     --XX      Reserved for X11 interfaces.  _N_o _X_1_1 _s_u_p_p_o_r_t _i_s _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_l_y
             _i_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_e_d_.

     Command input for eexx//vvii is read from the standard input.  In the vvii in-
     terface, it is an error if standard input is not a terminal.  In the eexx
     interface, if standard input is not a terminal, eexx will read commands
     from it regardless, however, the session will be a batch mode session,
     exactly as if the --ss option had been specified.

     EExx//vvii exits 0 on success, and greater than 0 if an error occurs.

FFAASSTT SSTTAARRTTUUPP
     This section will tell you the minimum amount that you need to do simple
     editing tasks using vvii. If you've never used any screen editor before,
     you're likely to have problems even with this simple introduction.  In
     that case you should find someone that already knows vvii and have them
     walk you through this section.

     VVii is a screen editor.  This means that it takes up almost the entire
     screen, displaying part of the file on each screen line, except for the
     last line of the screen.  The last line of the screen is used for you to
     give commands to vvii, and for vvii to give information to you.

     The other fact that you need to understand is that vvii is a modeful edi-
     tor, i.e. you are either entering text or you are executing commands, and
     you have to be in the right mode to do one or the other.  You will be in
     command mode when you first start editing a file.  There are commands
     that switch you into input mode.  There is only one key that takes you
     out of input mode, and that is the <escape> key.  (Key names are written
     using less-than and greater-than signs, e.g.  <escape> means the
     ``escape'' key, usually labeled ``esc'' on your terminal's keyboard.)  If
     you're ever confused as to which mode you're in, keep entering the <es-
     cape> key until vvii beeps at you.  (Generally, vvii will beep at you if you
     try and do something that's not allowed.  It will also display error mes-
     sages.)

     To start editing a file, enter the command ``vi file_name<carriage-
     return>''. The command you should enter as soon as you start editing is
     ``:set verbose showmode<carriage-return>''. This will make the editor
     give you verbose error messages and display the current mode at the bot-
     tom of the screen.

     The commands to move around the file are:
     hh     Move the cursor left one character.
     jj     Move the cursor down one line.
     kk     Move the cursor up one line.
     ll     Move the cursor right one character.
     <<ccuurrssoorr--aarrrroowwss>>
           The cursor arrow keys should work, too.
     //tteexxtt<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Search for the string ``text'' in the file, and move the cursor to
           its first character.

     The commands to enter new text are:
     aa     Append new text, _a_f_t_e_r the cursor.
     ii     Insert new text, _b_e_f_o_r_e the cursor.
     oo     Open a new line below the line the cursor is on, and start entering
           text.
     OO     Open a new line above the line the cursor is on, and start entering
           text.
     <<eessccaappee>>
           Once you've entered input mode using the one of the aa, ii, OO, or oo
           commands, use <<eessccaappee>> to quit entering text and return to command
           mode.

     The commands to copy text are:
     yyyy    Copy the line the cursor is on.
     pp     Append the copied line after the line the cursor is on.

     The commands to delete text are:
     dddd    Delete the line the cursor is on.
     xx     Delete the character the cursor is on.

     The commands to write the file are:
     ::ww<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Write the file back to the file with the name that you originally
           used as an argument on the vvii command line.
     ::ww ffiillee__nnaammee<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Write the file back to the file with the name ``file_name''.

     The commands to quit editing and exit the editor are:
     ::qq<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Quit editing and leave vi (if you've modified the file, but not
           saved your changes, vvii will refuse to quit).
     ::qq!!<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Quit, discarding any modifications that you may have made.

     One final caution.  Unusual characters can take up more than one column
     on the screen, and long lines can take up more than a single screen line.
     The above commands work on ``physical'' characters and lines, i.e. they
     affect the entire line no matter how many screen lines it takes up and
     the entire character no matter how many screen columns it takes up.

     The following section describes the commands available in the command
     mode of the vvii editor.  In each entry below, the tag line is a usage syn-

     There are a large number of options that may be set (or unset) to change
     the editor's behavior.  This section describes the options, their abbre-
     viations and their default values.

     In each entry below, the first part of the tag line is the full name of
     the option, followed by any equivalent abbreviations.  The part in square
     brackets is the default value of the option.  Most of the options are
     boolean, i.e. they are either on or off, and do not have an associated
     value.

     Options apply to both eexx and vvii modes, unless otherwise specified.

     COLUMNS    The number of columns on the screen.  This value overrides any
                system or terminal specific values.  If the COLUMNS environ-
                mental variable is not set when eexx//vvii runs, or the ccoolluummnnss op-
                tion is explicitly reset by the user, eexx//vvii enters the value
                into the environment.
     EXINIT     A list of eexx startup commands, read if the variable NEXINIT is
                not set.
     HOME       The user's home directory, used as the initial directory path
                for the startup _$_H_O_M_E_/_._n_e_x_r_c and _$_H_O_M_E_/_._e_x_r_c files.  This val-

     LINES      The number of rows on the screen.  This value overrides any
                system or terminal specific values.  If the LINES environmen-
                tal variable is not set when eexx//vvii runs, or the lliinneess option
                is explicitly reset by the user, eexx//vvii enters the value into

     NEXINIT    A list of eexx startup commands.
     SHELL      The user's shell of choice (see also the sshheellll option).
     TERM       The user's terminal type.  The default is the type
                ``unknown''. If the TERM environmental variable is not set

     SIGALRM     VVii//eexx uses this signal for periodic backups of file modifica-
                 tions and to display ``busy'' messages when operations are
                 likely to take a long time.
     SIGHUP
     SIGTERM     If the current buffer has changed since it was last written
                 in its entirety, the editor attempts to save the modified
                 file so it can be later recovered.  See the vvii//eexx Reference
                 manual section entitled ``Recovery'' for more information.
     SIGINT      When an interrupt occurs, the current operation is halted,
                 and the editor returns to the command level.  If interrupted
                 during text input, the text already input is resolved into
                 the file as if the text input had been normally terminated.
     SIGWINCH    The screen is resized.  See the vvii//eexx Reference manual sec-
                 tion entitled ``Sizing the Screen'' for more information.
     SIGCONT
