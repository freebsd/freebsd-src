 * operations.  In the historic vi, the commands "ex", and "edit" obviously
 * set the alternate file name because they switched the underlying file.
 * Less obviously, the "read", "file", "write" and "wq" commands set it as
 * well.  In this implementation, some new commands have been added to the
 * list.  Where it gets interesting is that the alternate file name is set
 * multiple times by some commands.  If an edit attempt fails (for whatever
 * reason, like the current file is modified but as yet unwritten), it is
 * set to the file name that the user was unable to edit.  If the edit
 * succeeds, it is set to the last file name that was edited.  Good fun.
 *
 * If the user edits a temporary file, there are time when there isn't an
 * alternative file name.  A name argument of NULL turns it off.
