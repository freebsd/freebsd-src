/* Sensible version of fmt
 *
 * Syntax: fmt [ options ] [ goal [ max ] ] [ filename ... ]
 *
 * Since the documentation for the original fmt is so poor, here
 * is an accurate description of what this one does. It's usually
 * the same. The *mechanism* used may differ from that suggested
 * here. Note that we are *not* entirely compatible with fmt,
 * because fmt gets so many things wrong.
 *
 * 1. Tabs are expanded, assuming 8-space tab stops.
 *    If the `-t <n>' option is given, we assume <n>-space
 *    tab stops instead.
 *    Trailing blanks are removed from all lines.
 *    x\b == nothing, for any x other than \b.
 *    Other control characters are simply stripped. This
 *    includes \r.
 * 2. Each line is split into leading whitespace and
 *    everything else. Maximal consecutive sequences of
 *    lines with the same leading whitespace are considered
 *    to form paragraphs, except that a blank line is always
 *    a paragraph to itself.
 *    If the `-p' option is given then the first line of a
 *    paragraph is permitted to have indentation different
 *    from that of the other lines.
 *    If the `-m' option is given then a line that looks
 *    like a mail message header, if it is not immediately
 *    preceded by a non-blank non-message-header line, is
 *    taken to start a new paragraph, which also contains
 *    any subsequent lines with non-empty leading whitespace.
 *    Unless the `-n' option is given, lines beginning with
 *    a . (dot) are not formatted.
 * 3. The "everything else" is split into words; a word
 *    includes its trailing whitespace, and a word at the
 *    end of a line is deemed to be followed by a single
 *    space, or two spaces if it ends with a sentence-end
 *    character. (See the `-d' option for how to change that.)
 *    If the `-s' option has been given, then a word's trailing
 *    whitespace is replaced by what it would have had if it
 *    had occurred at end of line.
 * 4. Each paragraph is sent to standard output as follows.
 *    We output the leading whitespace, and then enough words
 *    to make the line length as near as possible to the goal
 *    without exceeding the maximum. (If a single word would
 *    exceed the maximum, we output that anyway.) Of course
 *    the trailing whitespace of the last word is ignored.
 *    We then emit a newline and start again if there are any
 *    words left.
 *    Note that for a blank line this translates as "We emit
 *    a newline".
 *    If the `-l <n>' option is given, then leading whitespace
 *    is modified slightly: <n> spaces are replaced by a tab.
 *    Indented paragraphs (see above under `-p') make matters
 *    more complicated than this suggests. Actually every paragraph
 *    has two `leading whitespace' values; the value for the first
 *    line, and the value for the most recent line. (While processing
 *    the first line, the two are equal. When `-p' has not been
 *    given, they are always equal.) The leading whitespace
 *    actually output is that of the first line (for the first
 *    line of *output*) or that of the most recent line (for
 *    all other lines of output).
 *    When `-m' has been given, message header paragraphs are
 *    taken as having first-leading-whitespace empty and
 *    subsequent-leading-whitespace two spaces.
 *
 * Multiple input files are formatted one at a time, so that a file
 * never ends in the middle of a line.
 *
 * There's an alternative mode of operation, invoked by giving
 * the `-c' option. In that case we just center every line,
 * and most of the other options are ignored. This should
 * really be in a separate program, but we must stay compatible
 * with old `fmt'.
 *
 * QUERY: Should `-m' also try to do the right thing with quoted text?
 * QUERY: `-b' to treat backslashed whitespace as old `fmt' does?
 * QUERY: Option meaning `never join lines'?
 * QUERY: Option meaning `split in mid-word to avoid overlong lines'?
 * (Those last two might not be useful, since we have `fold'.)
 *
 * Differences from old `fmt':
 *
 *   - We have many more options. Options that aren't understood
 *     generate a lengthy usage message, rather than being
 *     treated as filenames.
 *   - Even with `-m', our handling of message headers is
 *     significantly different. (And much better.)
 *   - We don't treat `\ ' as non-word-breaking.
 *   - Downward changes of indentation start new paragraphs
 *     for us, as well as upward. (I think old `fmt' behaves
 *     in the way it does in order to allow indented paragraphs,
 *     but this is a broken way of making indented paragraphs
 *     behave right.)
 *   - Given the choice of going over or under |goal_length|
 *     by the same amount, we go over; old `fmt' goes under.
 *   - We treat `?' as ending a sentence, and not `:'. Old `fmt'
 *     does the reverse.
 *   - We return approved return codes. Old `fmt' returns
 *     1 for some errors, and *the number of unopenable files*
 *     when that was all that went wrong.
 *   - We have fewer crashes and more helpful error messages.
 *   - We don't turn spaces into tabs at starts of lines unless
 *     specifically requested.
 *   - New `fmt' is somewhat smaller and slightly faster than
 *     old `fmt'.
 *
 * Bugs:
 *
 *   None known. There probably are some, though.
 *
 * Portability:
 *
 *   I believe this code to be pretty portable. It does require
 *   that you have `getopt'. If you need to include "getopt.h"
 *   for this (e.g., if your system didn't come with `getopt'
 *   and you installed it yourself) then you should arrange for
 *   NEED_getopt_h to be #defined.
 *
 *   Everything here should work OK even on nasty 16-bit
 *   machines and nice 64-bit ones. However, it's only really
 *   been tested on my FreeBSD machine. Your mileage may vary.
