.Sh NAME
.Nm file2c
.Nd convert file to c-source
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl sx
.Op Fl n Ar count
.Op Ar prefix Op Ar suffix
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a file from stdin and writes it to stdout, converting each
byte to its decimal or hexadecimal representation on the fly.
The byte values are separated by a comma.
This also means that the last byte value is not followed by a comma.
By default the byte values are printed in decimal, but when the
.Fl x
option is given, the values will be printed in hexadecimal.
When
.Fl s
option is given, each line is printed with a leading tab and each comma is
followed by a space except for the last one on the line.
.Pp
If more than 70 characters are printed on the same line, that line is
ended and the output continues on the next line.
With the
.Fl n
option this can be made to happen after the specified number of
byte values have been printed.
The length of the line will not be considered anymore.
To have all the byte values printed on the same line, give the
.Fl n
option a negative number.
.Pp
A prefix and suffix strings can be printed before and after the byte values
(resp.)
If a suffix is to be printed, a prefix must also be specified.
The first non-option word is the prefix, which may optionally be followed
by a word that is to be used as the suffix.
.Pp
This program is typically used to embed binary files into C source files.
The prefix is used to define an array type and the suffix is used to end
the C statement.
The
.Fl n , s
and
.Fl x
options are useful when the binary data represents a bitmap and the output
needs to remain readable and/or editable.
Fonts, for example, are a good example of this.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
date | file2c 'const char date[] = {' ',0};'
.Ed
.Pp
will produce:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const char date[] = {
83,97,116,32,74,97,110,32,50,56,32,49,54,58,50,56,58,48,53,
32,80,83,84,32,49,57,57,53,10
,0};
