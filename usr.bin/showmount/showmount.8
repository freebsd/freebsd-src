.Op Fl e
.Op Fl 1
.Op Fl 3
.Op Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility shows status information about the
.Tn NFS
server on
.Ar host .
By default it prints the names of all hosts that have
.Tn NFS
file systems mounted
on the host.
See
.%T "NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094,
Appendix A,
and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I,
for a detailed description of the protocol.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a , Fl -all
List all mount points in the form:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ar host : Ns Ar dirpath .
.Ed
.It Fl d , Fl -directories
List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.
.It Fl E , Fl -exports-script
Show the
.Ar host Ns 's
exports list in a script-friendly format.
Client addresses and the header are not shown, and special
characters are escaped.
.It Fl e , Fl -exports
Show the
.Ar host Ns 's
exports list.
.It Fl 1
Use mount protocol Version 1, compatible with legacy servers.
.It Fl 3

.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr mount_nfs 8 ,
.Xr mountd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual mounts,
since the
.Tn NFS
server is stateless.
The
.Nm
utility will only display the information
as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
