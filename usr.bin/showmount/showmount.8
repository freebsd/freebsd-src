.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm showmount
.Op Fl ade
.Op Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Showmount
shows status information about the
.Tn NFS
server on
.Ar host .
By default it prints the names of all hosts that have
.Tn NFS
file systems mounted
on the host. See
.%T "NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094,
Appendix A ,
for a detailed description of the protocol.

.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Ar host : Ns Ar dirpath
.Ed
.It Fl d
List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts
.It Fl e

.Ar host Ns 's
exports list
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr mountd 8
.Sh BUGS
The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual mounts,
since the
.Tn NFS
server is stateless.
.Nm Showmount
will only display the information
as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm showmount
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
