# Login access control table.
#
# When someone logs in, the table is scanned for the first entry that
# matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
# logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
# permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will
# be accepted or refused.
#
# Format of the login access control table is three fields separated by a
# ":" character:
#
# 	permission : users : origins
#
# The first field should be a "+" (access granted) or "-" (access denied)
# character. The second field should be a list of one or more login names,
# group names, or ALL (always matches).  The third field should be a list
# of one or more tty names (for non-networked logins), host names, domain
# names (begin with "."), host addresses, internet network numbers (end
# with "."), ALL (always matches) or LOCAL (matches any string that does
# not contain a "." character). If you run NIS you can use @netgroupname
# in host or user patterns.
#
# The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.
#
# The group file is searched only when a name does not match that of the
# logged-in user. Only groups are matched in which users are explicitly
# listed: the program does not look at a user's primary group id value.
