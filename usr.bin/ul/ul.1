.Nd do underlining
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl t Ar terminal
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence
which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified
by the environment variable
.Ev TERM .
The file
.Pa /etc/termcap
is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.
If the terminal is incapable of underlining, but is capable of
a standout mode then that is used instead.
If the terminal can overstrike,
or handles underlining automatically,
.Nm
degenerates to
.Xr cat 1 .
If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i
Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate
dashes
.Ql \- .
.It Fl t Ar terminal
Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with
.Ar terminal .
