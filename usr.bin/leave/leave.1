printed the next message.

All times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to
be in the next 12 hours.

.Ql Cm \&+ ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.

have to leave?". A reply of newline causes

to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.Pa .login
or
.Pa .profile.

Leave ignores interrupts, quits, and terminates.
