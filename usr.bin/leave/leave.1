have to leave.
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.Nm
exits just before it would have
printed the next message.

.It Ar hhmm
The time of day is in the form

where
.Ar hh
is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and
.Ar mm
are minutes.
All times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to
be in the next 12 hours.
.It Cm \&+
If the time is preceded by
.Sq Cm \&+ ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.

or
.Pa .profile .
