.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility removes the specified message queues, semaphores and shared memory
segments.
These System V IPC objects can be specified by their
creation ID or any associated key.
.Pp
The following options are generic:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl v
If specified once with -W or with -1 for an object, it will show
all removed objects.
If specified twice with -W or with -1 for an objects, it will show
all removed objects and all failed removals.
.It Fl W
Try to wipe all specified message queues, semaphores and shared
memory segments.
.It Fl y
Use the
.Xr kvm 3
interface instead of the
.Xr sysctl 3
interface to extract the required information.
If
.Nm
is to operate on the running system,
using
.Xr kvm 3
will require read privileges to
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.El
.Pp
The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be removed.
Any number and combination of these options can be used:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q Ar msqid
Remove the message queue associated with the ID
.Ar msqid
from the system.
.It Fl m Ar shmid
Mark the shared memory segment associated with ID
.Ar shmid
for removal.
This marked segment will be destroyed after the last detach.
.It Fl s Ar semid
Remove the semaphore set associated with ID
.Ar semid
from the system.
.It Fl Q Ar msgkey
Remove the message queue associated with key
.Ar msgkey
from the system.
.It Fl M Ar shmkey
Mark the shared memory segment associated with key
.Ar shmkey
for removal.
This marked segment will be destroyed after the last detach.
.It Fl S Ar semkey
Remove the semaphore set associated with key
.Ar semkey
from the system.
.El
.Pp
The identifiers and keys associated with these System V IPC objects can be
determined by using
.Xr ipcs 1 .
If the identifier or the key is -1, it will remove all these objects.
