.Sh NAME
.Nm gencat
.Nd NLS catalog compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar "output-file"
.Ar "input-files..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility merges the text NLS input files
.Ar "input-files..."
into a formatted message catalog file
.Ar "output-file" .
The file
.Ar "output-file"
will be created if it does not already exist.
If
.Ar "output-file"
does exist, its messages will be included in the new
.Ar "output-file" .
If set and message numbers collide, the new message text defined in
.Ar "input-files..."
will replace the old message text currently contained in
.Ar "output-file" .
.Sh INPUT FILES
The format of a message text source file is defined below.
Note that
the fields of a message text source line are separated by a single space
character: any other space characters are considered to be part of the
field contents.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Li $set Ar n comment
This line specifies the set identifier of the following messages until
the next
.Li $set
or end-of-file appears.
The argument
.Ar n
is the set identifier which is defined as a number in the range
[1, (NL_SETMAX)].
Set identifiers must occur in ascending order within
a single source file, but need not be contiguous.
Any string following
a space following the set identifier is treated as a comment.
If no
.Li $set
directive is specified in a given source file, all messages will
be located in the default message set NL_SETD.
.It Li $del Ar n comment
This line deletes messages from set
.Ar n
from a message catalog.
The
.Ar n
specifies a set number.
Any string following a space following the set
number is treated as a comment.
.It Li $ Ar comment
A line beginning with
.Li $
followed by a space is treated as a comment.
.It Ar m message-text
A message line consists of a message identifier
.Ar m
in the range [1, (NL_MSGMAX)].
The
.Ar message-text
is stored in the message catalog with the set identifier specified by
the last
.Li $set
directive, and the message identifier
.Ar m .
If the
.Ar message-text
is empty, and there is a space character following the message identifier,
an empty string is stored in the message catalog.
If the
.Ar message-text
is empty, and if there is no space character following the message
identifier, then the existing message in the current set with the
specified message identifier is deleted from the catalog.
Message
identifiers must be in ascending order within a single set, but
need not be contiguous.
The
.Ar message-text
length must be in the range [0, (NL_TEXTMAX)].
.It Li $quote Ar c
This line specifies an optional quote character
.Ar c
which can be used to surround
.Ar message-text
so that trailing space or empty messages are visible in message
source files.
By default, or if an empty
.Li $quote
directive is specified, no quoting of
.Ar message-text
will be recognized.
.El
.Pp
Empty lines in message source files are ignored.
The effect of lines
beginning with any character other than those described above is
undefined.
.Pp
Text strings can contain the following special characters and escape
sequences.
In addition, if a quote character is defined, it may be
escaped as well to embed a literal quote character.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "\eooo" -offset indent -compact
.It Li \en
line feed
.It Li \et
horizontal tab
.It Li \ev
vertical tab
.It Li \eb
backspace
.It Li \er
carriage return
.It Li \ef
form feed
.It Li \e\e
backslash
.It Li \eooo
octal number in the range [000, 377]
.El
.Pp
A backslash character immediately before the end of the line in a file
is used to continue the line onto the next line, e.g.:
.Pp
.Dl 1 This line is continued \e
.Dl on this line.
.Pp
If the character following the backslash is not one of those specified,
the backslash is ignored.
