.Dt POSIXMQCONTROL 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posixmqcontrol
.Nd Control POSIX mqueuefs message queues
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar create
.Fl q Ar queue
.Fl s Ar size
.Fl d Ar depth
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Nm
.Ar info
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar recv
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar rm
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar send
.Fl q Ar queue
.Fl c Ar content
.Op Fl p Ar priority
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command allows separating POSIX message queue administration from application
stack.
Defining and adjusting queue attributes can be done without touching
application code.
It allows creating queues, inspecting queue metadata, altering group and user
access to queues, dumping queue contents, and unlinking queues.
.Pp
Unlinking removes the name from the system and frees underlying memory.
.Pp
The maximum message size, maximum queue size, and current queue size are
displayed by the
.Ic info
subcommand. This output is similar to running
.Ic cat
on a mqueuefs queue mounted under a mount point.
This utility requires the
.Ic mqueuefs
kernel module to be loaded but does not require
.Ic mqueuefs
to be mounted as a file system.
.Pp
The following subcommands are provided:
.Bl -tag -width truncate
.It Ic create
Create the named queues, if they do not already exist.
More than one queue name may be created. The same maximum queue depth and
maximum message size are used to create all queues.
If a queue exists, then depth and size are optional.
.Pp
The required
.Ar size
and
.Ar depth
arguments specify the maximum message size (bytes per message) and maximum queue
size (depth or number of messages in the queue).
The optional numerical
.Ar mode
argument specifies the initial access mode.
If the queue exists but does not match the requested size and depth, this
utility will attempt to recreate the queue by first unlinking and then creating
it.
This will fail if the queue is not empty or is opened by other processes.
.It Ic rm
Unlink the queues specified - one attempt per queue.
Failure to unlink one queue does not stop this sub-command from attempting to
unlink the others.
.It Ic info
For each named queue, dispay the maximum message size, maximum queue size,
current queue depth, user owner id, group owner id, and mode permission bits.
.It Ic recv
Wait for a message from a single named queue and display the message to
standard output.
.It Ic send
Send messages to one or more named queues.
If multiple messages and multiple queues are specified, the utility attempts to
send all messages to all queues.
The optional -p priority, if omitted, defaults to MQ_PRIO_MAX / 2 or medium
priority.
.El
.Sh NOTES
A change of queue geometry (maximum message size and/or maximum number of
messages) requires destroying and re-creating the queue.
As a safety feature,
the create subcommand refuses to destroy a non-empty queue.
If you use the rm subcommand to destroy a queue, any queued messages are lost.
To avoid down-time when altering queue attributes, consider creating a new
queue and configure reading applications to drain both new and old queues.
Retire the old queue once all writers have been updated to write to the new
queue.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Bl -bullet
.It
EX_NOTAVAILABLE usually means the mqueuefs kernel module is not loaded.
.It
EX_USAGE reports one or more incorrect parameters.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
To retrieve the current message from a named queue,
.Pa /1 ,
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol recv -q /1"
.It
To create a queue with the name
.Pa /2
with maximum message size 100 and maximum queue depth 10,
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol create -q /2 -s 100 -d 10"
.It
To send a message to a queue with the name
.Pa /3
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol send -q /3 -c 'some choice words.'"
.It
To examine attributes of a queue named
.Pa /4
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol info -q /4"
