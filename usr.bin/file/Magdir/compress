# compress:  file(1) magic for pure-compression formats (no archives)
#
# compress, gzip, pack, compact, huf, squeeze, crunch, freeze, yabba, etc.
#
# Formats for various forms of compressed data
# Formats for "compress" proper have been moved into "compress.c",
# because it tries to uncompress it to figure out what's inside.

# Squeeze and Crunch...
# These numbers were gleaned from the Unix versions of the programs to
# handle these formats.  Note that I can only uncrunch, not crunch, and
# I didn't have a crunched file handy, so the crunch number is untested.

# European GSM 06.10 is a provisional standard for full-rate speech

# There's only a magic nibble (4 bits); that nibble repeats every 33
# bytes.  This isn't suited for use, but maybe we can use it someday.
#
# This will cause very short GSM files to be declared as data and
# mismatches to be declared as data too!
