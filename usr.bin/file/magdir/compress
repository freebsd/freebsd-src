# Formats for various forms of compressed data
# Formats for "compress" proper have been moved into "compress.c",
# because it tries to uncompress it to figure out what's inside.
#
# XXX - the two "packed data" versions are byte-swapped versions of
# one another; is that because the 2-byte magic number is written
# out in native byte order, with "unpack" figuring out the byte order
# from the magic number (in which case both can be left as is, or
# changed to specify a byte order *and* to indicate the byte order of
# the packing machine), or because the old "file" didn't have any way of
# having "magic"-file entries that specified a particular byte order?

# Squeeze and Crunch, from Keith Waclena <keith@cerberus.uchicago.edu>
# These numbers were gleaned from the Unix versions of the programs to
# handle these formats.  Note that I can only uncrunch, not crunch, and
# I didn't have a crunched file handy, so the crunch number is untested.
