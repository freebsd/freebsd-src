.Fl q
.Op Fl p Ar pid | command
.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Pp
Which execution parameter is changed, selected by the mandatory
parameter
.Ar mode .
Possible values for
.Ar mode
are:
.Bl -tag -width logsigexit
.It Ar aslr
Control the Address Space Layout Randomization.
Only applicable to the new process spawned.
.It Ar trace
Control the permission for debuggers to attach.
Note that process is only allowed to enable tracing for itself,
not for any other process.
.It Ar trapcap
Controls the signalling of capability mode access violations.
.It Ar protmax
Controls the implicit PROT_MAX application for
.Xr mmap 2 .
.It Ar nonewprivs
Controls disabling the setuid and sgid bits for
.Xr execve 2 .
.It Ar wxmap
Controls the write exclusive execute mode for mappings.
.It Ar kpti
Controls the KPTI enable, AMD64 only.
.It Ar la48
Control limiting usermode process address space to 48 bits of address,
AMD64 only, on machines capable of 57-bit addressing.
.It Ar logsigexit
Controls the logging of exits due to a signal that would normally cause a core
dump.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar control
specifies if the selected
.Ar mode

To disable debuggers attachment to the process 1020, execute
.Dl "proccontrol -m trace -s disable -p 1020"
.It
To execute the
.Xr uniq 1
program in a mode where capability access violations cause
.Dv SIGTRAP
delivery, do
.Dl "proccontrol -m trapcap uniq"
