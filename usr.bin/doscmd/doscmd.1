.Nm doscmd
.Nd run a subset of real-mode DOS programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm doscmd
.Fl 23AbDEfHIMOPRrtVvXxYz
.Fl c Ar file
.Fl d Ar file
.Fl i Ar port Ns Xo 
.Op : Ns Ar cnt
.Xc
.Fl o Ar port Ns Xo 
.Op : Ns Ar cnt
.Xc
.Fl S Ar int
.Fl U Ar int
.Op Ar cmd [args ...]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Doscmd
can either emulate a subset of DOS and run the
single command
.Ar cmd
.Ar args ,
or it can be used to emulate a PC and boot DOS,
which allows it to run a larger variety of DOS applications.
It should be noted that MS DOS 6.2 and higher appear
to cause difficulties for
.Nm doscmd.
To boot DOS, either provide the 
.Fl b
flag or omit the
.Ar cmd
argument.
If
.Fl b
is specified,
.Ar cmd
and
.Ar args
are ignored.
.Pp
Although 
.Nm doscmd
only provides a subset of DOS, it is sufficient to run a variety of
programs, including, but not limited to, compilers, assemblers and
linker-loaders.
.Pp
The various flags available to
.Nm doscmd
are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 2
Enable debugging traces of every trap to the
.Nm doscmd
emulator from the DOS program.
Note that some traps are handled in the kernel and hence will not
be traced.
.It Fl 3
Enable debugging of several lower level functions, such
as changing of interrupt vectors and initializing paths to logical drives.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl A
Enable tracing of all interrupts that pass into the emulator.
This is the same as using the
.Fl S
option with all 256 possible interrupt values.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl b
Attempt to boot DOS rather than emulate it.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl c Ar file
Capture all output directed at the screen into
.Ar file .
Note that direct screen writes will not be captured.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl C
List MS-DOS calls emulated and their return values.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl D
Enable debugging of the disk and file operations.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl d Ar file
Send the debug output to
.Ar file
instead of stderr.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl E
Enable debugging of the exec routines.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl H
Enable tracing of half implemented calls.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl I
Enable tracing of all interrupts.  Almost the same as
.Fl A
except a few less traces are turned on.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl i Ar port Ns Xo
.Op : Ns Ar cnt
.Xc
Enable tracing of all inputs requested from the io
.Ar port .
If
.Ar cnt
is present, trace from
.Ar port
to
.Ar port+cnt Ns No -1 .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl M
Enable debugging of the memory operations.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl O
Direct the debugging output to stdout rather than stderr.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl o Ar port Ns Xo
.Op : Ns Ar cnt
.Xc
Enable tracing of all outputs requested from the io
.Ar port .
If
.Ar cnt
is present, trace from
.Ar port
to
.Ar port+cnt Ns No -1 .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl p Ar port Ns Xo
.Op : Ns Ar cnt
.Xc
Map the requested io
.Ar port
(with optional range up to to
.Ar port+cnt Ns No -1 )
to the real hardware I/O port(s).
This will likely require root privs to access them.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl P
Enable tracing of io port calls (such as
.Li inb ,
.Li outb ,
etc).
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl R
Enable debugging of the file redirect code.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl r
Use the raw keyboard and display.  Pressing <CTRL-ALT-DEL> will
cause doscmd to exit.  This allows use of VGA graphics.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl S Ar int
Enable tracing of the interrupt
.Ar int .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl t
Attempt to do instruction level tracing.
Some instructions confuse the trace.
Pressing
.Li <CTRL-ALT-T>
attempts to toggle the trace mode on and off.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl U Ar int
Disable tracing of the interrupt
.Ar int .
Useful after
.Fl A
or
.Fl I .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl V
Include register dumps when reporting unknown interrupts.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl v
Same as
.Fl AH
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl X
Enable debugging of the XMS operations.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl x
Open an X11 window to display output.  This enables a
variety interrupts not available otherwise.  This
can be used with or without
.Fl b .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl Y
Enable debugging of the EMS operations.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Fl z
Cause
.Nm doscmd
to pause just prior to jumping to the DOS program.
Very little use except for developing
.Nm doscmd .
.El
.Pp
When starting up,
.Nm doscmd
attempts to read a configuration file.  First the file
.Cm .doscmdrc
in the current directory.  If not found there, the
.Cm $HOME
directory is searched.  If still not found, the file
.Cm /etc/doscmdrc
is used.
.Pp
In the configuration file, a comment is started with the \fB#\fP character.
Blank lines are ignored.
Non empty lines either are environment variables
or commands which configure devices.
Any line which has an \fB=\fP before any white space is considered to be
an environment variable assignment and is added to the DOS environment.
The rest of the lines are one of the following
.Bl -tag -width XXXXX
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm boot Op Cm A: | C:
Set the device to boot from.
By default
.Cm A:
is first tried, if it is defined, and if that fails,
.Cm C:
is tried.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm assign Xo
.Op Cm A-Z :
.Op Fl ro
.Ar path
.Xc
Assigns the
.Nm BSD/OS
directory
.Ar path
to be assigned as the specified drive.  If the
.Fl ro
flag is specified, it is a read only file system.
These assignments will not take place when booting DOS until the
.Pa /usr/libdata/doscmd/redir.com
binary is run.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm assign Xo
.Cm lpt Ns Op Cm 0-4 :
.Op Cm direct
.Ar path
.Op Ar timeout
.Xc
Attempt to assign the specified printer to
.Ar path .
If
.Ar timeout
is specified then use it as the length of time for no
activity (in seconds) to indicate that the printer
should be flushed.  The default is 30 seconds.
The
.Cm direct
option should be set when
.Ar path
refers to a real printer.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm assign Xo
.Op Cm A: | B:
.Op Fl ro
.Ar path
.Ar density
.Xc
.It Cm assign Xo
.Cm flop Ns Op Cm 01
.Op Fl ro
.Ar path
.Ar density
.Xc
Assign the file
.Ar path
to be used as either the next available floppy or
to the specified floppy.
If
.Fl ro
is specified the floppy will be read only.
The
.Ar density
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 1440x
.It 180
9 head 40 track single sided floppy
.It 360
9 head 40 track double sided floppy
.It 720

15 head 80 track double sided floppy
.It 1440
18 head 80 track double sided floppy
.It 2880
36 head 80 track double sided floppy
.El
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm assign Xo
.Op Cm C-Z  :
.Op Fl ro
.Ar path
.Op Ar type | cyl head sec
.Op Ar fdisk_tab
.Xc
.It Cm assign Xo
.Cm hard Ns Op Cm 01
.Op Fl ro
.Ar path
.Op Ar type | cyl head sec
.Op Ar fdisk_tab
.Xc
Assign the file
.Ar path
to be used as either the next available hard disk or
to the specified hard disk.
A disk's geometry can either be directly specified with
.Ar cyl
being the number of cylinders,
.Ar head
the number of heads and
.Ar sec
the number of sectors per track,
or it can be one of the standard types specified by
.Ar type 
(see below).
The option
.Ar fdisk_tab
argument specifies file to use as the first sector
of this disk.  This can be useful for inserting a
false fdisk table when
.Ar path
only refers to part of a disk.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm assign Xo
.Cm com Ns Op Cm 1-4 :
.Ar path
.Ar port
.Ar irq
.Xc
Assign the tty or pty specified by
.Ar path
to be used as the specified com port.
It's base address will be emulated at
.Ar port
at interrupt specified by
.Ar irq .
This code is lightly tested and may not suit all needs.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm portmap Xo
.Ar port
.Op Ar count
.Xc
Map the requested io
.Ar port
(with optional range up to to
.Ar port+count Ns No -1 )
to the real hardware I/O port(s).
This will likely require root privs to access them.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.It Cm "setver command version"
Cause doscmd, when emulating DOS, to report
.Cm version
as the version number of DOS when called from the program named
.Cm command .
The format of
.Cm version
is the same as of the
.Cm MS_VERSION
variable described below.
.El
.Pp
If not already assigned,
.Cm C:
will be assigned to the root directory (/) and the current directory
for
.Cm C:
will be set to the actual current directory.
Note that this means that invocations such as:
.Pp
.Dl "doscmd ../foo
.Pp
will not work as the
.Cm C:
directory will start with the current path.
Also, the following environment variables will be defined if not
already defined:
.Bd -literal
.Cm "COMSPEC=C:\eCOMMAND.COM
.Cm "PATH=C:\e
.Cm "PROMPT=DOS> 
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Cm PATH
variable is also used to find
.Ar cmd .
Like DOS, first
.Ar cmd.com
will be looked for and then
.Ar cmd.exe .
.Sh "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.Pp
There are several variables in the 
.Cm .doscmdrc
file which are internal to doscmd and do not actually get inserted into
the DOS environment.  These are:
.Bl -tag -width MS_VERSION
.It Cm MS_VERSION
The value of this variable is used to determine the version of DOS that
should be reported by
.Nm doscmd .
Note that
.Nm doscmd
will not change the way
it works, just the way it reports.  By default this value is
.Cm 410 ,
which corresponds to
.Nm "MS DOS
version
.Nm 4.1 .
To change it to version 3.2 (the default in previous versions of
.Nm doscmd )
use the value of
.Cm 320 .
.It Cm X11_FONT
The value of this variable determines the font used in an X window.
The default font is
.Cm vga ,
which is installed in
.Pa /usr/libdata/doscmd/fonts .
Add the line
.Ql xset fp+ /usr/libdata/doscmd/fonts
to your
.Pa ${HOME}/.xsession
or
.Pa ${HOME}/.xinitrc
to let the X server find it.
.Sh FILE TRANSLATION
.Nm Doscmd
translates
.Nm BSD/OS
file names into 
.Nm DOS
file names by converting to all upper case and eliminating any invalid
character.  It does not make any attempt to convert ASCII files into
the
.Cm <CR><LF>
format favored in the DOS world.  Use
.Xr fconv 1
(part of the ports collection) or similar tools to convert ASCII files.

.Sh INSTALLING DOS ON A PSEUDO DISK
.Pp
To install DOS on a pseudo hard disk under doscmd, do the following:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It 1
Create a 
.Pa .doscmdrc
with at least the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
assign A: /dev/fd0.1440 1440
assign A: /dev/fd0.720 720
assign hard boot_drive 80 2 2
.Ed
.Pp
You may need to adjust the raw files for the A: drive to match
your system.  This example will cause the HD drive to be tried
first and the DD drive second.
.Pp
Note that you should only use raw devices or files at this point,
do not use a cooked device!  (Well, it would probably be okay
for a hard disk, but certainly not the floppy)
.Pp
.Li boot_drive
should be the file name of where you want your bootable
image to be.  The three numbers which follow
.Li 80 2 2
say that the drive will have 80 cylinders, 2 heads and 2 sectors per track.
This is the smallest drive possible which still can have MS DOS
5.0 installed on it along with a
.Pa config.sys
and
.Pa autoexec.bat
file.
.Pp
You might want to create a larger boot drive.
.Pp
The file
.Pa boot_drive
must exist, so use the command touch to create it.
.It 2
Insert a floppy disk into the A: drive which is bootable to MS-DOS
and has the commands fdisk, format and sys on it.  You should also
copy the file redir.com onto the floppy by either mounting it
with the msdos file system type or by using mtools
(e.g.,
.Li mwrite redir.com a: ).
.It 3
run doscmd.
.It 4
At the > prompt type
.Li fdisk .
.It 5
Select 
.Li Create DOS partition or Logical Drive .
.It 6
Select 
.Li Create Primary DOS Partition .
.It 7
Tell it how big to make it
(Typically the whole drive.  It is pretty tiny after all.)
.It 8
Get out of FDISK by hitting
.Li <ESC>
a few times.
.It 9
doscmd may abort, if it does, start up doscmd again.
.It 10
At the > prompt, type
.Li format c:
and follow the instructions.
.It 11
At the > prompt type
.Li sys c: .
.It 12
Get out of doscmd.
.It 13
Either remove the floppy from the drive or add the line
.Bd -literal -offset indent 
boot C:
.Ed
to your
.Pa .doscmdrc .
.It 14
You should now be running DOS off of your new disk.  You will
probably want both config.sys and an autoexec.bat file.  To
start with, you can say:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
> copy con: config.sys
LASTDRIVE=Z
^Z
> copy con: autoexec.bat
@echo off
redir.com
^Z
.Ed
.It 15
Quit doscmd.
.It 16
You know have a bootable pseudo disk which will automatically call
the magic 
.Li redir
program, which installs FreeBSD disks.  To use
them add lines to your .doscmdrc such as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
assign D: /usr/dos
assign P: -ro /usr/prb
.Ed
Note that you will not always be able to access every file due to
naming problems.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Pp
If
.Nm doscmd
encounters an interrupt which is unimplemented, it will print a message
such as:
.Pp
.Dl Unknown interrupt 21 function 99
.Pp
and exit.
.Pp
If
.Nm
emits the message 
.Ic X11 support not compiled in
when supplied the
.Fl x
switch, this support can be added by defining an environment variable
.Ev X11BASE
which points to the installed X Window System (normally
.Pa /usr/X11R6
) and then typing 
.Ic make install
in the source directory (normally 
.Pa /usr/src/usr.bin/doscmd 
).  For this to work, the X programmer's kit must have been installed.
