.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a | m
.Nm
.Fl k
.Ic list
.Op Ar prefix
.Nm
.Op Fl ck
.Op Ar keyword ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is supposed to provide most locale specific information to
the standard output.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked without arguments, it will print out a summary of the current
locale environment, subject to the environment settings and
internal status.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with the
.Ar keyword
arguments, and no options are specified, it will print out the
values of all keywords specified, using the current locale settings.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Print names of all available locales.
While looking for locales,
.Nm
will respect the
.Ev PATH_LOCALE
environment variable, and use it instead of the system's default locale
directory.
.It Fl c
Print the category name for all selected keywords.
If no keywords are selected, print the category name for all defined
keywords.
.It Fl k
Print the names and values of all selected keywords.
If no keywords are selected, print the names and values of all defined
keywords.
.It Fl m
Print names of all available charmaps.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The special
.Pf ( Fx
specific) keyword
.Cm list
can be used to retrieve the human readable list of all available keywords.
If so,
a prefix string can be defined to limit the amount of keywords returned.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2004 .
The
.Ev LC_CTYPE ,
.Ev LC_MESSAGES
and
.Ev NLSPATH
environment variables are not interpreted.
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Fx
does not support
.Em charmap Ns s
in their
.Tn POSIX
meaning,
.Nm
emulates the
.Fl m
option using the CODESETs listing of all available locales.
