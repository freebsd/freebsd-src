.Nd dump ISO-9660 El Torito boot catalog information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program reads El Torito boot catalog information
from an ISO-9660 image and outputs it in various formats.
It can be used to check the catalog in an image or
to output catalog data in a format that can be used by other tools
such as shell scripts.
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl f Ar format | Fl -format Ar format
Select the output format.
Supported output formats are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm text
Human-readable text (default)
.It Cm shell
Each boot entry is emitted as a string
suitable for passing to a sh-compatible eval command.
The variables emitted are:
.Bl -tag -width "et_platform"
.It Dv et_platform
The platform ID from the section header.
Set to 'default' for the initial (default) entry.
.It Dv et_system
The system ID from the boot entry.
.It Dv et_lba
The starting LBA (2048-byte blocks) of the boot image.
.It Dv et_sectors
The number of sectors (512-byte sectors) that comprise the boot image.
.El
.El
.It Fl o Ar file | Fl -output Ar file
Write output to
.Ar file .
If
.Ql -
is specified then standard out is used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see what entries are in a given boot catalog run
.Nm
passing the filename of the image as an argument like so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% etdump bootonly.iso
Image in bootonly.iso
Default entry
	System i386
	Start LBA 420 (0x1a4), sector count 4 (0x4)
	Media type: no emulation

Section header: efi, final
	Section entry
		System i386
		Start LBA 20 (0x14), sector count 1600 (0x640)
		Media type: no emulation
.Ed
.Pp
To use the output in a shell script a for loop can be used
to iterate over the entries returned using eval:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
for entry in `etdump --format shell bootonly.iso`; do
	eval $entry
	echo $et_platform $et_system $et_lba $et_sectors
done
