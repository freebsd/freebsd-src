.Sh NAME
.Nm cu
.Nd call UNIX
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ehot
.Op Fl a Ar acu
.Op Fl l Ar line
.Op Fl s Ar speed \*(Ba Fl speed
.Op Ar phone-number
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
establishes a full-duplex connection to another machine, giving the
appearance of being logged in directly on the remote CPU.
It goes without saying that you must have a login on the machine (or
equivalent) to which you wish to connect.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl a Ar acu
Set the acu.
.It Fl e
Use even parity.
If both
.Fl e
and
.Fl o
are given, then no parity is used
(the default).
.It Fl h
Echo characters locally (half-duplex mode).
.It Fl l Ar line
Specify the line to use.
Either of the forms like
.Pa tty00
or
.Pa /dev/tty00
are permitted.
.It Fl o
Use odd parity.
If both
.Fl e
and
.Fl o
are given, then no parity is used
(the default).
.It Fl s Ar speed \*(Ba Fl speed
Set the speed of the connection.
The default is 9600.
.It Fl t
Connect via a hard-wired connection to a host on a dial-up line.
.El
.Pp
Typed characters are normally transmitted directly to the remote
machine (which does the echoing as well).
A tilde
.Pq Ql ~
appearing as the first character of a line is an escape signal; the
following are recognized:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Fl
.It Ic ~^D No or Ic ~.
Drop the connection and exit.
Only the connection is dropped \(en the login session is not terminated.
.It Ic ~c Op Ar name
Change directory to
.Ar name
(no argument implies change to home directory).
.It Ic ~!
Escape to a shell (exiting the shell will return to
.Nm ) .
.It Ic ~\*(Gt
Copy file from local to remote.
.Nm
prompts for the name of a local file to transmit.
.It Ic ~\*(Lt
Copy file from remote to local.
.Nm
prompts first for the name of the file to be sent, then for a command
to be executed on the remote machine.
.It Ic ~p Ar from Op Ar to
Send a file to a remote
.Ux
host.
This command causes the remote
.Ux
system to run the following command string,
sending it the
.Sq from
file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stty -echo; cat \*(Gt 'to'; stty echo
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Sq to
file isn't specified, the
.Sq from
file name is used.
This command is actually a
.Ux
specific version of the
.Ic ~\*(Gt
command.
.It Ic ~t Ar from Op Ar to
Take a file from a remote
.Ux
host.
As in the
.Ic ~p
command, the
.Sq to
file defaults to the
.Sq from
file name if it isn't specified.
The remote host executes the following command string
to send the file to
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cat 'from'; echo '' | tr '\e012' '\e01'
.Ed
.It Ic ~|
Pipe the output from a remote command to a local
.Ux
process.
The command string sent to the local
.Ux
system is processed by the shell.
.It Ic ~$
Pipe the output from a local
.Ux
process to the remote host.
The command string sent to the local
.Ux
system is processed by the shell.
.It Ic ~C
Fork a child process on the local system to perform special protocols
such as \s-1XMODEM\s+1.
The child program will be run with the following arrangement of
file descriptors:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0 \*(Lt-\*(Gt remote tty in
1 \*(Lt-\*(Gt remote tty out
2 \*(Lt-\*(Gt local tty stderr
.Ed
.It Ic ~#
Send a
.Dv BREAK
to the remote system.
For systems which don't support the necessary
.Fn ioctl
call, the break is simulated by a sequence of line speed changes and
DEL characters.
.It Ic ~s
Set a variable (see the discussion below).
.It Ic ~v
List all variables and their values (if set).
.It Ic ~^Z
Stop
.Nm
(only available with job control).
.It Ic ~^Y
Stop only the
.Dq local side
of
.Nm
(only available with job control); the
.Dq remote side
of
.Nm ,
the side that displays output from the remote host, is left running.
.It Ic ~?
Get a summary of the tilde escapes.
.El
.Pp
When
.Nm
prompts for an argument, for example during setup of a file transfer,
the line typed may be edited with the standard erase and kill characters.
A null line in response to a prompt, or an interrupt, will abort the
dialogue and return the user to the remote machine.
.Pp
.Nm
guards against multiple users connecting to a remote system by opening
modems and terminal lines with exclusive access, and by honoring the
locking protocol used by
.Xr uucico .
.Pp
During file transfers
.Nm
provides a running count of the number of lines transferred.
When using the
.Ic ~\*(Gt
and
.Ic ~\*(Lt
commands, the
.Dq eofread
and
.Dq eofwrite
variables are used to recognize end-of-file when reading, and specify
end-of-file when writing (see below).
File transfers normally depend on hardwareflow or tandem mode for flow control.
If the remote system does not support hardwareflow or tandem mode,
.Dq echocheck
may be set to indicate
.Nm
should synchronize with the remote system on the echo of each
transmitted character.
.Pp
When
.Nm
must dial a phone number to connect to a system, it will print various
messages indicating its actions.
.Nm
supports a variety of auto-call units and modems with the
.Ar at
capability in system descriptions.
.Pp
Support for Ventel 212+	(ventel), Hayes AT-style (hayes),
USRobotics Courier (courier), Telebit T3000 (t3000) and
Racal-Vadic 831 (vadic) units is enabled by default.
.Pp
Support for Bizcomp 1031[fw] (biz31[fw]), Bizcomp 1022[fw]
(biz22[fw]), DEC DF0[23]-AC (df0[23]), DEC DN-11 (dn11) and
Racal-Vadic 3451 (v3451) units can be added by recompiling
.Nm
with the appropriate defines.
.Pp
Note that if support for both the Racal-Vadic 831 and 3451 is enabled,
they are referred to as the v831 and v3451 respectively.
If only one of the two is supported, it is referred to as vadic.
.Ss VARIABLES
.Nm
maintains a set of variables which control its operation.
Some of these variables are read-only to normal users (root is allowed
to change anything of interest).
Variables may be displayed and set through the
.Sq s
escape.
The syntax for variables is patterned after
.Xr vi 1
and
.Xr Mail 1 .
Supplying
.Dq all
as an argument to the set command displays all variables readable by
the user.
Alternatively, the user may request display of a particular variable
by attaching a
.Ql \&?
to the end.
For example,
.Dq escape?
displays the current escape character.
.Pp
Variables are numeric, string, character, or boolean values.
Boolean variables are set merely by specifying their name; they may be
reset by prepending a
.Ql !\&
to the name.
Other variable types are set by concatenating an
.Ql =
and the value.
The entire assignment must not have any blanks in it.
A single set command may be used to interrogate as well as set a
number of variables.
Certain common variables have abbreviations.
The following is a list of common variables, their abbreviations, and
their default values:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar baudrate
(num) The baud rate at which the connection was established;
abbreviated
.Ar ba .
.It Ar beautify

.Ic ~\*(Gt
file transfer command; abbreviated
