.Nm tsort
.Nd topological sort of a directed graph
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl q
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tsort
takes a list of pairs of node names representing directed arcs in
a graph and prints the nodes in topological order on standard output.
Input is taken from the named
.Ar file ,
or from standard input if no file
is given.
.Pp
Node names in the input are separated by white space and there must
be an even number of nodes.
.Pp
Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from the node
to itself.
This is useful when a node is not connected to any other nodes.
.Pp
If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly sorted),
one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues.
Cycles are reported on standard error.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Turn on debugging.
.It Fl l
Search for and display the longest cycle.
Can take a very long time.
.It Fl q
Do not display informational messages about cycles.  This is primarily
intended for building libraries, where optimal ordering is not critical,
and cycles occur often.
