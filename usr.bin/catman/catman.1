.Sh NAME
.Nm catman
.Nd "preformat man pages"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fnrvL
.Op Ar directories ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility preformats all the man pages in
.Ar directories
using the
.Nm nroff Fl man
command.
Directories may be separated by colons instead of spaces.
If no
.Ar directories
are specified, the contents of the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable is used, or if that is not set, the default directory
.Pa /usr/share/man
is processed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Force all man pages to be reformatted even if the corresponding cat page
is newer.
.It Fl L
Process only localized subdirectories corresponding to the locale specified
in the standard environment variables.
.It Fl n
Print out what would be done instead of performing any formatting.
.It Fl r
Scan for and remove
.Dq junk
files that are neither man pages nor their
corresponding formatted cat pages.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm
to be more verbose about what it is doing.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev MANPATH" -compact
.It Ev LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE , LANG
These variables control what subdirectories will be processed if the
.Fl L
option is used.
