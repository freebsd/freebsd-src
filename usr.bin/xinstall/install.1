.Nm install
.Op Fl Ccdps

.Ar file1
\&...
.Ar fileN directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is overwritten if permissions
allow.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl c
option is specified,
except if the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then don't change the modification time of the target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This flag turns off the default behavior of
.Nm install
where it deletes the original file after creating the target.
.It Fl D 
Print debugging information.
If
.Fl d
is specified one or more times,
then print the renaming steps for
.Fl C .
If
.Fl d
is specified two or more times,
then warn about files that aren't installed with
.Fl C .
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group. A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod  1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner. A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(Compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file doesn't already exist or is different,
then preserve the modification time of the file.
.It Fl s
.Nm Install
exec's the command
.Xr strip  1
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm install
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm install
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Pp
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@XXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXX
If the
.Fl C
or
.Fl p
option is used, then temporary files named INS@XXXX,
where XXXX is decided by

are created in the target directory.
