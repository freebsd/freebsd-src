Some options have the general meaning:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl f Ar address_family , Fl p Ar protocol
Limit display to those records
of the specified
.Ar address_family
or a single
.Ar protocol .
The following address families and protocols are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm netgraph , ng Pq Dv AF_NETGRAPH" -compact
.It Em Family
.Em Protocols
.It Cm inet Pq Dv AF_INET
.Cm divert , icmp , igmp , ip , ipsec , pim, tcp , udp

.Cm icmp6 , ip6 , ipsec6 , rip6 , tcp , udp
.It Cm pfkey Pq Dv PF_KEY
.Cm pfkey
.It Cm atalk Pq Dv AF_APPLETALK
.Cm ddp
.It Cm netgraph , ng Pq Dv AF_NETGRAPH
.Cm ctrl , data

.\".It Cm iso Pq Dv AF_ISO
.\".Cm clnp , cltp , esis , tp
.It Cm unix Pq Dv AF_UNIX
.It Cm link Pq Dv AF_LINK
.El
.Pp
The program will complain if
.Ar protocol
is unknown or if there is no statistics routine for it.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default,
which is the kernel image the system has booted from.
.It Fl n
Show network addresses and ports as numbers.
Normally
.Nm
attempts to resolve addresses and ports,
and display them symbolically.
.It Fl W
In certain displays, avoid truncating addresses even if this causes
some fields to overflow.
.El
.Pp
The default display, for active sockets, shows the local
and remote addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol,
and the internal state of the protocol.
Address formats are of the form
.Dq host.port
or
.Dq network.port
if a socket's address specifies a network but no specific host address.
When known, the host and network addresses are displayed symbolically
according to the databases
.Xr hosts 5
and
.Xr networks 5 ,
respectively.
If a symbolic name for an address is unknown, or if
the
.Fl n
option is specified, the address is printed numerically, according
to the address family.
For more information regarding
the Internet IPv4
.Dq dot format ,
refer to
.Xr inet 3 .
Unspecified,
or
.Dq wildcard ,
addresses and ports appear as
.Dq Li * .
.Pp
The interface display provides a table of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and collisions.
The network addresses of the interface
and the maximum transmission unit
.Pq Dq mtu
are also displayed.
.Pp
The routing table display indicates the available routes and their status.
Each route consists of a destination host or network, and a gateway to use
in forwarding packets.
The flags field shows a collection of information about the route stored
as binary choices.
The individual flags are discussed in more detail in the
.Xr route 8
and
.Xr route 4
manual pages.
The mapping between letters and flags is:
.Bl -column ".Li W" ".Dv RTF_WASCLONED"
.It Li 1 Ta Dv RTF_PROTO1 Ta "Protocol specific routing flag #1"
.It Li 2 Ta Dv RTF_PROTO2 Ta "Protocol specific routing flag #2"
.It Li 3 Ta Dv RTF_PROTO3 Ta "Protocol specific routing flag #3"
.It Li B Ta Dv RTF_BLACKHOLE Ta "Just discard pkts (during updates)"
.It Li b Ta Dv RTF_BROADCAST Ta "The route represents a broadcast address"
.It Li C Ta Dv RTF_CLONING Ta "Generate new routes on use"
.It Li c Ta Dv RTF_PRCLONING Ta "Protocol-specified generate new routes on use"
.It Li D Ta Dv RTF_DYNAMIC Ta "Created dynamically (by redirect)"
.It Li G Ta Dv RTF_GATEWAY Ta "Destination requires forwarding by intermediary"
.It Li H Ta Dv RTF_HOST Ta "Host entry (net otherwise)"
.It Li L Ta Dv RTF_LLINFO Ta "Valid protocol to link address translation"
.It Li M Ta Dv RTF_MODIFIED Ta "Modified dynamically (by redirect)"
.It Li R Ta Dv RTF_REJECT Ta "Host or net unreachable"
.It Li S Ta Dv RTF_STATIC Ta "Manually added"
.It Li U Ta Dv RTF_UP Ta "Route usable"
.It Li W Ta Dv RTF_WASCLONED Ta "Route was generated as a result of cloning"
.It Li X Ta Dv RTF_XRESOLVE Ta "External daemon translates proto to link address"
.El
.Pp
Direct routes are created for each
interface attached to the local host;
the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.
The refcnt field gives the
current number of active uses of the route.
Connection oriented
protocols normally hold on to a single route for the duration of
a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route while sending
to the same destination.
The use field provides a count of the number of packets
sent using that route.
The interface entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with the
.Fl w
option and a
.Ar wait
interval argument, it displays a running count of statistics related to
network interfaces.
An obsolescent version of this option used a numeric parameter
with no option, and is currently supported for backward compatibility.
By default, this display summarizes information for all interfaces.
Information for a specific interface may be displayed with the
.Fl I
option.
