.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Make
is a program designed to simplify the maintenance of other programs.
Its input is a list of specifications as to the files upon which programs
and other files depend.
If the file
.Ql Pa makefile
exists, it is read for this list of specifications.
If it does not exist, the file
.Ql Pa Makefile
is read.
If the file
.Ql Pa .depend
exists, it is read (see
.Xr mkdep 1) .
.Pp
This manual page is intended as a reference document only.
For a more thorough description of
.Nm make
and makefiles, please refer to
.%T "Make \- A Tutorial" .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Try to be backwards compatible by executing a single shell per command and
by executing the commands to make the sources of a dependency line in sequence.
.It Fl D Ar variable
Define
.Ar variable
to be 1, in the global context.
.It Fl d Ar flags
Turn on debugging, and specify which portions of
.Nm make
are to print debugging information.
.Ar Flags
is one or more of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar A
Print all possible debugging information;
equivalent to specifying all of the debugging flags.
.It Ar a
Print debugging information about archive searching and caching.
.It Ar c
Print debugging information about conditional evaluation.
.It Ar d
Print debugging information about directory searching and caching.
.It Ar "g1"
Print the input graph before making anything.
.It Ar "g2"
Print the input graph after making everything, or before exiting
on error.
.It Ar j
Print debugging information about running multiple shells.
.It Ar m
Print debugging information about making targets, including modification
dates.
.It Ar s
Print debugging information about suffix-transformation rules.
.It Ar t
Print debugging information about target list maintenance.
.It Ar v
Print debugging information about variable assignment.
.El
.It Fl e
Specify that environment variables override macro assignments within
makefiles.
.It Fl f Ar makefile
Specify a makefile to read instead of the default
.Ql Pa makefile
and
.Ql Pa Makefile .
If
.Ar makefile
is
.Ql Fl ,
standard input is read.
Multiple makefile's may be specified, and are read in the order specified.
.It Fl I Ar directory
Specify a directory in which to search for makefiles and included makefiles.
The system makefile directory (or directories, see the
.Fl m
option) is automatically included as part of this list.
.It Fl i
Ignore non-zero exit of shell commands in the makefile.
Equivalent to specifying
.Ql Fl
before each command line in the makefile.
.It Fl j Ar max_jobs
Specify the maximum number of jobs that
.Nm make
may have running at any one time. Turns compatibility mode off, unless the
.Ar B
flag is also specified.
.It Fl k
Continue processing after errors are encountered, but only on those targets
that do not depend on the target whose creation caused the error.
.It Fl m Ar directory
Specify a directory in which to search for sys.mk and makefiles included
via the <...> style.  Multiple directories can be added to form a search path.
This path will override the default system include path: /usr/share/mk.
Furthermore the system include path will be appended to the search path used
for "..."-style inclusions (see the
.Fl I
option).
.It Fl n
Display the commands that would have been executed, but do not actually
execute them.
.It Fl q
Do not execute any commands, but exit 0 if the specified targets are
up-to-date and 1, otherwise.
.It Fl r
Do not use the built-in rules specified in the system makefile.
.It Fl s
Do not echo any commands as they are executed.
Equivalent to specifying
.Ql Ic @
before each command line in the makefile.
.It Fl t
Rather than re-building a target as specified in the makefile, create it
or update its modification time to make it appear up-to-date.
.It Fl V Ar variable
Print
.Nm make Ns 's
idea of the value of
.Ar variable ,
in the global context.
Do not build any targets.
Multiple instances of this option may be specified;
the variables will be printed one per line,
with a blank line for each null or undefined variable.
.It Ar variable=value
Set the value of the variable
.Ar variable
to
.Ar value .
.El
.Pp
There are seven different types of lines in a makefile: file dependency
specifications, shell commands, variable assignments, include statements,
conditional directives, for loops, and comments.
.Pp
In general, lines may be continued from one line to the next by ending
them with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
The trailing newline character and initial whitespace on the following
line are compressed into a single space.
.Sh FILE DEPENDENCY SPECIFICATIONS
Dependency lines consist of one or more targets, an operator, and zero
or more sources.
This creates a relationship where the targets ``depend'' on the sources
and are usually created from them.
The exact relationship between the target and the source is determined
by the operator that separates them.
The three operators are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Ic \&:
A target is considered out-of-date if its modification time is less than
those of any of its sources.
Sources for a target accumulate over dependency lines when this operator
is used.
The target is removed if
.Nm make
is interrupted.
.It Ic \&!
Targets are always re-created, but not until all sources have been
examined and re-created as necessary.
Sources for a target accumulate over dependency lines when this operator
is used.
The target is removed if
.Nm make
is interrupted.
.It Ic \&::
If no sources are specified, the target is always re-created.
Otherwise, a target is considered out-of-date if any of its sources has
been modified more recently than the target.
Sources for a target do not accumulate over dependency lines when this
operator is used.
The target will not be removed if
.Nm make
is interrupted.
.El
.Pp
Targets and sources may contain the shell wildcard values
.Ql ? ,
.Ql * ,
.Ql []
and
.Ql {} .
The values
.Ql ? ,
.Ql *
and
.Ql []
may only be used as part of the final
component of the target or source, and must be used to describe existing
files.
The value
.Ql {}
need not necessarily be used to describe existing files.
Expansion is in directory order, not alphabetically as done in the shell.
.Sh SHELL COMMANDS
Each target may have associated with it a series of shell commands, normally
used to create the target.
Each of the commands in this script
.Em must
be preceded by a tab.
While any target may appear on a dependency line, only one of these
dependencies may be followed by a creation script, unless the
.Ql Ic ::
operator is used.
.Pp
If the first or first two characters of the command line are
.Ql Ic @
and/or
.Ql Ic \- ,
the command is treated specially.
A
.Ql Ic @
causes the command not to be echoed before it is executed.
A
.Ql Ic \-
causes any non-zero exit status of the command line to be ignored.
.Sh VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS
Variables in make are much like variables in the shell, and, by tradition,
consist of all upper-case letters.
The five operators that can be used to assign values to variables are as
follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic \&=
Assign the value to the variable.
Any previous value is overridden.
.It Ic \&+=
Append the value to the current value of the variable.
.It Ic \&?=
Assign the value to the variable if it is not already defined.
.It Ic \&:=
Assign with expansion, i.e. expand the value before assigning it
to the variable.
Normally, expansion is not done until the variable is referenced.
.It Ic \&!=
Expand the value and pass it to the shell for execution and assign
the result to the variable.
Any newlines in the result are replaced with spaces.
.El
.Pp
Any white-space before the assigned
.Ar value
is removed; if the value is being appended, a single space is inserted
between the previous contents of the variable and the appended value.
.Pp
Variables are expanded by surrounding the variable name with either
curly braces
.Pq Ql {}
or parentheses
.Pq Ql ()
and preceding it with
a dollar sign
.Pq Ql \&$ .
If the variable name contains only a single letter, the surrounding
braces or parentheses are not required.
This shorter form is not recommended.
.Pp
Variable substitution occurs at two distinct times, depending on where
the variable is being used.
Variables in dependency lines are expanded as the line is read.
Variables in shell commands are expanded when the shell command is
executed.
.Pp
The four different classes of variables (in order of increasing precedence)
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Environment variables
Variables defined as part of
.Nm make Ns 's
environment.
.It Global variables
Variables defined in the makefile or in included makefiles.
.It Command line variables
Variables defined as part of the command line.
.It Local variables
Variables that are defined specific to a certain target.
The seven local variables are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".ARCHIVE"
.It Va .ALLSRC
The list of all sources for this target; also known as
.Ql Va \&> .
.It Va .ARCHIVE
The name of the archive file.
.It Va .IMPSRC
The name/path of the source from which the target is to be transformed
(the ``implied'' source); also known as
.Ql Va \&< .
.It Va .MEMBER
The name of the archive member.
.It Va .OODATE
The list of sources for this target that were deemed out-of-date; also
known as
.Ql Va \&? .
.It Va .PREFIX
The file prefix of the file, containing only the file portion, no suffix
or preceding directory components; also known as
.Ql Va * .
.It Va .TARGET
The name of the target; also known as
.Ql Va @ .
.El
.Pp
The shorter forms
.Ql Va @ ,
.Ql Va ? ,
.Ql Va \&>
and
.Ql Va *
are permitted for backward
compatibility with historical makefiles and are not recommended.
The six variables
.Ql Va "@F" ,
.Ql Va "@D" ,
.Ql Va "<F" ,
.Ql Va "<D" ,
.Ql Va "*F"
and
.Ql Va "*D"
are
permitted for compatibility with
.At V
makefiles and are not recommended.
.Pp
Four of the local variables may be used in sources on dependency lines
because they expand to the proper value for each target on the line.
These variables are
.Ql Va .TARGET ,
.Ql Va .PREFIX ,
.Ql Va .ARCHIVE ,
and
.Ql Va .MEMBER .
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm make
sets or knows about the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width MAKEFLAGS
.It Va \&$
A single dollar sign
.Ql \&$ ,
i.e.
.Ql \&$$
expands to a single dollar
sign.
.It Va .MAKE
The name that
.Nm make
was executed with
.Pq Va argv Op 0
.It Va .CURDIR
A path to the directory where
.Nm make
was executed.
.It Va .OBJDIR
A path to the directory where the targets are built.
.It Ev MAKEFLAGS
The environment variable
.Ql Ev MAKEFLAGS
may contain anything that
may be specified on
.Nm make Ns 's
command line.
Anything specified on
.Nm make Ns 's
command line is appended to the
.Ql Ev MAKEFLAGS
variable which is then
entered into the environment for all programs which
.Nm make
executes.
.It Ev PWD
Alternate path to the current directory.
.Nm make
normally sets
.Ql Va .CURDIR
to the canonical path given by
.Xr getcwd 2 .
However, if the environment variable
.Ql Ev PWD
is set and gives a path to the current directory, then
.Nm make
sets
.Ql Va .CURDIR
to the value of
.Ql Ev PWD
instead.
.Ql Ev PWD
is set to the value of
.Ql Va .OBJDIR
for all programs which
.Nm make
executes.
.El
.Pp
Variable expansion may be modified to select or modify each word of the
variable (where a ``word'' is white-space delimited sequence of characters).
The general format of a variable expansion is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl {variable[:modifier[:...]]}
.Pp
Each modifier begins with a colon and one of the following
special characters.
The colon may be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
.Bl -tag -width Cm E\&
.It Cm E
Replaces each word in the variable with its suffix.
.It Cm H
Replaces each word in the variable with everything but the last component.
.It Cm M Ns Ar pattern
Select only those words that match the rest of the modifier.
The standard shell wildcard characters
.Pf ( Ql * ,
.Ql ? ,
and
.Ql Op )
may
be used.
The wildcard characters may be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
.It Cm N Ns Ar pattern
This is identical to
.Ql Cm M ,
but selects all words which do not match
the rest of the modifier.
.It Cm R
Replaces each word in the variable with everything but its suffix.
.Sm off
.It Cm S No \&/ Ar old_pattern Xo
.No \&/ Ar new_pattern
.No \&/ Op Cm g
.Xc
.Sm on
Modify the first occurrence of
.Ar old_pattern
in each word to be replaced with
.Ar new_pattern .
If a
.Ql g
is appended to the last slash of the pattern, all occurrences
in each word are replaced.
If
.Ar old_pattern
begins with a carat
.Pq Ql ^ ,
.Ar old_pattern
is anchored at the beginning of each word.
If
.Ar old_pattern
ends with a dollar sign
.Pq Ql \&$ ,
it is anchored at the end of each word.
Inside
.Ar new_string ,
an ampersand
.Pq Ql &
is replaced by
.Ar old_pattern .
Any character may be used as a delimiter for the parts of the modifier
string.
The anchoring, ampersand and delimiter characters may be escaped with a
backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
.Pp
Variable expansion occurs in the normal fashion inside both
.Ar old_string
and
.Ar new_string
with the single exception that a backslash is used to prevent the expansion
of a dollar sign
.Pq Ql \&$
not a preceding dollar sign as is usual.
.It Cm T
Replaces each word in the variable with its last component.
.It Ar old_string=new_string
This is the
.At V
style variable substitution.
It must be the last modifier specified.
If
.Ar old_string
or
.Ar new_string
do not contain the pattern matching character
.Ar %
then it is assumed that they are
anchored at the end of each word, so only suffixes or entire
words may be replaced. Otherwise
.Ar %
is the substring of
.Ar old_string
to be replaced in
.Ar new_string
.El
.Sh DIRECTIVES, CONDITIONALS AND FOR LOOPS
Directives, conditionals and for loops reminiscent
of the C programming language are provided in
.Nm make .
All such structures are identified by a line beginning with a single
dot
.Pq Ql \&.
character.  The following directives are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic \&.include Ar <file>
.It Ic \&.include Ar \*qfile\*q
Include the specified makefile.  Variables between the angle brackets
or double quotes are expanded to form the file name.  If angle brackets
are used, the included makefile is expected to be in the system
makefile directory.  If double quotes are used, the including
makefile's directory and any directories specified using the
.Fl I
option are searched before the system
makefile directory.
.It Ic \&.undef Ar variable
Un-define the specified global variable.
Only global variables may be un-defined.
.It Ic \&.error Ar message
Terminate processing of the makefile immediately. The filename of the
makefile, the line on which the error was encountered and the specified
message are printed to standard output and
.Nm make
terminates with exit code 1.  Variables in the message are expanded.
.El
.Pp
Conditionals are used to determine which parts of the Makefile
to process.  They are used similarly to the conditionals supported
by the C pre-processor.  The following conditionals are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic \&.if
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar expression
.Op Ar operator expression ...
.Xc
Test the value of an expression.
.It Xo
.Ic .ifdef
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable
.Op Ar operator variable ...
.Xc
Test the value of a variable.
.It Xo
.Ic .ifndef
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable
.Op Ar operator variable ...
.Xc
Test the value of a variable.
.It Xo
.Ic .ifmake
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar target
.Op Ar operator target ...
.Xc
Test the target being built.
.It Xo
.Ic .ifnmake
.Oo \&! Oc Ar target
.Op Ar operator target ...
.Xc
Test the target being built.
.It Ic .else
Reverse the sense of the last conditional.
.It Xo
.Ic .elif
.Oo \&! Oc Ar expression
.Op Ar operator expression ...
.Xc
A combination of
.Ql Ic .else
followed by
.Ql Ic .if .
.It Xo
.Ic .elifdef
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable
.Op Ar operator variable ...
.Xc
A combination of
.Ql Ic .else
followed by
.Ql Ic .ifdef .
.It Xo
.Ic .elifndef
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable
.Op Ar operator variable ...
.Xc
A combination of
.Ql Ic .else
followed by
.Ql Ic .ifndef .
.It Xo
.Ic .elifmake
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar target
.Op Ar operator target ...
.Xc
A combination of
.Ql Ic .else
followed by
.Ql Ic .ifmake .
.It Xo
.Ic .elifnmake
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar target
.Op Ar operator target ...
.Xc
A combination of
.Ql Ic .else
followed by
.Ql Ic .ifnmake .
.It Ic .endif
End the body of the conditional.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar operator
may be any one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "Cm XX"
.It Cm \&|\&|
logical OR
.It Cm \&&&
Logical
.Tn AND ;
of higher precedence than
.Dq .
.El
.Pp
As in C,
.Nm make
will only evaluate a conditional as far as is necessary to determine
its value.
Parentheses may be used to change the order of evaluation.
The boolean operator
.Ql Ic \&!
may be used to logically negate an entire
conditional.
It is of higher precedence than
.Ql Ic \&&& .
.Pp
The value of
.Ar expression
may be any of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ic defined
.It Ic defined
Takes a variable name as an argument and evaluates to true if the variable
has been defined.
.It Ic make
Takes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the target
was specified as part of
.Nm make Ns 's
command line or was declared the default target (either implicitly or
explicitly, see
.Va .MAIN )
before the line containing the conditional.
.It Ic empty
Takes a variable, with possible modifiers, and evaluates to true if
the expansion of the variable would result in an empty string.
.It Ic exists
Takes a file name as an argument and evaluates to true if the file exists.
The file is searched for on the system search path (see
.Va .PATH ) .
.It Ic target
Takes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the target
has been defined.
.El
.Pp
.Ar Expression
may also be an arithmetic or string comparison.  Variable expansion is
performed on both sides of the comparison, after which the integral
values are compared.  A value is interpreted as hexadecimal if it is
preceded by 0x, otherwise it is decimal; octal numbers are not supported.
The standard C relational operators are all supported.  If after
variable expansion, either the left or right hand side of a
.Ql Ic ==
or
.Ql Ic "!="
operator is not an integral value, then
string comparison is performed between the expanded
variables.
If no relational operator is given, it is assumed that the expanded
variable is being compared against 0.
.Pp
When
.Nm make
is evaluating one of these conditional expression, and it encounters
a word it doesn't recognize, either the ``make'' or ``defined''
expression is applied to it, depending on the form of the conditional.
If the form is
.Ql Ic .ifdef
or
.Ql Ic .ifndef ,
the ``defined'' expression
is applied.
Similarly, if the form is
.Ql Ic .ifmake
or
.Ql Ic .ifnmake , the ``make''
expression is applied.
.Pp
If the conditional evaluates to true the parsing of the makefile continues
as before.
If it evaluates to false, the following lines are skipped.
In both cases this continues until a
.Ql Ic .else
or
.Ql Ic .endif
is found.
.Pp
For loops are typically used to apply a set of rules to a list of files.
The syntax of a for loop is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic \&.for
.Ar variable
.Ic in
.Ar expression
.Xc
.It Xo
<make-rules>
.Xc
.It Xo
.Ic \&.endfor
.Xc
.El
After the for
.Ic expression
is evaluated, it is split into words. The
iteration
.Ic variable
is successively set to each word, and substituted in the
.Ic make-rules
inside the body of the for loop.
.Sh COMMENTS
Comments begin with a hash
.Pq Ql \&#
character, anywhere but in a shell
command line, and continue to the end of the line.
.Sh SPECIAL SOURCES
.Bl -tag -width Ic .IGNORE
.It Ic .IGNORE
Ignore any errors from the commands associated with this target, exactly
as if they all were preceded by a dash
.Pq Ql \- .
.It Ic .MAKE
Execute the commands associated with this target even if the
.Fl n
or
.Fl t
options were specified.
Normally used to mark recursive
.Nm make Ns 's .
.It Ic .NOTMAIN
Normally
.Nm make
selects the first target it encounters as the default target to be built
if no target was specified.
This source prevents this target from being selected.
.It Ic .OPTIONAL
If a target is marked with this attribute and
.Nm make
can't figure out how to create it, it will ignore this fact and assume
the file isn't needed or already exists.
.It Ic .PRECIOUS
When
.Nm make
is interrupted, it removes any partially made targets.
This source prevents the target from being removed.
.It Ic .SILENT
Do not echo any of the commands associated with this target, exactly
as if they all were preceded by an at sign
.Pq Ql @ .
.It Ic .USE
Turn the target into
.Nm make Ns 's .
version of a macro.
When the target is used as a source for another target, the other target
acquires the commands, sources, and attributes (except for
.Ic .USE )
of the
source.
If the target already has commands, the
.Ic .USE
target's commands are appended
to them.
.It Ic .WAIT
If special
.Ic .WAIT
source is appears in a dependency line, the sources that precede it are
made before the sources that succeed it in the line. Loops are not being
detected and targets that form loops will be silently ignored.
.El
.Sh "SPECIAL TARGETS"
Special targets may not be included with other targets, i.e. they must be
the only target specified.
.Bl -tag -width Ic .BEGIN
.It Ic .BEGIN
Any command lines attached to this target are executed before anything
else is done.
.It Ic .DEFAULT
This is sort of a
.Ic .USE
rule for any target (that was used only as a
source) that
.Nm make
can't figure out any other way to create.
Only the shell script is used.
The
.Ic .IMPSRC
variable of a target that inherits
.Ic .DEFAULT Ns 's
commands is set
to the target's own name.
.It Ic .END
Any command lines attached to this target are executed after everything
else is done.
.It Ic .IGNORE
Mark each of the sources with the
.Ic .IGNORE
attribute.
If no sources are specified, this is the equivalent of specifying the
.Fl i
option.
.It Ic .INTERRUPT
If
.Nm make
is interrupted, the commands for this target will be executed.
.It Ic .MAIN
If no target is specified when
.Nm make
is invoked, this target will be built.
.It Ic .MAKEFLAGS
This target provides a way to specify flags for
.Nm make
when the makefile is used.
The flags are as if typed to the shell, though the
.Fl f
option will have
no effect.
.\" XXX: NOT YET!!!!
.\" .It Ic .NOTPARALLEL
.\" The named targets are executed in non parallel mode. If no targets are
.\" specified, then all targets are executed in non parallel mode.
.It Ic .NOTPARALLEL
Disable parallel mode.
.It Ic .NO_PARALLEL
Same as above, for compatibility with other pmake variants.
.It Ic .ORDER
The named targets are made in sequence.
.\" XXX: NOT YET!!!!
.\" .It Ic .PARALLEL
.\" The named targets are executed in parallel mode. If no targets are
.\" specified, then all targets are executed in parallel mode.
.It Ic .PATH
The sources are directories which are to be searched for files not
found in the current directory.
If no sources are specified, any previously specified directories are
deleted.
.It Ic .PHONY
Apply the
.Ic .PHONY
attribute to any specified sources. Targets with this attribute are always
considered to be out of date.
.It Ic .PRECIOUS
Apply the
.Ic .PRECIOUS
attribute to any specified sources.
If no sources are specified, the
.Ic .PRECIOUS
attribute is applied to every
target in the file.
.It Ic .SILENT
Apply the
.Ic .SILENT
attribute to any specified sources.
If no sources are specified, the
.Ic .SILENT
attribute is applied to every
command in the file.
.It Ic .SUFFIXES
Each source specifies a suffix to
.Nm make .
If no sources are specified, any previous specified suffices are deleted.
