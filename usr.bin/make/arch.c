/*-
 * arch.c --
 *	Functions to manipulate libraries, archives and their members.
 *
 *	Once again, cacheing/hashing comes into play in the manipulation
 * of archives. The first time an archive is referenced, all of its members'
 * headers are read and hashed and the archive closed again. All hashed
 * archives are kept on a list which is searched each time an archive member
 * is referenced.
 *
 * The interface to this module is:
 *	Arch_ParseArchive   	Given an archive specification, return a list
 *	    	  	    	of GNode's, one for each member in the spec.
 *	    	  	    	FAILURE is returned if the specification is
 *	    	  	    	invalid for some reason.
 *
 *	Arch_Touch	    	Alter the modification time of the archive
 *	    	  	    	member described by the given node to be
 *	    	  	    	the current time.
 *
 *	Arch_TouchLib	    	Update the modification time of the library
 *	    	  	    	described by the given node. This is special
 *	    	  	    	because it also updates the modification time
 *	    	  	    	of the library's table of contents.
 *
 *	Arch_MTime	    	Find the modification time of a member of
 *	    	  	    	an archive *in the archive*. The time is also
 *	    	  	    	placed in the member's GNode. Returns the
 *	    	  	    	modification time.
 *
 *	Arch_MemTime	    	Find the modification time of a member of
 *	    	  	    	an archive. Called when the member doesn't
 *	    	  	    	already exist. Looks in the archive for the
 *	    	  	    	modification time. Returns the modification
 *	    	  	    	time.
 *
 *	Arch_FindLib	    	Search for a library along a path. The
 *	    	  	    	library name in the GNode should be in
 *	    	  	    	-l<name> format.
 *
 *	Arch_LibOODate	    	Special function to decide if a library node
 *	    	  	    	is out-of-date.
 *
 *	Arch_Init 	    	Initialize this module.

 *	    Its modification time is less than that of one of its
 *	    	  sources (gn->mtime < gn->cmtime).
