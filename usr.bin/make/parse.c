 * parse.c --
 *	Functions to parse a makefile.
 *
 *	One function, Parse_Init, must be called before any functions
 *	in this module are used. After that, the function Parse_File is the
 *	main entry point and controls most of the other functions in this
 *	module.
 *
 *	Most important structures are kept in Lsts. Directories for
 *	the #include "..." function are kept in the 'parseIncPath' Lst, while
 *	those for the #include <...> are kept in the 'sysIncPath' Lst. The
 *	targets currently being defined are kept in the 'targets' Lst.
 *
 *	The variables 'curFile.fname' and 'curFile.lineno' are used to track
 *	the name of the current file and the line number in that file so that
 *	error messages can be more meaningful.
 *
 * Interface:
 *	Parse_Init	    	    Initialization function which must be
 *	    	  	    	    called before anything else in this module
 *	    	  	    	    is used.
 *
 *	Parse_File	    	    Function used to parse a makefile. It must
 *	    	  	    	    be given the name of the file, which should
 *	    	  	    	    already have been opened, and a function
 *	    	  	    	    to call to read a character from the file.
 *
 *	Parse_IsVar	    	    Returns TRUE if the given line is a
 *	    	  	    	    variable assignment. Used by MainParseArgs
 *	    	  	    	    to determine if an argument is a target
 *	    	  	    	    or a variable assignment. Used internally
 *	    	  	    	    for pretty much the same thing...
 *
 *	Parse_Error	    	    Function called when an error occurs in
 *	    	  	    	    parsing. Used by the variable and
 *	    	  	    	    conditional modules.
 *	Parse_MainName	    	    Returns a Lst of the main target to create.
