.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes the named files or the standard input writing
the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.
Backspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement
the column count for tab calculations.
The
.Nm
utility is useful for pre-processing character files
(before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that
contain tabs.
.Pp
The
.Nm unexpand
utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named
files and writes the result on the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
.Nm ( unexpand

By default, only leading blanks and tabs
are reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.

option is given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the
resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
