/*
 *	This program un-does what "strfile" makes, thereby obtaining the
 * original file again.  This can be invoked with the name of the output
 * file, the input file, or both. If invoked with only a single argument
 * ending in ".dat", it is pressumed to be the input file and the output
 * file will be the same stripped of the ".dat".  If the single argument
 * doesn't end in ".dat", then it is presumed to be the output file, and
 * the input file is that name prepended by a ".dat".  If both are given
 * they are treated literally as the input and output files.
