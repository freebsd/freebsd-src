FreeBSD is started up by the program 'init'.  The first thing init does when
starting multiuser mode (ie, starting the computer up for normal use) is to
run the shell script /etc/rc.  By reading /etc/rc and the /etc/rc.d/ scripts,
you can learn a lot about how the system is put together, which again will
make you more confident about what happens when you do something with it.

If you have installed it, you can download, compile, and install software by
just typing

	# cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname>
	# make install && make clean

as root.  The ports infrastructure will download the software, change it so
it works on FreeBSD, compile it, install it, register the installation so it
will be possible to automatically uninstall it, and clean out the temporary
working space it used.  You can remove an installed port you decide you do not
want after all by typing

	# cd /usr/ports/<category>/<portname>
	# make deinstall

as root.

You can open up a new split-screen window in (n)vi with :N or :E and then
use ^w to switch between the two.
%
You can permanently set environment variables for your shell by putting them
in a startup file for the shell.  The name of the startup file varies
depending on the shell - csh and tcsh uses .login, bash, sh, ksh and zsh use

You can use aliases to decrease the amount of typing you need to do to get
commands you commonly use.  Examples of fairly popular aliases include (in
Bourne shell style, as in /bin/sh, bash, ksh, and zsh):

	alias lf="ls -FA"
	alias ll="ls -lA"
	alias su="su -m"

In csh or tcsh, these would be

	alias lf ls -FA
	alias ll ls -lA
	alias su su -m

To remove an alias, you can usually use 'unalias aliasname'.  To list all
aliases, you can usually type just 'alias'.
%
You can use /etc/make.conf to control the options used to compile software
on this system.  Example entries are in

%
When using ZFS as the file system the "df" command is reporting the pool size
and not file system sizes. It also does not know about descendent ZFS
datasets, snapshots, quotas, and reservations with their individual space usage.
Use the built-in "zfs list" command to get a better overview of space usage:

zfs list -o space

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To learn more about what your system is doing, take a look at systat(1). For
example, to get various statistics related to virtual memory usage, process
scheduling, device interrupts, system name translation caching, and disk I/O,
enter the following:

systat -vmstat

Other values are icmp, icmp6, ifstat, iostat, ip, ip6, netstat, pigs, sctp,
swap, tcp, or zarc. You can switch between displays using :<display> and exit
back to your shell by typing

:quit

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To set a quota of 10 GB for the user named foo on a ZFS dataset, run the
following command:

# zfs set userquota@foo=10G pool/home/foo

The zfs userspace command can display the quota and current space usage:

# zfs userspace pool/home/foo

To unset a quota, assign "none" as the value.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
ZFS can display I/O statistics for a given pool using the iostat subcommand.
By default, it will display one line of current activity.  To display stats
every 5 seconds run the following command (cancel with CTRL+C):

zpool iostat 5

To view individual disk activities, specify the -v parameter:

zpool iostat -v

Of course, both can be combined. For more options, see zpool(8).
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
FreeBSD's top(1) utility displays CPU statistics by default.
To display I/O activity for each process instead, run top like this:

top -m io

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
ZFS keeps a history of commands run against a specific pool using the
history subcommand to zpool:

zpool history

More details are available using the -i and -l parameters. Note that ZFS
will not keep the complete pool history forever and will remove older
events in favor of never ones.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To display the compression ratio for the ZFS dataset /var/log on the pool
mypool, run the following command:

zfs get refcompressratio mypool/var/log

The refcompressratio will only display the compression ratio for that specific
dataset, not the descendant datasets. To include the child datasets, the
command looks like this:

zfs get compressratio mypool/var

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can limit the depth of the displayed datasets in the "zfs list" output
using the -d parameter. To display only the first level of datasets below
mypool/usr and not the ones deeper than those, run this command:

zfs list -d 1 mypool/usr

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
The "zfs list" command can be filtered in multiple ways. To display just
the dataset name, use the -o parameter:

zfs list -o name mypool/usr

More columns and their order can be defined by separating them with commas:

zfs list -o mountpoint,name,avail

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
The output of "zfs list" can be sorted by a specific column using -s.  To
sort the datasets by the "used" column in ascending order, run this command:

zfs list -s used

To sort in descending order instead, use -S:

zfs list -S used

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To make the "zfs list" output more script-friendly, you can suppress the
output of the headers for each column by passing the -H parameter:

zfs list -H

Another helpful option for script writers is -p, which displays the numbers
in non-rounded, exact values:

zfs list -p

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
Before deleting a dataset or snapshot, perform a dry run using the -n
parameter. This is to make sure you really want to delete just that
dataset/snapshot and not any dependent ones. ZFS will display the resulting
action when -n is combined with the -v option without actually performing
it:

zfs destroy -nrv mypool@mysnap

Once you are sure this is exactly what you intend to do, remove the -n
parameter to execute the destroy operation.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can delete a range of ZFS snapshots (a-z) in multiple ways.
The following will delete d and all earlier snapshots:

zfs destroy mypool/data@%d

To delete d and all later snapshots:

zfs destroy mypool/data@d%

To delete all dataset snapshots:

zfs destroy mypool/data@%

Make sure to let ZFS perform a dry run (-n option) first and display (-v) what
it would do to confirm that the delete operation is removing exactly what you
intended.
		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To set a custom ZFS property on the mypool pool, you need to provide it
using the "key1:key2=value" syntax, where the colon (:) is used as the
separator and identifier from the built-in ZFS properties:

# zfs set warranty:expires=2038-01-19 mypool

The custom property is applied to all datasets and can be queried like any
built-in properties using zfs get:

zfs get warranty:expires mypool

To reset the value of a custom property, use the inherit subcommand:

# zfs inherit warranty:expires mypool

Removing a custom property from a pool is done using the -r flag to the
"zfs inherit" command:

# zfs inherit -r warranty:expires mypool

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
To delete a range of ZFS snapshots, use the % (percent) character after the
full path to the first snapshot that should be included. For example, to
simulate deleting snapshots a through (including) d, use this command:

# zfs destroy -rvn mypool/tmp@a%d

Once you are sure that this is what you want, remove the -n option:

# zfs destroy -rv mypool/tmp@a%d

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
You can prevent the removal of a ZFS snapshot by using the hold subcommand.
For example, to prevent the snapshot called milestone from deletion, run the
following command:

# zfs hold milestone_hold mypool/projects@my_milestone

The "zfs holds" command will list all current snapshots that are protected
this way (-r for a recursive list):

# zfs holds -r mypool

The TIMESTAMP column in the output of the above command is from when the
hold was created, not the snapshot it holds. The "zfs destroy" command will
echo a "dataset is busy" message on the console when it encounters a hold.
Use "zfs release" to release the hold on the snapshot:

# zfs release milestone_hold mypool/projects@my_milestone

A user "sender" needs the following permissions set to send a ZFS dataset:

# zfs allow -u sender send,snapshot txpool

On the receiving side, the user "receiver" requires these permissions:

# zfs allow -u receiver compression,mountpoint,mount,create,receive rxpool

		-- Benedict Reuschling <bcr@FreeBSD.org>
%
Don't let your zpool fill up completely by creating a dataset with
reservation.

# zfs create -o refreservation=<5% of total pool space> <poolname>/reserved

You can always shrink the reserve if you need the space, but your pool will
always have space left this way.

Sometimes a single slow HDD can cripple the performance of your entire system.
You can spot one like this:

# gstat -I5s | sort -rn -k9 | head

FreeBSD's ps(1) can create a dependency tree based on parent/child
relationships between processes, like this:

$ ps -d

It is possible to measure the resident memory set:

$ vmstat -o | awk 'NR>1 { t[$7] += $1 } \
END { for (i in t) printf "%s %d\n",i,t[i] }'

The rows have the following meaning:
df = default (not assigned a specific pager)
sw = swap
df = virtual
vn = vnode
ph = heap
md = memory device

This will be reported in number of pages, so it needs to be multiplied by the
page size of the architecture which can be found via:

$ sysctl -n hw.pagesize

To establish a serial connection to anything including a USB device,
nothing more than cu(1) is needed:

$ cu -s 115200 -l /dev/ttyU0

You can control kernel stack(9) traces on ^T (tty info) by setting
kern.tty_info_kstacks to 0 (off), 1 (on), or 2 (verbose), e.g.:

# sysctl kern.tty_info_kstacks=2

To determine which fonts provide a particular Unicode character, fc-list from
the fontconfig package may be helpful.  For example, if your friend complains
that the emoji you sent won't display, run fc-list with the hex value of the
character to determine which font your friend should install.

$ fc-list ':charset=0x1F4A1'
/usr/local/share/fonts/noto/NotoColorEmoji.ttf: Noto Color Emoji:style=Regular

$ pkg which /usr/local/share/fonts/noto/NotoColorEmoji.ttf
/usr/local/share/fonts/noto/NotoColorEmoji.ttf was installed by package noto-emoji-2.042

When netstat reports every 8 seconds, it tells traffic in bits per second:
