.Sh NAME
.Nm fortune
.Nd "print a random, hopefully interesting, adage"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aDefilosw
.Op Fl m Ar pattern
.Oo
.Op Ar \&N%
.Ar file Ns / Ns Ar directory Ns / Ns Cm all
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Nm
is run with no arguments it prints out a random epigram.
Epigrams are divided into several categories, where each category
is subdivided into those which are potentially offensive and those
which are not.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Choose from all lists of maxims, both offensive and not.
(See the
.Fl o
option for more information on offensive fortunes.)
.It Fl D
Enable additional debugging output.
Specify this option multiple times for more verbose output.
Only available if compiled with
.Li -DDEBUG .
.It Fl e
Consider all fortune files to be of equal size (see discussion below
on multiple files).
.It Fl f
Print out the list of files which would be searched, but do not
print a fortune.
.It Fl l
Long dictums only.
.It Fl m Ar pattern
Print out all fortunes which match the regular expression
.Ar pattern .
See
.Xr regex 3
for a description of patterns.
.It Fl o
Choose only from potentially offensive aphorisms.
.Bf -symbolic
Please, please, please request a potentially offensive fortune if and
only if you believe, deep down in your heart, that you are willing
to be offended.
(And that if you are not willing, you will just quit using
.Fl o
rather than give us
grief about it, okay?)
.Ef
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
\&... let us keep in mind the basic governing philosophy
of The Brotherhood, as handsomely summarized in these words:
we believe in healthy, hearty laughter -- at the expense of
the whole human race, if needs be.
Needs be.
                           --H. Allen Smith, "Rude Jokes"
.Ed
.It Fl s
Short apothegms only.
.It Fl i
Ignore case for
.Fl m
patterns.
.It Fl w
Wait before termination for an amount of time calculated from the
number of characters in the message.
This is useful if it is executed as part of the logout procedure
to guarantee that the message can be read before the screen is cleared.
.El
.Pp
The user may specify alternate sayings.
You can specify a specific file, a directory which contains one or
more files, or the special word
.Cm all
which says to use all the standard databases.
Any of these may be preceded by a percentage, which is a number
.Ar N
between 0 and 100 inclusive, followed by a
.Ql % .
If it is, there will be an
.Ar N
percent probability that an adage will be picked from that file
or directory.
If the percentages do not sum to 100, and there are specifications
without percentages, the remaining percent will apply to those files
and/or directories, in which case the probability of selecting from
one of them will be based on their relative sizes.
.Pp
As an example, given two databases
.Pa funny
and
.Pa not-funny ,
with
.Pa funny
twice as big, saying
.Pp
.Dl "fortune funny not-funny"
.Pp
will get you fortunes out of
.Pa funny
two-thirds of the time.
The command
.Pp
.Dl "fortune 90% funny 10% not-funny"
.Pp
will pick out 90% of its fortunes from
.Pa funny
(the
.Dq Li "10% not-funny"
is unnecessary, since 10% is all that is left).
The
.Fl e
option says to consider all files equal;
thus
.Pp
.Dl "fortune -e funny not-funny"
.Pp
is equivalent to
.Pp
.Dl "fortune 50% funny 50% not-funny"
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev FORTUNE_PATH"
.It Ev FORTUNE_PATH
The search path for the data files.
It is a colon-separated list of directories in which
.Nm
looks for data files.
If not set it will default to
.Pa /usr/share/games/fortune:/usr/local/share/games/fortune .
If none of the directories specified exist, it will print a warning and exit.
.It Ev FORTUNE_SAVESTATE
If set, fortune will save some state about what fortune
it was up to on disk.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /usr/share/games/fortune/*"
.It Pa /usr/share/games/fortune/*
the fortunes databases (those files ending
.Dq Pa -o
contain the
.Sy offensive
fortunes)
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
In particular, if
.Fl l ,
.Fl m ,
or
.Fl s
is specified, failure to find a matching citation in the selected
files counts as an error.
