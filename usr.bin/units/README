This is a program which I wrote as a clone of the UNIX 'units'
command.  I threw it together in a couple days, but it seems to work,
with some restrictions.  I have tested it under DOS with Borland C and
Ultrix 4.2, and SunOS 4.1.  

This program differs from the unix units program in the following
ways:
   it can gracefully handle exponents larger than 9 in output
   it uses 'e' to denote exponentiation in numbers
   prefixes are listed in the units file
   it tries both -s and -es plurals
   it allows use of * for multiply and ^ for exponentiation in the input
   the output format is somewhat different
