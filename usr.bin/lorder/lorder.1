.Sh NAME
.Nm lorder
.Nd list dependencies for object files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Xr nm 1
to determine interdependencies between object files and library
archives listed on its command line.
It then outputs a list of pairs of file names such that the first file
in each pair references at least one symbol defined by the second.
.Pp
The output is normally used with
.Xr tsort 1
when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single
pass of the loader.
.Pp
Similarly, when linking static binaries,
.Nm
and
.Xr tsort 1
can be used to sort libraries in order of dependency.
.Pp
While contemporary linkers no longer require the use of
.Nm ,
it is provided for the benefit of legacy code bases and build
systems which still insist on it.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev NM
Path to the
.Xr nm 1
binary, defaults to
.Dq Li nm .
.It Ev NMFLAGS
Flags to pass to
.Xr nm 1 .

.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility will not work properly if given file names with spaces or
newlines in them.
