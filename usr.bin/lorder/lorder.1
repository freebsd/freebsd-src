.Sh NAME
.Nm lorder
.Nd list dependencies for object files
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
.Nm
is obsolete and may not be present in
.Fx 14
and later.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Xr nm 1
to determine interdependencies between object files and library
archives listed on its command line.
It then outputs a list of pairs of file names such that the first file
in each pair references at least one symbol defined by the second.
.Pp
The output is normally used with
.Xr tsort 1
when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single
pass of the loader.
.Pp
Similarly, when linking static binaries,
.Nm
and
.Xr tsort 1
can be used to sort libraries in order of dependency.
.Pp
The use of
.Nm
is not required by contemporary linkers, and
.Nm
may be removed from a future version of
.Fx .

.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility will not work properly if given file names with spaces or
newlines in them.
