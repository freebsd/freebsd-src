Updating Information for FreeBSD STABLE users

This file is maintained and copyrighted by M. Warner Losh
<imp@village.org>.  See end of file for further details.  For commonly
done items, please see the COMMON ITEMS: section later in the file.

A reverse chronology since 4.0 was released is included, followed by
the common items quick how-tos, followed by entries for versions of
-current prior to 4.0 Release.

This is for the 4.6 release branch.  All entries since 4.6 are an
itemized list of commits to this branch, numbered from the beginning.

The security advisories related to various patches contain information
on how to build/install a minimal set of binaries and start/stop a
minimal number of processes, if possible, for that patch.  For those
updates that don't have an advisory, or to be safe, you can do a full
build and install as described in the COMMON ITEMS section.

20020805:	p9	FreeBSD-SA-02:37.kqueue
	Registering an EVFILT_WRITE event on a pipe whose far end had
	already been closed would cause a kernel panic.

20020804:	p8
	Bugfix for READ_BIG errors with ATAPI devices.

	A race condition in pppd(8) was corrected.

20020730:	p1	FreeBSD-SA-02:23.stdio.v1.2
	A bug in the previous patch for the vulnerability described
	in FreeBSD-SA-02:23.stdio was found and corrected.

	A tags bug in the ata(4) subsystem has been corrected.

20020626:	p1	FreeBSD-SA-02:28.resolv
	A fix for a buffer overflow in libc has been corrected.

20020615:
	FreeBSD 4.6-RELEASE.

20020515:
	The k5su utility installed as part of Kerberos 5 is no longer
	installed with the set-user-ID bit set by default.  Add
	ENABLE_SUID_K5SU=yes to /etc/make.conf to have it installed
	with the set-user-ID bit set.

20020501:
	The ephemeral port range change that was previously mentioned
	in this document has been reverted, so any changes it required
	to your system may be reverted as well.  Those who missed the
	change should ignore this notice.

20020421:
	inetd_enable was changed back to YES, to match the defaults
	earlier in the 4.0-stable branch.  This change restores the
	daemons that were enabled prior to April 15th.

	When exec'ing set[ug]id executables, the kernel now ensures that the
	stdio file descriptors (0..2) are open.  See FreeBSD-SA-02:23.stdio.

20020420:
	sendmail_enable was changed back to YES, to match the
	defaults earlier in the 4.0-stable branch.

20020415:
	Many denizens of /etc were MFC'ed. While most of the changes
	are very benign, some of them have created a bit of a stir.
	Use the new version of mergemaster to update /etc, either by
	updating /etc after installworld, or by doing:
	cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/mergemaster; make all install [clean]
	Then use the new -C option to double-check your rc.conf settings.
	You should also double-check settings in [defaults/]rc.conf,
	syslog.conf, newsyslog.conf, and anything else important
	to your system.

	The two most important changes to note: sendmail and inetd were
	turned off by default.  If you need them, please turn them back
	on by adding sendmail_enable=YES and/or inetd_enable=YES to
	/etc/rc.conf.

20020411:
	New sendmail startup scripts have been installed to make it
	easier to use alternative MTAs with FreeBSD.  The rc.conf
	variable mta_start_script can be set to a script for starting
	an alternative MTA or to "" to prevent any MTA from being
	started at boot.

20020404:
	The sendmail startup code in /etc/rc has been changed to deal
	with a non-set-user-ID sendmail binary.  Setting the rc.conf
	variable sendmail_enable to "NO" no longer prevents any sendmail
	daemons from starting.  Instead, set sendmail_enable to "NONE"
	to prevent any MTA from being started at boot.

20020404:
	Due to the import of sendmail 8.12.2 (see 20020325 entry), a new
	user and group are required in order for sendmail to run as a
	set-group-ID binary.  A 'make installworld' will use the new user
	and group to set the owner and group of /var/spool/clientmqueue
	and will fail if the new user and group do not exist.  The 'smmsp'
	user and group must be merged from src/etc/group and
	src/etc/master.passwd before using 'make installworld'.
	'mergemaster -p' will do this.  You may need to install
	mergemaster before this will work if you are updating from a
	very old version of stable.  This can be done with:
	cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/mergemaster; make all install [clean]

20020325:
	sendmail 8.12.2 has been imported.  The sendmail binary is no
	longer a set-user-ID root binary and the infrastructure to support
	command line mail submission has changed.  Be sure to run
	mergemaster (especially for updating /etc/rc, /etc/defaults/rc.conf,
	and /etc/mail) and read /etc/mail/README for more details.

20020318:
	The ata(4) driver has been updated from the version in -CURRENT.  
	As a result, some device nodes in /dev have changed; it will be 
	necessary to update MAKEDEV and re-make the device nodes.
	mergemaster(8) will offer to do this as a part of its upgrade
	procedure.

20020129:
	FreeBSD 4.5-RELEASE.

20020105:
	The locale names have been renamed in -stable to match
	-current:
		1. ISO_* -> ISO*
		2. ru_SU* -> ru_RU*
		3. DIS_* -> ISO*-15
		4. *.ASCII -> *.US-ASCII

20011202:
	A security hole in OpenSSH involving `UseLogin yes' has been
	patched.

20011110:
	Some linux module changes, merged from current, require that you
	clean out the old compile directory.  If you are building with
	MODULES_WITH_WORLD=yes, then you need to cd to src/sys/modules/linux
	and run "make cleandir".  If not, then you need to cd
	src/sys/compile/$KERNCONF and do a make modules-clean.

20011102:
	ipfw/bridge/dummynet features merged from current.

20011018:
	The kernel Makefile was enhanced to pass -g to modules builds
	when it is used for kernel building (eg, when the config file
	has DEBUG=-g).  People that have enabled debugging kernels
	will find they need significantly more disk space in their
	slash (/) partition.

20010928:
	The OpenSSH `ChallengeResponseAuthentication' option now
	defaults to `yes'.  This enables S/Key authentication, which
	can result in users receiving an S/Key challenge when logging
	in interactively.  To disable this behavior, add a line to
	your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:
	`ChallengeResponseAuthentication no'

20010914:
	4.4 Released.

20010814:
	The pci attachment for pcic device was merged from current.  You
	should update your pccardd at the same time as you update your
	kernel.

	Note: Interrupts will now be shared between the CardBus bridge
	and the cards.  This is a change over the hand configuration
	before.

20010811:
	isdn4bsd was updated to version 1.00.1. for users of the isp<N>
	(kernel PPP over ISDN) devices, this means that they now _must_
	use ispppcontrol instead of spppcontrol to configure and control
	their isp<N> devices. see /usr/share/examples/isdn for more info.

20010725:
	The ed driver has been updated.  It now allows mii attachments,
	which means that you must include the miibus in your kernel if
	you use the ed driver.

20010724:
	The gif(4) interface has been converted to use cloning
	rather then allocating a static number of devices a compile
	time.  If you use gif interfaces and configure them by any
	method other then setting standard variables in /etc/rc.conf
	you will need to update your system to create devices with
	"ifconfig gifX create" before attempting to configure them.
	
	See the ifconfig(8) man page and /etc/rc.network for more
	information.

20010611:
	The TCP_RESTRICT_RST option has been removed. You should entirely
	remove it from your kernel configuration.

	The same functionality is available from the blackhole(4) MIB.

20010531:
	The wd compat devices were removed from the ata driver.  Kernels
	after this date will fail to work with /dev/ nodes that you may
	have on your disk.  /etc/fstab is a common place to find these
	files hanging out, as are dump devices in /etc/rc.conf.

20010521:
	Minor repo damange has happened.  This may cause problems
	with cvsup of ports.  If you get errors, please see
	http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=27495
	at the bottom for details on a workaround.  The error message
	is
Updater failed: Cannot delete "/usr/ports/www/jakarta-tomcat/files": Directory not empty

20010516:
	Size changes in the cred structures introduced a binary
	incompatibility for modules using the crhold() macro.  Modules
	should be recompiled for kernel later than this date.

20010510:
	The fxp driver from current has been ported to -stable.  This
	requires kernels that include fxp to also include mii bus devices.
	See GENERIC for details.

20010421:
	FreeBSD 4.3 RELEASE

20010402:
	It appears that PERL_THREADED=true in /etc/make.conf is not
	compatible with mod_perl.  Not sure the exact date of this problem,
	but it post dates 4.2 and predates 4.3.

20010202:
	The KERNEL variable for buildkernel and installkernel has been
	deprecated in favor of KERNCONF.  make kernel now combines these
	two steps.

20010117:
	Linksys Fast Ethernet PCCARD cards supported by the ed driver
	now require the addition of flag 0x80000 to their config line
	in pccard.conf(5).  This flag is not optional.  These Linksys
	cards will not be recognized without it.

20010112:
	Important new FreeBSD-version stuff: PAM support has been worked
	in, partially from the "Unix" OpenSSH version.  This requires
	adding the following in pam.conf:
  
	sshd    auth    sufficient      pam_skey.so
	sshd    auth    required        pam_unix.so         try_first_pass
	sshd    session required        pam_permit.so

20010109:
	ipfw interface changed.  Make sure that the userland and kernel match
	or you won't have the firewall rules you think you do.

20001120:
	FreeBSD 4.2 RELEASE.

20001020:
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
				Sendmail has been updated.
	****************************** WARNING ******************************
	o mail.local(8) is no longer installed as a set-user-id binary.
	o sendmail(8) is now built with STARTTLS support unless NO_OPENSSL
	  is set.
	o The default /etc/mail/sendmail.cf disables the SMTP EXPN and VRFY
	  commands.
	o Now using sendmail's version of vacation(1).
	o The sendmail cf building tools (contrib/sendmail/cf) are installed
	  in /usr/share/sendmail/cf.
	o sendmail.cw changed to local-host-names

	More details can be found at
		http://people.freebsd.org/~imp/UPDATING/sendmail-20001010

20001009:
	The ports tree's new layout is in place.  Be sure to update
	your entire ports tree, or you will have problems.

20001006:
	The perl build procedure no longer installs miniperl, nor uses
	the installed miniperl.  It is recommended that you delete
	/usr/bin/miniperl.

20000925:
	FreeBSD 4.1.1 RELEASE.

20000907:
	Changes to libkvm requires a recompile of the usual suspects.
	(find /usr/src -name Makefile | xargs egrep -l LIBKVM)
	This means that your world must match your kernel around this
	point.

20000904:
	A new issue with the sendmail upgrade has come to light.
	/etc/aliases has moved to /etc/mail/aliases.  Mergemaster will 
	incorrectly install the default aliases in /etc/mail rather than
	move the old one from /etc.  So you'll need to manually move the
	file, create a symbolic link, remove the old /etc/aliases.db and
	run newaliases.  For safety sake, you should stop sendmail
	while doing this and run the upgrade when locally sourced email
	is not likely to be generated.

20000827:
	sendmail has been updated from 8.9.3 to 8.11.0.  Some of the more
	visible changes that may immediately affect your configuration
	include:
	- New default file locations from src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README
	- newaliases limited to root and trusted users
	- MSA port (587) turned on by default
	- New queue file naming system so can't go from 8.11 -> 8.9
	- FEATURE(`rbl') renamed to FEATURE(`dnsbl')
	- FEATURE(`nullclient') is more full featured
	- FEATURE(`nouucp') requires an argument: `reject' or `nospecial'
	- mail.local FreeBSD-only -b option changed to -B
	- See src/contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for more info

20000803:
	The "installkernel" target has changed slightly. Now even if
	you override KERNEL e.g. 'make installkernel KERNEL=MYKERNEL'
	it will install the MYKERNEL file (built with the buildkernel
	target) as /kernel rather than /MYKERNEL. Those who have
	updated their /boot/loader.conf files to point to /MYKERNEL
	should remove that entry or perform manual rename of /kernel
	to /MYKERNEL.

20000724:
	FreeBSD 4.1 RELEASE

20000711:
	If you use CVSUP or CTM to get CVS trees, AND you used to get 
	the old crypto files from internat.freebsd.org AND you check
	out files from the CVS tree with the cvs command, please read
		http://people.freebsd.org/~imp/internat.txt
	for details on potential problems that you might have and how
	to get around them.

	If you are merely a mirror, or don't answer yes to each of the
	clauses above, you needn't worry.

20000707:
	We started building modules here.  IF you don't wish to
	follow the documented procedure for building kernels, then
	you'll have to install new mk files from src/share/mk, or
	define NO_MODULES.

20000706:
	Binutils were updated.  In order to build a kernel after this
	date, you must follow the updating procedure for building
	kernels exactly as presented here.  You may be able to get away
	with doing it the old way, but if it breaks, make sure that you've
	tried the "To build a kernel" section with a fresh /usr/obj
	first.

20000622:
	The license on the softupdates is now a standard 2 clause
	BSD license.  You may need to remove your symbolic links
	that used to be required when updating.

20000501:
	At approximately this date, an incompatible kernel change
	was made which means that if you update kernels accross
	this boundary, you also have to update modules, and vice
	versa.

20000315:
	FreeBSD 4.0 RELEASE.  Historical entries follow the common
	items.

****************************** 4.0 RELEASE ******************************

COMMON ITEMS:

	To build a kernel
	-----------------
	cd /usr/src
	# If you have not already done so, please buildworld here
	# You will also need to update your config file to 4.x.  Usually
	# people tend to start with GENERIC from 4.x and hack from there.
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<YOUR_KERNEL_HERE>
	make installkernel  KERNCONF=<YOUR_KERNEL_HERE>
	# Verify that the new kernel works, it will be installed as
	# /kernel

	To rebuild disk /dev entries
	----------------------------
	MAKEDEV should be copied from src/etc/MAKEDEV to /dev before
	starting the following:

		For N in the list of disks
			MAKEDEV N			# eg ad0
			for M in the list of slices
				MAKEDEV NsMa		# eg ad0s1a


	To rebuild everything
	---------------------
	make world

	Except when it doesn't work :-)

	To update from 3.x to 4.x stable
	--------------------------------
	***********************************************************
	READ -STABLE ARCHIVES FOR THE LAST WEEK OR TWO BEFORE
	STARTING THIS PROCESS.  UPDATING MAY LAG BEHIND A LITTLE
	A GOTCHAS ARE OFTEN REPORTED IN FREEBSD-STABLE@FREEBSD.ORG
	BEFORE BEING INCLUDED HERE.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO REMOTE
	MACHINES, MAKE SURE THAT THE EXACT VERSION YOU ARE UPDATING
	THEM TO WORKS ON LOCAL MACHINES BEFORE PROCEEDING.
	***********************************************************
	<see notes below>				[3]
	cd /usr/src
	<see notes below>				[2]
	make buildworld -DNOPERL
	<follow directions to build/install a kernel>
	cd /usr/src/sbin/mknod
	make install
	<follow rebuild disk /dev entries above>	[1]
	reboot
	<in single user>				[6]
	cd /usr/src
	cd gnu/usr.bin/texinfo/install-info
	make install
	cd ../../../..
	ldconfig -R /usr/obj/usr/src/lib/libc
	make installworld -DNOPERL			[5]
	mergemaster					[4]
	reboot
	<multi-user>

	[1] You may need to switch from wd to ad ala 19991210.  In
	addition, you should disable any third party modules such as
	vmware so that you don't crash your system on reboot.
	[2] If you have any of the following in your /etc/make.conf,
	please comment them out before following these instructions
	and then do a make buildworld + make installworld after you
	are back to <multi-user> above:
		MAKE_KERBEROS4
	[3] Update to 4.x-stable sources.  Make sure that you get all
	the parts.  If you are using cvsup files that are older than a
	couple of months, be sure they have all the components listed
	in /usr/share/examples/cvsup.  Crypto and secure are now
	required.
	[4] This step is not optional.  If you fail to do this, you
	will not have critical system config files updated for their
	4.x functionality.  This will lead to reduced system
	functionality, the biggest problem being with /etc/pam.conf
	not having the entries necessary to allow remote ssh access.
	[5] Note: This won't upgrade your perl install.  You will
	need to rebuild the world on 4.x to update perl.
	[6] From the bootblocks, boot -s, and then do
		fsck -p
		mount -u /
		mount -a
		cd /usr/src
		adjkerntz -i		# if CMOS is wall time

	To update from 4.0-RELEASE or later to the most current
	4.x-STABLE
	----------
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE
	reboot	(in single user) [1]
	make installworld
	mergemaster		[2]
	reboot

	[1] You can often get away without doing this step as the
	system will be properly updated.  During the running of the
	installworld, however, system components may break and other
	oddities may happen.  Don't do this on systems that aren't
	otherwise quiet as unpredictable results may happen.  If in
	doubt, reboot into single user.  For remote installs, keep
	a separate kernel around and use a serial console if at all
	possible.  See also note [6] above.
	[2] If you do not run mergemaster, you will likely hit a
	number of show stopper problems.  The biggest one is that
	your /etc/pam.conf won't let you log in using ssh.

What follows are older entries for those people upgrading from earlier
versions of -stable/-current.

20000308:
	The binary interface of perl to its modules changed.  You
	will need to recompile any perl moudles after an
	installworld.  This includes all ports matching the pattern 
	/usr/ports/*/p5-*.

20000303:
	CMSG_XXX macros offset in <sys/socket.h> has changed to
	conform RFC-2292.  All affected applications have been
	corrected.  The i386 platform's offsets haven't changed, but
	the alpha's did.  When you build and install new kernel on
	FreeBSD/alpha, you must also do a make world.

20000225:
	OpenSSH has been added to FreeBSD.  This may conflict with the
	ports/security/ssh port since it installs binaries into
	/usr/bin and the port goes into /usr/local/bin.  Most paths
	have /usr/bin in the path before /usr/local/bin, so problems
	may arise.  If you don't want OpenSSH, add NO_OPENSSH=yes to
	your make.conf.

	You will also need to enable OpenSSH in /etc/rc.conf if you
	want to run the new servers.  You may need to move your host
	key and other config files from /usr/local/etc to /etc/ssh.

	OpenSSH's command line parsing, available options and default
	settings aren't the same as ssh, so some care needs to be
	taken in its operation.  One should do a full audit of all
	configuration settings.

20000205:
	The xinstall problem has kinda sorta been corrected.  The 
	following is known to work by the author of UPDATING.  It
	is what he did to update his laptop.  It is likely the same
	effect as the work around listed in 20000129.
		make buildworld
		make installworld	This will fail
		cd usr.bin/xinstall
		make clean all install NOSHARED=YES
		cd ../..
		make installworld
	If it doesn't work for you, then I'm sure that there will be
	another 100 messages in -current.

20000204:
	libipsec version number changed from 2 to 0.  The original
	commit of Jan 6 incorrectly set this to 2.  Remove
	/usr/lib/libipsec.so.2* before the buildworld and rebuild
	anything that uses libipsec.so after you install the new
	version.

20000201:
	The rcmd related functions have been aligned with other BSD
	implementations.  rlogind and rshd have been changed to use
	the new API.  A make world is recommended to keep them in sync
	with the libraries they use.

	http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/net/rcmd.c
	has the details.

20000129:
	{set,get}flags have been added to the tree for rather dubious
	reasons.

	IF AND ONLY IF installworld fails:
		make -k -DNOFSCHG installworld
		make installworld
	This issue was resolved Feb 5, 2000.

20000125:
	rcmd_af() is added for multiple address family support.  rsh
	and rlogin have been updated to use this to support INET6.  A
	make world is recommended to keep them in sync with the
	libraries they use.

20000124:
	The default way that virtual tables in our default C++
	compiler has changed.  We used to use THUNKS for virtual
	inheritance.  Unfortunately there are bugs that The GCC
	developers thought would be fixed in GCC 2.95.  However it
	isn't.

	After this change existing applications written in C++ may
	give errors like below when you try to run them:

/usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.3: Undefined symbol "__vt_7filebuf"

	The only fix is to rebuild the application and any C++
	libraries used.

20000124:
	The management of next_writeable has been move from the
	kernel to userspace. This means that the burncd command
	must be in sync with the kernel. So make world is your
	friend.

20000117:
	GNU texinfo upgraded to 4.0.  It is recommended that you use
	make buildworld to update.

20000117:
	CAM_VERSION has been increased.  Recompile all programs that
	depend on it (tosha, camcontrol, etc) when moving to kernels
	past this date.

20000115:
	pccard ioctls changed with a commit to have the kernel tell
	pccardd which device it created, rather than having pccardd
	dictate it to the kernel.  Recompile kernel and
	pccardd/pccardc together.  pccardd/pccardc rely on a kernel
	Makefile that must be installed prior to building them.  Make
	world will automatically take care of this issue, but you need
	to know if you are building by hand.

20000109:
	Your kernel config files need to be changed to s/controller/device/
	in them.  You will need a new version of config to do this.

20000107:
	chown & chgrp moved again

	This is a heads up to let you know that you need to 
		    rm -f /sbin/chown /bin/chgrp
	after your next `make world'.  Additionally you need to install
	a new /dev/MAKEDEV (mergemaster(8) will assist you in this).

20000107:
	SHA-1 password support gone

	As warned yesterday, I've just removed the ability for
	libcrypt to understand SHA-1 passwords. This was present but
	undocumented in the tree for the past few months and was
	removed so it can be reimplemented properly as part of a
	revamped libcrypt at a later date. Anyone who was actually
	making use of the feature will have to update their passwords
	back to MD5 before they reinstall the library.

20000106:
	ioctl numbers changed for dvdio ioctls.  You will need to recompile
	anything that uses them.  wormcontrol has been deprecated in
	favor of burncd.

19991223:
	Building linux and svr4 compatibility into the kernel now
	requires /usr/bin/genassym.  Go to /usr/src/usr.bin/genassym,
	do "make obj ; make clean depend all install" before building
	your kernel.

19991218:
	sendmail.cf has moved from /etc/sendmail.cf to
	/etc/mail/sendmail.cf.  You may need to adjust /etc/rc.conf
	and /etc/rc to cope as well as moving sendmail.cf.

19991216:
	ntp 4.0.98 has replaced the ancient xntpd.  The daemon name
	changed from xntpd to ntpd, so you may need to update your
	/etc/rc.conf file.  The ntp.conf files are compatible with the
	old release, unless you are using a local reference clock.
	Details about ntp4 can be found at http://www.ntp.org/.

	xntpd will be cvs removed from the repo in about a week.

19991213:
	Soren updated the ata driver.  Please update to at least this
	version before submitting bug reports.

19991210:
	The ata driver has become the primary ata/ide/atapi driver in
	the kernel.  The wd driver is obsolete.  You should upgrade your
	machine to the new ata driver.  You will need to follow the
	directions for updating the devices in the 19991205 entry.  You
	will need to update all occurances of wd to ad in your config files
	(/etc/rc.conf, /etc/fstab, etc).  A compatibility device exists
	for wd for the time being, but once you have determined that
	ata is working for you, transition to the new ad devices.

19991205:
	Block devices are going away.  You will need to update your /dev
	tree with a fresh copy of MAKEDEV for things to always work in 
	the future.  fsck is unable to cope with dirty file systems
	after this change, so it may work for you or it may not.

	See "To rebuild disk /dev entries" at the end of the file.

	*** All uses of block devices must be converted to char devices.
	*** Likely the only thing impacted is dumpdev in /etc/rc.conf

19991204:
	The dc interface has replaced al, ax, dm, pn and mx.  The former
	have been removed.

19991204:
	Support for the old 'sd' device names has been removed in
	favor of 'da'.  Please update your /etc/fstab, /etc/rc.conf
	and any other places you might have sd names cached.
	Generally these changes are as simple as s=/dev/sd=/dev/da=g,
	but be careful to make sure that things are really that
	simple.  You may also need to create /dev entries for the da
	devices as well.

	See "To rebuild disk /dev entries" at the end of the file.

19991203:
	BAD144 support has been removed.  Cope or replace the hardware.

19991129:
	ALPHA users take note.  All klds will need to be recompiled for
	kernels build after this date.  It is a good time to update since
	pal.s will be going away soon.

19991126:
	MFS_ROOT and MFS_ROOT_SIZE are gone, replaced by MD_ROOT and
	MD_ROOT_SIZE options in the md driver.  md driver now deals with
	the hacks.  You should add md driver to kerneles that have
	MFS_ROOT, et al.  See GENERIC or LINT for details.

19991125:
	The ep changed a while ago and can no longer be used with hard
	wired addresses in the config file.

19991122:
	The bridge drivers for sound cards have been committed.  Please
	see LINT for instructions for your card, if it still works at
	all.

19991113:
	Gcc 2.95.2 is now the default compiler.

19991030:
	/etc/radius.conf file format has changed.The format change is
	as follows.  Each server line in the file should now begin
	with a new field containing either "auth" for RADIUS
	authentication, or "acct" for RADIUS accounting.  Formerly
	only authentication was supported.  If the first field isn't
	"auth" or "acct" then the code assumes that "auth" is
	intended.  (That's the compatibility hack.)

19991015:
	PCCARD has been updated to attach pcic to the isa bus.  Therefore
	you will need to modify kernel config files that have pcic/card
	in them as follows:
		controller	pcic0	at isa?
		controller	pcic1	at isa?
		controller	card0

19990929:
	The sigset_t datatype has been changed from an integral type
	to a compound type and can hold 128 signals. Syscalls directly
	or indirectly using the new sigset_t have been added as to
	maintain compatibility with existing binaries. A new kernel must
	be made and installed and booted with before a make world can
	be done.

	***************************************************************
		RECOMPILE AND REINSTALL KERNEL BEFORE MAKEWORLD
	***************************************************************

19990919:
	New jail syscall format requires recompilation of jail(8) with
	fresh headers installed (or a make world will do it for you).

19990914:
	Matt Dillon checked in many vm related things and sent a heads up
	to -current urging caution and to report vm problems to him.
	As of the 19th, no killer problems have been reported, but you
	have been warned.

19990908:
	The new miibus has been added to the system.  If you are using
	the dm, rl, sf, sis, ste, tl, wb or xl drivers, you need to
	add "controller miibus0" to your config file.

19990905:
	/var/cron/log has been moved to /var/log/cron to get all the
	log files in one place.

19990831:
	tn3270 has been removed from the base system and added as a port.

19990830:
	User-visible TCP timers are now expressed in units of 1ms, instead
	of 500ms, so if you've customized any timer values under
	``net.inet.tcp'', multiply them by 500 to preserve TCP's behavior.

19990828:
	RCS Id tags changed to FreeBSD.  This will cause huge cvsup
	updates.

19990821:
	On 28-May-1999 libreadline was upgraded from readline-2.2 to
	readline-4.0.  At that time the shared library major version
	number was bumped from "3" to "4".  It has been deemed that
	the interface change between readline-2.2 and readline-4.0 was
	not sufficient to warrant the version number bump.

	Thus I have reverted it back to "3".  You will need to perform
	the below immediately before your next ``make world'':
	    cd /usr/lib
	    ls -l libreadline.so.4
	        (if you have /usr/lib/libreadline.so.4)
	    mv libreadline.so.4 libreadline.so.3
	    rm -f libreadline.so
	    ln -s libreadline.so.3 libreadline.so

19990801:
	Changes to the pccardd kernel interface require that you recompile
	pccardd for new kernel.

19980725:
	The ipfw interface to the kernel has changed.  You will need to
	recompile ipfw programs for the new kernel.

19990715:
	The bpfilter device has been renamed to bpf.  You will need to 
	change your config files in order to enable this in newer kernels.

19990704:
	src/contrib/sys/softupdates is moving to
	src/sys/contrib/softupdates.  Update your symbolic links/etc.

19990702:
	Major changes have been made to vinum and its interface.  See
	the man page (vinum(8)) for details.  Look at the concat,
	mirror and stripe commands, as well as the SIMPLIFIED
	CONFIGURATION section.

19990628:
	Newsyslog.conf has had a minor, but potentially dangerous,
	change to its username/group syntax.  The old syntax was
	user.group, while the new syntax is user:group.

19990627:
	Inetd wrapping default has changed.  Please see the updated
	man page for details.

19990623:
	Compaq Smart Raid driver committed as ida.

19990622:
	The second phase of syscons cleanup has happened.  Some
	functionality has been made optional.  For details, see
        http://www.freebsd.org/~yokota/sc_update-June.txt
	Everyone will need to re-config(8) their kernels, but old
	binaries will work with the new kernel.

19990620:
	IPFW uid/gid-based filtering support has been committed. This
	breaks binary compatibility with previous copies of
	ipfw(8). Any utilities using the ioctl()s of ipfw (especially
	ipfw(8)) need to be recompiled with the newest headers
	installed.

19990618:
	Inetd now wraps all stream-based services, including internals.
	Syslog "severity" options are honoured. Installed syslog.conf
	and hosts.allow should be checked.

19990509:
	Most of the problems with newbus have been corrected, but
	it is still current and evolving.

	libcam's ABI has changed.  You must recompile the world and
	any ports that use it.

19990427:
	Massive changes to SMP went into the tree that should speed
	things up.  However, if you experience problems with SMP 
	machines, you can back off to the PRE_SMP_VMSHARE tag in the
	CVS repository (or run an MP kernel).

19990420:
	Pccardd and the pccard bus in general seem to be broken or
	most people.  Soren has patches to make it better for some,
	but not all people.  Work is underway to make it better for
	all people.

19990416:
	new bus changes integrated into -current.  Many problems were
	initially reported, but most have been fixed.  You'll need a
	new config and to tweak your kernel config file the way that
	GENERIC was tweaked.  Keep a copy of your old kernel when
	upgrading in case your new kernel doesn't work (and report the
	breakage to current@freebsd.org).

	As of 19990421 the remaining problems/quirks are

	o sio no longer supports pnp nor pccard.  This will be corrected,
	  but the new pccard code needs to be completed.
	o Some of the sound drivers broke for some people.  It seems
	  inconsistent as to who/what/when/where things broke.
	o Duplicate device entries in your config do not work.  Previously
	  they were silently ignored.  psm0 seems to be the most common
	  duplicate choice, although some reports have come in from people
	  that wired their scsi disk entries.
	o You must move the keyboard and mouse attachments from the
	  isa bus to the atkbdc bus.  See GENERIC for details.
	o Machines with multiple host-pci bridges (Intel 450NX) will not
	  probe the second pci bus.
	o Some probe ordering may have changed, so device naming may change
	  with the new kernel.  If you have multiple devices, please double
	  check to make sure they didn't move.  This is especially true
	  for cards on different buses.
	o The bus attachment for vga0 is always isa0 and never pci0 when
	  it is in fact a pci card.  It is safe to ignore this.
	o The format of the boot messages has changed (and is not
	  guaranteed to be constant for a while) so you may see this
	  in some shell scripts that diff dmesg from day to day as well
	  as scripts that parse dmesg output.

19990414:
	cc -aout sometimes has problems compiling with -g, remove -g
	from those compilation units affected until this is corrected.

	cc -aout has problems with producing some threaded libraries,
	so make world -DWANT_AOUT is not functional at this time.

	Since make world for a.out isn't functional, you cannot do
	make aout-to-elf from a pre-egcs a.out system.  To work around
	this problem, make aout-to-elf using 3.1-stable first (or a
	pre egcs -current) and then a simple make world will take you
	the rest of the way with a -current source base.

19990413:
	Make -j works again for make world.  As always, use it with
	care, and be sure to try a make world w/o -j before reporting
	problems (that is, know if the problem exists w/o -j before
	reporting the problem with -j).

19990413:
	Note cc -aout, which had been broken since the conversion to
	egcs, now supposedly works.  If you have rebuilt things like
	XFree86 a.out libraries, you should rebuild them again or
	progams that use them, including netscape, will fail to work.

19990409:
	NOTE: New c++ compiler cannot be used with c++ binaries from
	the old compiler and vice versa.

19990408:
	In recent days egcs has been imported into the tree.  A number
	of problems have been discussed in -current.  Here is a highlight
	of a few of the more common ones.  With the exception of make
	-j n, they have been claimed to have been fixed.

	c++ is broken after make world: This is correct.  Because we
	changed compilers two make worlds are necessary to get C++
	working again.  The code generated by the old compiler and new
	compiler are not compatible, so things wind up being
	undefined.

	cpp is broken in make world:  There was a window where cpp
	would be built incorrectly.  The fix for this is
		cd src/gnu/usr.bin/cc
		make clean
		make all
		make install
	and this should correct your problems.  See the -current
	archives for a version of this that does moer cleaning.

	Make -j n doesn't work.  Work contiunes to make this work,
	I've seen no reports of success as of April 7th.

19990329:
	Previously, one would define "NOAOUT" to keep from building
	the legacy a.out bits.  Now one would define "WANT_AOUT" to
	build them.

19990316:
	The name of the old wd.c and atapi.c based CDROM driver has
	been changed back to wcd. So update your config file to use
	"device wcd" instead of "device acd".

19990314:
	For those of you using the VN device as a loadable module,
	please be aware that the new VN device has been committed to
	-4.x and cannot yet be used as a loadable module.  This will
	be fixed in the future.
	
19990309:
	New loader.rc mechanism.  Please see src/sys/boot/README for
	details.

19990225:
	struct proc size changed.  Recompile kernel and the
	usual suspects.  Make world if in doubt.

19990214:
	The nlpt driver has changed names back to be the lpt driver.
	See ppbus(4) or http://www.freebsd.org/~nsouch/ppbus.html
	for proper configuration details.

19990210:
	The 'lpt' driver is now obsolete.  Replace it with the 'nlpt'
	driver and 'ppbus' controller combination.

19990209:
	New devstat API requires recompilation of libdevstat, systat,
	iostat, vmstat and rpc.rstatd.  A new kernel is also required.
	make world + building a kernel should do all of this.  Any
	ports that use devstat need to be recompiled as well.

19990125:
	Linux threads options has gone away (they are now standard in
	the FreeBSD kernel).  A recompile of all libkvm using programs
	is in order (or better yet a make world).

19990122:
	On or about this date there was a small window when the boot
	blocks had some minor problems which seemed to force one to
	edit /etc/fstab.  This has been corrected, if you are seeing this
	problem, please rebuild and reinstall your boot blocks.

19990121:
	Vinum has changed.  The "vinum read" command has changed.  For
	updates, please see

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=800363+0+current/freebsd-current

	for details.  

	Matt Dillon committed a boatload of VM changes, for
	information please see

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=886676+0+current/freebsd-current
	or
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=827400+0+current/freebsd-current

	for details.  These changes will likely not impact anybody,
	but large chagnes to the VM need at least a heads up.

19990120:
	Stable branch created.  You might want to consider using this
	branch.  It is tagged with RELENG_3.

19990119:
	More work on the syscons driver has been committed.  Since
	files moved around, you will need to reconfigure your kernel,
	and make clean; make depend before rebuilding the kernel.  No
	config file changes are needed.

19990111:
	New keyboard and video card drivers are introduced as the first
	stage of console driver reorganization.  You are required to
	update the kernel configuration file and rebuild the kernel.
	kbdcontrol, vidcontrol, and screen savers also need recompilation.
	The instruction can be found in

		http://www.freebsd.org/~yokota/sc_update.txt

	It has notes on splash screen too.

19990106:
	Robert Nordier was kind enough to make this page to enable people to
	install the new bootblocks:

		http://www.freebsd.org/~rnordier/boot.txt

	When updating to ELF, make sure that you have updated your
	/etc/rc files which have different ldconfig invocations for
	elf and aout.  Otherwise things like X will stop working with
	messages about being unable to find library files.  The
	mergemaster utility in ports/sysutils/mergemaster helps to
	keep critical files like this in sync, and its use is
	recommended.

19990104:
	Information about ELF day (see 19981230) can be found in

		http://www.freebsd.org/~peter/elfday.html

	about the upcoming change, its motivations and instructions
	for doing the upgrade.

19981230:
	You should install new bootblocks now.  The ELF kernel will
	become default soon.  In addition, you'll need to upgrade
	your userland programs to ELF before then as well.  Use
	make aout-to-elf to upgrade your userland programs (old
	a.out programs in, for example, /usr/local/bin will
	continue to work, even after the upgrade).  See src/Makefile
	for more details.

19981224:
	The old wcd driver has been deleted from the kernel.  The
	driver that replaces it is named acd.  You'll need to change
	this in your configuration files.

	Failure to do this will result in "ATAPI CD-ROMs not
	configured" at boot time.

	The floppy tape driver (ft) has been removed from the kernel,
	with no replacement driver.

19981202:
	New groups from 19981201 commented out of mtree, so they
	aren't strictly needed, but still a good idea to have.

19981201:
	New user/group added: bind.  From src/etc/master.passwd and
	src/etc/group:
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/group 
		bind:*:53:
		% grep <newstuff> /usr/src/etc/master.passwd 
		tty:*:4:65533::0:0:Tty Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
		kmem:*:5:65533::0:0:KMem Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin
		bind:*:53:53::0:0:Bind Sandbox:/:/sbin/nologin

19981118:
	PAM integrated into the tree.   Requires new /etc/pam.conf file
	to silence warnings from authentication programs (login, etc).
	See src/etc/pam.conf for a sample.
