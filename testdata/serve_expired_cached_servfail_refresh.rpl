SCENARIO_BEGIN Test serve-expired with client-timeout and a SERVFAIL upstream reply
; Scenario overview:
; - query for example.com. IN A
; - answer from upstream is SERVFAIL; will be cached for NORR_TTL(5)
; - check that the client gets the SERVFAIL; also cached
; - query again right after the TTL expired
; - cached SERVFAIL should be ignored and upstream queried
; - answer from upstream is still SERVFAIL; the cached error response will be
;   refreshed for another NORR_TTL(5)
; - check that the client gets the SERVFAIL
; - query again; the upstream now has the answer available
; - check that we get the refreshed cached response instead
