.SH NAME
\fBaddch\fR, \fBwaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR, \fBmvwaddch\fR,
\fBechochar\fR, 
\fBwechochar\fR - add a character (with attributes) to a \fBncurses\fR window, then advance the cursor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <ncurses.h>\fR

\fBaddch(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBwaddch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBmvaddch(int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBmvwaddch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBechochar(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBwechochar(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBaddch\fR, \fBwaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR and \fBmvwaddch\fR routines put
the character \fIch\fR into the given window at its current window position,
which is then advanced.  They are analogous to \fBputchar\fR in \fBstdio\fR(3).
If the advance is at the right margin, the cursor automatically wraps to the
beginning of the next line.  At the bottom of the scrolling region, if
\fBscrollok\fR is enabled, the scrolling region is scrolled up one line.

If \fIch\fR is a tab, newline, or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately
within the window.  A newline also does a \fBclrtoeol\fR before moving.  Tabs
are considered to be at every eighth column.

If \fIch\fR is any control character other than tab, newline, or backspace, it
is drawn in \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.  Calling \fBwinch\fR after adding a
control character does not return the control character, but instead returns
the representation of the control character.  (To emit control characters
literally, use \fBechochar\fR.)

Video attributes can be combined with a character by OR-ing them into the
parameter.  This results in these attributes also being set.  (The intent here
is that text, including attributes, can be copied from one place to another
using \fBinch\fR and \fBaddch\fR.)  [see \fBstandout\fR, predefined video
attribute constants, on the curs_attr(3) page].

The \fBechochar\fR and \fBwechochar\fR routines are functionally equivalent to
a call to \fBaddch\fR followed by a call to \fBrefresh\fR, or a call to
\fBwaddch\fR followed by a call to \fBwrefresh\fR.  The knowledge that only a
single character is being output is taken into consideration and, for
non-control characters, a considerable performance gain might be seen by using
these routines instead of their equivalents.
.SS Line Graphics
The following variables may be used to add line drawing characters to the
screen with routines of the \fBaddch\fR family.  The default character listed
below is used if the \fBacsc\fR capability doesn't define a terminal-specific
replacement for it.  The names are taken from the VT100 nomenclature.

.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value
other than \fBERR\fR upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the
preceding routine descriptions.

.SH NOTES
Note that \fBaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR, \fBmvwaddch\fR, and
\fBechochar\fR may be macros.

On 386 and 486 consoles, giving \fBwechochar\fR an argument with its high
bit set will produce the corresponding high-half ASCIIZ graphic (SVr4 curses
also has this feature but does not document it).  A control-character argument,
however, will not typically produce the corresponding graphic; 
characters such as CR, NL, FF and TAB are typically interpreted by the console
driver itself, and ESC will be interpreted as the leader of a control sequence.
