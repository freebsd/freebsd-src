.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is used to establish a security context between an
application and a remote peer using the RPSEC_GSS protocol.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width "options_req"
.It clnt
An RPC handle which is connected to the remote peer
.It principal
The name of the service principal on the remote peer.
For instance, a principal such as
.Qq nfs@server.example.com
might be used by an application which needs to contact an NFS server
.It mechanism
The desired mechanism for this security context.
The value of mechanism should be the name of one of the security
mechanisms listed in /etc/gss/mech.
.It service
Type of service requested.
.Bl -tag -width "rpc_gss_svc_integrity"
.It rpc_gss_svc_default
The default - typically the same as
.Dv rpc_gss_svc_none .
.It rpc_gss_svc_none
RPC headers only are integrity protected by a checksum.
.It rpc_gss_svc_integrity
RPC headers and data are integrity protected by a checksum.
.It rpc_gss_svc_privacy
RPC headers are integrity protected by a checksum and data is encrypted.
.El
.It qop
Desired quality of protection or NULL for the default.
Available values are listed in /etc/gss/qop
.It options_req
Extra security context options to be passed to the underlying GSS-API
mechanism.
Pass
.Dv NULL
to supply default values.
.It options_ret
Various values returned by the underlying GSS-API mechanism.
Pass
.Dv NULL
if these values are not required.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the security context was created successfully, a pointer to an
.Vt AUTH
structure that represents the context is returned.
To use this security context for subsequent RPC calls, set
.Va clnt->cl_auth
to this value.
