.Sh NAME
.Nm libstatcounters
.Nd A library to gather BERI/CHERI's statcounters.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides an API to the BERI/CHERI statcounters. To link with
.Nm
, use "-lstatcounters" when compiling. When linking statically, add
.Pp
"-Wl,--whole-archive -lstatcounters -Wl,--no-whole-archive"
.Pp
to the linking flags to still enable the automatic sampling of statcounters before and after
.Fn main
, and output of the difference (this is naturally available if not linking static). The behaviour of the automatic sampling is controlled through the
.Nm STATCOUNTERS_OUTPUT
and
.Nm STATCOUNTERS_FORMAT
environment variables.
.Pp
.Nm STATCOUNTERS_OUTPUT
.Nd Environment variable specifying the file in which to output the statcounters'values
.Pp
.Nm STATCOUNTERS_FORMAT
.Nd Environment variable specifying the desired output format. "csv" is supported, any other value will output in a human readable format
.Sh API
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn reset_statcounters
.in +5
.Fn reset_statcounters
resets the hardware statcounters. Avoid using this function and consider using
.Fn sample_statcounters
to populate two statcounters_bank_t and diff them using
.Fn diff_statcounters
instead.
.in
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn zero_statcounters "statcounters_bank_t * const b"
.in +5
.Fn zero_statcounters
zeroes the statcounters_bank_t
.Fa b .
.in
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn sample_statcounters "statcounters_bank_t * const b"
.in +5
.Fn sample_statcounters
samples the hardware statcounters into statcounters_bank_t
.Fa b .
.in
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn diff_statcounters "const statcounters_bank_t * const be" "const statcounters_bank_t * const bs" "statcounters_bank_t * const bd"
.in +5
.Fn diff_statcounters
stores the difference between statcounters_bank_t
.Fa be
and
.Fa bs
in statcounters_bank_t
.Fa bd .
.in
.Pp
.Ft void
.Fn dump_statcounters "const statcounters_bank_t * const b" "const char * const fname" "const char * const fmt"
.in +5
.Fn dump_statcounters
dumps the statcounters_bank_t
.Fa b
content in file
.Fa fname
according to format
.Fa fmt .
The
.Fa fname
is a string  describing the path to the desired file. The supported value for the
.Fa fmt
string are "csv" for csv output, or anything else for human readable output.
