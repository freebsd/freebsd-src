.Sh NAME
.Nm kinfo_getvmobject
.Nd function for getting system-wide memory information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/user.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft struct kinfo_vmobject *
.Fn kinfo_getvmobject "int *cntp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is used to obtain information about the objects using memory
in the system.
.Pp
The
.Ar cntp
argument allows the caller to know how many records are returned.
.Pp
This function is a wrapper around the
.Dq vm.objects
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB.
While the kernel returns a packed structure, this function expands the
data into a fixed record format.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success the
.Fn kinfo_getvmobject
function returns a pointer to an array of
.Vt struct kinfo_vmobject
structures as defined by
.In sys/user.h .
The array is allocated by an internal call to
.Xr malloc 3
and must be freed by the caller with a call to
.Xr free 3 .
On failure the
.Fn kinfo_getvmobject
function returns
.Dv NULL .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr kinfo_getvmmap 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn kinfo_getvmobject
function first appeared in
.Fx 10.2 .
