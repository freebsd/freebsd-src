.Sh NAME
.Nm cpuset_parselist ,
.Nm domainset_parselist
.Nd utility functions for cpuset(2) handling
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/cpuset.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft int
.Fn cpuset_parselist "const char *cpu_list" "cpuset_t *mask"
.Ft int
.Fn domainset_parselist "const char *domain_policy" "domainset_t *domain_mask" "int *policyp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cpuset_parselist
function parses a
.Va cpu-list
filling the
.Va mask .
.Pp
The
.Va cpu-list
may include numbers separated by '-' for ranges and commas separating individual
numbers.
A special list of
.Dq all
may be specified in which case the list includes all CPUs from the root set.
.Pp
The
.Fn domainset_parselist
function parses a
.Xr domainset 9
memory domain allocation policy
specified by
.Va domain_policy
filling the
.Va domain_mask
and the
.Va policyp .
A valid
.Va domain_policy
is formatted as
.Ar policy:domain-list .
See the
.Ar -n
flag in
.Xr cpuset 1
for a list of valid domain policies.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Return values can be the following
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Dv CPUSET_PARSE_OK
The parsing was successful
.It Dv CPUSET_PARSE_ERROR
The
.Va cpu-list
or
.Va domain-policy
format is invalid
.It Dv CPUSET_PARSE_GETAFFINITY
The
.Xr cpuset_getaffinity 2
call has failed
.It Dv CPUSET_PARSE_INVALID_CPU
The number of supported CPUs or NUMA domains has been exceeded.
The maximum number being
.Va CPU_SETSIZE
and
.Va DOMAINSET_SETSIZE
respectively.
.It Dv CPUSET_PARSE_GETDOMAIN
The
.Xr cpuset_getdomain 2
call has failed
