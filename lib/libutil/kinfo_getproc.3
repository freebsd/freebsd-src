.Dt KINFO_GETPROC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kinfo_getproc
.Nd function for getting process information from kernel
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/user.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft struct kinfo_proc *
.Fn kinfo_getproc "pid_t pid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is used for obtaining process information from the kernel.
.Pp
The
.Ar pid
field contains the process identifier.
This should be a process that you have privilege to access.
This function is a wrapper around
.Xr sysctl 3
with the
.Dv KERN_PROC_PID
mib.
While the kernel returns a packed structure, this function expands the
data into a fixed record format.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success the
.Fn kinfo_getproc
function returns a pointer to a
.Vt struct kinfo_proc
structure as defined by
.In sys/user.h .
The pointer was obtained by an internal call to
.Xr malloc 3
and must be freed by the caller with a call to
.Xr free 3 .
On failure the
.Fn kinfo_getproc
function returns
.Dv NULL .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn kinfo_getproc
function first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
