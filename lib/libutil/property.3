.Pp
The function
.Fn properties_read
reads
.Fa name = value
pairs from the file descriptor passed in
.Fa fd
and returns the head of a new property list, assuming that the
file's contents have been parsed properly, or NULL in case
of error.
.Pp
The
.Fn property_find
function returns the associated value string for the property named
.Fa name
if found, otherwise NULL.
The value returned may be up to
.Dv PROPERTY_MAX_VALUE
bytes in length.
.Pp
The
.Fn properties_free
function is used to free the structure returned by
.Fn properties_read
when it is no longer needed.
.Sh FILE FORMAT
Each property in the file is assumed to have the format of
.Fa name = value
where
.Fa name
is an alphanumeric string (and any punctuation not including the `=' character)
and
.Fa value
is an arbitrary string of text terminated by a newline character.
If newlines
are desired, the entire value should be enclosed in { } (curly-bracket)
characters.
Any line beginning with a # or ; character is assumed to
be a comment and will be ignored.
