The function
.Fn properties_read
reads
.Fa name = value
pairs from the file specified in
.Fa fp
and returns the head of a new property list, assuming that the
file's contents have been parsed properly, or NULL in case
of error.  The property list pointer should be passed to
.Fn properties_free
when no longer needed.
.Pp
.Fn property_find
Returns the associated value string for the property named
.Fa name
if found, otherwise NULL.
.Pp
.Fn properties_free
is used to free the structure returned by
.Fn properties_read
when it is no longer needed.
