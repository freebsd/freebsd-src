.Dt RADIUS.CONF 5
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm radius.conf
.Nd RADIUS client configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /etc/radius.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the information necessary to configure the RADIUS client
library.  It is parsed by
.Xr rad_config 3 .
The file contains one or more lines of text, each describing a
single RADIUS server which will be used by the library.  Leading
white space is ignored, as are empty lines and lines containing
only comments.
.Pp
A RADIUS server is described by two to four fields on a line.  The
fields are separated by white space.  The
.Ql #
character at the beginning of a field begins a comment, which extends
to the end of the line.  A field may be enclosed in double quotes,
in which case it may contain white space and/or begin with the
.Ql #
character.  Within a quoted string, the double quote character can
be represented by
.Ql \e\&" ,
and the backslash can be represented by
.Ql \e\e .
No other escape sequences are supported.
.Pp
The first field specifies
the server host, either as a fully qualified domain name or as a
dotted-quad IP address.  The host may optionally be followed by a
.Ql \&:
and a numeric port number, without intervening white space.  If the
port specification is omitted, it defaults to the
.Ql radius
service in the
.Pa /etc/services
file, or to the standard RADIUS port 1812 if there is no such entry in
.Pa /etc/services .
.Pp
The second field contains the shared secret, which should be known
only to the client and server hosts.  It is an arbitrary string of
characters, though it must be enclosed in double quotes if it
contains white space.  The shared secret may be
any length, but the RADIUS protocol uses only the first 128
characters.  N.B., some popular RADIUS servers have bugs which
prevent them from working properly with secrets longer than 16
characters.
.Pp
The third field contains a decimal integer specifying the timeout in
seconds for receiving a valid reply from the server.  If this field
is omitted, it defaults to 3 seconds.
.Pp
The fourth field contains a decimal integer specifying the maximum
number of attempts that will be made to authenticate with the server
before giving up.  If omitted, it defaults to 3 attempts.  Note,
this is the total number of attempts and not the number of retries.
.Pp
Up to 10 RADIUS servers may be specified.  The servers are tried in
round-robin fashion, until a valid response is received or the
maximum number of tries has been reached for all servers.
.Pp
The standard location for this file is
.Pa /etc/radius.conf .
But an alternate pathname may be specified in the call to
.Xr rad_config 3 .
Since the file contains sensitive information in the form of the
shared secrets, it should not be readable except by root.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
# A simple entry using all the defaults:
radius1.domain.com	OurLittleSecret

# A server still using the obsolete RADIUS port, with increased
# timeout and maximum tries:
auth.domain.com:1645	"I can't see you, but I know you're there"  5  4

# A server specified by its IP address:
192.168.27.81		$X*#..38947ax-+=
