 * the same precision as 'a' and the resulting b is the rounding error.)
 * |a| must be >= |b| or 0, b's type must be no larger than 'a's type, and
 * exponent overflow or underflow must not occur.  This uses a Theorem of
 * Dekker (1971).  See Knuth (1981) 4.2.2 Theorem C.  The name "TwoSum"
 * is apparently due to Skewchuk (1997).
 *
 * For this to always work, assignment of a + b to 'a' must not retain any
 * extra precision in a + b.  This is required by C standards but broken
 * in many compilers.  The brokenness cannot be worked around using
 * STRICT_ASSIGN() like we do elsewhere, since the efficiency of this
 * algorithm would be destroyed by non-null strict assignments.  (The
 * compilers are correct to be broken -- the efficiency of all floating
 * point code calculations would be destroyed similarly if they forced the
 * conversions.)
 *
 * Fortunately, a case that works well can usually be arranged by building
 * any extra precision into the type of 'a' -- 'a' should have type float_t,
 * double_t or long double.  b's type should be no larger than 'a's type.
 * Callers should use these types with scopes as large as possible, to
 * reduce their own extra-precision and efficiency problems.  In
 * particular, they shouldn't convert back and forth just to call here.
