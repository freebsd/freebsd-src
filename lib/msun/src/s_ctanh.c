/*
 * Hyperbolic tangent of a complex argument z = x + I y.
 *
 * The algorithm is from:
 *
 *   W. Kahan.  Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions or Much
 *   Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit.  In The State of the Art in
 *   Numerical Analysis, pp. 165 ff.  Iserles and Powell, eds., 1987.
 *
 * Method:
 *
 *   Let t    = tan(x)
 *       beta = 1/cos^2(y)
 *       s    = sinh(x)
 *       rho  = cosh(x)
 *
 *   We have:
 *
 *   tanh(z) = sinh(z) / cosh(z)
 *
 *             sinh(x) cos(y) + I cosh(x) sin(y)
 *           = ---------------------------------
 *             cosh(x) cos(y) + I sinh(x) sin(y)
 *
 *             cosh(x) sinh(x) / cos^2(y) + I tan(y)
 *           = -------------------------------------
 *                    1 + sinh^2(x) / cos^2(y)
 *
 *             beta rho s + I t
 *           = ----------------
 *               1 + beta s^2
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *   I omitted the original algorithm's handling of overflow in tan(x) after
 *   verifying with nearpi.c that this can't happen in IEEE single or double
 *   precision.  I also handle large x differently.
