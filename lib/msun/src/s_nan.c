 * Scan a string of hexadecimal digits (the format nan(3) expects) and
 * make a bit array (using the local endianness). We stop when we
 * encounter an invalid character, NUL, etc.  If we overflow, we do
 * the same as gcc's __builtin_nan(), namely, discard the high order bits.
 *
 * The format this routine accepts needs to be compatible with what is used
 * in contrib/gdtoa/hexnan.c (for strtod/scanf) and what is used in
 * __builtin_nan(). In fact, we're only 100% compatible for strings we
 * consider valid, so we might be violating the C standard. But it's
 * impossible to use nan(3) portably anyway, so this seems good enough.
