	 * When log(|z|) is far from 1, accuracy in calculating the sum
	 * of the squares is not very important since log() reduces
	 * inaccuracies.  We depended on this to use the general
	 * formula when log(|z|) is very far from 1.  When log(|z|) is
	 * moderately far from 1, we go through the extra-precision
	 * calculations to reduce branches and gain a little accuracy.
	 *
	 * When |z| is near 1, we subtract 1 and use log1p() and don't
	 * leave it to log() to subtract 1, since we gain at least 1 bit
	 * of accuracy in this way.
	 *
	 * When |z| is very near 1, subtracting 1 can cancel almost
	 * 3*MANT_DIG bits.  We arrange that subtracting 1 is exact in
	 * doubled precision, and then do the rest of the calculation
	 * in sloppy doubled precision.  Although large cancellations
	 * often lose lots of accuracy, here the final result is exact
	 * in doubled precision if the large calculation occurs (because
	 * then it is exact in tripled precision and the cancellation
	 * removes enough bits to fit in doubled precision).  Thus the
	 * result is accurate in sloppy doubled precision, and the only
	 * significant loss of accuracy is when it is summed and passed
	 * to log1p().
