.Sh NAME
.Nm fegetround ,
.Nm fesetround

.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fenv.h
.Fd "#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON"
.Ft int
.Fn fegetround void
.Ft int
.Fn fesetround "int round"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fegetround
function determines the current floating-point rounding mode,
and the
.Fn fesetround
function sets the current rounding mode to
.Fa round .
The rounding mode is one of
.Dv FE_TONEAREST , FE_DOWNWARD , FE_UPWARD ,
or
.Dv FE_TOWARDZERO ,
as described in
.Xr fenv 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn fegetround
routine returns the current rounding mode.
The
.Fn fesetround
function returns 0 on success and non-zero otherwise;
however, the present implementation always succeeds.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fenv 3 ,
.Xr fpgetround 3 ,
.Xr fpsetround 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fegetround
and
.Fn fesetround
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
These routines first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
They supersede the non-standard
.Xr fpgetround 3
and
.Xr fpsetround 3
functions.
