.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions calculate the error function of
.Fa x .
.Pp
The
.Fn erf ,
.Fn erff ,
and
.Fn erfl
functions calculate the error function of x; where

.Pp
The
.Fn erfc ,
.Fn erfcf ,
and
.Fn erfcl
functions calculate the complementary error function of
.Fa x ;
that is
.Fn erfc
subtracts the result of the error function
.Fn erf x
from 1.0.
