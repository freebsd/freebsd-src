.Dt TANPI 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tanpi ,
.Nm tanpif ,
.Nm tanpil
.Nd half\(encycle tangent functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn tanpi "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn tanpif "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn tanpil "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tanpi ,
.Fn tanpif ,
and
.Fn tanpil
functions compute the tangent of
.Fa "\(*p \(mu x"
and measure angles in half-cycles.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn tanpi ,
.Fn tanpif ,
and
.Fn tanpil
functions returns
.Fn tan "\(*p \(mu x" .
If \*(Bax\*(Ba \*(Ge 2^(p - 1)
where p is the floating\(enpoint precision of
.Ar x ,
then the returned value is \*(Pm0 and it has no significance.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Bl -tag
.It
.Fn tanpi \*(Pm0
returns \*(Pm0.
.It
.Fn tanpi \*(Pmn
returns \*(Pm0 for positive integers
.Ar n .
.It
.Fn tanpi \*(Pmn/2
returns \*(Na for n > 0 and raises an FE_INVALID exception.
.It
.Fn tanpi \*(Pm\(if
return an \*(Na and raises an FE_INVALID exception.
.It
.Fn tanpi \*(Na
return an \*(Na and raises an FE_INVALID exception.
