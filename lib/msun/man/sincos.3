.Sh NAME
.Nm sincos ,
.Nm sincosf ,
.Nm sincosl
.Nd sine and cosine functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft void
.Fn sincos "double x" "double *s" "double *c"
.Ft void
.Fn sincosf "float x" "float *s" "float *c"
.Ft void
.Fn sincosl "long double x" "long double *s" "long double *c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sincos ,
.Fn sincosf ,
and
.Fn sincosl
functions compute the sine and cosine of
.Fa x .
Using these functions allows argument reduction to occur only
once instead of twice with individual invocations of
.Fn sin
and
.Fn cos .
Like
.Fn sin
and
.Fn cos ,
a large magnitude argument may yield a result with little
or no significance.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon returning from
.Fn sincos ,
.Fn sincosf ,
and
.Fn sincosl ,
the memory pointed to by
.Fa "*s"
and
.Fa "*c"
are assigned the values of sine and cosine, respectively.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cos 3 ,
.Xr sin 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions were added to
.Fx 11.2
to aid in writing various complex function contained in
.St -isoC-99 .
