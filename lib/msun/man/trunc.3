.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn trunc "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn truncf "float x"
.Ft "long double"
.Fn truncl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn trunc ,
.Fn truncf ,
and
.Fn truncl
functions return the nearest integral value with magnitude less than
or equal to
.Pf | Fa x Ns | .
They are equivalent to
.Fn rint ,
.Fn rintf ,
and
.Fn rintl ,
respectively, in the
.Dv FE_TOWARDZERO
rounding mode.
