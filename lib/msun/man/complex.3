.Sh NAME
.Nm complex
.Nd "complex arithmetic"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions support complex arithmetic in the C math library.
.Sh "LIST OF FUNCTIONS"
Each of the following
.Vt "double complex"
functions has a
.Vt "float complex"
counterpart with an
.Ql f
appended to the name and a
.Vt "long double complex"
counterpart with an
.Ql l
appended.
As an example, the
.Vt "float complex"
and
.Vt "long double complex"
counterparts of
.Ft double
.Fn cabs "double complex z"
are
.Ft float
.Fn cabsf "float complex z"
and
.Ft "long double"
.Fn cabsl "long double complex z" ,
respectively.

functions described here conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh BUGS
The power functions,
.Fn cpowf, cpow ,
and
.Fn cpowl ,
are implemented, but the code was neither reviewed nor tested.
