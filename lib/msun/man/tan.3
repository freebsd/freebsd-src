.Dt TAN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tan ,
.Nm tanf ,
.Nm tanl
.Nd tangent functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn tan "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn tanf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn tanl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tan ,
.Fn tanf ,
and
.Fn tanl
functions compute the tangent of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
A large magnitude argument may yield a result
with little or no significance.
For a discussion of error due to roundoff, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn tan ,
.Fn tanf ,
and
.Fn tanl
functions return the tangent value.
