.Dt SINPI 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sinpi ,
.Nm sinpif ,
.Nm sinpil
.Nd half\(encycle sine functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn sinpi "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sinpif "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sinpil "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sinpi ,
.Fn sinpif ,
and
.Fn sinpil
functions compute the sine of
.Fa "\(*p \(mu x" .
and measure angles in half-cycles.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sinpi ,
.Fn sinpif ,
and
.Fn sinpil
functions returns
.Fn sin "\(*p \(mu x" .
If \*(Bax\*(Ba \*(Ge 2^(p - 1)
where p is the floating\(enpoint precision of
.Ar x ,
then the returned value is \*(Pm0 and it has no significance.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Bl -tag -width "sinpi(NaN)"
.It Fn sinpi \*(Pm0
returns \*(Pm0.
.It Fn sinpi \*(Pmn
returns \*(Pm0 for positive integers
.Ar n .
.It Fn sinpi \*(Pm\(if
return an \*(Na and raises an FE_INVALID exception.
.It Fn sinpi \*(Na
return an \*(Na and raises an FE_INVALID exception.
