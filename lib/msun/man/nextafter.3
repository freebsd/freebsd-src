.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn nextafter ,
.Fn nextafterf ,
.Fn nextafterl ,
.Fn nexttoward ,
.Fn nexttowardf ,
and
.Fn nexttowardl
routines conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
They implement the Nextafter function recommended by
.St -ieee754 ,
with the extension that
.Fn nextafter "+0.0" "-0.0"
returns
.Li -0.0 ,
and
.Fn nextafter "-0.0" "+0.0"
returns
.Li +0.0 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn nextafter
function appeared in
.Bx 4.3 ,
and
.Fn nextafterf
appeared in
.Fx 2.0 .
