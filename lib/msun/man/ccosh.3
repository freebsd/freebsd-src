.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In complex.h
.Ft double complex
.Fn ccosh "double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn ccoshf "float complex z"
.Ft double complex
.Fn csinh "double complex z"
.Ft float complex

.Fn ctanhf "float complex z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ccosh ,
.Fn csinh ,
and
.Fn ctanh
functions compute the hyperbolic cosine, sine, and tangent of the complex number
.Fa z ,
respectively.
The
.Fn ccoshf ,
.Fn csinhf ,
and
.Fn ctanhf
functions perform the same operations in
.Fa float
precision.
