.Sh NAME
.Nm scalb ,
.Nm scalbf ,
.Nm significand ,
.Nm significandf
.Nd IEEE test functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn scalb "double x" "double n"
.Ft float
.Fn scalbf "float x" "float n"
.Ft double
.Fn significand "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn significandf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions allow users to test conformance to
.St -ieee754 .
Their use is not otherwise recommended.
.Pp
.Fn scalb x n
and
.Fn scalbf x n
return
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
If
.Fa n
is not an integer, \*(Pm\*(If, or an \*(Na, the result is unspecified.
.Pp
.Fn significand x
and
.Fn significandf x
return
.Fa sig ,
where
.Fa x
:=
.Fa sig No \(** 2** Ns Fa n
with 1 \(<=
.Fa sig
< 2.
.Fn significand x
and
.Fn significandf x
are not defined when
.Fa x
is 0, \*(Pm\*(If, or \*(Na.
