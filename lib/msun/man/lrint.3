.Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft "long long"
.Fn llrint "double x"
.Ft "long long"
.Fn llrintf "float x"
.Ft "long long"
.Fn llrintl "long double x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrint "double x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrintf "float x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrintl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lrint
function returns the integer nearest to its argument
.Fa x
according to the current rounding mode.
If the rounded result is too large to be represented as a
.Vt long
value, an invalid exception is raised and the return value is undefined.
Otherwise, if
.Fa x
is not an integer,
.Fn lrint
raises an inexact exception.
When the rounded result is representable as a
.Vt long ,
the expression
.Fn lrint x
is equivalent to
.Po Vt long Pc Ns Fn rint x
(although the former may be more efficient).
.Pp
The
.Fn llrint ,
.Fn llrintf ,
.Fn llrintl ,
.Fn lrintf ,
and
.Fn lrintl
functions differ from
.Fn lrint
only in their input and output types.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lround 3 ,
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr rint 3 ,
.Xr round 3
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn llrint ,
.Fn llrintf ,
.Fn lrint ,
and
.Fn lrintf
routines first appeared in
.Fx 5.4 .
The long double variants were introduced in
.Fx 8.0 .
