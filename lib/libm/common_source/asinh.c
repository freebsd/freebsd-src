/* ASINH(X)
 * RETURN THE INVERSE HYPERBOLIC SINE OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 2/16/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 3/7/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions :
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	sqrt(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log1p(x) 		...return log(1+x)
 *
 * Method :
 *	Based on
 *		asinh(x) = sign(x) * log [ |x| + sqrt(x*x+1) ]
 *	we have
 *	asinh(x) := x  if  1+x*x=1,
 *		 := sign(x)*(log1p(x)+ln2))	 if sqrt(1+x*x)=x, else
 *		 := sign(x)*log1p(|x| + |x|/(1/|x| + sqrt(1+(1/|x|)^2)) )
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	asinh(x) returns the exact inverse hyperbolic sine of x nearly rounded.
 *	In a test run with 52,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum
 *	observed error was 1.58 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
