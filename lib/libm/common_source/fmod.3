.Sh NAME
.Nm fmod
.Nd floating-point remainder function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn fmod "double x" "double y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fmod
function computes the floating-point remainder of
.Fa x Ns / Fa y .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn fmod
function returns the value
.Sm off
.Fa x - Em i * Fa y ,
.Sm on
for some integer
.Em i
such that, if
.Fa y
is non-zero, the result has the same sign as
.Fa x
and magnitude less than the magnitude of
.Fa y .
If
.Fa y
is zero, whether a domain error occurs or the
.Fn fmod
function returns zero is implementation-defined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fmod
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
