.Sh NAME
.Nm acos
.Nd arc cosine function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn acos "double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acos
function computes the principal value of the arc cosine of
.Fa x .
A domain error occurs for arguments not in the range [-1, +1].
For a discussion of error due to roundoff, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The 
.Fn acos
function returns the arc cosine in the range
.Bq 0 , \*(Pi
radians.
On the
.Tn VAX
and
.Tn Tahoe ,
if:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Pf \&| Ns Ar x Ns \&| > 1 ,
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn acos x
sets the global variable
.Va errno
to
.Dv EDOM
and a reserved operand fault is generated.
