    * (because the vax and tahoe differ in float format!), the power
    * of 2 of the hex-float exponent, and the hex-float mantissa.

    * used in a post-check to make sure the constants were compiled

    *     #define foo vccast(foo)
    * since CPP cannot do this for them from inside another macro (sigh).
    * We define "vccast" if this needs doing.
