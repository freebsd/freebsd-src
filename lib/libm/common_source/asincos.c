/* ASIN(X)
 * RETURNS ARC SINE OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (IEEE DOUBLE 53 bits, VAX D FORMAT 56 bits)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 4/16/85, REVISED ON 6/10/85.
 *
 * Required system supported functions:
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	sqrt(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	atan2(y,x)
 *
 * Method :
 *	asin(x) = atan2(x,sqrt(1-x*x)); for better accuracy, 1-x*x is
 *		  computed as follows
 *			1-x*x                     if x <  0.5,
 *			2*(1-|x|)-(1-|x|)*(1-|x|) if x >= 0.5.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	if x is NaN, return x itself;
 *	if |x|>1, return NaN.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 * 1)  If atan2() uses machine PI, then
 *
 *	asin(x) returns (PI/pi) * (the exact arc sine of x) nearly rounded;
 *	and PI is the exact pi rounded to machine precision (see atan2 for
 *      details):
 *
 *	in decimal:

 *
 *	In a test run with more than 200,000 random arguments on a VAX, the
 *	maximum observed error in ulps (units in the last place) was
 *	2.06 ulps.      (comparing against (PI/pi)*(exact asin(x)));
 *
 * 2)  If atan2() uses true pi, then
 *
 *	asin(x) returns the exact asin(x) with error below about 2 ulps.
 *
 *	In a test run with more than 1,024,000 random arguments on a VAX, the
 *	maximum observed error in ulps (units in the last place) was
