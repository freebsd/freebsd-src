.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are required for, or recommended by the
.Tn IEEE
standard
754 for floating\-point arithmetic.
.Pp
The
.Fn copysign
function
returns
.Fa x
with its sign changed to
.Fa y Ns 's.
.Pp
The
.Fn drem
function
returns the remainder
.Fa r
:=
.Fa x
\-
.Fa n\(**y
where
.Fa n
is the integer nearest the exact value of
.Bk -words
.Fa x Ns / Ns Fa y ;
.Ek
moreover if
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa n
\-
.Sm off
.Fa x No / Fa y No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
=
1/2
then
.Fa n
is even.  Consequently
the remainder is computed exactly and
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa r No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
\*(Le
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa y No \\*(Ba/2.
.Sm on
But
.Fn drem x 0
is exceptional.
(See below under
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS . )
.Pp
The
.Fn finite
function returns the value 1 just when
\-\*(If \*(Lt
.Fa x
\*(Lt +\*(If;
otherwise a
zero is returned
(when
.Pf \\*(Ba Ns Fa x Ns \\*(Ba
= \*(If or
.Fa x
is \*(Na or
is the
.Tn VAX Ns 's
reserved operand).
.Pp
The
.Fn logb
function returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
a signed integer converted to double\-precision floating\-point and so
chosen that
1 (<=
.Pf \\*(Ba Ns Fa x Ns \\*(Ba2** Ns Fa n
< 2
unless
.Fa x
= 0 or
(only on machines that conform to
.Tn IEEE
754)
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa x Ns \\*(Ba
= \*(If
or
.Fa x
lies between 0 and the Underflow Threshold.
(See below under
.Sx BUGS . )
.Pp
The
.Fn scalb
function returns
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed, for integer n, without first computing
.Pf 2\(** Fa n .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Tn IEEE
standard
754 defines
.Fn drem x 0
and
.Fn drem \\*(If y
to be invalid operations that produce a \*(Na.
On the
.Tn VAX , 
.Fn drem x 0
generates a reserved operand fault.  No \*(If
exists on a
.Tn VAX . 
.Pp
.Tn IEEE
754 defines
.if n \
.Fn logb \(+-\\*(If
= \*(If and
.Fn logb 0
= \-\*(If, and
requires the latter to signal Division\-by\-Zero.
But on a
.Tn VAX , 
.Fn logb 0
= 1.0 \- 2.0**31 = \-2,147,483,647.0.
And if the correct value of
.Fn scalb
would overflow on a
.Tn VAX , 
it generates a reserved operand fault and sets the global variable
.Va errno
to
.Dv ERANGE .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm ieee
functions appeared in 
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Should
.Fn drem x 0
and
.Fn logb 0
on a
.Tn VAX
signal invalidity 
by setting
.Va errno No = Dv EDOM ?
Should
.Fn logb 0
return  \-1.7e38?
.Pp
.Tn IEEE
754 currently specifies that
.Fn logb "denormalized no."
=
.Fn logb "tiniest normalized no. > 0"
but the consensus has changed to the specification in the new 
proposed
.Tn IEEE
standard p854, namely that
.Fn logb x
satisfy 
.Bd -filled -offset indent
1 \(<=
.Fn scalb \\*(Bax\\*(Ba \-logb(x)
<
Radix\0 ... = 2
for
.Tn IEEE
754
.Ed
.Pp
for every x except 0, 
\*(If
and \*(Na.
Almost every program that assumes 754's specification will work
correctly if
.Fn logb
follows 854's specification instead.
.Pp
.Tn IEEE
754 requires
.Fn copysign x \\*(Na)
=
.Pf \(+- Ns Fa x
but says nothing
else about the sign of a \*(Na.  A \*(Na
.Em (N Ns ot
.Em a
.Em N Ns umber )
is
similar in spirit to the
.Tn VAX Ns 's
reserved operand, but very
different in important details.  Since the sign bit of a
reserved operand makes it look negative,  
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Fn copysign x "reserved operand"
=
.Pf \- Fa x ;
.Ed
.Pp
should this return the reserved operand instead?
