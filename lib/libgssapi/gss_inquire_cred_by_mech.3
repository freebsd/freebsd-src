.Sh DESCRIPTION
Obtains per-mechanism information about a credential.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It initiator_lifetime"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It cred_handle
A handle that refers to the target credential.
Specify
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL
to inquire about the default initiator principal.
.It mech_type
The mechanism for which information should be returned.
.It name
The name whose identity the credential asserts.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the application
after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_name .
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It initiator_lifetime
The number of seconds for which the credential will remain capable of
initiating security contexts under the specified mechanism.
If the credential can no longer be used to initiate contexts,
or if the credential usage for this mechanism is
.Dv GSS_C_ACCEPT ,
this parameter will be set to zero.
If the implementation does not support expiration of initiator
credentials,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It acceptor_lifetime
The number of seconds for which the credential will remain capable of
accepting security contexts under the specified mechanism.
If the credential can no longer be used to accept contexts,
or if the credential usage for this mechanism is
.Dv GSS_C_INITIATE ,
this parameter will be set to zero.
If the implementation does not support expiration of acceptor
credentials,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It cred_usage
How the credential may be used with the specified mechanism.
One of the following:
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Dv GSS_C_INITIATE
.It
.Dv GSS_C_ACCEPT
.It
.Dv GSS_C_BOTH
.El
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_NO_CRED
The referenced credentials could not be accessed
.It GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL
The referenced credentials were invalid
.It GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED
The referenced credentials have expired.
If the lifetime parameter was not passed as
.Dv NULL ,
it will be set to 0.
