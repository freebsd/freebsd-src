.Sh DESCRIPTION
Attaches a cryptographic MIC and optionally encrypts the specified
.Dv input_message .
The output_message contains both the MIC and the message.
The
.Dv qop_req
parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic algorithms,
if supported by the chosen mechanism.
.Pp
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted
by
.Fn gss_wrap
to provide "secure framing",
implementations must support the wrapping of zero-length messages.
.Pp
The
.Fn gss_seal
routine is an obsolete variant of
.Fn gss_wrap .
It is
provided for backwards
compatibility with applications using the GSS-API V1 interface.
A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is provided,
both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link
and to retain the slight parameter type differences between the
obsolete versions of this routine and its current form.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It output_message_buffer"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It context_handle
Identifies the context on which the message will be sent.
.It conf_req_flag
.Bl -tag -width "Non-zero" -compact
.It Non-zero
Both confidentiality and integrity services are requested.
.It Zero
Only integrity service is requested.
.El
.It qop_req
Specifies required quality of protection.
A mechanism-specific default may be requested by setting qop_req to
.Dv GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT .
If an unsupported protection strength is requested,
.Fn gss_wrap
will return a major_status of
.Dv GSS_S_BAD_QOP .
.It input_message_buffer
Message to be protected.
.It conf_state
.Bl -tag -width "Non-zero" -compact
.It Non-zero
Confidentiality, data origin authentication and integrity services
have been applied.
.It Zero
Integrity and data origin services only has been applied.
.El
.It output_message_buffer
Buffer to receive protected message.
Storage associated with this buffer must
be freed by the application after use
with a call to
.Xr gss_release_buffer 3 .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion.
.It GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED
The context has already expired
.It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT
The context_handle parameter did not identify a valid context.
.It GSS_S_BAD_QOP
The specified QOP is not supported by the mechanism.
