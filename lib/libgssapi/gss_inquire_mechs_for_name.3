.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In "gssapi/gssapi.h"
.Ft OM_uint32
.Fo gss_inquire_mechs_for_name
.Fa "OM_uint32 *minor_status"
.Fa "const gss_name_t input_name"
.Fa "gss_OID_set *mech_types"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Returns the set of mechanisms supported by the GSS-API implementation
that may be able to process the specified name.
.Pp
Each mechanism returned will recognize at least one element within the
name.
It is permissible for this routine to be implemented within a
mechanism-independent GSS-API layer,
using the type information contained within the presented name,
and based on registration information provided by individual mechanism
implementations.
This means that the returned
.Fa mech_types
set may indicate that a particular mechanism will understand the name
when in fact it would refuse to accept the name as input to
.Fn gss_canonicalize_name ,
.Fn gss_init_sec_context ,
.Fn gss_acquire_cred
or
.Fn gss_add_cred
(due to some property of the specific name, as opposed to the name
type).
Thus this routine should be used only as a pre-filter for a call to a
subsequent mechanism-specific routine.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It minor_status"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It input_name
The name to which the inquiry relates.
.It mech_types
Set of mechanisms that may support the specified name.
The returned OID set must be freed by the caller after use with a call
to
.Fn gss_release_oid_set .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_COMPLETE"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_BAD_NAME
The
.Fa input_name
parameter was ill-formed
