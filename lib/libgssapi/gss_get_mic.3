.Sh DESCRIPTION
Generates a cryptographic MIC for the supplied message,
and places the MIC in a token for transfer to the peer application.
The
.Fa qop_req
parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic algorithms,
if supported by the chosen mechanism.
.Pp
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted
by
.Fn gss_wrap
to provide "secure framing",
implementations must support derivation of MICs from zero-length messages.
.Pp
The
.Fn gss_sign
routine is an obsolete variant of
.Fn gss_get_mic .
It is
provided for backwards
compatibility with applications using the GSS-API V1 interface.
A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is provided,
both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link
and to retain the slight parameter type differences between the
obsolete versions of this routine and its current form.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It message_buffer"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It context_handle
Identifies the context on which the message will be sent.
.It qop_req
Specifies requested quality of protection.
Callers are encouraged, on portability grounds,
to accept the default quality of protection offered by the chosen
mechanism,
which may be requested by specifying
.Dv GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT
for this parameter.
If an unsupported protection strength is requested,
.Fn gss_get_mic
will return a
.Fa major_status
of
.Dv GSS_S_BAD_QOP .
.It message_buffer
Message to be protected.
.It msg_token
Buffer to receive token.
The application must free storage associated with this buffer after
use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_buffer .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED
The context has already expired
.It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT
The context_handle parameter did not identify a valid context
.It GSS_S_BAD_QOP
The specified QOP is not supported by the mechanism
