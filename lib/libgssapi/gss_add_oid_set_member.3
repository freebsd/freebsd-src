.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In "gssapi/gssapi.h"
.Ft OM_uint32

.Fa "const gss_OID member_oid"

.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Add an Object Identifier to an Object Identifier set.
This routine is intended for use in conjunction with
.Fn gss_create_empty_oid_set
when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for input to
.Fn gss_acquire_cred .
The
.Fa oid_set
parameter must refer to an OID-set that was created by GSS-API
(e.g. a set returned by
.Fn gss_create_empty_oid_set ).
GSS-API creates a copy of the
.Fa member_oid
and inserts this copy into the set,
expanding the storage allocated to the OID-set's elements array if
necessary.
The routine may add the new member OID anywhere within the elements
array,
and implementations should verify that the new
.Fa member_oid
is not already contained within the elements array;
if the
.Fa member_oid
is already present,
the
.Fa oid_set
should remain unchanged.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It minor_status"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It member_oid
The object identifier to copied into the set.
.It oid_set
The set in which the object identifier should be inserted.
