.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In "gssapi/gssapi.h"
.Ft OM_uint32
.Fo gss_display_name
.Fa "OM_uint32 *minor_status"
.Fa "const gss_name_t input_name"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of an opaque
internal-form name for display purposes.
The syntax of a printable name is defined by the GSS-API implementation.
.Pp
If
.Fa input_name
denotes an anonymous principal,
the implementation should return the
.Fa gss_OID
value
.Dv GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS
as the
.Fa output_name_type ,
and a textual name that is syntactically distinct from all valid
supported printable names in
.Fa output_name_buffer .
.Pp
If
.Fa input_name
was created by a call to
.Fn gss_import_name ,
specifying
.Dv GSS_C_NO_OID
as the name-type,
implementations that employ lazy conversion between name types may
return
.Dv GSS_C_NO_OID
via the
.Fa output_name_type
parameter.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It output_name_buffer"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It input_name
Name to be displayed.
.It output_name_buffer
Buffer to receive textual name string.
The application must free storage associated with this name after use
with a call to
.Fn gss_release_buffer .
.It output_name_type
The type of the returned name.
The returned
.Fa gss_OID
will be a pointer into static storage,
and should be treated as read-only by the caller
(in particular, the application should not attempt to free it).
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_COMPLETE"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_BAD_NAME
.Fa input_name
was ill-formed
