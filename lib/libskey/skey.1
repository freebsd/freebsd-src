.Nm S/key
.Nd "a procedure to use one time passwords for accessing computer systems"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a procedure for using one time password to authenticate access to
computer systems.
It uses 64 bits of information transformed by the
MD4 algorithm.
The user supplies the 64 bits in the form of 6 English
words that are generated by a secure computer.
Example use of the
.Nm
program
.Nm key :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
>key 99 th91334
Enter password: <your secret password is entered here>
OMEN US HORN OMIT BACK AHOY
>
.Ed
.Pp
The programs that are part of the
.Nm
system are
.Nm keyinit , key ,
and
.Nm keyinfo .
.Nm Keyinit
is used to get your ID set up,
.Nm key
is
used to get the one time password each time,
.Nm keyinfo
is used to extract information from the
.Nm
database.
.Pp
When you run
.Nm keyinit
you inform the system of your
secret password.
Running
.Nm key
then generates the
one-time passwords, and also requires your secret
password.
If however, you misspell your password
while running
.Nm key ,
you will get a list of passwords
that will not work, and no indication about the problem.
.Pp
Password sequence numbers count backward from 99.
If you don't know this, the syntax for
.Nm key
will be confusing.
.Pp
You can enter the passwords using small letters, even
though the
.Nm key
program gives them in caps.
.Pp
.Tn Macintosh
and a general purpose
.Tn PC
use are available.
.Pp
Under
.Fx ,
you can control, with
.Pa /etc/skey.access ,
from which hosts and/or networks the use of
.Nm
passwords is obligated.
