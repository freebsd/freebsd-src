.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_kerndisp
.Nd get kernel displacement
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkvm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In kvm.h
.Ft kssize_t
.Fn kvm_kerndisp "kvm_t *kd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn kvm_kerndisp
returns the number of bytes by which the kernel referenced by
.Fa kd
is displaced.
This is the difference between the kernel's base virtual address at run time
and the kernel base virtual address specified in the kernel image file.
.Pp
Note that if the kernel is moved to a lower memory address,
the displacement will be negative.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn kvm_kerndisp
returns the number of bytes by which the kernel is displaced.
If the kernel is not displaced or if it is not possible to find the
displacement then 0 is returned.
