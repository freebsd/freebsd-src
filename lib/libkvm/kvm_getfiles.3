.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <kvm.h>
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #define _KERNEL
.Fd #include <sys/file.h>
.Fd #undef _KERNEL
.\" .Fa kvm_t *kd

.Fn kvm_getfiles "kvm_t *kd" "int op" "int arg" "int *cnt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn kvm_getfiles
returns a (sub-)set of the open files in the kernel indicated by
.Fa kd.
The
.Fa op
and
.Fa arg
arguments constitute a predicate which limits the set of files
returned.  No predicates are currently defined.
.Pp
The number of processes found is returned in the reference parameter
.Fa cnt .
The files are returned as a contiguous array of file structures,
preceded by the address of the first file entry in the kernel.
This memory is owned by kvm and is not guaranteed to be persistent across
subsequent kvm library calls.  Data should be copied out if it needs to be
saved.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn kvm_getfiles
will return NULL on failure.
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
This routine does not belong in the kvm interface.
