.Dt ABORT2 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm abort2
.Nd "abort process with diagnostics"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void
.Fn abort2 "const char *why" "int nargs" "void **args"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn abort2
system call causes the process to be killed and the specified diagnostic
message (with arguments) to be delivered by the kernel to the
.Xr syslogd 8
daemon.
.Pp
The
.Fa why
argument points to a
.Dv NUL- Ns
terminated string specifying a reason of the program's termination
(maximum 128 characters long).
The
.Fa args
array contains pointers which will be logged numerically
(with the kernel's
.Ql %p
.Xr printf 9
format).
The
.Fa nargs
argument specifies the number of pointers in
.Fa args
(maximum 16).
.Pp
The
.Fn abort2
system call
is intended for use in situations where continuation of a process
is impossible or for other definitive reasons is unwanted, and normal
diagnostic channels cannot be trusted to deliver the message.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn abort2
function
never returns.
.Pp
The process is killed with
.Dv SIGABRT
unless the arguments to
.Fn abort2
are invalid, in which case
.Dv SIGKILL
is used.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -compact
#include <stdlib.h>

if (weight_kg > max_load) {
	void *ptrs[3];

	ptrs[0] = (void *)(intptr_t)weight_kg;
	ptrs[1] = (void *)(intptr_t)max_load;
	ptrs[2] = haystack;
	abort2("Camel overloaded", 3, ptrs);
}
