.Fn thr_set_name "long id" "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn thr_set_name
system call sets the user-visible name for the thread with the identifier
.Va id

.Va name .

.Dv MAXCOMLEN + 1
bytes.
The thread name can be seen in the output of the
.Xr ps 1
and
.Xr top 1
commands, in the kernel debuggers and kernel tracing facility outputs,
and in userland debuggers and program core files, as notes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn thr_set_name
returns zero; otherwise, \-1 is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
