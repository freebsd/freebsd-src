.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In signal.h
.Ft int
.Fn sigreturn "const ucontext_t *scp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sigreturn
system call
allows users to atomically unmask, switch stacks,
and return from a signal context.
The thread's signal mask and stack status are
restored from the context structure pointed to by
.Fa scp .
The system call does not return;
the users stack pointer, frame pointer, argument pointer,
and processor status longword are restored from the context.
Execution resumes at the specified pc.
This system call is used by the trampoline code and
.Xr longjmp 3
when returning from a signal to the previously executing program.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the system call does not return.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sigreturn
system call
will fail and the thread context will remain unchanged
if one of the following occurs.
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa scp
argument

address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
