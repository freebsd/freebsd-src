.Dt I386_VM86 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm i386_vm86
.Nd control vm86-related functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In machine/sysarch.h
.In machine/vm86.h
.Ft int
.Fn i386_vm86 "int function" "void *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn i386_vm86
system call
is used to call various vm86 related functions.
The
.Fa function
argument
can be one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width VM86_SET_VME
.It Dv VM86_INIT
This will initialize the kernel's vm86 parameter area for the
process, and permit the process to make vm86 calls.
The
.Fa data
argument
points to the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct vm86_init_args {
        int     debug;
        int     cpu_type;
        u_char  int_map[32];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa debug
argument
is used to turn on debugging code.
The
.Fa cpu_type
argument
controls the type of CPU being emulated, and is currently unimplemented.
The
.Fa int_map
argument
is a bitmap which determines whether vm86 interrupts should be handled
in vm86 mode, or reflected back to the process.
If the
.Em Nth
bit is set, the interrupt will be reflected to the process, otherwise
it will be dispatched by the vm86 interrupt table.
.It Dv VM86_INTCALL
This allows calls to be made to vm86 interrupt handlers by the process.
It effectively simulates an INT instruction.
.Fa data
should point to the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct vm86_intcall_args {
	int	intnum;
	struct	vm86frame vmf;
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa intnum
specifies the operand of INT for the simulated call.
A value of 0x10, for example, would often be used to call into the VGA BIOS.
.Fa vmf
is used to initialize CPU registers according to the calling convention for
the interrupt handler.
.It Dv VM86_GET_VME
This is used to retrieve the current state of the Pentium(r) processor's
VME (Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions) flag, which is bit 0 of CR4.
.Fa data
should be initialized to point to the following:
.Bd -literal
struct vm86_vme_args {
	int	state;			/* status */
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa state
will contain the state of the VME flag on return.
.\" .It Dv VM86_SET_VME
.El
.Pp
vm86 mode is entered by calling
.Xr sigreturn 2
with the correct machine context for vm86, and with the
.Dv PSL_VM
bit set.
Control returns to the process upon delivery of a signal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std i386_vm86
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn i386_vm86
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The kernel does not have vm86 support, or an invalid function was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There is not enough memory to initialize the kernel data structures.
