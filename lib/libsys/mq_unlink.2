.Dt MQ_UNLINK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mq_unlink
.Nd "mq_unlink - remove a message queue (REALTIME)"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb librt
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In mqueue.h
.Ft int
.Fn mq_unlink "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mq_unlink
function removes the message queue named by the string
.Fa name .
If one or more processes have the message queue open when
.Fn mq_unlink
is called, destruction of the message queue will be postponed
until all references to the message queue have been closed.
However, the
.Fn mq_unlink
call need not block until all references have been closed; it may return
immediately.
.Pp
After a successful call to
.Fn mq_unlink ,
reuse of the name will subsequently cause
.Xr mq_open 2
to behave as if no message queue of this name exists.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mq_unlink
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCESS
Permission is denied to unlink the message queue represented by
.Fa name .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa name
is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the
.Fa name
argument exceeds
.Brq Dv PATH_MAX
or
a pathname component is longer than
.Brq Dv NAME_MAX .
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The message queue does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOSYS
.Xr mqueuefs 4
module is neither loaded nor included in the kernel.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mq_open 2
.Sh STANDARDS

.Fn mq_unlink
system call conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2004 .
The
.Bq Er EACCESS
error code is an extension to the standard.

Support for POSIX message queues first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
