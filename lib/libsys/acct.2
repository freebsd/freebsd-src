.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd enable or disable process accounting
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn acct "const char *file"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acct
system call enables or disables the collection of system accounting
records.
If the argument
.Fa file
is a null pointer, accounting is disabled.
If
.Fa file
is an
.Em existing
pathname (null-terminated), record collection is enabled and for
every process initiated which terminates under normal
conditions an accounting record is appended to
.Fa file .
Abnormal conditions of termination are reboots
or other fatal system problems.
Records for processes which never terminate cannot be
produced by
.Fn acct .
.Pp
For more information on the record structure used by
.Fn acct ,
see
.In sys/acct.h
and
.Xr acct 5 .
.Pp
This call is permitted only to the super-user.
.Sh NOTES
Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the
accounting file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when
space once again becomes available.
The values controlling this behaviour can be modified using the following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va kern.acct_chkfreq"
.It Va kern.acct_chkfreq
Specifies the frequency (in seconds) with which free disk
space should be checked.
.It Va kern.acct_resume
The percentage of free disk space above which process
accounting will resume.
.It Va kern.acct_suspend
The percentage of free disk space below which process
accounting will suspend.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On error -1 is returned.
The file must exist and the call may be exercised only by the super-user.

.Fn acct
system call will fail if one of the following is true:
.Bl -tag -width Er
