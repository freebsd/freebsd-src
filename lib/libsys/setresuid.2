.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setresuid
system call sets the real,
effective and saved user IDs of the current process.
The analogous
.Fn setresgid
sets the real, effective and saved group IDs.
.Pp
Privileged processes may set these IDs
to arbitrary values.
Unprivileged processes are restricted
in that each of the new IDs must match one of the current IDs.
.Pp
Passing -1 as an argument causes the corresponding value
to remain unchanged.
.Pp
The
.Fn getresgid
and
.Fn getresuid
calls retrieve the real, effective, and saved group and user IDs of
the current process, respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The calling process was not privileged
and tried to change one or more IDs to a value
which was not the current real ID, the current effective ID
nor the current saved ID.

An address passed to
.Fn getresgid
or
.Fn getresuid
was invalid.
