.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In security/mac_bsdextended/mac_bsdextended.h
.In ugidfw.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library routines provide an interface to the
.Xr mac_bsdextended 4
file system firewall MAC policy.
.Pp
The
.Nm
library defines the following functions:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fn bsde_parse_rule_string"
.It Fn bsde_rule_to_string
Converts the internal representation of a rule
.Pq Vt "struct mac_bsdextended_rule"
into its text representation;
see
.Xr bsde_rule_to_string 3 .
.It Fn bsde_parse_rule
Parses an entire rule
(in argument array form);
see
.Xr bsde_parse_rule 3 .
.It Fn bsde_parse_rule_string
Parses an entire rule string;
see
.Xr bsde_parse_rule_string 3 .
.It Fn bsde_get_rule_count
Returns the total number of ugidfw rules being enforced in the system;
see
.Xr bsde_get_rule_count 3 .
.It Fn bsde_get_rule_slots
Returns the total number of used rule slots;
see
.Xr bsde_get_rule_slots 3 .
.It Fn bsde_get_rule
Returns a rule by its rule number;
see
.Xr bsde_get_rule 3 .
.It Fn bsde_delete_rule
Deletes a rule by its rule number;
see
.Xr bsde_delete_rule 3 .
.It Fn bsde_set_rule
Uploads the rule to the
.Xr mac_bsdextended 4
module and applies it;
see
.Xr bsde_set_rule 3 .
.It Fn bsde_add_rule
Upload the rule to the module, automatically selecting the next available
rule number; see
.Xr bsde_add_rule 3 .
