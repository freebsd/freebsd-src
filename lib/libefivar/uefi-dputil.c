/** @file
  Device Path services. The thing to remember is device paths are built out of
  nodes. The device path is terminated by an end node that is length
  sizeof(EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL). That would be why there is sizeof(EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL)
  all over this file.

  The only place where multi-instance device paths are supported is in
  environment varibles. Multi-instance device paths should never be placed
  on a Handle.
