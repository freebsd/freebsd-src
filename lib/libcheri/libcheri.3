.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a programmer-friendly interface to CHERI in-process
compartmentalization using an object-capability security model.
The programming interface requires programmers to define compartments in terms
of
.Em classes
(particular pieces of code that will run in isolation) and
.Em objects
(in-execution instances of isolated code).
In
.Nm ,
classes are statically linked memory images (in the future to be ELF
binaries).
.Pp
.Ss libcheri classes
A new class may be created using
.Fn sandbox_class_new ,
which accepts
.Fa path ,
a pathname to the class's memory image and
.Fa sandboxlen ,
an address-space size in bytes.
If successful, a pointer to the class will be stored in
.Fa sbcpp .
Classes implement a single invocation entry point, which can then fan out to
multiple methods courtesy a method argument.
.Pp
Optionally,
.Fn sandbox_class_method_declare
may be used to associate descriptive strings with method numbers, which will
then be visible via
.Xr procstat 1 .
The method number is passed via
.Fa methodnum
and string via
.Fa methodname .
.Pp
Classes may be destroyed, once all its objects have been freed, using
.Fn sandbox_class_destroy .
.Pp
.Ss Sandbox objects
Object instances may be created using
.Fn sandbox_object_new ,
which accepts a previously created class passed via
.Fa sbcp ,
with a heap size specified by
.Fa heaplen ,
and on success returns a
.Nm
object via
.Fa sbopp .
When an object is no longer required, it can be destroyed by passing it
to
.Fn sandbox_object_destroy .
An object may be restored to a pristine state by passing it to
.Fn sandbox_object_reset .
.Pp
.Fn sandbox_object_getobject
returns the
.Nm
object's underlying CHERI object (sealed code and data capabilities).
.Fn sandbox_object_getsystemobject
returns the CHERI system-class instance suitable for delegating to the object.
.Ss Object invocation
Methods may be invoked using
.Fn sandbox_object_cinvoke
if CHERI compiler support is present (allowing use of
.Em __capability ) ,
or
.Fn sandbox_object_invoke
(which can be used without compiler support).
Both interfaces accept a
.Nm
object pointer,
.Fa sbop ,
method number via
.Fa methodnum ,
and general-purpose and capability register arguments.
These functions are implemented as wrappers around
.Xr cheri_invoke 3 .
.Ss Object monitoring
.Pp
Objects within a
.Nm
process may be monitored using
.Xr procstat 1 ,
or programmatically using
.Xr libprocstat 3
APIs.
Various statistics are maintained, including object counts, method invocation
counts, and object fault information.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std sandbox_class_new sandbox_class_method_declare sandbox_object_new sandbox_object_reset
.Pp
.Fn sandbox_class_destroy
and
.Fn sandbox_object_destroy
do not have return values as they cannot fail.
.Pp
.Fn sandbox_object_cinvoke
and
.Fn sandbox_object_invoke
return the value returned by the invoked object method unless a fault occurs,
in which case -1 will be returned.
As a method returning -1 cannot be distinguished from a fault in the caller,
use of negative return values for method return values is discouraged.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn sandbox_object_cinvoke
and
.Fn sandbox_object_invoke
APIs cannot distinguish the invoked object returning a negative value and a
fault causing a negative value to be returned.
.Pp
It is not clear how programmers should select a suitable
.Fa sandboxlen
value to pass to
.Fn sandbox_class_new .
.Pp
This man page should include information on how to structure and link code
intended to be used as
.Nm
classes.
.Pp
This man page does not document the CHERI system class.
