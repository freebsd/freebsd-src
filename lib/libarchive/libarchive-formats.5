.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libarchive-formats
.Nd archive formats supported by the libarchive library
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr libarchive 3
library reads and writes a variety of streaming archive formats.
Generally speaking, all of these archive formats consist of a series of
.Dq entries .
Each entry stores a single file system object, such as a file, directory,
or symbolic link.
.Pp
The following provides a brief description of each format supported
by libarchive, with some information about recognized extensions or
limitations of the current library support.
Note that just because a format is supported by libarchive does not
imply that a program that uses libarchive will support that format.
Applications that use libarchive specify which formats they wish
to support.
.Ss Tar Formats
The
.Xr libarchive 3
library can read most tar archives.
However, it only writes POSIX-standard
.Dq ustar
and
.Dq pax interchange
formats.
.Pp
All tar formats store each entry in one or more 512-byte records.
The first record is used for file metadata, including filename,
timestamp, and mode information, and the file data is stored in
subsequent records.
Later variants have extended this by either appropriating undefined
areas of the header record, extending the header to multiple records,
or by storing special entries that modify the interpretation of
subsequent entries.
.Pp

.It Cm gnutar
The
.Xr libarchive 3
library can read GNU-format tar archives.
It currently supports the most popular GNU extensions, including
modern long filename and linkname support, as well as atime and ctime data.
The libarchive library does not support multi-volume
archives, nor the old GNU long filename format.
.It Cm pax
The
.Xr libarchive 3
library can read and write POSIX-compliant pax interchange format
archives.
Pax interchange format archives are an extension of the older ustar
format that adds a separate entry with additional attributes stored
as key/value pairs.
The presence of this additional entry is the only difference between
pax interchange format and the older ustar format.
The extended attributes are of unlimited length and are stored
as UTF-8 Unicode strings.
Keywords defined in the standard are in all lowercase; vendors are allowed
to define custom keys by preceding them with the vendor name in all uppercase.
When writing pax archives, libarchive uses many of the SCHILY keys
defined by Joerg Schilling's
.Dq star
archiver.
The libarchive library can read most of the SCHILY keys.
It ignores any keywords that it does not understand.
.It Cm restricted pax
The libarchive library can also write pax archives in which it
attempts to suppress the extended attributes entry whenever
possible.
The result will be identical to a ustar archive unless the
extended attributes entry is required to store a long file
name, long linkname, extended ACL, file flags, or if any of the standard
ustar data (user name, group name, UID, GID, etc) cannot be fully
represented in the ustar header.
In all cases, the result can be dearchived by any program that
can read POSIX-compliant pax interchange format archives.
Programs that correctly read ustar format (see below) will also be
able to read this format; any extended attributes will be extracted as
separate files stored in
.Pn PaxHeader
directories.
.It Cm ustar
The libarchive library can both read and write this format.
This format has the following limitations:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Device major and minor numbers are limited to 21 bits.
Nodes with larger numbers will not be added to the archive.
.It
Path names in the archive are limited to 255 bytes.
(Shorter if there is no / character in exactly the right place.)
.It
Symbolic links and hard links are stored in the archive with
the name of the referenced file.
This name is limited to 100 bytes.
.It
Extended attributes, file flags, and other extended
security information cannot be stored.
.It
Archive entries are limited to 2 gigabytes in size.
.El
Note that the pax interchange format has none of these restrictions.
.El
.Pp
The libarchive library can also read a variety of commonly-used extensions to
the basic tar format.
In particular, it supports base-256 values in certain numeric fields.
This essentially removes the limitations on file size, modification time,
and device numbers.
.Pp
The first tar program appeared in Sixth Edition Unix (circa 1976).
This makes the tar format one of the oldest and most widely-supported
archive formats.
The first official standard for the tar file format was the
.Dq ustar
(Unix Standard Tar) format defined by POSIX in 1988.
POSIX.1-2001 extended the ustar format to create the
.Dq pax interchange
format.
There have also been many custom variations.
.Ss Cpio Formats
The libarchive library can read a number of common cpio variants and can write
.Dq odc
format archives.
A cpio archive stores each entry as a fixed-size header followed
by a variable-length filename and variable-length data.
Unlike tar, cpio does only minimal padding of the header or file data.
There are a variety of cpio formats, which differ primarily in
how they store the initial header: some store the values as
octal or hexadecimal numbers in ASCII, others as binary values of
varying byte order and length.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm binary
The libarchive library can read both big-endian and little-endian
variants of the original binary cpio format.
This format used 32-bit binary values for file size and mtime,
and 16-bit binary values for the other fields.
.It Cm odc
The libarchive library can both read and write this
POSIX-standard format.
This format stores the header contents as octal values in ASCII.
It is standard, portable, and immune from byte-order confusion.
File sizes and mtime are limited to 33 bits (8GB file size),
other fields are limited to 18 bits.
.It Cm SVR4
The libarchive library can read both CRC and non-CRC variants of
this format.
The SVR4 format uses eight-digit hexadecimal values for
all header fields.
This limits file size to 4GB, and also limits the mtime and
other fields to 32 bits.
The SVR4 format can optionally include a CRC of the file
contents, although libarchive does not currently verify this CRC.
.El
.Pp
Cpio is an old format that was widely used because of its simplicity
and its support for very long filenames.
Unfortunately, it has many limitations that make it unsuitable
for widespread use.
Only the POSIX format permits files over 4GB, and its 18-bit
limit for most other fields makes it unsuitable for modern systems.
In addition, cpio formats only store numeric UID/GID values (not
usernames and group names), which can make it very difficult to correctly
transfer archives across systems.
.Ss Shar Formats
A
.Dq shell archive
is a shell script that, when executed on a POSIX-compliant
system, will recreate a collection of file system objects.
The libarchive library can write two different kinds of shar archives:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm shar
The traditional shar format uses a limited set of POSIX
commands, including
.Xr echo 1 ,
.Xr mkdir 1 ,
and
.Xr sed 1 .
It is suitable for portably archiving small collections of plain text files.
However, it is not generally well-suited for large archives
(many implementations of
.Xr sh 1
have limits on the size of a script) nor should it be used with non-text files.
.It Cm shardump
This format is similar to shar but encodes files using
.Xr uuencode 1
so that the result will be a plain text file regardless of the file contents.
It also includes additional shell commands that attempt to reproduce as
many file attributes as possible, including owner, mode, and flags.
The additional commands used to restore file attributes make
shardump archives less portable than plain shar archives.
.El
.Ss ISO9660 format
Libarchive can read and extract from files containing ISO9660-compliant
CDROM images.
It also has partial support for Rockridge extensions.
In many cases, this can remove the need to burn a physical CDROM.
It also avoids security and complexity issues that come with
virtual mounts and loopback devices.
.Ss Zip format
Libarchive can extract from most zip format archives.
It currently only supports uncompressed entries and entries
compressed with the
.Dq deflate
algorithm.
Older zip compression algorithms are not supported.
