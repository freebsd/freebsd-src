.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a complete API for reading streaming archives.
The general process is to first create the
.Tn struct archive
object, set options, initialize the reader, iterate over the archive
headers and associated data, then close the archive and release all
resources.
The following summary describes the functions in approximately the
order they would be used:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn archive_read_new
Allocates and initializes a
.Tn struct archive
object suitable for reading from an archive.
.It Fn archive_read_support_compression_all , Fn archive_read_support_compression_bzip2 , Fn archive_read_support_compression_compress , Fn archive_read_support_compression_gzip , Fn archive_read_support_compression_none
Enables auto-detection code and decompression support for the
specified compression.
Note that
.Dq none
is always enabled by default.
For convenience,
.Fn archive_read_support_compression_all
enables all available decompression code.
.It Fn archive_read_support_format_all , Fn archive_read_support_format_cpio , Fn archive_read_support_format_iso9660 , Fn archive_read_support_format_tar, Fn archive_read_support_format_zip
Enables support---including auto-detection code---for the
specified archive format.
For example,
.Fn archive_read_support_format_tar
enables support for a variety of standard tar formats, old-style tar,
ustar, pax interchange format, and many common variants.
For convenience,
.Fn archive_read_support_format_all
enables support for all available formats.
Note that there is no default.
.It Fn archive_read_open
The same as
.Fn archive_read_open2 ,
except that the skip callback is assumed to be
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn archive_read_open2
Freeze the settings, open the archive, and prepare for reading entries.
This is the most generic version of this call, which accepts
four callback functions.
Most clients will want to use
.Fn archive_read_open_filename ,
.Fn archive_read_open_FILE ,
.Fn archive_read_open_fd ,
or
.Fn archive_read_open_memory
instead.
The library invokes the client-provided functions to obtain
raw bytes from the archive.
.It Fn archive_read_open_FILE
Like
.Fn archive_read_open ,
except that it accepts a
.Ft "FILE *"
pointer.
This function should not be used with tape drives or other devices
that require strict I/O blocking.
.It Fn archive_read_open_fd
Like
.Fn archive_read_open ,
except that it accepts a file descriptor and block size rather than
a set of function pointers.
Note that the file descriptor will not be automatically closed at
end-of-archive.
This function is safe for use with tape drives or other blocked devices.
.It Fn archive_read_open_file
This is a deprecated synonym for
.Fn archive_read_open_filename .
.It Fn archive_read_open_filename
Like
.Fn archive_read_open ,
except that it accepts a simple filename and a block size.
A NULL filename represents standard input.
This function is safe for use with tape drives or other blocked devices.
.It Fn archive_read_open_memory
Like
.Fn archive_read_open ,
except that it accepts a pointer and size of a block of
memory containing the archive data.
.It Fn archive_read_next_header
Read the header for the next entry and return a pointer to
a
.Tn struct archive_entry .
.It Fn archive_read_data
Read data associated with the header just read.
Internally, this is a convenience function that calls
.Fn archive_read_data_block
and fills any gaps with nulls so that callers see a single
continuous stream of data.
.It Fn archive_read_data_block
Return the next available block of data for this entry.
Unlike
.Fn archive_read_data ,
the
.Fn archive_read_data_block
function avoids copying data and allows you to correctly handle
sparse files, as supported by some archive formats.
The library guarantees that offsets will increase and that blocks
will not overlap.
Note that the blocks returned from this function can be much larger
than the block size read from disk, due to compression
and internal buffer optimizations.
.It Fn archive_read_data_skip
A convenience function that repeatedly calls
.Fn archive_read_data_block
to skip all of the data for this archive entry.
.It Fn archive_read_data_into_buffer
A convenience function that repeatedly calls
.Fn archive_read_data_block
to copy the entire entry into the client-supplied buffer.
Note that the client is responsible for sizing the buffer appropriately.
.It Fn archive_read_data_into_fd
A convenience function that repeatedly calls
.Fn archive_read_data_block
to copy the entire entry to the provided file descriptor.
.It Fn archive_read_extract_set_skip_file
This function records the device and inode numbers
of a file that should not be restored.
This is a convenience that prevents
.Fn archive_read_extract
from restoring a file over the archive itself.
.It Fn archive_read_extract
A convenience function that recreates the specified object on
disk and reads the entry data into that object.
The filename, permissions, and other critical information
are taken from the provided
.Va archive_entry
object.
The
.Va flags
argument modifies how the object is recreated.
It consists of a bitwise OR of one or more of the following values:
.Bl -tag -compact -width "indent"
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_OWNER
The user and group IDs should be set on the restored file.
By default, the user and group IDs are not restored.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_PERM
The permissions (mode bits) should be restored for all objects.
By default, permissions are only restored for regular files.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_TIME
The timestamps (mtime, ctime, and atime) should be restored.
By default, they are ignored.
Note that restoring of atime is not currently supported.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_NO_OVERWRITE
Existing files on disk will not be overwritten.
By default, existing regular files are truncated and overwritten;
existing directories will have their permissions updated;
other pre-existing objects are unlinked and recreated from scratch.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_UNLINK
Existing files on disk will be unlinked and recreated from scratch.
By default, existing files are truncated and rewritten, but
the file is not recreated.
In particular, the default behavior does not break existing hard links.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_ACL
Attempt to restore ACLs.
By default, extended ACLs are ignored.
.It Cm ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_FFLAGS
Attempt to restore extended file flags.
By default, file flags are ignored.
.El
Note that not all attributes are set immediately;
some attributes are cached in memory and written to disk only
when the archive is closed.
(For example, read-only directories are initially created
writable so that files within those directories can be
restored.
The final permissions are set when the archive is closed.)
.It Fn archive_read_extract_set_progress_callback
Sets a pointer to a user-defined callback that can be used
for updating progress displays during extraction.
The progress function will be invoked during the extraction of large
regular files.
The progress function will be invoked with the pointer provided to this call.
Generally, the data pointed to should include a reference to the archive
object and the archive_entry object so that various statistics
can be retrieved for the progress display.
.It Fn archive_read_close
Complete the archive and invoke the close callback.
.It Fn archive_read_finish
Invokes
.Fn archive_read_close
if it was not invoked manually, then release all resources.
.El
.Pp
Note that the library determines most of the relevant information about
the archive by inspection.
In particular, it automatically detects
.Xr gzip 1
or
.Xr bzip2 1
compression and transparently performs the appropriate decompression.
It also automatically detects the archive format.
.Pp
A complete description of the
.Tn struct archive
and
.Tn struct archive_entry
objects can be found in the overview manual page for
.Xr libarchive 3 .
.Sh CLIENT CALLBACKS
The callback functions must match the following prototypes:
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ft typedef ssize_t
.Fn archive_read_callback "struct archive *" "void *client_data" "const void **buffer"
.It
.\" #if ARCHIVE_API_VERSION < 2
.Ft typedef int
.Fn archive_skip_callback "struct archive *" "void *client_data" "size_t request"
.\" #else
.\" .Ft typedef off_t
.\" .Fn archive_skip_callback "struct archive *" "void *client_data" "off_t request"
.\" #endif
.It
.Ft typedef int
.Fn archive_open_callback "struct archive *" "void *client_data"
.It
.Ft typedef int
.Fn archive_close_callback "struct archive *" "void *client_data"
.El
.Pp
The open callback is invoked by
.Fn archive_open .
It should return
.Cm ARCHIVE_OK
if the underlying file or data source is successfully
opened.
If the open fails, it should call
.Fn archive_set_error
to register an error code and message and return
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL .
.Pp
The read callback is invoked whenever the library
requires raw bytes from the archive.
The read callback should read data into a buffer,
set the
.Li const void **buffer
argument to point to the available data, and
return a count of the number of bytes available.
The library will invoke the read callback again
only after it has consumed this data.
The library imposes no constraints on the size
of the data blocks returned.
On end-of-file, the read callback should
return zero.
On error, the read callback should invoke
.Fn archive_set_error
to register an error code and message and
return -1.
.Pp
The skip callback is invoked when the
library wants to ignore a block of data.
The return value is the number of bytes actually
skipped, which may differ from the request.
If the callback cannot skip data, it should return
zero.
If the skip callback is not provided (the
function pointer is
.Dv NULL ),
the library will invoke the read function
instead and simply discard the result.
A skip callback can provide significant
performance gains when reading uncompressed
archives from slow disk drives or other media
that can skip quickly.
.Pp
The close callback is invoked by archive_close when
the archive processing is complete.
The callback should return
.Cm ARCHIVE_OK
on success.
On failure, the callback should invoke
.Fn archive_set_error
to register an error code and message and
return
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following illustrates basic usage of the library.
In this example,
the callback functions are simply wrappers around the standard
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr read 2 ,
and
.Xr close 2
system calls.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
list_archive(const char *name)
{
  struct mydata *mydata;
  struct archive *a;
  struct archive_entry *entry;

  mydata = malloc(sizeof(struct mydata));
  a = archive_read_new();
  mydata->name = name;
  archive_read_support_compression_all(a);
  archive_read_support_format_all(a);
  archive_read_open(a, mydata, myopen, myread, myclose);
  while (archive_read_next_header(a, &entry) == ARCHIVE_OK) {
    printf("%s\\n",archive_entry_pathname(entry));
    archive_read_data_skip(a);
  }
  archive_read_finish(a);
  free(mydata);
}

ssize_t
myread(struct archive *a, void *client_data, const void **buff)
{
  struct mydata *mydata = client_data;

  *buff = mydata->buff;
  return (read(mydata->fd, mydata->buff, 10240));
}

int
myopen(struct archive *a, void *client_data)
{
  struct mydata *mydata = client_data;

  mydata->fd = open(mydata->name, O_RDONLY);
  return (mydata->fd >= 0 ? ARCHIVE_OK : ARCHIVE_FATAL);
}

int
myclose(struct archive *a, void *client_data)
{
  struct mydata *mydata = client_data;

  if (mydata->fd > 0)
    close(mydata->fd);
  return (ARCHIVE_OK);
}

.Sh RETURN VALUES
Most functions return zero on success, non-zero on error.
The possible return codes include:
.Cm ARCHIVE_OK
(the operation succeeded),
.Cm ARCHIVE_WARN
(the operation succeeded but a non-critical error was encountered),
.Cm ARCHIVE_EOF
(end-of-archive was encountered),
.Cm ARCHIVE_RETRY
(the operation failed but can be retried),
and
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL
(there was a fatal error; the archive should be closed immediately).
Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
.Fn archive_errno
and
.Fn archive_error_string
functions.
.Pp
.Fn archive_read_new
returns a pointer to a freshly allocated
.Tn struct archive
object.
It returns
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Pp
.Fn archive_read_data
returns a count of bytes actually read or zero at the end of the entry.
On error, a value of
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL ,
.Cm ARCHIVE_WARN ,
or
.Cm ARCHIVE_RETRY
is returned and an error code and textual description can be retrieved from the
.Fn archive_errno
and
.Fn archive_error_string
functions.
.Pp
The library expects the client callbacks to behave similarly.
If there is an error, you can use
.Fn archive_set_error
to set an appropriate error code and description,
then return one of the non-zero values above.
(Note that the value eventually returned to the client may
not be the same; many errors that are not critical at the level
of basic I/O can prevent the archive from being properly read,
thus most I/O errors eventually cause
.Cm ARCHIVE_FATAL
to be returned.)

.Sh HISTORY
The

library was written by

.Sh BUGS
Directories are actually extracted in two distinct phases.
Directories are created during
.Fn archive_read_extract ,
but final permissions are not set until
.Fn archive_read_close .
This separation is necessary to correctly handle borderline
cases such as a non-writable directory containing
files, but can cause unexpected results.
In particular, directory permissions are not fully
restored until the archive is closed.
If you use
.Xr chdir 2
to change the current directory between calls to
.Fn archive_read_extract
or before calling
.Fn archive_read_close ,
you may confuse the permission-setting logic with
the result that directory permissions are restored
incorrectly.
