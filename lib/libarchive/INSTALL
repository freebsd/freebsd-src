How you install this depends on which distribution you
are using and what target you're compiling for:

FROM A PACKAGED DISTRIBUTION TO ANY SYSTEM

If you unpacked this from a tar.gz archive and have a "configure"
file, then you should be able to install it using the following common
steps:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you need to customize the target directories, use
    ./configure --help
to list the configure options.

FROM CVS TO FreeBSD

The source code from the FreeBSD CVS server can be
compiled as-is on any FreeBSD system, just use:
    make
    make install

FROM CVS TO A PACKAGED DISTRIBUTION

The source code from the FreeBSD CVS server can be used
to build a tar.gz archive suitable for later installation on
any system.  You'll need the following GNU tools installed:
    autoconf (including aclocal and autoheader)
    automake

You should be able to use the following command to build a distribution:
    make distfile

The result will be a file named libarchive-<version>.tar.gz in
the object directory.
