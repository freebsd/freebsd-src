This is the test harness for libarchive.

It compiles into a single program "libarchive_test" that is intended
to exercise as much of the library as possible.  It is, of course,
very much a work in progress.

Each test is a function named test_foo in a file named test_foo.c.
Note that the file name is the same as the function name.
Each file must start with this line:

  #include "test.h"

The test function must be declared with a line of this form

  DEFINE_TEST(test_foo)

Nothing else should appear on that line.

When you add a test, please update the Makefile to add your
file to the list of tests.  The Makefile and main.c use various
macro trickery to automatically collect a list of test functions
to be invoked.

Each test function can rely on the following:

  * The current directory will be a freshly-created empty directory
    suitable for that test.  (The top-level main() creates a
    directory for each separate test and chdir()s to that directory
    before running the test.)

  * The test function should use assert(), assertA() and similar macros
    defined in test.h.  If you need to add new macros of this form, feel
    free to do so.

  * You are encouraged to document each assertion with a failure() call
    just before the assert.  The failure() function is a printf-like
    function whose text is displayed only if the assertion fails.  It
    can be used to display additional information relevant to the failure:

       failure("The data read from file %s did not match the data written to that file.", filename);
       assert(strcmp(buff1, buff2) == 0);

  * Tests are encouraged to be economical with their memory and disk usage,
    though this is not essential.

  * Disable tests on specific platforms as necessary.  Please don't
    use config.h to adjust feature requirements, as I want the tests
    to also serve as a check on the configure process.  The following
    form is appropriate:

#if !defined(__PLATFORM) && !defined(__Platform2__)
    assert(xxxx)
#endif
