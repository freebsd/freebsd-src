/*
 * An ugly detail of the implementation - fortunately not visible
 * to the API users - is the "branding": libc needs to keep track
 * of what "brand" ACL is: NFSv4, POSIX.1e or unknown.  It happens
 * automatically - for example, during acl_get_file(3) ACL gets
 * branded according to the "type" argument; during acl_set_permset
 * ACL, if its brand is unknown it gets branded as NFSv4 if any of the
 * NFSv4 permissions that are not valid for POSIX.1e ACL are set etc.
 * Branding information is used for printing out the ACL (acl_to_text(3)),
 * veryfying acl_set_whatever arguments (checking against setting
 * bits that are valid only for NFSv4 in ACL branded as POSIX.1e) etc.
