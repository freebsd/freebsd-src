.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_set_fd ,
.Nm acl_set_fd_np ,
.Nm acl_set_file
.Nd get an ACL for a file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/acl.h>
.Ft int
.Fn acl_set_file "const char *path_p" "acl_type_t type" "acl_t acl"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_set_fd "int fd" "acl_t acl"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_set_fd_np "int fd" "acl_t acl" "acl_type_t type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_set_file ,
.Fn acl_set_fd ,
and
.Fn acl_set_fd_np
each associate an ACL with an object referred to by
.Va fd
or
.Va path_p .  
All except
.Fn acl_set_fd_np
are POSIX.1e calls--
.Fn acl_set_fd
allows only the setting of ACLs of type ACL_TYPE_ACCESS
where as 
.Fn acl_set_fd_np
allows the setting of ACLs of any type.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and
.Va errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, these functions shall return
-1 and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or the
object exists and the process does not have appropriate access rights.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Va fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Va acl
does not point to a valid ACL for this object, or the ACL type
specified in
.Va type
is invalid for this object, or both.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named object does not exist, or the
.Va path_p
argument points to an empty string.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory available to fulfill request.
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
The directory or file system that would contain the new ACL cannot be
extended, or the file system is out of file allocation resources.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The file system does not support ACL retrieval.
.It Bq Er EROFS
This function requires modification of a file system which is currently
read-only.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.  Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.  To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Fx 4.0 ,
and development continues.
