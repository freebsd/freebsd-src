.Dt ACL_EQUIV_MODE_NP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_equiv_mode_np
.Nd check if ACL can be represented as UNIX permissions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_equiv_mode_np "acl_t acl" "mode_t* mode_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_equiv_mode_np
function is a non-portable call which checks that entries contained in the
.Va acl
argument use only the ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER tag types, and that
permissions contained in these entries consist only of ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE and
ACL_EXECUTE.
If the check succeeds, the ACL can be represented as traditional UNIX
file permissions bits set.
.Pp
If
.Va mode_p
is not NULL and the check succeeds, the function fills the argument with a mode
value corresponding to permissions contained in the ACL.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function returns 0 if the ACL can be represented
as UNIX permissions and 1 if it is not possible.
Otherwise, a value
of
.Va -1
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_equiv_mode_np
function returns a value of
.Va -1
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa acl
does not point to a valid ACL.
