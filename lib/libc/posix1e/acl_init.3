.Dt ACL_INIT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_init
.Nd initialize ACL working storage
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_init "int count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_init
function allocates and initializes the working storage for an ACL of at
least
.Va count
ACL entries.
A pointer to the working storage is returned.
The working
storage allocated to contain the ACL is freed by a call to
.Xr acl_free 3 .
When the area is first allocated, it shall contain an ACL that contains
no ACL entries.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
as an argument.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function shall return a pointer to the
working storage.
Otherwise, a value of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
shall be returned, and
.Va errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_init
function shall return a value of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of count is less than zero.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Va acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Fx 4.0 ,
and development continues.
