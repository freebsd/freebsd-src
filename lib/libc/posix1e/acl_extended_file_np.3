.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_extended_file_np ,
.Nm acl_extended_file_nofollow_np ,
.Nm acl_extended_link_np
.Nd checks if the file has extended ACLs set
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_extended_file_np "const char* path_p"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_extended_file_nofollow_np "const char* path_p"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_extended_link_np "const char* path_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_extended_file_np
function is a non-portable call that checks if the file or directory referred to
by the argument
.Va path_p
contains extended access ACLs. The
.Fn acl_extended_file_nofollow_np
function works the same way, except it does not follow symlinks. The
.Fn acl_extended_link_np
function is a synonim to
.Fn acl_extended_file_nofollow_np
named in FreeBSD style.
An ACL is considered to be extended access one if it contains entries other
than the three required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ and
ACL_OTHER.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function returns 0 if the file object does not
contain extended access ACLs and 1 in the other case.
Otherwise, the value -1 is returned, and
.Va errno
indicates the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_extended_file_np
function shall return a value of
.Va -1
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
