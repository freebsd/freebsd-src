.Dt MAC_FREE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_free
.Nd free MAC label
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_free "mac_t label"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_free
function frees the storage allocated to contain a
.Vt mac_t .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mac_free
function always returns 0.
WARNING: see the notes in the
.Sx BUGS
section regarding the use of this
function.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mac 3 ,
.Xr mac_get 3 ,
.Xr mac_prepare 3 ,
.Xr mac_set 3 ,
.Xr mac_text 3 ,
.Xr posix1e 3 ,
.Xr mac 4 ,
.Xr mac 9
.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for Mandatory Access Control was introduced in
.Fx 5.0
as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
.Sh BUGS
POSIX.1e specifies that
.Fn mac_free
will be used to free text strings created using
.Xr mac_to_text 3 .
Because
.Vt mac_t
is a complex structure in the
.Tn TrustedBSD
implementation,
.Fn mac_free
is specific to
.Vt mac_3 ,
and must not be used to free the character strings returned from
.Fn mac_to_text .
Doing so may result in undefined behavior.
