.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_get_entry
.Nd retrieve an ACL entry from an ACL
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_get_entry "acl_t acl" "int entry_id" "acl_entry_t *entry_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_get_entry
function
is a POSIX.1e call that retrieves a descriptor for an ACL entry
specified by the argument
.Fa entry_id
within the ACL indicated by the argument
.Fa acl .
.Pp
If the value of
.Fa entry_id
is
.Dv ACL_FIRST_ENTRY ,
then the function will return in
.Fa entry_p
a descriptor for the first ACL entry within
.Fa acl .
If a call is made to
.Fn acl_get_entry
with
.Fa entry_id
set to
.Dv ACL_NEXT_ENTRY
when there has not been either an initial successful call to
.Fn acl_get_entry ,
or a previous successful call to
.Fn acl_create_entry ,
.Fn acl_delete_entry ,
.Fn acl_dup ,
.Fn acl_from_text ,
.Fn acl_get_fd ,
.Fn acl_get_file ,
.Fn acl_set_fd ,
.Fn acl_set_file ,
or
.Fn acl_valid ,
then the result is unspecified.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the
.Fn acl_get_entry
function successfully obtains an ACL entry, a value of 1 is returned.
If the ACL has no ACL entries, the
.Fn acl_get_entry
returns a value of 0.
If the value of
.Fa entry_id
is
.Dv ACL_NEXT_ENTRY
and the last ACL entry in the ACL has already been returned by a
previous call to
.Fn acl_get_entry ,
a value of 0 will be returned until a successful call with
.Fa entry_id
of
.Dv ACL_FIRST_ENTRY
is made.
Otherwise, a value of -1 will be returned and
the global variable
.Va errno
will be set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn acl_get_entry
function fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa acl
does not point to a valid ACL.
Argument
.Fa entry_id
is neither
.Dv ACL_FIRST_ENTRY
nor
.Dv ACL_NEXT_ENTRY .
