.Dt ACL_FROM_MODE_NP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_from_mode_np
.Nd create an ACL from status information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_from_mode_np "const mode_t mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_from_mode_np
function is a non-portable call that converts the permissions set referred to by
.Va mode
into the corresponding minimal ACL structure, appropriate for applying to
files or manipulating.
.Pp
This function causes memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any
free-able memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void *)acl_t
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function returns a pointer to the
internal representation of the ACL in working storage.
Otherwise, a value
of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_from_mode_np
function returns a value of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the
hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
