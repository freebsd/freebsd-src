.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_cmp_np
function is a non-portable call that checks if ACLs pointed to by

are equivalent.
The two ACLs are considered equal when they contain the same
entries with matching tag types, qualifiers and permissions.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function returns 0 if the given ACLs are
equivalent and 1 if they differ.
Otherwise, the value -1 is returned, and
.Va errno
indicates the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_cmp_np
function shall return a value of
.Va -1
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
