.Nd create a new ACL entry
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_create_entry "acl_t *acl_p" "acl_entry_t *entry_p"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_create_entry_np "acl_t *acl_p" "acl_entry_t *entry_p" "int index"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_create_entry
function
is a POSIX.1e call that creates a new ACL entry in the ACL
pointed to by
.Fa acl_p .
The
.Fn acl_create_entry_np
function is a non-portable version that creates the ACL entry
at position
.Fa index .
Positions are numbered starting from zero, i.e. calling
.Fn acl_create_entry_np
with
.Fa index
argument equal to zero will prepend the entry to the ACL.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std acl_create_entry
.Sh ERRORS

function fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
