.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_is_trivial_np
.Nd determine whether ACL is trivial
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_is_trivial_np "const acl_t aclp" "int *trivialp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_is_trivial_np
function determines whether the ACL pointed to by the argument
.Va acl
is trivial.
Upon successful completion, the location referred to by the argument
.Fa trivialp
will be set to 1, if the ACL
.Fa aclp
points to is trivial, or 0 if it's not.
.Pp
ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without losing
any access rules.
For POSIX.1e ACLs, ACL is trivial if it has the three required entries,
one for owner, one for owning group, and one for other.
For NFSv4 ACLs, ACL is trivial if it is identical to the ACL generated by
.Xr acl_strip_np 3 .
Files that have non-trivial ACL have a plus sign appended after mode bits
in "ls -l" output.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std acl_is_trivial_np
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acl 3 ,
.Xr acl_strip_np 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.

.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Fx 4.0 .
The
.Fn acl_is_trivial_np
function was added in
.Fx 8.0 .
