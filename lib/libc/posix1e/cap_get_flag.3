.Fd #include <sys/capability.h>
.Ft int
.Fn cap_get_flag "cap_t cap_p" "cap_value_t cap" "cap_flag_t flag" "cap_flag_value_t *value_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn cap_get_flag
shall obtain the current value of the capability flag
.Ar flag
of the capability
.Ar cap
from the capability state in working storage identified by
.Ar cap_p
and place it into the location pointed to by
.Ar value_p .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
FreeBSD's support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and
.Va errno
set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS

POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.  Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.  To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for POSIX.1e Capabilities was developed as part of the TrustedBSD
Project.
POSIX.1e Capability support was introduced in
.Fx 5.0 ,
and development continues.
