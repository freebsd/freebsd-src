.Sh NAME
.Nm mac.conf
.Nd format of the MAC library configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file configures the default label elements to be used by policy-agnostic
applications that operate on MAC labels.
A file contains a series of default label sets specified by object class,
in addition to blank lines and comments preceded by a
.Ql #
symbol.
.Pp
Each declaration consists of a single line with two fields separated
by white space: the object class name, and a list of label elements
as used by the
.Xr mac_prepare 3
library calls prior to an application invocation of a function from
.Xr mac_get 3 .
Label element names may optionally begin with a
.Ql \&?
symbol to indicate that a failure to retrieve the label element for
an object should be silently ignored, and improves usability if the
set of MAC policies may change over time.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example configures user applications to operate with
four MAC policies:
.Xr mac_biba 4 ,
.Xr mac_mls 4 ,
SEBSD,
and
.Xr mac_partition 4 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#
# Default label set to be used by simple MAC applications
#

default_file_labels ?biba,?mls,?sebsd
default_ifnet_labels ?biba,?mls,?sebsd
default_process_labels ?biba,?mls,partition,?sebsd
.Ed
.Pp
In this example, userland applications will attempt to retrieve Biba,
MLS, and SEBSD labels for all object classes; for processes, they will
additionally attempt to retrieve a Partition identifier.
In all cases except the Partition identifier, failure to retrieve a
label due to the respective policy not being present will be ignored.

.Sh HISTORY
Support for Mandatory Access Control was introduced in
.Fx 5.0
as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn TrustedBSD
MAC Framework and associated policies, interfaces, and
applications are considered to be an experimental feature in
.Fx .
Sites considering production deployment should keep the experimental
status of these services in mind during any deployment process.
See also
.Xr mac 9
for related considerations regarding the kernel framework.
