.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_get_file ,
.Nm mac_get_fd ,
.Nm mac_get_proc
.Nd get the label of a file, socket, socket peer or process
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_get_file "const char *path" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_get_fd "int fd" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_get_pid "pid_t pid" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_get_proc "mac_t label"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_get_file
and
.Fn mac_get_fd
functions fill in
.Fa label
(which must first be allocated by
.Xr mac_prepare 3 )
with the MAC label associated with the file referenced by
.Fa path
or the file descriptor specified by
.Fa fd ,
respectively.
Note that this function will fail on socket descriptors.
For information on
getting MAC labels on socket descriptors see
.Xr getsockopt 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_get_proc
and
.Fn mac_get_pid
functions fill in
.Fa label
(which must first be allocated by
.Xr mac_prepare 3 )
with the MAC label associated
with the requesting process
or the specified process, respectively.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
A component of
.Fa path
is not searchable,
or MAC read access to the file
is denied.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The pathname pointed to by
.Fa path
exceeds
.Dv PATH_MAX ,
or a component of the pathname exceeds
.Dv NAME_MAX .
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A component of
.Fa path
does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory is available
to allocate a new MAC label structure.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of
.Fa path
is not a directory.
