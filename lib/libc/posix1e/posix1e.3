.Sh NAME
.Nm posix1e
.Nd introduction to the POSIX.1e security API
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.In sys/mac.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
POSIX.1e describes five security extensions to the POSIX.1 API: Access
Control Lists (ACLs), Auditing, Capabilities, Mandatory Access Control, and
Information Flow Labels.
While IEEE POSIX.1e D17 specification has not been standardized, several of
its interfaces are widely used.
.Pp
.Fx
implements POSIX.1e interface for access control lists, described in
.Xr acl 3 ,
and supports ACLs on the
.Xr ffs 4
file system; ACLs must be administratively enabled using
.Xr tunefs 8 .
.Pp
.Fx
implements a POSIX.1e-like mandatory access control interface, described in
.Xr mac 3 ,
although with a number of extensions and important semantic differences.
.Pp
.Fx
does not implement the POSIX.1e audit, privilege (capability), or information
flow label APIs.
However,
.Fx
does implement the
.Xr libbsm 3
audit API.
It also provides
.Xr capsicum 4 ,
a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework implementing a
hybrid capability system model.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
POSIX.1e assigns security attributes to all objects, extending the security
functionality described in POSIX.1.
These additional attributes store fine-grained discretionary access control
information and mandatory access control labels; for files, they are stored
in extended attributes, described in
.Xr extattr 3 .
.Pp
POSIX.2c describes
a set of userland utilities for manipulating these attributes, including
.Xr getfacl 1
and
.Xr setfacl 1
for access control lists, and
.Xr getfmac 8
and
.Xr setfmac 8
for mandatory access control labels.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Fx 4.0 ;
most features were available as of
.Fx 5.0 .
