============================================
Distribution contents:

Makefile.inc	Ignore this, it's the 4.4BSD subsystem Makefile.
PORT		The per OS/architecture directories to use to build
		libdb.a, if you're not running 4.4BSD.  See the file
		PORT/README for more information.
README		This file.
VERSION		This file.
btree		B+tree routines.
db		Dbopen(3) interface routine.
doc		USENIX papers, formatted manual pages.
hash		Extended linear hashing routines.
man		Unformatted manual pages.
mpool		Memory pool routines.
recno		Fixed/variable length record routines.
test		Test package.

============================================
1.73 -> 1.74
	recno:	Don't put the record if rec_search fails, in rec_rdelete.
		Create fixed-length intermediate records past "end" of DB
		correctly.
		Realloc bug when reading in fixed records.
	all:	First cut at port to Alpha (64-bit architecture) using
		4.4BSD basic integral types typedef's.
		Cast allocation pointers to shut up old compilers.
		Rework PORT directory into OS/machine directories.

1.72 -> 1.73
	btree:	If enough duplicate records were inserted and then deleted
		that internal pages had references to empty pages of the
		duplicate keys, the search function ended up on the wrong
		page.

1.7  -> 1.72	12 Oct 1993
	hash:	Support NET/2 hash formats.
		
1.7  -> 1.71	16 Sep 1993
	btree/recno:
		Fix bug in internal search routines that caused
		return of invalid pointers.

1.6  -> 1.7	07 Sep 1993
	hash:	Fixed big key overflow bugs.
	test:	Portability hacks, rewrite test script, Makefile.
	btree/recno:
		Stop copying non-overflow key/data pairs.
	PORT:	Break PORT directory up into per architecture/OS
		subdirectories.

1.5  -> 1.6	06 Jun 1993
	hash:	In PAIRFITS, the first comparison should look at (P)[2].
		The hash_realloc function was walking off the end of memory.
		The overflow page number was wrong when bumping splitpoint.

1.4  -> 1.5	23 May 1993
	hash:	Set hash default fill factor dynamically.
	recno:	Fixed bug in sorted page splits.
		Add page size parameter support.
		Allow recno to specify the name of the underlying btree;
			used for vi recovery.
	btree/recno:
		Support 64K pages.
	btree/hash/recno:
		Provide access to an underlying file descriptor.
		Change sync routines to take a flag argument, recno
			uses this to sync out the underlying btree.

1.3  -> 1.4	10 May 1993
	recno:	Delete the R_CURSORLOG flag from the recno interface.
		Zero-length record fix for non-mmap reads.
		Try and make SIZE_T_MAX test in open portable.

1.2  -> 1.3	01 May 1993
	btree:	Ignore user byte-order setting when reading already
		existing database.  Fixes to byte-order conversions.

1.1  -> 1.2	15 Apr 1993
		No bug fixes, only compatibility hacks.
