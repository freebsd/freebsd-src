.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm catopen
.Nd open message catalog
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In nl_types.h
.Ft nl_catd
.Fn catopen "const char *name" "int oflag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn catopen
function opens the message catalog specified by
.Fa name
and returns a message catalog descriptor.
If
.Fa name
contains a
.Sq /
then
.Fa name
specifies the full pathname for the message catalog, otherwise the value
of the environment variable
.Ev NLSPATH
is used with
the following substitutions:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It \&%N
The value of the
.Fa name
argument.
.It \&%L
The value of the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category (see below).
.It \&%l
The language element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%t
The territory element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%c
The codeset element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%%
A single % character.
.El
.Pp
An empty string is substituted for undefined values.
.Pp
Path names templates defined in
.Ev NLSPATH
are separated by colons
.Pq Sq \&: .
A leading or two adjacent colons
is equivalent to specifying %N.
.Pp
If the
.Fa oflag
argument is set to the
.Dv NL_CAT_LOCALE
constant,
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
locale category used to open the message catalog; using
.Dv NL_CAT_LOCALE
conforms to the
.St -xpg4
standard.
You can specify 0 for compatibility with
.St -xpg3 ;
when
.Fa oflag
is set to 0, the
.Ev LANG
environment variable
determines the message catalog locale.
.Pp
A message catalog descriptor
remains valid in a process until that process closes it, or
until a successful call to one of the
.Xr exec 3
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn catopen
returns a message catalog descriptor.
Otherwise, (nl_catd) -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
An entire path to the message catalog exceeded 1024 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
Argument
.Fa name
does not point to a valid message catalog name,
or it points to an empty string.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named message catalog does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
