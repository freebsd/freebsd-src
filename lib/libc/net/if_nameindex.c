/*
 * From RFC 2553:
 *
 * 4.3 Return All Interface Names and Indexes
 *
 *    The if_nameindex structure holds the information about a single
 *    interface and is defined as a result of including the <net/if.h>
 *    header.
 *
 *       struct if_nameindex {
 *         unsigned int   if_index;
 *         char          *if_name;
 *       };
 *
 *    The final function returns an array of if_nameindex structures, one
 *    structure per interface.
 *
 *       struct if_nameindex  *if_nameindex(void);
 *
 *    The end of the array of structures is indicated by a structure with
 *    an if_index of 0 and an if_name of NULL.  The function returns a NULL
 *    pointer upon an error, and would set errno to the appropriate value.
 *
 *    The memory used for this array of structures along with the interface
 *    names pointed to by the if_name members is obtained dynamically.
 *    This memory is freed by the next function.
 *
 * 4.4.  Free Memory
 *
 *    The following function frees the dynamic memory that was allocated by
 *    if_nameindex().
 *
 *        #include <net/if.h>
 *
 *        void  if_freenameindex(struct if_nameindex *ptr);
 *
 *    The argument to this function must be a pointer that was returned by
 *    if_nameindex().
