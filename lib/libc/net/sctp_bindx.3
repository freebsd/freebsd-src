.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sctp_bindx
.Nd bind or unbind an SCTP socket to a list of addresses
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In netinet/sctp.h
.Ft int
.Fn sctp_bindx "int s" "struct sockaddr *addrs" "int num" "int type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sctp_bindx
call binds or unbinds a address or a list of addresses to an
SCTP endpoint.
This allows a user to bind a subset of
addresses.
The
.Fn sctp_bindx
call operates similarly to
.Fn bind
but allows a list of addresses and also allows a bind or an
unbind.
The argument
.Fa s
must be a valid SCTP socket descriptor.
The argument
.Fa addrs
is a list of addresses (where the list may be only 1 in
length) that the user wishes to bind or unbind to the
socket.
The argument
.Fa type
must be one of the following values.
.Pp
.Dv SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR
This value indicates that the listed address(es) need to
be added to the endpoint.
.Pp
.Dv SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR
This value indicates that the listed address(es) need to
be removed from the endpoint.
.Pp
Note that when a user adds or deletes an address to an
association if the dynamic address flag
.Va net.inet.sctp.auto_asconf
is enabled any associations in the endpoint will attempt to
have the address(es) added dynamically to the existing
association.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The call returns 0 on success and -1 upon failure.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sctp_bindx
function can return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
This value is returned if the
.Fa type
field is not one of the allowed values (see above).
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
This value is returned if the number of addresses
being added causes a memory allocation failure in
the call.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The argument
.Fa s
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
The argument
.Fa s
is not a socket.
