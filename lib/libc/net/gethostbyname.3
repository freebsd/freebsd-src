.Fd #include <netdb.h>
.Fd extern struct h_errno;
.Ft struct hostent *
.Fn gethostbyname "char *name"
.Ft struct hostent *

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn gethostbyname
and
.Fn gethostbyaddr
functions
each return a pointer to an object with the
following structure describing an internet host
referenced by name or by address, respectively.
This structure contains either the information obtained from the name server,
.Xr named 8 ,
or broken-out fields from a line in 
.Pa /etc/hosts .
If the local name server is not running these routines do a lookup in
.Pa /etc/hosts .
.Bd -literal
struct	hostent {
	char	*h_name;	/* official name of host */
	char	**h_aliases;	/* alias list */
	int	h_addrtype;	/* host address type */
	int	h_length;	/* length of address */
	char	**h_addr_list;	/* list of addresses from name server */
};
#define	h_addr  h_addr_list[0]	/* address, for backward compatibility */
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width h_addr_list
.It Fa h_name
Official name of the host.
.It Fa h_aliases
A zero terminated array of alternate names for the host.
.It Fa h_addrtype
The type of address being returned; currently always
.Dv AF_INET .
.It Fa h_length
The length, in bytes, of the address.
.It Fa h_addr_list
A zero terminated array of network addresses for the host.
Host addresses are returned in network byte order.
.It Fa h_addr
The first address in
.Fa h_addr_list ;
this is for backward compatibility.
.Pp
When using the nameserver,
.Fn gethostbyname
will search for the named host in the current domain and its parents
unless the name ends in a dot.
If the name contains no dot, and if the environment variable
.Dq Ev HOSTALIASES
contains the name of an alias file, the alias file will first be searched
for an alias matching the input name.
See
.Xr hostname 7
for the domain search procedure and the alias file format.
.Pp
The
.Fn sethostent
function
may be used to request the use of a connected
.Tn TCP
socket for queries.
If the
.Fa stayopen
flag is non-zero,
this sets the option to send all queries to the name server using
.Tn TCP
and to retain the connection after each call to 
.Fn gethostbyname
or
.Fn gethostbyaddr .
Otherwise, queries are performed using
.Tn UDP
datagrams.
.Pp
The
.Fn endhostent
function
closes the
.Tn TCP
connection.
.Sh FILES

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error return status from 
.Fn gethostbyname
and
.Fn gethostbyaddr
is indicated by return of a null pointer.
The external integer
.Va h_errno
may then be checked to see whether this is a temporary failure
or an invalid or unknown host.
The routine
.Fn herror
can be used to print an error message describing the failure.
If its argument
.Fa string
is
.Pf non Dv -NULL ,
it is printed, followed by a colon and a space.
The error message is printed with a trailing newline.
.Pp
The variable
.Va h_errno
can have the following values:
.Bl -tag -width HOST_NOT_FOUND
.It Dv HOST_NOT_FOUND
No such host is known.
.It Dv TRY_AGAIN
This is usually a temporary error
and means that the local server did not receive
a response from an authoritative server.
A retry at some later time may succeed.
.It Dv NO_RECOVERY
Some unexpected server failure was encountered.
This is a non-recoverable error.
.It Dv NO_DATA
The requested name is valid but does not have an IP address; 
this is not a temporary error.  
This means that the name is known to the name server but there is no address
associated with this name.
Another type of request to the name server using this domain name
will result in an answer;
for example, a mail-forwarder may be registered for this domain.

.Sh CAVEAT
The
.Fn gethostent
function
is defined, and
.Fn sethostent
and
.Fn endhostent
are redefined,
when
.Xr libc 3
is built to use only the routines to lookup in
.Pa /etc/hosts
and not the name server.
.Pp
The
.Fn gethostent
function
reads the next line of
.Pa /etc/hosts ,
opening the file if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fn sethostent
function
opens and/or rewinds the file
.Pa /etc/hosts .
If the
.Fa stayopen
argument is non-zero,
the file will not be closed after each call to
.Fn gethostbyname
or
.Fn gethostbyaddr .
.Pp
The
.Fn endhostent
function
closes the file.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn herror
function appeared in 
.Bx 4.3 .
The
.Fn endhostent ,
.Fn gethostbyaddr ,
.Fn gethostbyname ,
.Fn gethostent ,
and
.Fn sethostent
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
These functions use static data storage;
if the data is needed for future use, it should be
copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
Only the Internet
address format is currently understood.
