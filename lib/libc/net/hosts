# This file should contain the addresses and aliases for local hosts that
# share this file.  Replace 'my.domain' below with the domainname of your
# machine.

# In the presence of the domain name service or NIS, this file may
# not be consulted at all; see /etc/nsswitch.conf for the resolution order.

#10.0.0.3		myfriend.my.domain myfriend
#
# According to RFC 1918, you can use the following IP blocks for
# private internets:
#
#	10.0.0.0	-   10.255.255.255	(10/8 prefix)
#	172.16.0.0	-   172.31.255.255	(172.16/12 prefix)
#	192.168.0.0	-   192.168.255.255	(192.168/16 prefix)
#
# In case you want to make addresses available on the Internet, you need
# real official assigned numbers.  Do not try to invent your own network
# numbers but instead get one from your network provider (if any) or
# from your regional registry (ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NCC, or AfriNIC.)
