.Dt SETPROCTITLE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm setproctitle
.Nd set the process title for
.Xr ps 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft void
.Fn setproctitle "const char *fmt" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setproctitle
library routine sets the process title that appears on the
.Xr ps 1
command.
.Pp
The title is set from the executable's name, followed by the
result of a
.Xr printf 3
style expansion of the arguments as specified by the
.Va fmt
argument.
If the
.Va fmt
argument begins with a
.Dq -
character, the executable's name is skipped.
.Pp
If
.Va fmt
is NULL, the process title is restored.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the title on a daemon to indicate its activity:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
setproctitle("talking to %s", inet_ntoa(addr));
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr w 1 ,
.Xr kvm 3 ,
.Xr kvm_getargv 3 ,
.Xr printf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn setproctitle
is implicitly non-standard.  Other methods of causing the
.Xr ps 1
command line to change, including copying over the argv[0] string are
also implicitly non-portable.  It is preferable to use an operating system
supplied
.Fn setproctitle
if present.
.Pp
Unfortunately, it is possible that there are other calling conventions
to other versions of
.Fn setproctitle ,
although none have been found by the author as yet.  This is believed to be
the predominant convention.
.Pp
It is thought that the implementation is compatible with other systems,
including
.Nx
and
.Tn BSD/OS .
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn setproctitle
first appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
Other operating systems have
similar functions.
