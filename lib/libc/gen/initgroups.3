.Sh NAME
.Nm initgroups
.Nd initialize group access list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn initgroups "const char *name" "int basegid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn initgroups
function
uses the
.Xr getgrouplist 3
function to calculate the group access list for the user
specified in
.Fa name .
This group list is then setup for the current process using
.Xr setgroups 2 .
The
.Fa basegid
is automatically included in the groups list.
Typically this value is given as
the group number from the password file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn initgroups
function
returns \-1 if it was not invoked by the super-user.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setgroups 2 ,
.Xr getgrouplist 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn initgorups
function appeared in 
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getgrouplist
function called by
.Fn initgorups
uses the routines based on
.Xr getgrent 3 .
If the invoking program uses any of these routines,
the group structure will
be overwritten in the call to
.Fn initgroups .
