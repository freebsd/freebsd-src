.Ft int
.Fn sem_wait "sem_t *sem"
.Ft int
.Fn sem_trywait "sem_t *sem"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sem_wait
function decrements (locks) the semaphore pointed to by
.Fa sem ,
but blocks if the value of
.Fa sem
is zero, until the value is non-zero and the value can be decremented.
.Pp
The
.Fn sem_trywait
function decrements (locks) the semaphore pointed to by
.Fa sem
only if the value is non-zero.
Otherwise, the semaphore is not decremented and
an error is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS

.Fn sem_wait
and
.Fn sem_trywait
functions will fail if:
