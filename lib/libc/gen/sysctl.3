.Sh NAME
.Nm sysctl ,
.Nm sysctlbyname
.Nd get or set system information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/sysctl.h>
.Ft int
.Fn sysctl "int *name" "u_int namelen" "void *oldp" "size_t *oldlenp" "void *newp" "size_t newlen"
.Fn sysctlbyname "const char *name" "void *oldp" "size_t *oldlenp" "void *newp" "size_t newlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysctl
function retrieves system information and allows processes with
appropriate privileges to set system information.
The information available from
.Fn sysctl
consists of integers, strings, and tables.
Information may be retrieved and set from the command interface
using the 
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
.Pp
Unless explicitly noted below,
.Fn sysctl
returns a consistent snapshot of the data requested.
Consistency is obtained by locking the destination
buffer into memory so that the data may be copied out without blocking.
Calls to
.Fn sysctl
are serialized to avoid deadlock.
.Pp
The state is described using a ``Management Information Base'' (MIB)
style name, listed in
.Fa name ,
which is a
.Fa namelen
length array of integers.
.Pp
The
.Fn sysctlbyname
function accepts an ascii representation of the name and internally
looks up the integer name vector.  Apart from that, it behaves the same
as the standard
.Fn sysctl
function.
.Pp
The information is copied into the buffer specified by
.Fa oldp .
The size of the buffer is given by the location specified by
.Fa oldlenp
before the call,
and that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful call
and after a call that returns with the error code ENOMEM.
If the amount of data available is greater
than the size of the buffer supplied,
the call supplies as much data as fits in the buffer provided
and returns with the error code ENOMEM.
If the old value is not desired,
.Fa oldp
and
.Fa oldlenp
should be set to NULL.
.Pp
The size of the available data can be determined by calling 
.Fn sysctl
with a NULL parameter for
.Fa oldp .
The size of the available data will be returned in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
For some operations, the amount of space may change often.
For these operations,
the system attempts to round up so that the returned size is
large enough for a call to return the data shortly thereafter.
.Pp
To set a new value,
.Fa newp
is set to point to a buffer of length
.Fa newlen
from which the requested value is to be taken.
If a new value is not to be set,
.Fa newp
should be set to NULL and
.Fa newlen
set to 0.
.Pp
The top level names are defined with a CTL_ prefix in
.Pa <sys/sysctl.h> ,
and are as follows.
The next and subsequent levels down are found in the include files
listed here, and described in separate sections below.
.Pp
.Bl -column CTLXMACHDEPXXX "Next level namesXXXXXX" -offset indent
.It Sy Pa Name	Next level names	Description
.It CTL\_DEBUG	sys/sysctl.h	Debugging
.It CTL\_VFS	sys/mount.h	Filesystem
.It CTL\_HW	sys/sysctl.h	Generic CPU, I/O
.It CTL\_KERN	sys/sysctl.h	High kernel limits
.It CTL\_MACHDEP	sys/sysctl.h	Machine dependent
.It CTL\_NET	sys/socket.h	Networking

.Pp
For example, the following retrieves the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2], maxproc;
size_t len;

mib[0] = CTL_KERN;
mib[1] = KERN_MAXPROC;
len = sizeof(maxproc);
sysctl(mib, 2, &maxproc, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Pp
To retrieve the standard search path for the system utilities:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2];
size_t len;
char *p;

mib[0] = CTL_USER;
mib[1] = USER_CS_PATH;
sysctl(mib, 2, NULL, &len, NULL, 0);
p = malloc(len);
sysctl(mib, 2, p, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Sh CTL_DEBUG
The debugging variables vary from system to system.
A debugging variable may be added or deleted without need to recompile
.Fn sysctl
to know about it.
Each time it runs,
.Fn sysctl
gets the list of debugging variables from the kernel and
displays their current values.
The system defines twenty 
.Ns ( Va struct ctldebug )
variables named 
.Nm debug0
through
.Nm debug19 .
They are declared as separate variables so that they can be
individually initialized at the location of their associated variable.
The loader prevents multiple use of the same variable by issuing errors
if a variable is initialized in more than one place.
For example, to export the variable
.Nm dospecialcheck
as a debugging variable, the following declaration would be used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int dospecialcheck = 1;
struct ctldebug debug5 = { "dospecialcheck", &dospecialcheck };
.Ed
.Sh CTL_VFS
A distinguished second level name, VFS_GENERIC,
is used to get general information about all filesystems.
One of its third level identifiers is VFS_MAXTYPENUM
that gives the highest valid filesystem type number.
Its other third level identifier is VFS_CONF that
returns configuration information about the filesystem
type given as a fourth level identifier (see
.Xr getvfsbyname 3
as an example of its use).
The remaining second level identifiers are the
filesystem type number returned by a
.Xr statfs 2
call or from VFS_CONF.
The third level identifiers available for each filesystem
are given in the header file that defines the mount
argument structure for that filesystem.
.Sh CTL_HW
The string and integer information available for the CTL_HW level
is detailed below.
The changeable column shows whether a process with appropriate
privilege may change the value.
