.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This interface is defined by

A far more complete interface is available using
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn sysconf
function provides a method for applications to determine the current
value of a configurable system limit or option variable.
The
.Fa name
argument specifies the system variable to be queried.
Symbolic constants for each name value are found in the include file
.In unistd.h .
Shell programmers who need access to these parameters should use the
.Xr getconf 1
utility.

.Pp
These values also exist, but may not be standard:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Li _SC_CPUSET_SIZE
Size of the kernel cpuset.
.It Li _SC_PHYS_PAGES
The number of pages of physical memory.
Note that it is possible that the product of this value and the value of

.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Fn sysconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that is not
supported, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sysconf
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr sysctl 3 .
In addition, the following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getconf 1 ,
.Xr pathconf 2 ,
.Xr confstr 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Except for the fact that values returned by
.Fn sysconf
may change over the lifetime of the calling process,
this function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn sysconf
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The value for _SC_STREAM_MAX is a minimum maximum, and required to be
the same as ANSI C's FOPEN_MAX, so the returned value is a ridiculously
small and misleading number.
