input.

The
.Fn getpass
function turns off character echoing while reading the password.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn getpass
function appeared in
.At v7 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getpass
function leaves its result in an internal static object and returns
a pointer to that object.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn getpass
will modify the same object.
.Pp
The calling process should zero the password as soon as possible to
avoid leaving the cleartext password visible in the process's address
space.
.Pp
Upon receipt of a SIGTSTP, the input buffer will be flushed, so any
partially typed password must be retyped when the process
continues.
