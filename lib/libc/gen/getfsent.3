.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getfsent ,
.Fn getfsspec ,
and
.Fn getfsfile
functions
each return a pointer to an object with the following structure
containing the broken-out fields of a line in the file system
description file,
.In fstab.h .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct fstab {
	char	*fs_spec;	/* block special device name */
	char	*fs_file;	/* file system path prefix */
	char	*fs_vfstype;	/* File system type, ufs, nfs */
	char	*fs_mntops;	/* Mount options ala -o */
	char	*fs_type;	/* FSTAB_* from fs_mntops */
	int	fs_freq;	/* dump frequency, in days */
	int	fs_passno;	/* pass number on parallel fsck */
};

.Pp
The fields have meanings described in
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Pp
The
.Fn setfsent
function
opens the file (closing any previously opened file) or rewinds it
if it is already open.
.Pp
The
.Fn endfsent
function
closes the file.
.Pp
The
.Fn setfstab
function sets the file to be used by subsequent operations.
The value set by
.Fn setfstab
does not persist across calls to
.Fn endfsent .
.Pp
The
.Fn getfstab
function returns the name of the file that will be used.
.Pp
The
.Fn getfsspec
and
.Fn getfsfile
functions
search the entire file (opening it if necessary) for a matching special
file name or file system file name.
.Pp
For programs wishing to read the entire database,
.Fn getfsent
reads the next entry (opening the file if necessary).
.Pp
All entries in the file with a type field equivalent to
.Dv FSTAB_XX
are ignored.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getfsent ,
.Fn getfsspec ,
and
.Fn getfsfile
functions
return a
.Dv NULL
pointer on
.Dv EOF
or error.
The
.Fn setfsent
function
returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.
The
.Fn endfsent
function
returns nothing.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev PATH_FSTAB"
.It Ev PATH_FSTAB
If the environment variable
.Ev PATH_FSTAB
is set, all operations are performed against the specified file.
.Ev PATH_FSTAB
will not be honored if the process environment or memory address space is
considered
.Dq tainted .

copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
