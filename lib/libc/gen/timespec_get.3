.Sh NAME
.Nm timespec_get
.Nd get current calendar time
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fn timespec_get "struct timespec *ts" "int base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function sets the interval pointed to by
.Fa ts
to hold the current calendar time based on the specified time base in
.Fa base .
.Pp
The base
.Dv TIME_UTC
returns the time since the epoch.
This time is expressed in seconds and nanoseconds since midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970.
In
.Fx ,
this corresponds to
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME .
.Pp
The base
.Dv TIME_MONOTONIC
returns a monotonically-increasing time since an unspecified point in the past.
In
.Fx ,
this corresponds to
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function returns the passed value of
.Fa base
if successful, otherwise
.Dv 0
on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
function with a
.Fa base
of
.Dv TIME_UTC
conforms to
.St -isoC-2011 .
