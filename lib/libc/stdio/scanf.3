.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scanf
family of functions scans input according to a
.Fa format
as described below.
This format may contain
.Em conversion specifiers ;
the results from such conversions, if any,
are stored through the
.Em pointer
arguments.
The
.Fn scanf
function
reads input from the standard input stream
.Em stdin ,
.Fn fscanf
reads input from the stream pointer
.Fa stream ,
and
.Fn sscanf
reads its input from the character string pointed to by
.Fa str .
The
.Fn vfscanf
function
is analogous to
.Xr vfprintf 3
and reads input from the stream pointer
.Fa stream
using a variable argument list of pointers (see
.Xr stdarg 3 ) .
The
.Fn vscanf
function scans a variable argument list from the standard input and
the
.Fn vsscanf
function scans it from a string;
these are analogous to
the
.Fn vprintf
and
.Fn vsprintf
functions respectively.
Each successive
.Em pointer
argument must correspond properly with
each successive conversion specifier
(but see `suppression' below).
All conversions are introduced by the
.Cm %
(percent sign) character.
The
.Fa format
string
may also contain other characters.
White space (such as blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the
.Fa format
string match any amount of white space, including none, in the input.
Everything else
matches only itself.
Scanning stops
when an input character does not match such a format character.
Scanning also stops
when an input conversion cannot be made (see below).
.Sh CONVERSIONS
Following the
.Cm %
character introducing a conversion
there may be a number of
.Em flag
characters, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm *
Suppresses assignment.
The conversion that follows occurs as usual, but no pointer is used;
the result of the conversion is simply discarded.
.It Cm h
Indicates that the conversion will be one of
.Cm dioux
or
.Cm n
and the next pointer is a pointer to a
.Em short  int
(rather than
.Em int ) .
.It Cm l
Indicates either that the conversion will be one of
.Cm dioux
or
.Cm n
and the next pointer is a pointer to a
.Em long  int
(rather than
.Em int ) ,
or that the conversion will be one of
.Cm efg
and the next pointer is a pointer to
.Em double
(rather than
.Em float ) .
.It Cm L
Indicates that the conversion will be
.Cm efg
and the next pointer is a pointer to
.Em long double .
(This type is not implemented; the
.Cm L
flag is currently ignored.)
.It Cm q
Indicates either that the conversion will be one of
.Cm dioux
or
.Cm n
and the next pointer is a pointer to a
.Em long long int
(rather than
.Em int ) ,
.El
.Pp
In addition to these flags,
there may be an optional maximum field width,
expressed as a decimal integer,
between the
.Cm %
and the conversion.
If no width is given,
a default of `infinity' is used (with one exception, below);
otherwise at most this many characters are scanned
in processing the conversion.
Before conversion begins,
most conversions skip white space;
this white space is not counted against the field width.
.Pp
The following conversions are available:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Cm %
Matches a literal `%'.
That is, `%\&%' in the format string
matches a single input `%' character.
No conversion is done, and assignment does not occur.
.It Cm d
Matches an optionally signed decimal integer;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em int .
.It Cm D
Equivalent to
.Cm ld ;
this exists only for backwards compatibility.
.It Cm i
Matches an optionally signed integer;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em int .
The integer is read in base 16 if it begins
with
.Ql 0x
or
.Ql 0X ,
in base 8 if it begins with
.Ql 0 ,
and in base 10 otherwise.
Only characters that correspond to the base are used.
.It Cm o
Matches an octal integer;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em unsigned int .
.It Cm O
Equivalent to
.Cm lo ;
this exists for backwards compatibility.
.It Cm u
Matches an optionally signed decimal integer;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em unsigned int .
.It Cm x
Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em unsigned int .
.It Cm X
Equivalent to
.Cm lx ;
this violates the
.St -isoC ,
but is backwards compatible with previous
.Ux
systems.
.It Cm f
Matches an optionally signed floating-point number;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em float .
.It Cm e
Equivalent to
.Cm f .
.It Cm g
Equivalent to
.Cm f .
.It Cm E
Equivalent to
.Cm lf ;
this violates the
.St -isoC ,
but is backwards compatible with previous
.Ux
systems.
.It Cm F
Equivalent to
.Cm lf ;
this exists only for backwards compatibility.
.It Cm s
Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em char ,
and the array must be large enough to accept all the sequence and the
terminating
.Dv NUL
character.
The input string stops at white space
or at the maximum field width, whichever occurs first.
.It Cm c
Matches a sequence of
.Em width
count
characters (default 1);
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em char ,
and there must be enough room for all the characters
(no terminating
.Dv NUL
is added).
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.
To skip white space first, use an explicit space in the format.
.It Cm \&[
Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set
of accepted characters;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em char ,
and there must be enough room for all the characters in the string,
plus a terminating
.Dv NUL
character.
The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.
The string is to be made up of characters in
(or not in)
a particular set;
the set is defined by the characters between the open bracket
.Cm [
character
and a close bracket
.Cm ]
character.
The set
.Em excludes
those characters
if the first character after the open bracket is a circumflex
.Cm ^ .
To include a close bracket in the set,
make it the first character after the open bracket
or the circumflex;
any other position will end the set.
The hyphen character
.Cm -
is also special;
when placed between two other characters,
it adds all intervening characters to the set.
To include a hyphen,
make it the last character before the final close bracket.
For instance,
.Ql [^]0-9-]
means the set `everything except close bracket, zero through nine,
and hyphen'.
The string ends with the appearance of a character not in the
(or, with a circumflex, in) set
or when the field width runs out.
.It Cm p
Matches a pointer value (as printed by
.Ql %p
in
.Xr printf 3 ) ;
the next pointer must be a pointer to
.Em void .
.It Cm n
Nothing is expected;
instead, the number of characters consumed thus far from the input
is stored through the next pointer,
which must be a pointer to
.Em int .
This is
.Em not
a conversion, although it can be suppressed with the
.Cm *
flag.
.El
.Pp
For backwards compatibility,
other conversion characters (except
.Ql \e0 )
are taken as if they were
.Ql %d
or, if uppercase,
.Ql %ld ,
and a `conversion' of
.Ql %\e0
causes an immediate return of
.Dv EOF .
The
.Cm F
and
.Cm X
conversions will be changed in the future
to conform to the
.Tn ANSI
C standard,
after which they will act like
.Cm f
and
.Cm x
respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These
functions
return
the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided
for, or even zero, in the event of a matching failure.
Zero
indicates that, while there was input available,
no conversions were assigned;
typically this is due to an invalid input character,
such as an alphabetic character for a
.Ql %d
conversion.
The value
.Dv EOF
is returned if an input failure occurs before any conversion such as an
end-of-file occurs.
If an error or end-of-file occurs after conversion
has begun,
the number of conversions which were successfully completed is returned.

.Sh STANDARDS
The functions
.Fn fscanf ,
.Fn scanf ,
and
.Fn sscanf
conform to
.St -isoC .
.Sh HISTORY
The functions
.Fn vscanf ,
.Fn vsscanf
and
.Fn vfscanf
are new to this release.
.Sh BUGS
The current situation with
.Cm %F
and
.Cm %X
conversions is unfortunate.
.Pp
All of the backwards compatibility formats will be removed in the future.
.Pp
Numerical strings are truncated to 512 characters; for example,
.Cm %f
and
.Cm %d
are implicitly
.Cm %512f
and
.Cm %512d .
