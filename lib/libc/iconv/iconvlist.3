.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn iconvlist
function obtains a list of character encodings that are supported by the
.Xr iconv 3
call.
The
.Fn do_one
callback function will be called, where the
.Fa count
argument will be set to the number of the encoding names found, the
.Fa names
argument will be the list of the supported encoding names and the
.Fa arg
argument will be the \"outer\"
.Fa arg
argument of the
.Fn iconvlist
function.
This argument can be used to interchange custom data between the caller of
.Fn iconvlist
and the callback function.
.Pp
If an error occurs,
.Fa names
will be NULL when calling
.Fn do_one .
