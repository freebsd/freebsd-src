.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In iconv.h
.Ft int
.Fn __iconv_get_list "char ***names" "size_t count" "bool paired"
.Ft void
.Fn __iconv_free_list "char **names" "size_t count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn __iconv_get_list
function obtains a list of character encodings that are supported by the
.Xr iconv 3
call.
The list of the encoding names will be stored in
.Fa names
and the number of the entries is stored in
.Fa count .
If the
.Fa paired
variable is true, the list will be arranged into
canonical/alias name pairs.
.Pp
The
.Fn __iconv_free_list
function is to free the allocated memory during the call of
.Fn __iconv_get_list .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn __iconv_get_list
returns 0 and set the
.Fa names
and
.Fa count
arguments.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr iconvlist 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm __iconv_get_list
and
.Nm __iconv_free_list
functions are non-standard interfaces, which appeared in
