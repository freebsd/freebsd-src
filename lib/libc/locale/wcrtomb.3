.Sh NAME
.Nm wcrtomb
.Nd "convert a wide-character code to a character (restartable)"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcrtomb "char * restrict s" "wchar_t wc" "mbstate_t * restrict ps"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcrtomb
function stores a multibyte sequence representing the
wide character
.Fa wc ,
including any necessary shift sequences, to the
character array
.Fa s ,
storing a maximum of
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
bytes.
.Pp
If
.Fa s
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn wcrtomb
behaves as if
.Fa s
pointed to an internal buffer and
.Fa wc
was a null wide character (L'\e0').
.Pp
The
.Ft mbstate_t
argument,
.Fa ps ,
is used to keep track of the shift state.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn wcrtomb
uses an internal, static
.Vt mbstate_t
object.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcrtomb
functions returns the length (in bytes) of the multibyte sequence
needed to represent
.Fa wc ,
or
.Po Vt size_t Pc Ns \-1
if
.Fa wc
is not a valid wide character code.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wcrtomb
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.\".It Bq Er EINVAL
.\"Invalid argument.
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid wide character code was specified.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mbrtowc 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr wctomb 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcrtomb
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation does not support shift states.
