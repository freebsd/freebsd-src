.Dq "Big Five"
encoding for Traditional Chinese text
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ENCODING
.Qq BIG5
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Dq Big Five
is a standard for encoding Traditional Chinese text.
Each character is represented by either one or two bytes.
Characters from the ASCII character set are represented as
single bytes in the range 0x00 - 0x7F.
Traditional Chinese characters are represented by two bytes:
the first in the range 0xA1 - 0xFE, the second in the range
0x40 - 0xFE.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr euc 5 ,
.Xr gb18030 5 ,
.Xr utf8 5
.Sh BUGS
The range of the second byte overlaps some ASCII characters, including
0x5C
.Pq Ql \e
and 0x7C
.Pq Ql |
which may cause problems in program execution or
display.
Big5 is considered a legacy standard and only preserved for backward
compatibility reason.
New documents and systems are suggested using UTF-8 directly.
