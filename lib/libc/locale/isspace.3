.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isspace
.Nd white-space character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <ctype.h>
.Ft int
.Fn isspace "int c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isspace
function tests for the standard white-space characters.
For single C
.Va char Ns s
locales (see
.Xr multibyte 3 )
the value of the argument is
representable as an
.Li unsigned char
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Pp
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__
.It \&011\ ht \t012\ nl \t013\ vt \t014\ np \t015\ cr
.It \&040\ sp
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isspace
function returns zero if the character tests false and
returns non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ctype 3 ,
.Xr multibyte 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isspace
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
