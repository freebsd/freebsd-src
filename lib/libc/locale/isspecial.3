.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isspecial
and

functions test for a special character.
.Pp
The
.Fn isspecial_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isspecial
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isspecial
and
.Fn isspecial_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswspecial
or
.Fn iswspecial_l
function should be used instead.
