.Dt NEWLOCALE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm newlocale
.Nd Creates a new locale
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In locale.h
.Ft locale_t
.Fn newlocale "int mask" "const char * locale" "locale_t base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Creates a new locale, inheriting some properties from an existing locale.
The
.Fa mask
defines the components that the new locale will have set to the locale with the
name specified in the
.Fa locale
parameter.
Any components not specified in
.Fa mask
will be inherited from the locale referenced by
.Fa base ,
if
.Fa base
is not
.Dv NULL .
If the call is successful, the state of the locale referenced by
.Fa base
is unspecified, and it must not be accessed.
The special locale
.Dv LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
may not be specified for
.Fa base .
The
.Fa mask
is either
.Fa LC_ALL_MASK ,
indicating all possible locale components,
or the logical OR of some combination of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "LC_MESSAGES_MASK" -offset indent
.It LC_COLLATE_MASK
The locale for string collation routines.
This controls alphabetic ordering in
.Xr strcoll 3
and
.Xr strxfrm 3 .
.It LC_CTYPE_MASK
The locale for the
.Xr ctype 3
and
.Xr multibyte 3
functions.
This controls recognition of upper and lower case, alphabetic or
non-alphabetic characters, and so on.
.It LC_MESSAGES_MASK
Set a locale for message catalogs, see
.Xr catopen 3
function.
.It LC_MONETARY_MASK
Set a locale for formatting monetary values; this affects
the
.Xr localeconv 3
function.
.It LC_NUMERIC_MASK
Set a locale for formatting numbers.
This controls the formatting of decimal points in input and output of floating
point numbers in functions such as
.Xr printf 3
and
.Xr scanf 3 ,
as well as values returned by
.Xr localeconv 3 .
.It LC_TIME_MASK
Set a locale for formatting dates and times using the
.Xr strftime 3
function.
.El
This function uses the same rules for loading locale components as
.Xr setlocale 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns a new, valid,
.Fa locale_t
or NULL if an error occurs.
You must free the returned locale with
.Xr freelocale 3 .
