.Sh NAME
.Nm ispunct ,
.Nm ispunct_l
.Nd punctuation character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn ispunct "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn ispunct_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ispunct
and
.Fn ispunct_l
functions test for any printing character except for space
.Pq Ql "\ "
or a
character for which
.Xr isalnum 3
or
.Xr isalnum_l 3
is true.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__
.It "\&041\ ``!''" Ta "042\ ``""''" Ta "043\ ``#''" Ta "044\ ``$''" Ta "045\ ``%''"
.It "\&046\ ``&''" Ta "047\ ``'''" Ta "050\ ``(''" Ta "051\ ``)''" Ta "052\ ``*''"
.It "\&053\ ``+''" Ta "054\ ``,''" Ta "055\ ``-''" Ta "056\ ``.''" Ta "057\ ``/''"
.It "\&072\ ``:''" Ta "073\ ``;''" Ta "074\ ``<''" Ta "075\ ``=''" Ta "076\ ``>''"
.It "\&077\ ``?''" Ta "100\ ``@''" Ta "133\ ``[''" Ta "134\ ``\e\|''" Ta "135\ ``]''"
.It "\&136\ ``^''" Ta "137\ ``_''" Ta "140\ ```''" Ta "173\ ``{''" Ta "174\ ``|''"
.It "\&175\ ``}''" Ta "176\ ``~''" Ta \& Ta \& Ta \&
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn ispunct_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn ispunct
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn ispunct
and
.Fn ispunct_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswpunct
or
.Fn iswpunct_l
function should be used instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ctype 3 ,
.Xr ctype_l 3 ,
.Xr iswpunct 3 ,
.Xr iswpunct_l 3 ,
.Xr xlocale 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn ispunct
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
The
.Fn ispunct_l
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn ispunct
function first appeared in
.At v7 .
