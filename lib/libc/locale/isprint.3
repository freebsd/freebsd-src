.Dt ISPRINT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isprint ,
.Nm isprint_l
.Nd printing character test (space character inclusive)
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isprint "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isprint_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isprint
and
.Fn isprint_l
functions test for any printing character, including space
.Pq Ql "\ " .
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__

.El
.Pp
The
.Fn isprint_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isprint
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isprint
and
.Fn isprint_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswprint
or
.Fn iswprint_l
function should be used instead.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isprint
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn isprint
function first appeared in
.At v7 .
