.Sh NAME
.Nm isalpha ,
.Nm isalpha_l
.Nd alphabetic character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isalpha "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isalpha_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isalpha
and
.Fn isalpha_l
functions test for any character for which
.Xr isupper 3 ,
.Xr isupper_l 3
or
.Xr islower 3 ,
.Xr islower_l 3
is true.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__

.Pp
The
.Fn isalpha_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isalpha
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isalpha
and
.Fn isalpha_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswalpha
or
.Fn iswalpha_l
function should be used instead.

The
.Fn isalpha
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
The

function conforms to
