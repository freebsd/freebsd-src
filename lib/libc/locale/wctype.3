.In wctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn iswctype "wint_t wc" "wctype_t charclass"
.Ft wctype_t
.Fn wctype "const char *property"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wctype
function returns a value of type
.Vt wctype_t
which represents the requested wide character class and
may be used as the second argument for calls to
.Fn iswctype .
.Pp
The following character class names are recognised:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Li alnum" ".Li cntrl" ".Li ideogram" ".Li print" ".Li space"
.It Li "alnum	cntrl	ideogram	print	space	xdigit"

The
.Fn iswctype
function checks whether the wide character
.Fa wc
is in the character class
.Fa charclass .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn iswctype
function returns non-zero if and only if
.Fa wc
has the property described by
.Fa charclass ,
or
.Fa charclass
is zero.
.Pp
The
.Fn wctype
function returns 0 if
.Fa property
is invalid, otherwise it returns a value of type
.Vt wctype_t
that can be used in subsequent calls to
.Fn iswctype .

Reimplement
.Xr iswalpha 3
in terms of
.Fn iswctype
and
.Fn wctype :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int
myiswalpha(wint_t wc)
{
	return (iswctype(wc, wctype("alpha")));
