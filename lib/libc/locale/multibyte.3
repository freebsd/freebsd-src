.Sh NAME
.Nm multibyte
.Nd multibyte and wide character manipulation functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In limits.h
.In stdlib.h
.In wchar.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The basic elements of some written natural languages, such as Chinese,
cannot be represented uniquely with single C
.Vt char Ns s .
The C standard supports two different ways of dealing with
extended natural language encodings:
wide characters and
multibyte characters.
Wide characters are an internal representation
which allows each basic element to map
to a single object of type
.Vt wchar_t .
Multibyte characters are used for input and output
and code each basic element as a sequence of C
.Vt char Ns s .
Individual basic elements may map into one or more
(up to
.Dv MB_LEN_MAX )
bytes in a multibyte character.
.Pp
The current locale
.Pq Xr setlocale 3
governs the interpretation of wide and multibyte characters.
The locale category
.Dv LC_CTYPE
specifically controls this interpretation.
The
.Vt wchar_t
type is wide enough to hold the largest value
in the wide character representations for all locales.
.Pp
Multibyte strings may contain
.Sq shift
indicators to switch to and from
particular modes within the given representation.
If explicit bytes are used to signal shifting,
these are not recognized as separate characters
but are lumped with a neighboring character.
There is always a distinguished
.Sq initial
shift state.
Some functions (e.g.,
.Xr mblen 3 ,
.Xr mbtowc 3
and
.Xr wctomb 3 )
maintain static shift state internally, whereas
others store it in an
.Vt mbstate_t
object passed by the caller.
Shift states are undefined after a call to
.Xr setlocale 3
with the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
or
.Dv LC_ALL
categories.
.Pp
For convenience in processing,
the wide character with value 0
(the null wide character)
is recognized as the wide character string terminator,
and the character with value 0
(the null byte)
is recognized as the multibyte character string terminator.
Null bytes are not permitted within multibyte characters.
.Pp
The C library provides the following functions for dealing with
multibyte characters:
.Bl -column "Description"
.It Sy "Function	Description"
.It Xr mblen 3 Ta "get number of bytes in a character"
.It Xr mbrlen 3 Ta "get number of bytes in a character (restartable)"
.It Xr mbrtowc 3 Ta "convert a character to a wide-character code (restartable)"
.It Xr mbsrtowcs 3 Ta "convert a character string to a wide-character string (restartable)"
.It Xr mbstowcs 3 Ta "convert a character string to a wide-character string"
.It Xr mbtowc 3 Ta "convert a character to a wide-character code"
.It Xr wcrtomb 3 Ta "convert a wide-character code to a character (restartable)"
.It Xr wcstombs 3 Ta "convert a wide-character string to a character string"
.It Xr wcsrtombs 3 Ta "convert a wide-character string to a character string (restartable)"
.It Xr wctomb 3 Ta "convert a wide-character code to a character"
