.Sh NAME
.Nm isrune ,
.Nm isrune_l
.Nd valid character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isrune "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isrune_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isrune
and
.Fn isrune_l
functions test for any character that is valid in the current
character set.
In the
.Tn ASCII
character set, this is equivalent to
.Fn isascii .
.Pp
The
.Fn isrune_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isrune
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isrune
and
.Fn isrune_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswrune
or
.Fn iswrune_l
function should be used instead.
