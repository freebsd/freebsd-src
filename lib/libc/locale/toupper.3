.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm toupper ,
.Nm toupper_l
.Nd lower case to upper case letter conversion
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn toupper "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn toupper_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn toupper
and
.Fn toupper_l
functions convert a lower-case letter to the corresponding
upper-case letter.
The argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
The
.Fn toupper_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn toupper
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the argument is a lower-case letter, the
.Fn toupper
and
.Fn toupper_l
functions return the corresponding upper-case letter if there is
one; otherwise, the argument is returned unchanged.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn towupper
or
.Fn towupper_l
function should be used instead.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn toupper
function conforms to
