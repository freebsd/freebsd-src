.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm querylocale
.Nd Look up the locale name or version for a specified category
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In locale.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn querylocale "int mask" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Returns the name or version of the locale for the category specified by
.Fa mask .
The possible values for the mask are the same as those in
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
when requesting the locale name.
Specify the bitwise OR of
.Fa LC_VERSION_MASK
and another mask value to request a version string.
Version strings can be compared to detect changes to the locale's definition.
The structure of the version string is unspecified.
Currently, version information is only available for
.Fa LC_COLLATE_MASK ,
and an empty string is returned for other categories.
If more than one bit in the mask is set, not counting
.Fa LC_VERSION_MASK ,
the returned value is undefined.

.Fn querylocale
function first appeared in
