.Dt EVENTFD 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm eventfd
.Nd create a file descriptor for event notification
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/eventfd.h
.Ft int
.Fn eventfd "unsigned int initval" "int flags"
.Ft int
.Fn eventfd_read "int fd" "eventfd_t *value"
.Ft int
.Fn eventfd_write "int fd" "eventfd_t value"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn eventfd
creates a special file descriptor with event counter or semaphore semantics,
designed for interprocess communication.
The returned file descriptor refers to a kernel object containing an
unsigned 64-bit integer counter, which is initialized with the value of the
.Fa initval
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may contain the result of
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "EFD_SEMAPHORE" -compact
.It Dv EFD_CLOEXEC
set FD_CLOEXEC on the file descriptor
.It Dv EFD_NONBLOCK
do not block on read/write operations
.It Dv EFD_SEMAPHORE
use semaphore semantics
.El
.Pp
File operations have the following semantics:
.Bl -tag -width EFD_SEMAPHORE
.It Xr read 2
If the counter is zero, the call blocks until the counter becomes non-zero, unless
.Dv EFD_NONBLOCK
was set, in which case it would fail with
.Dv EAGAIN
instead.
.Pp
If the counter is non-zero:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If
.Dv EFD_SEMAPHORE
is not set, the current value of the counter is returned,
and the value is reset to zero.
.It
If
.Dv EFD_SEMAPHORE
is set, the constant 1 is returned, and the value is decremented by 1.
.El
.Pp
The numeric value is encoded as 64-bit (8 bytes) in host byte order.
The
.Xr read 2
call fails with
.Dv EINVAL
if there is less than 8 bytes available in the supplied buffer.
.It Xr write 2
Adds the given value to the counter.
The maximum value that can be stored in the counter is the
maximum unsigned 64-bit integer value minus one (0xfffffffffffffffe).
.Pp
If the resulting value exceeds the maximum, the call would block
until the value is reduced by
.Xr read 2 ,
unless
.Dv EFD_NONBLOCK
was set, in which case it would fail with
.Dv EAGAIN
instead.
.Pp
The numeric value is encoded as 64-bit (8 bytes) in host byte order.
The
.Xr write 2
call fails with
.Dv EINVAL
if there is less than 8 bytes available in the supplied buffer,
or if the value 0xffffffffffffffff is given.
.It Xr poll 2
When receiving notifications via
.Xr poll 2 /
.Xr ppoll 2 /
.Xr select 2 /
.Xr pselect 2 /
.Xr kqueue 2 ,
the following semantics apply:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The file descriptor is readable when the counter is greater than zero.
.It
The file descriptor is writable when the counter is less than the maximum value.
.El
.El
.Pp
File descriptors created by
.Fn eventfd
are passable to other processes via
.Xr sendmsg 2
and are preserved across
.Xr fork 2 ;
in both cases the descriptors refer to the same counter from both processes.
Unless
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
flag was specified,
the created file descriptor will remain open across
.Xr execve 2
system calls; see
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr fcntl 2
and
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
description.
.Pp
.Fn eventfd_read
and
.Fn eventfd_write
are thin wrappers around
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls,
provided for compatibility with glibc.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn eventfd
returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns \-1 on failure, and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn eventfd_read
and
.Fn eventfd_write
functions return 0 if the operation succeeded, -1 otherwise.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn eventfd
may fail with:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa flags
argument given to
.Fn eventfd
has unknown bits set.
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The process has already reached its limit for open
file descriptors.
.It Bq Er ENFILE
The system file table is full.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
No memory was available to create the kernel object.
.El

.Xr kqueue 2 ,

.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr write 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn eventfd
system call is non-standard.
It is present in Linux.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn eventfd
system call first appeared in
.Fx 13.0 .
