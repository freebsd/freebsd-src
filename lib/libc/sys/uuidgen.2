.Dt UUIDGEN 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uuidgen
.Nd generate universally unique identifiers
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/uuid.h
.Ft int
.Fn uuidgen "uuid_t *store" "int count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
system call generates
.Fa count
universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) and writes them to the buffer
pointed to by
.Fa store .
The identifiers are generated according to the syntax and semantics of the
DCE version 1 variant of universally unique identifiers. When no IEEE 802
address is available for the node field a random multicast address is
generated for each call.
.Pp
When multiple identifiers are requested, the
.Nm
system call will generate identifiers that are adjacent in time.
.Pp
Universally unique identifiers, also known as globally unique identifiers,
are normally represented as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
63d81915-7140-11d6-903d-00022d09712b
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Nm
system call can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The buffer pointed to by
.Fa store
could not be written to for any or all identifiers.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa count
parameter is less than 1 or larger than the hard upper limit of 2048.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
system call first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
