.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm abort2
.Nd abort process with diagnostics.
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void
.Fo abort2
.Fa "char *why"
.Fa "int argc"
.Fa "void **args"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn abort2
function causes the process to be killed and the specified diagnostic
message (with arguments) is delivered by the kernel to the 
.Xr syslogd 8
daemon.
.Pp
.Fa why
is NULL-terminated string containing reason of program termination (max 128 char long).
.Fa args
contains pointers which will be logged numerically (kernels '%p'
.Xr printf 9
format).
.Fa nargs
is number of pointers in
.Fa args ,
(max 16).
.Pp
.Fn abort2
is intended for use in situations where continuation of the process 
is impossible or for other definitive reasons unwanted, and normal
diagnostic channels cannot be trusted to deliver the message.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -compact
#include <stdlib.h>

if (weight_kg > max_load) {
	void *ptrs[3];

	ptrs[0] = (void*)weight_kg;
	ptrs[1] = (void *)max_load;
	ptrs[2] = haystack;
	abort2("Camel overloaded", 3, ptrs);
}
