.Dt STAT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm stat ,
.Nm lstat ,
.Nm fstat
.Nd get file status
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn stat "const char *path" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn lstat "const char *path" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstat "int fd" "struct stat *sb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stat
function obtains information about the file pointed to by
.Fa path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be searchable.
.Pp
.Fn Lstat
is like
.Fn stat
except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.Fn lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.Fn stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.Pp
The
.Fn fstat
obtains the same information about an open file
known by the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fa sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Fn stat
structure
as defined by
.Aq Pa sys/stat.h
(shown below)
and into which information is placed concerning the file.
.Bd -literal

The time-related fields of
.Fa struct stat
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXst_mtime
.It st_atime
Time when file data last accessed.
Changed by the
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2
and
.Xr read 2
system calls.
.It st_mtime
Time when file data last modified.
Changed by the
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls.
.It st_ctime
Time when file status was last changed (inode data modification).
Changed by the
.Xr chmod 2 ,
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr link 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr rename 2 ,
.Xr unlink 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls.
.El
.Pp
If
.Dv _POSIX_SOURCE
is not defined, the time-related fields are defined as:
.Bd -literal
#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE
#define st_atime st_atimespec.tv_sec
#define st_mtime st_mtimespec.tv_sec
#define st_ctime st_ctimespec.tv_sec
#endif
.Ed
.Pp
The size-related fields of the
.Fa struct stat
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXst_blksize
.It st_blksize
The optimal I/O block size for the file.
.It st_blocks
The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte units.
As short symbolic links are stored in the inode, this number may
be zero.

The status information word
.Fa st_mode
has the following bits:

Previous versions of the system used different types for the
.Li st_dev ,
.Li st_uid ,
.Li st_gid ,
.Li st_rdev ,
.Li st_size ,
.Li st_blksize
and
.Li st_blocks

A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG

or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT

Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa sb
or
.Em name
points to an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Er
.Fn Fstat
will fail if:
.It Bq Er EBADF

.Sh BUGS
Applying
.Fn fstat
to a socket (and thus to a pipe)
returns a zeroed buffer,
except for the blocksize field,
and a unique device and inode number.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn stat
and
.Fn fstat
function calls are expected to conform to
.St -p1003.1-90 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn stat
and a
.Fn fstat
function call appeared in
.At v7 .
A
.Fn lstat
function call appeared in
