.Sh NAME
.Nm stat ,
.Nm lstat ,
.Nm fstat
.Nd get file status
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn stat "const char *path" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn lstat "const char *path" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstat "int fd" "struct stat *sb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stat
system call obtains information about the file pointed to by
.Fa path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be searchable.
.Pp
The
.Fn lstat
system call is like
.Fn stat
except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.Fn lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.Fn stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.Pp
The
.Fn fstat
system call obtains the same information about an open file
known by the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fa sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Vt stat
structure
as defined by
.In sys/stat.h
and into which information is placed concerning the file.
.Pp
The fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
related to the file system are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_nlink"
.It Va st_dev
The numeric ID of the device containing the file.
.It Va st_ino
The file's inode number.
.It Va st_nlink
The number of hard links to the file.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va st_dev
and
.Va st_ino
fields together identify the file uniquely within the system.
.Pp
The time-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_birthtime"
.It Va st_atime
Time when file data last accessed.
Changed by the
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr readv 2
system calls.
.It Va st_mtime
Time when file data last modified.
Changed by the
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr write 2
and
.Xr writev 2
system calls.
.It Va st_ctime
Time when file status was last changed (inode data modification).
Changed by the
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr chmod 2 ,
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr creat 2 ,
.Xr link 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr rename 2 ,
.Xr rmdir 2 ,
.Xr symlink 2 ,
.Xr truncate 2 ,
.Xr unlink 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr write 2
and
.Xr writev 2
system calls.
.It Va st_birthtime
Time when the inode was created.
.El
.Pp
If
.Dv _POSIX_SOURCE
is not defined, the time-related fields are defined as:
.Bd -literal
#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE
#define st_atime st_atimespec.tv_sec
#define st_mtime st_mtimespec.tv_sec
#define st_ctime st_ctimespec.tv_sec
#endif
.Ed
.Pp
The size-related fields of the
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_blksize"
.It Va st_size
The file size in bytes.
.It Va st_blksize
The optimal I/O block size for the file.
.It Va st_blocks
The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte units.
As short symbolic links are stored in the inode, this number may
be zero.
.El
.Pp
The access-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_mode"
.It Va st_uid
The user ID of the file's owner.
.It Va st_gid
The group ID of the file.
.It Va st_mode
Status of the file (see below).
.El
.Pp
The status information word
.Fa st_mode
has the following bits:
.Bd -literal
#define S_IFMT   0170000  /* type of file */
#define S_IFIFO  0010000  /* named pipe (fifo) */
#define S_IFCHR  0020000  /* character special */
#define S_IFDIR  0040000  /* directory */
#define S_IFBLK  0060000  /* block special */
#define S_IFREG  0100000  /* regular */
#define S_IFLNK  0120000  /* symbolic link */
#define S_IFSOCK 0140000  /* socket */
#define S_IFWHT  0160000  /* whiteout */
#define S_ISUID  0004000  /* set user id on execution */
#define S_ISGID  0002000  /* set group id on execution */
#define S_ISVTX  0001000  /* save swapped text even after use */
#define S_IRUSR  0000400  /* read permission, owner */
#define S_IWUSR  0000200  /* write permission, owner */
#define S_IXUSR  0000100  /* execute/search permission, owner */

.Pp
For a list of access modes, see
.In sys/stat.h ,
.Xr access 2
and
.Xr chmod 2 .
The following macros are available to test whether a
.Va st_mode
value passed in the
.Fa m
argument corresponds to a file of the specified type:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fn S_ISFIFO m"
.It Fn S_ISBLK m
Test for a block special file.
.It Fn S_ISCHR m
Test for a character special file.
.It Fn S_ISDIR m
Test for a directory.
.It Fn S_ISFIFO m
Test for a pipe or FIFO special file.
.It Fn S_ISLNK m
Test for a symbolic link.
.It Fn S_ISREG m
Test for a regular file.
.It Fn S_ISSOCK m
Test for a socket.
.It Fn S_ISWHT m
Test for a whiteout.
.El
.Pp
The macros evaluate to a non-zero value if the test is true
or to the value 0 if the test is false.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Previous versions of the system used different types for the
.Va st_dev ,
.Va st_uid ,
.Va st_gid ,
.Va st_rdev ,
.Va st_size ,
.Va st_blksize
and
.Va st_blocks
fields.

system call will fail if:
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa sb
argument
points to an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn stat
and
.Fn fstat
system calls are expected to conform to
.St -p1003.1-90 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn stat
and
.Fn fstat
system calls appeared in
.At v7 .
The
.Fn lstat
system call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Applying
.Fn fstat
to a socket (and thus to a pipe)
returns a zeroed buffer,
except for the blocksize field,
and a unique device and inode number.
