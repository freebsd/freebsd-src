.Dt CHMOD 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chmod ,
.Nm fchmod ,
.Nm lchmod
.Nd change mode of file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/stat.h>
.Ft int
.Fn chmod "const char *path" "mode_t mode"
.Ft int
.Fn fchmod "int fd" "mode_t mode"
.Ft int
.Fn lchmod "const char *path" "mode_t mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file permission bits of the file named specified by
.Fa path
or referenced by the file descriptor
.Fa fd
are changed to
.Fa mode .
The
.Fn chmod
function verifies that the process owner (user) either owns
the file specified by
.Fa path
(or
.Fa fd ) ,
or
is the super-user.
The
.Fn chmod
function follows symbolic links to operate on the target of the link
rather than the link itself.
.Pp
The
.Fa lchmod
function is similar to
.Fn chmod
but does not follow symbolic links.
.Pp
A mode is created from
.Em or'd
permission bit masks
defined in
.Aq Pa sys/stat.h :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
#define S_IRWXU 0000700    /* RWX mask for owner */
#define S_IRUSR 0000400    /* R for owner */
#define S_IWUSR 0000200    /* W for owner */
#define S_IXUSR 0000100    /* X for owner */

#define S_IRWXG 0000070    /* RWX mask for group */
#define S_IRGRP 0000040    /* R for group */
#define S_IWGRP 0000020    /* W for group */
#define S_IXGRP 0000010    /* X for group */

#define S_IRWXO 0000007    /* RWX mask for other */
#define S_IROTH 0000004    /* R for other */
#define S_IWOTH 0000002    /* W for other */
#define S_IXOTH 0000001    /* X for other */

#define S_ISUID 0004000    /* set user id on execution */
#define S_ISGID 0002000    /* set group id on execution */
#define S_ISVTX 0001000    /* sticky bit */
#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE
#define S_ISTXT 0001000
#endif
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fx
VM system totally ignores the sticky bit
.Pq Dv ISVTX
for executables.
On UFS-based filesystems (FFS, MFS, LFS) the sticky
bit may only be set upon directories.
.Pp
If mode
.Dv ISVTX
(the `sticky bit') is set on a directory,
an unprivileged user may not delete or rename
files of other users in that directory.
The sticky bit may be
set by any user on a directory which the user owns or has appropriate
permissions.
For more details of the properties of the sticky bit, see
.Xr sticky 8 .
.Pp
If mode ISUID (set UID) is set on a directory,
and the MNT_SUIDDIR option was used in the mount of the filesystem,
then the owner of any new files and sub-directories
created within this directory are set
to be the same as the owner of that directory.
If this function is enabled, new directories will inherit
the bit from their parents.  Execute bits are removed from
the file, and it will not be given to root.
This behavior does not change the
requirements for the user to be allowed to write the file, but only the eventual
owner after it has been created.
Group inheritance is not effected.
.Pp
This feature is designed for use on fileservers serving PC users via
ftp, SAMBA, or netatalk.
It provides security holes for shell users and as
such should not be used on shell machines, especially on home directories.
This option requires the SUIDDIR
option in the kernel to work.
Only UFS filesystems support this option.
For more details of the suiddir mount option, see
.Xr mount 8 .
.Pp
Writing or changing the owner of a file
turns off the set-user-id and set-group-id bits
unless the user is the super-user.
This makes the system somewhat more secure
by protecting set-user-id (set-group-id) files
from remaining set-user-id (set-group-id) if they are modified,
at the expense of a degree of compatibility.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Chmod
will fail and the file mode will be unchanged if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file and
the effective user ID is not the super-user.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa Path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.It Bq Er EFTYPE
An attempt was made to set the sticky bit upon an executable.
.El
.Pp
.Fn Fchmod
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The descriptor is not valid.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa fd
refers to a socket, not to a file.
.It Bq Er EROFS
