.Dt CAP_NEW 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_new ,
.Nm cap_getrights
.Nd System calls to manipulate capabilities
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/capability.h
.Ft int
.Fn cap_new "int fd" "cap_rights_t rights"
.Ft int
.Fn cap_getrights "int fd" "cap_rights_t *rightsp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Capabilities are special file descriptors derived from an existing file
descriptor, such as one returned by
.Xr fhopen 2 ,
.Xr kqueue 2 ,
.Xr mq_open 2 ,
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr pipe 2 ,
.Xr shm_open 2 ,
.Xr socket 2 ,
or
.Xr socketpair 2 ,
but with a restricted set of permitted operations determined by a rights
mask set when the capability is created.
These restricted rights cannot be changed after the capability is created,
although further capabilities with yet more restricted rights may be created
from an existing capability.
In every other sense, a capability behaves in the same way as the file
descriptor it was created from.
.Pp
.Fn cap_new
creates a new capability for the existing file descriptor
.Fa fd ,
and returns a file descriptor for it.
Operations on the capability will be limited to those permitted by
.Fa rights ,
which is static for the lifetime of the capability.
If
.Fa fd
refers to an existing capability, then
.Fa rights
must be equal to or a subset of the rights on that capability.
As with
.Xr dup 2
and
.Xr dup2 2 ,
many properties are shared between the new capability and the existing file
descriptor, including open file flags, blocking disposition, and file offset.
Many applications will prefer to use the
.Xr cap_limitfd 3
library call, part of
.Xr libcapsicum 3 ,
as it offers a more convenient interface.
.Pp
.Fn cap_getrights
queries the rights associated with the capability referred to by file
descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
These system calls, when combined with
.Xr cap_enter 2 ,
may be used to construct process sandboxes with highly granular rights
assignment.
.Sh RIGHTS
The following rights may be specified in a new capability rights mask:
.Bl -tag -width CAP_EXTATTR_DELETE
.It Dv CAP_ACCEPT
Permit
.Xr accept 2 .
.It Dv CAP_ACL_CHECK
Permit checking of an ACL on a file descriptor; there is no cross-reference
for this system call.
.It Dv CAP_ACL_DELETE
Permit
.Xr acl_delete_fd_np 2 .
.It Dv CAP_ACL_GET
Permit
.Xr acl_get_fd 2
and
.Xr acl_get_fd_np 2 .
.It Dv CAP_ACL_SET
Permit
.Xr acl_set_fd 2
and
.Xr acl_set_fd_np 2 .
.It Dv CAP_BIND
Permit
.Xr bind 2 .
Note that sockets can also become bound implicitly as a result of
.Xr connect 2
or
.Xr send 2 ,
and that socket options set with
.Xr setsockopt 2
may also affect binding behavior.
.It Dv CAP_CONNECT
Permit
.Xr connect 2 ;
also required for
.Xr sendto 2
with a non-NULL destination address.
.It Dv CAP_EVENT
Permit
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
and
.Xr kevent 2
to be used in monitoring the file descriptor for events.
.It Dv CAP_FEXECVE
Permit
.Xr fexecve 2 ;
.Dv CAP_READ
will also be required.
.It Dv CAP_EXTATTR_DELETE
Permit
.Xr extattr_delete_fd 2 .
.It Dv CAP_EXTATTR_GET
Permit
.Xr extattr_get_fd 2 .
.It Dv CAP_EXTATTR_LIST

Permit
.Xr flock 2
and related calls.
.It Dv CAP_FPATHCONF
Permit
.Xr fpathconf 2 .
.It Dv CAP_FSCK
Permit UFS background-fsck operations on the descriptor.
.It Dv CAP_FSTAT
Permit
.Xr fstat 2 .
.It Dv CAP_FSTATFS
Permit
.Xr fstatfs 2 .
.It Dv CAP_FSYNC
Permit
.Xr aio_fsync 2
and
.Xr fsync 2 .

Permit
.Xr futimes 2 .

Permit
.Xr getsockname 2 .
.It Dv CAP_GETSOCKOPT
Permit

.It Dv CAP_IOCTL
Permit
.Xr ioctl 2 .
Be aware that this system call has enormous scope, including potentially
global scope for some objects.
.It Dv CAP_KEVENT
Permit
.Xr kevent 2 ;
.Dv CAP_EVENT
is also required on file descriptors that will be monitored using
.Xr kevent 2 .
.It Dv CAP_LISTEN
Permit
.Xr listen 2 ;
not much use (generally) without
.Dv CAP_BIND .
.It Dv CAP_LOOKUP
Permit the file descriptor to be used as a starting directory for calls such
as
.Xr linkat 2 ,
.Xr openat 2 ,
and
.Xr unlinkat 2 .
Note that these calls are not available in capability mode as they manipulate
a global name space; see
.Xr cap_enter 2
for details.
.It Dv CAP_MAC_GET
Permit
.Xr mac_get_fd 2 .
.It Dv CAP_MAC_SET
Permit
.Xr mac_set_fd 2 .
.It Dv CAP_MMAP
Permit
.Xr mmap 2 ;
specific invocations may also require
.Dv CAP_READ
or
.Dv CAP_WRITE .
.Pp
.It Dv CAP_PDGETPID
Permit
.Xr pdgetpid 2 .
.It Dv CAP_PDKILL
Permit
.Xr pdkill 2 .
.It Dv CAP_PDWAIT
Permit
.Xr pdwait 2 .

Permit
.Xr sctp_peeloff 2 .
.It Dv CAP_READ
Allow
.Xr aio_read 2 ,
.Xr pread 2 ,
.Xr read 2 ,

and related system calls.
.Pp
For files and other seekable objects,
.Dv CAP_SEEK
may also be required.
.It Dv CAP_REVOKE
Permit
.Xr frevoke 2
in certain ABI compatibility modes that support this system call.
.It Dv CAP_SEEK
Permit operations that seek on the file descriptor, such as
.Xr lseek 2 ,
but also required for I/O system calls that modify the file offset, such as
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2 .
.It Dv CAP_SEM_GETVALUE
Permit
.Xr sem_getvalue 3 .
.It Dv CAP_SEM_POST
Permit
.Xr sem_post 3 .
.It Dv CAP_SEM_WAIT
Permit
.Xr sem_wait 3
and
.Xr sem_trywait 3 .
.It Dv CAP_SETSOCKOPT
Permit
.Xr setsockopt 2 ;
this controls various aspects of socket behavior and may affect binding,
connecting, and other behaviors with global scope.
.It Dv CAP_SHUTDOWN
Permit explicit
.Xr shutdown 2 ;
closing the socket will also generally shut down any connections on it.
.It Dv CAP_TTYHOOK
Allow configuration of TTY hooks, such as
.Xr snp 4 ,
on the file descriptor.
.It Dv CAP_WRITE
Allow
.Xr aio_write 2 ,
.Xr pwrite 2 ,
.Xr send 2 ,
.Xr sendmsg 2 ,
.Xr sendto 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
and related system calls.
.Pp
For files and other seekable objects,
.Dv CAP_SEEK
may also be required.
.Pp
For
.Xr sendto 2
with a non-NULL connection address,
.Dv CAP_CONNECT
is also required.
.El
.Sh CAVEAT
The
.Fn cap_new
system call and the capabilities it creates may be used to assign
fine-grained rights to sandboxed processes running in capability mode.
However, the semantics of objects accessed via file descriptors are complex,
so caution should be exercised in passing object capabilities into sandboxes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn cap_new
returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns -1 on failure, and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Rv -std cap_getrights
.Sh ERRORS

may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er

.Fa fd

.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid right has been requested in
.Fa rights .
.It Bq Er EMFILE

.It Bq Er ENFILE

.It Bq Er EPERM
.Fa rights

with the capability referenced by
.Fa fd ,
if any.
.El
.Pp
.Fn cap_getrights
may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er

The
.Fa fd

.Sh HISTORY
Support for capabilities and capabilities mode was developed as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
.Sh BUGS
This man page should list the set of permitted system calls more specifically
for each capability right.
.Pp
Capability rights sometimes have unclear indirect impacts, which should be
documented, or at least hinted at.
.Sh AUTHORS
These functions and the capability facility were created by
