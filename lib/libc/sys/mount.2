.Sh NAME
.Nm mount ,
.Nm unmount
.Nd mount or dismount a filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn mount "int type" "const char *dir" "int flags" "caddr_t data"
.Ft int
.Fn unmount "const char *dir" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mount
function grafts
a filesystem object onto the system file tree
at the point
.Ar dir .
The argument
.Ar data
describes the filesystem object to be mounted.
The argument
.Ar type
tells the kernel how to interpret
.Ar data
(See
.Ar type
below).
The contents of the filesystem
become available through the new mount point
.Ar dir .
Any files in
.Ar dir
at the time
of a successful mount are swept under the carpet so to speak, and
are unavailable until the filesystem is unmounted.
.Pp
The following
.Ar flags
may be specified to
suppress default semantics which affect filesystem access.
.Bl -tag -width MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv MNT_RDONLY
The filesystem should be treated as read-only;
Even the super-user may not write on it.
.It Dv MNT_NOEXEC
Do not allow files to be executed from the filesystem.
.It Dv MNT_NOSUID
Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when executing them.
.It Dv MNT_NOATIME
Disable update of file access times.
.It Dv MNT_NODEV
Do not interpret special files on the filesystem.
.It Dv MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.
.It Dv MNT_ASYNC
All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.
.It Dv MNT_WANTRDWR
Upgrade a mounted read-only filesystem to read-write if MNT_UPDATE
is also specified.
.It Dv MNT_FORCE
Fore a read-write mount even if the filesystem appears to be unclean.
Dangerous.
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_UPDATE
indicates that the mount command is being applied 
to an already mounted filesystem.
This allows the mount flags to be changed without requiring
that the filesystem be unmounted and remounted.
Some filesystems may not allow all flags to be changed.
For example,
many filesystems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_RELOAD
causes the vfs subsystem to update its data structures pertaining to
the specified already mounted filesystem.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument defines the type of the filesystem.
The types of filesystems known to the system are defined in
.Aq Pa sys/mount.h .
.Fa Data
is a pointer to a structure that contains the type
specific arguments to mount.
The currently supported types of filesystems and
their type specific data are:

.Pp
The
.Fn umount
function call disassociates the filesystem from the specified
mount point
.Fa dir .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may specify
.Dv MNT_FORCE
to specify that the filesystem should be forcibly unmounted or made read-only
(if MNT_UPDATE and MNT_RDONLY are also specified)
even if files are still active.
Active special devices continue to work,
but any further accesses to any other active files result in errors
even if the filesystem is later remounted.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mount
returns the value 0 if the mount was successful, otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn umount
function returns the value 0 if the umount succeeded; otherwise -1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS

.Fn mount
function will fail when one of the following occurs:
