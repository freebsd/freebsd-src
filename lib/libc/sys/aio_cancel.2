.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <aio.h>
.Ft int
.Fn aio_cancel "int fildes" "struct aiocb * iocb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn aio_cancel
function cancels the outstanding asynchronous
I/O request for the file descriptor specified in
.Fa fildes .
If
.Fa iocb
is specified, only that specific asynchronous I/O request is cancelled.
.Pp
Normal asynchronous notification occurs for cancelled requests.  Requests
complete with an error result of
.Dv ECANCELED .
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
The
.Fn aio_cancel
function does not cancel asynchronous I/O requests for raw disk devices.  The
.Fn aio_cancel
function will always return
.Dv AIO_NOTCANCELED
for file descriptors associated with raw disk devices.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn aio_cancel
function returns -1 to indicate an error, or one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Dv
.It Bq Dv AIO_CANCELED
All outstanding requests meeting the criteria specified were cancelled.
.It Bq Dv AIO_NOTCANCELED
Some requests were not cancelled, status for the requests should be
checked with
.Xr aio_error 2 .
.It Bq Dv AIO_ALLDONE
All of the requests meeting the criteria have finished.

.Fn aio_cancel
function is expected to conform to the
.St -p1003.2
standard.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn aio_cancel
function first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
The first functional implemenation of
.Fn aio_cancel
appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
