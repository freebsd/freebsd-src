.Sh NAME
.Nm fspacectl
.Nd space management in a file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fo fspacectl
.Fa "int fd"
.Fa "int cmd"
.Fa "const struct spacectl_range *rqsr"
.Fa "int flags"
.Fa "struct spacectl_range *rmsr"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a system call performing space management over a file.
The
.Fa fd
argument specifies the file descriptor to be operated on by the
.Fa cmd
argument.
The
.Fa rqsr
argument points to a
.Fa spacectl_range
structure that contains the requested operation range.
The
.Fa flags
argument controls the behavior of the operation to take place.
If the
.Fa rmsr
argument is non-NULL, the
.Fa spacectl_range
structure it points to is updated to contain the unprocessed operation range
after the system call returns.
.Pp
For a successful completion without an unprocessed part in the requested
operation range,
.Fa "rmsr->r_len"
is updated to be the value 0, and
.Fa "rmsr->r_offset"
is updated to be
.Fa "rqsr->r_offset"
plus the number of bytes zeroed before the end-of-file.
The file descriptor's file offset is not used or modified by the system call.
Both
.Fa rqsr
and
.Fa rmsr
arguments can point to the same structure.
.Pp
The
.Fa spacectl_range
structure is defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct spacectl_range {
	off_t r_offset;
	off_t r_len;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The operation specified by the
.Fa cmd
argument may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width SPACECTL_DEALLOC
.It Dv SPACECTL_DEALLOC
Zero a region in the file specified by the
.Fa rqsr
argument.
The
.Fa "rqsr->r_offset"
has to be a value greater than or equal to 0, and the
.Fa "rqsr->r_len"
has to be a value greater than 0.
.Pp
If the file system supports hole-punching,
file system space deallocation may be performed in the given region.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument needs to be the value 0 currently.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
Possible failure conditions:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument references a file that was opened without write permission.
.It Bq Er EINTR
A signal was caught during execution.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa cmd
argument is not valid.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
If the
.Fa cmd
argument is
.Dv SPACECTL_DEALLOC ,
either the
.Fa "rqsr->r_offset"
argument was less than zero, or the
.Fa "rqsr->r_len"
argument was less than or equal to zero.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of
.Fa "rqsr->r_offset" +
.Fa "rqsr->r_len"
is greater than
.Dv OFF_MAX .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid or unsupported flag is included in
.Fa flags .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A flag included in
.Fa flags
is not supported by the operation specified by the
.Fa cmd
argument.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa rqsr
or a non-NULL
.Fa rmsr
argument point outside the process' allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.
.It Bq Er EINTEGRITY
Corrupted data was detected while reading from the file system.
.It Bq Er ENODEV
The
.Fa fd
argument does not refer to a file that supports
.Nm .
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
There is insufficient free space remaining on the file system storage
media.
.It Bq Er ENOTCAPABLE
The file descriptor
.Fa fd
has insufficient rights.
.It Bq Er ESPIPE
The
.Fa fd
argument is associated with a pipe or FIFO.
