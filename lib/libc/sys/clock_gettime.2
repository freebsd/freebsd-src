.Dt CLOCK_GETTIME 2
.Os BSD 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm clock_gettime ,
.Nm clock_settime ,
.Nm clock_getres
.Nd get/set/calibrate date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/time.h>
.Ft int
.Fn clock_gettime "clockid_t clock_id" "struct timespec *tp"
.Ft int
.Fn clock_settime "clockid_t clock_id" "const struct timespec *tp"
.Ft int
.Fn clock_getres "clockid_t clock_id" "struct timespec *tp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn clock_gettime
and
.Fn clock_settime
allow the calling process to retrieve or set the value used by a clock
which is specifed by
.Fa clock_id .
.Pp
.Fa clock_id
can be one of three values: CLOCK_REALTIME for time that increments as
a wall clock should, CLOCK_VIRTUAL for time that increments only when
the CPU is running in user mode on behalf of the calling process, or
CLOCK_PROF for time that increments when the CPU is running in user or
kernel mode.
.Pp
The structure pointed to by
.Fa tp
is defined in 
.Ao Pa sys/time.h Ac
as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
struct timespec {
	time_t	tv_sec;		/* seconds */
	long	tv_nsec;	/* and nanoseconds */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Only the super-user may set the time of day.
If the system securelevel is greater than 1 (see
.Xr init 8 ),
the time may only be advanced.
This limitation is imposed to prevent a malicious super-user
from setting arbitrary time stamps on files.
The system time can still be adjusted backwards using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call even when the system is secure.
.Pp
The resolution (granularity) of a clock is returned by the
.Fn clock_getres
call.  This value is placed in a (non-NULL)
.Fa *tp .
.Sh RETURN
A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded.
A -1 return value indicates an error occurred, and in this
case an error code is stored into the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width [EFAULT]
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa clock_id
was not a valid value.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa *tp
argument address referenced invalid memory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A user other than the super-user attempted to set the time.

.Xr adjtime 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn clock_gettime ,
etc.
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1b-93 .
