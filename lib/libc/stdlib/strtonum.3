.Dt STRTONUM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strtonum ,
.Nm strtonumx
.Nd "reliably convert string value to an integer"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft long long
.Fo strtonum
.Fa "const char *nptr"
.Fa "long long minval"
.Fa "long long maxval"
.Fa "const char **errstr"
.Fc
.Ft long long
.Fo strtonumx
.Fa "const char *nptr"
.Fa "long long minval"
.Fa "long long maxval"
.Fa "const char **errstr"
.Fa "int base"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strtonum
and
.Fn strtonumx
functions convert the string in
.Fa nptr
to a
.Vt "long long"
value.
These functions were designed to facilitate safe, robust programming and
overcome the shortcomings of the
.Xr atoi 3
and
.Xr strtol 3
family of interfaces.
.Pp
The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of whitespace
.Pq as determined by Xr isspace 3
followed by a single optional
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
sign.
.Pp
The remainder of the string is converted to a
.Vt "long long"
value according to base 10
.Pq for Fn strtonum
or the provided base
.Pq for Fn strtonumx .
.Pp
The value obtained is then checked against the provided
.Fa minval
and
.Fa maxval
bounds.
If
.Fa errstr
is non-null,
.Fn strtonum
and
.Fn strtonumx
store an error string in
.Fa *errstr
indicating the failure.
.Pp
For
.Fn strtonumx
the value of
.Ar base
is interpreted in the same way as described in
.Xr strtoll 3 .
In particular, if the value of
.Ar base
is 0, then the expected form of
.Ar nptr
is that of a decimal constant, octal constant or hexadecimal constant, any of
which may be preceded by a + or - sign.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strtonum
and
.Fn strtonumx
functions return the result of the conversion,
unless the value would exceed the provided bounds or is invalid.
On error, 0 is returned,
.Va errno
is set, and
.Fa errstr
will point to an error message.
On success,
.Fa *errstr
will be set to
.Dv NULL ;
this fact can be used to differentiate
a successful return of 0 from an error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Using
.Fn strtonum
and
.Fn strtonumx
correctly is meant to be simpler than the alternative functions.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int iterations;
const char *errstr;

iterations = strtonum(optarg, 1, 64, &errstr);
if (errstr != NULL)
	errx(1, "number of iterations is %s: %s", errstr, optarg);
.Ed
.Pp
The above example will guarantee that the value of iterations is between
1 and 64 (inclusive).
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The given string was out of range.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The given string did not consist solely of digit characters
.Pq for Fn strtonum ,
or characters which are valid in the given base
.Pq for Fn strtonumx .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The supplied
.Fa minval
was larger than
.Fa maxval .
.El
.Pp
If an error occurs,
.Fa errstr
will be set to one of the following strings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Li too large" -compact
.It Qq too large
The result was larger than the provided maximum value.
.It Qq too small
The result was smaller than the provided minimum value.
.It Qq invalid
The string did not consist solely of characters valid in the specified base
.Pq or base 10 for Fn strtonum .
.It Qq unparsable; invalid base specified
The specified base was outside the permitted range.

.Xr atoi 3 ,
.Xr atol 3 ,
.Xr atoll 3 ,
.Xr sscanf 3 ,
.Xr strtod 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strtonum
function is a
.Bx
extension.
The existing alternatives, such as
.Xr atoi 3
and
.Xr strtol 3 ,
are either impossible or difficult to use safely.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strtonum
function first appeared in
.Ox 3.6 .
The
.Fn strtonumx
function first appeared in illumos in 2023.
