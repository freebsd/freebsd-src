/*
 * C++11 introduces the thread_local scope (like __thread with some
 * additions).  As a key-feature it should support non-trivial
 * destructors, registered with __cxa_thread_atexit() to be executed
 * at the thread termination.
 *
 * The implemention keeps a _Thread_local list of destructors per each
 * thread, and calls __cxa_thread_call_dtors() on each thread's exit
 * to do cleanup.  For a thread calling exit(3), in particular, for
 * the initial thread returning from main(), we call
 * __cxa_thread_call_dtors() inside exit().
 *
 * It could be possible that a dynamically loaded library, use
 * thread_local variable but is dlclose()'d before thread exit.  The
 * destructor of this variable will then try to access the address,
 * for calling it but it's unloaded, so it'll crash.  We're using
 * __elf_phdr_match_addr() to detect and prevent such cases and so
 * prevent the crash.
