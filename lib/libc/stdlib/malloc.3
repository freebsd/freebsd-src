.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes of uninitialized memory.
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion)
for storage of any type of object.
.Pp
The
.Fn calloc
function allocates space for
.Fa number
objects,
each
.Fa size
bytes in length.
The result is identical to calling
.Fn malloc
with an argument of
.Dq "number * size" ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly initialized
to zero bytes.
.Pp
The
.Fn realloc
function changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
to
.Fa size
bytes.
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and
old sizes.
If the new size is larger,
the value of the newly allocated portion of the memory is undefined.
Upon success, the memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated memory is returned.
Note that
.Fn realloc
and
.Fn reallocf
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value than
.Fa ptr .
If
.Fa ptr
is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fn realloc
function behaves identically to
.Fn malloc
for the specified size.
.Pp
The
.Fn reallocf
function is identical to the
.Fn realloc
function, except that it
will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be allocated.
This is a
.Fx
specific API designed to ease the problems with traditional coding styles
for realloc causing memory leaks in libraries.
.Pp
The
.Fn free
function causes the allocated memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
to be made available for future allocations.
If
.Fa ptr
is
.Dv NULL ,
no action occurs.
.Sh TUNING
Once, when the first call is made to one of these memory allocation
routines, various flags will be set or reset, which affect the
workings of this allocation implementation.
.Pp
The ``name'' of the file referenced by the symbolic link named
.Pa /etc/malloc.conf ,
the value of the environment variable
.Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS ,
and the string pointed to by the global variable
.Va _malloc_options
will be interpreted, in that order, character by character as flags.
.Pp
Most flags are single letters,
where uppercase indicates that the behavior is set, or on,
and lowercase means that the behavior is not set, or off.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It A
All warnings (except for the warning about unknown
flags being set) become fatal.
The process will call
.Xr abort 3
in these cases.
.It C
Increase/decrease the size of the cache by a factor of two.
The default cache size is 256 objects for each arena.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It J
Each byte of new memory allocated by
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn realloc
or
.Fn reallocf
will be initialized to 0xa5.
All memory returned by
.Fn free ,
.Fn realloc
or
.Fn reallocf
will be initialized to 0x5a.
This is intended for debugging and will impact performance negatively.
.It K
Increase/decrease the virtual memory chunk size by a factor of two.
The default chunk size is 16 MB.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It N
Increase/decrease the number of arenas by a factor of two.
The default number of arenas is twice the number of CPUs, or one if there is a
single CPU.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It P
Various statistics are printed at program exit via an
.Xr atexit 3
function.
This has the potential to cause deadlock for a multi-threaded process that exits
while one or more threads are executing in the memory allocation functions.
Therefore, this option should only be used with care; it is primarily intended
as a performance tuning aid during application development.
.It Q
Increase/decrease the size of the allocation quantum by a factor of two.
The default quantum is the minimum allowed by the architecture (typically 8 or
16 bytes).
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It U
Generate
.Dq utrace
entries for
.Xr ktrace 1 ,
for all operations.
Consult the source for details on this option.
.It V
Attempting to allocate zero bytes will return a
.Dv NULL
pointer instead of
a valid pointer.
(The default behavior is to make a minimal allocation and return a
pointer to it.)
This option is provided for System V compatibility.
This option is incompatible with the
.Dq X
option.
.It X
Rather than return failure for any allocation function,
display a diagnostic message on
.Dv stderr
and cause the program to drop
core (using
.Xr abort 3 ) .
This option should be set at compile time by including the following in
the source code:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
_malloc_options = "X";
.Ed
.It Z
Each byte of new memory allocated by
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn realloc
or
.Fn reallocf
will be initialized to 0x0.
Note that this initialization only happens once for each byte, so
.Fn realloc
and
.Fn reallocf
calls do not zero memory that was previously allocated.
This is intended for debugging and will impact performance negatively.
.El
.Pp
The
.Dq J
and
.Dq Z
options are intended for testing and debugging.
An application which changes its behavior when these options are used
is flawed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn calloc
functions return a pointer to the allocated memory if successful; otherwise
a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM .
.Pp
The
.Fn realloc
and
.Fn reallocf
functions return a pointer, possibly identical to
.Fa ptr ,
to the allocated memory
if successful; otherwise a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM
if the error was the result of an allocation failure.
The
.Fn realloc
function always leaves the original buffer intact
when an error occurs, whereas
.Fn reallocf
deallocates it in this case.
.Pp
The
.Fn free
function returns no value.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This allocator uses multiple arenas in order to reduce lock contention for
threaded programs on multi-processor systems.
This works well with regard to threading scalability, but incurs some costs.
There is a small fixed per-arena overhead, and additionally, arenas manage
memory completely independently of each other, which means a small fixed
increase in overall memory fragmentation.
These overheads aren't generally an issue, given the number of arenas normally
used.
Note that using substantially more arenas than the default is not likely to
improve performance, mainly due to reduced cache performance.
However, it may make sense to reduce the number of arenas if an application
does not make much use of the allocation functions.
.Pp
This allocator uses a novel approach to object caching.
For objects below a size threshold (use the
.Dq P
option to discover the threshold), full deallocation and attempted coalescence
with adjacent memory regions are delayed.
This is so that if the application requests an allocation of that size soon
thereafter, the request can be met much more quickly.
Most applications heavily use a small number of object sizes, so this caching
has the potential to have a large positive performance impact.
However, the effectiveness of the cache depends on the cache being large enough
to absorb typical fluctuations in the number of allocated objects.
If an application routinely fluctuates by thousands of objects, then it may
make sense to increase the size of the cache.
Conversely, if an application's memory usage fluctuates very little, it may
make sense to reduce the size of the cache, so that unused regions can be
coalesced sooner.
.Pp
This allocator is very aggressive about tightly packing objects in memory, even
for objects much larger than the system page size.
For programs that allocate objects larger than half the system page size, this
has the potential to reduce memory footprint in comparison to other allocators.
However, it has some side effects that are important to keep in mind.
First, even multi-page objects can start at non-page-aligned addresses, since
the implementation only guarantees quantum alignment.
Second, this tight packing of objects can cause objects to share L1 cache
lines, which can be a performance issue for multi-threaded applications.
There are two ways to approach these issues.
First,
.Fn posix_memalign
provides the ability to align allocations as needed.
By aligning an allocation to at least the L1 cache line size, and padding the
allocation request by one cache line unit, the programmer can rest assured that
no cache line sharing will occur for the object.
Second, the
.Dq Q
option can be used to force all allocations to be aligned with the L1 cache
lines.
This approach should be used with care though, because although easy to
implement, it means that all allocations must be at least as large as the
quantum, which can cause severe internal fragmentation if the application
allocates many small objects.
.Sh DEBUGGING MALLOC PROBLEMS
The first thing to do is to set the
.Dq A
option.
This option forces a coredump (if possible) at the first sign of trouble,
rather than the normal policy of trying to continue if at all possible.
.Pp
It is probably also a good idea to recompile the program with suitable
options and symbols for debugger support.
.Pp
If the program starts to give unusual results, coredump or generally behave
differently without emitting any of the messages mentioned in the next
section, it is likely because it depends on the storage being filled with
zero bytes.
Try running it with the
.Dq Z
option set;
if that improves the situation, this diagnosis has been confirmed.
If the program still misbehaves,
the likely problem is accessing memory outside the allocated area.
.Pp
Alternatively, if the symptoms are not easy to reproduce, setting the
.Dq J
option may help provoke the problem.
.Pp
In truly difficult cases, the
.Dq U
option, if supported by the kernel, can provide a detailed trace of
all calls made to these functions.
.Pp
Unfortunately this implementation does not provide much detail about
the problems it detects; the performance impact for storing such information
would be prohibitive.
There are a number of allocation implementations available on the Internet
which focus on detecting and pinpointing problems by trading performance for
extra sanity checks and detailed diagnostics.
.Sh DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES
If any of the memory allocation/deallocation functions detect an error or
warning condition, a message will be printed to file descriptor STDERR_FILENO.
Errors will result in the process dumping core.
If the
.Dq A
option is set, all warnings are treated as errors.
.Pp
The
.Va _malloc_message
variable allows the programmer to override the function which emits
the text strings forming the errors and warnings if for some reason
the
.Dv stderr
file descriptor is not suitable for this.
Please note that doing anything which tries to allocate memory in
this function is likely to result in a crash or deadlock.
.Pp
All messages are prefixed by:
.Bl -diag
.It <progname>: (malloc)
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of the allocation
functions:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS"
.It Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS
If the environment variable
.Ev MALLOC_OPTIONS
is set, the characters it contains will be interpreted as flags to the
allocation functions.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To dump core whenever a problem occurs:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ln -s 'A' /etc/malloc.conf
.Ed
.Pp
To specify in the source that a program does no return value checking
on calls to these functions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
_malloc_options = "X";
