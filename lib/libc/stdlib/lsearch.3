.Sh NAME

.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In search.h
.Ft void *
.Fn lsearch "const void *key" "void *base" "size_t *nelp" "size_t width" \
    "int (*compar)(const void *, const void *)"
.Ft void *
.Fn lfind "const void *key" "const void *base" "size_t *nelp" "size_t width" \
    "int (*compar)(const void *, const void *)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Fn lsearch
and
.Fn lfind
functions walk linearly through an array and compare each element with
the one to be sought using a supplied comparison function.
.Pp
.Fa key
points to an element that matches the one that is searched.
The array's address in memory is denoted by the 
.Fa base
argument.
The width of one element (i.e. the size as returned by
.Fn sizeof )
is passed as the   
.Fa width 
argument.
The number of valid elements contained in the array (not the number of
elements the array has space reserved for) is given in the integer pointed
to by
.Fa nelp .
The
.Fa compar
argument points to a function which compares its two arguments and returns
zero if they are matching and non-zero otherwise.
.Pp
If no matching element was found in the array, 
.Fn lsearch 
copies
.Fa key
into the position after the last element and increments the
integer pointed to by
.Fa nelp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn lsearch
and
.Fn lfind
return a pointer to the first element found.
If no element was found,
.Fn lsearch
returns a pointer to the newly added element, whereas
.Fn lfind
returns
.Dv NULL .
Both functions return
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
