This alignment is a power of\~2, and may be larger than the range
supported by the
.Sy alignof
operator.
The value returned can be compared to the result of
.Sy alignof ,
and if it is greater or equal, the alignment requirement of the operand
is satisfied.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Fa ptr
as a power of\~2.
If
.Fa ptr
is a null pointer, an alignment of zero is returned.
An alignment of zero indicates that the tested pointer cannot be used to
access an object of any type.
