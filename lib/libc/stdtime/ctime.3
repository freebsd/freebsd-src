.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn ctime ,
.Fn gmtime
and
.Fn localtime
all take as an argument a time value representing the time in seconds since
the Epoch (00:00:00
.Tn UTC ,
January 1, 1970; see
.Xr time 3 ) .
.Pp
The function
.Fn localtime
converts the time value pointed at by
.Fa clock ,
and returns a pointer to a
.Dq Fa struct tm
(described below) which contains
the broken-out time information for the value after adjusting for the current
time zone (and any other factors such as Daylight Saving Time).
Time zone adjustments are performed as specified by the
.Ev TZ
environment variable (see
.Xr tzset 3 ) .
The function
.Fn localtime
uses
.Xr tzset 3
to initialize time conversion information if
.Xr tzset 3
has not already been called by the process.
.Pp
After filling in the tm structure,
.Fn localtime
sets the
.Fa tm_isdst Ns 'th
element of
.Fa tzname
to a pointer to an
.Tn ASCII
string that's the time zone abbreviation to be
used with
.Fn localtime Ns 's
return value.
.Pp
The function
.Fn gmtime
similarly converts the time value, but without any time zone adjustment,
and returns a pointer to a tm structure (described below).
.Pp
The
.Fn ctime
function
adjusts the time value for the current time zone in the same manner as
.Fn localtime ,
and returns a pointer to a 26-character string of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Thu Nov 24 18:22:48 1986\en\e0
.Ed
.Pp
All the fields have constant width.
.Pp
The
.Fn asctime
function
converts the broken down time in the structure
.Fa tm
pointed at by
.Fa *tm
to the form
shown in the example above.
.Pp
The function
.Fn mktime
converts the broken-down time, expressed as local time, in the structure
pointed to by tm into a time value with the same encoding as that of the
values returned by the
.Xr time 3
function, that is, seconds from the Epoch,
.Tn UTC .
.Pp
The original values of the
.Fa tm_wday
and
.Fa tm_yday
components of the structure are ignored, and the original values of the
other components are not restricted to their normal ranges.
(A positive or zero value for
.Fa tm_isdst
causes
.Fn mktime
to presume initially that summer time (for example, Daylight Saving Time)
is or is not in effect for the specified time, respectively.
A negative value for
.Fa tm_isdst
causes the
.Fn mktime
function to attempt to divine whether summer time is in effect for the
specified time.)
.Pp
On successful completion, the values of the
.Fa tm_wday
and
.Fa tm_yday
components of the structure are set appropriately, and the other components
are set to represent the specified calendar time, but with their values
forced to their normal ranges; the final value of
.Fa tm_mday
is not set until
.Fa tm_mon
and
.Fa tm_year
are determined.
.Fn Mktime
returns the specified calendar time; if the calendar time cannot be
represented, it returns \-1;
.Pp
The function
.Fn timegm
is
.Fn mktime
analog, but assume that broke-down time expressed as UTC (not local) time.
This function also set
.Fa tm_isdst
field to 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn difftime
function
returns the difference between two calendar times,
.Pf ( Fa time1
-
.Fa time0 ) ,
expressed in seconds.
.Pp
External declarations as well as the tm structure definition are in the 
.Aq Pa time.h
include file.
The tm structure includes at least the following fields:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int tm_sec;	/\(** seconds (0 - 60) \(**/
int tm_min;	/\(** minutes (0 - 59) \(**/
int tm_hour;	/\(** hours (0 - 23) \(**/
int tm_mday;	/\(** day of month (1 - 31) \(**/
int tm_mon;	/\(** month of year (0 - 11) \(**/
int tm_year;	/\(** year \- 1900 \(**/
int tm_wday;	/\(** day of week (Sunday = 0) \(**/
int tm_yday;	/\(** day of year (0 - 365) \(**/
int tm_isdst;	/\(** is summer time in effect? \(**/
char \(**tm_zone;	/\(** abbreviation of timezone name \(**/
long tm_gmtoff;	/\(** offset from UTC in seconds \(**/
.Ed
.Pp
The
field
.Fa tm_isdst
is non-zero if summer time is in effect.
.Pp
The field
.Fa tm_gmtoff
is the offset (in seconds) of the time represented from
.Tn UTC ,
with positive
values indicating east of the Prime Meridian.

.Sh HISTORY
This manual page is derived from
the time package contributed to Berkeley by
Arthur Olsen and which appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Except for 
.Fn difftime
and
.Fn mktime ,
these functions leaves their result in an internal static object and return
a pointer to that object. Subsequent calls to these
function will modify the same object.
.Pp
The
.Fa tm_zone
field of a returned tm structure points to a static array of characters,
which will also be overwritten by any subsequent calls (as well as by
subsequent calls to
.Xr tzset 3
and
.Xr tzsetwall 3 ) .
.Pp
Use of the external variable
.Fa tzname
is discouraged; the
.Fa tm_zone
entry in the tm structure is preferred.
.Pp
Avoid using out-of-range values with
.Fn mktime
when setting up lunch with promptness sticklers in Riyadh.
