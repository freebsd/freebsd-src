.Sh NAME
.Nm strptime
.Nd parse date and time string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <time.h>
.Ft const char *
.Fn strptime "const char *buf" "const char *format" "struct tm *timeptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strptime
function parses the string in the buffer
.Fa buf
according to the string pointed to by
.Fa format ,
and fills in the elements of the structure pointed to by
.Fa timeptr .
Thus, it can be considered the reverse operation of
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fa format
string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and
ordinary characters.
All ordinary characters are matched exactly with the buffer, where
white space in the format string will match any amount of white space
in the buffer.
All conversion specifications are identical to those described in
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn strptime
returns the pointer to the first character in
.Fa buf
that has not been required to satisfy the specified conversions in
.Fa format .
It returns
.Dv NULL
if one of the conversions failed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr date 1 ,
.Xr scanf 3 ,
