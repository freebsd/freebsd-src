.Fn strcoll "const char *s1" "const char *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn strcoll_l "const char *s1" "const char *s2" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strcoll
function
lexicographically compares the null-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
according to the current locale collation
and returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
depending on whether
.Fa s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2 .
If information about the current locale collation is not available,
the value of
.Fn strcmp s1 s2
is returned.
The
.Fn strcoll_l
function uses an explicit locale argument rather than the system locale.
