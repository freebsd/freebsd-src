.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strsep
.Nd separate strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <string.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn strsep "char **stringp" "char *delim"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strsep
locates in the null-terminated string at
.Fa *stringp
the first occurrence of any character in
.Fa delim
and replaces this with a
.Ql \e0 ,
records the location of the immediate following character in
.Fa *stringp ,
then returns the original value of
.Fa *stringp .
If no delimiter characters are found,
.Fn strsep
sets
.Fa *stringp
to
.Dv NULL ;
if
.Fa *stringp
is initially
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn strsep
returns
.Dv NULL .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following uses
.Fn strsep
to parse strings containing runs of white space,
making up an argument vector:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char inputstring[100];
char **argv[51], **ap = argv, *p, *val;
/* set up inputstring */
for (p = inputstring; p != NULL; ) {
	while ((val = strsep(&p, " \et")) != NULL && *val == '\e0');
	*ap++ = val;
}
*ap = 0;
