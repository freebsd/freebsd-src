.Dt MEMCCPY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm memccpy
.Nd copy string until character found
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft void *
.Fo memccpy
.Fa "void * restrict dst"
.Fa "const void * restrict src"
.Fa "int c"
.Fa "size_t len"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn memccpy
function
copies bytes from string
.Fa src
to string
.Fa dst .
If the character
.Fa c
(as converted to an
.Vt "unsigned char" )
occurs in the string
.Fa src ,
the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of
.Fa c
in the string
.Fa dst
is returned.
Otherwise,
.Fa len
bytes are copied, and a NULL pointer is returned.
If
.Fa src
and
.Fa dst
overlap, behavior is undefined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bcopy 3 ,
.Xr memcpy 3 ,
.Xr memmove 3 ,
.Xr strcpy 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn memccpy
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2004
and
.St -isoC-2023 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn memccpy
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4
and was first specified in the
.St -svid1 .
The
.Ft restrict
keyword was added to the prototype in
.Fx 5.0.0
in accordance with the updated specification of
.St -p1003.1-2004 .
