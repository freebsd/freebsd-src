.Sh NAME
.Nm strspn ,
.Nm strcspn
.Nd span a string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn strspn "const char *s" "const char *charset"
.Ft size_t
.Fn strcspn "const char *s" "const char *charset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strspn
function
spans the initial part of the null-terminated string
.Fa s
as long as the characters from
.Fa s
occur in the null-terminated string
.Fa charset .
In other words, it computes the string array index
of the first character of
.Fa s
which is not in
.Fa charset ,
else the index of the first null character.
.Pp
The
.Fn strcspn
function
spans the initial part of the null-terminated string
.Fa s
as long as the characters from
.Fa s
.Sy do not
occur in the null-terminated string
.Fa charset
.Po it spans the
.Sy complement
of
.Fa charset
.Pc .
In other words, it computes the string array index
of the first character of
.Fa s
which is also in
.Fa charset ,
else the index of the first null character.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strspn
and
.Fn strcspn
functions
return the number of characters spanned.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strspn
and
.Fn strcspn
functions
conform to
.St -isoC .
