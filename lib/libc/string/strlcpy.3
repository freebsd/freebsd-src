.Sh NAME
.Nm strlcpy ,
.Nm strlcat
.Nd size-bounded string copying and concatenation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <string.h>
.Ft size_t
.Fn strlcpy "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Ft size_t
.Fn strlcat "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
functions copy and concatenate strings respectively.  They are designed
to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements for
.Xr strncpy 3
and
.Xr strncat 3 .
Unlike those functions,
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
take the full size of the buffer (not just the length) and guarantee to
NUL-terminate the result (as long as
.Fa size
is larger than 0).  Note that you should include a byte for the NUL in
.Fa size .
.Pp
The
.Fn strlcpy
function copies up to
.Fa size
- 1 characters from the NUL-terminated string
.Fa src
to
.Fa dst ,
NUL-terminating the result.
.Pp
The
.Fn strlcat
function appends the NUL-terminated string
.Fa src
to the end of
.Fa dst .
It will append at most
.Fa size
- strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-terminating the result.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
functions return the total length of the string they tried to
create.  For
.Fn strlcpy
that means the length of
.Fa src .
For
.Fn strlcat
that means the initial length of
.Fa dst
plus
the length of
.Fa src .
While this may seem somewhat confusing it was done to make
truncation detection simple.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment illustrates the simple case:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *s, *p, buf[BUFSIZ];

.Li ...

(void)strlcpy(buf, s, sizeof(buf));
(void)strlcat(buf, p, sizeof(buf));
.Ed
.Pp
To detect truncation, perhaps while building a pathname, something
like the following might be used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHNAMELEN];

.Li ...

if (strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
	goto toolong;
if (strlcat(pname, file, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
	goto toolong;
.Ed
.Pp
Since we know how many characters we copied the first time, we can
speed things up a bit by using a copy instead on an append:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHNAMELEN];
size_t n;

.Li ...

n = strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname));
if (n >= sizeof(pname))
	goto toolong;
if (strlcpy(pname + n, file, sizeof(pname) - n) >= sizeof(pname) - n)
	goto toolong;
.Ed
.Pp
However, one may question the validity of such optimizations, as they
defeat the whole purpose of
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat .
As a matter of fact, the first version of this manual page got it wrong.

.Fn strlcpy
and

functions first appeared in

and made their appearance in
.Fx 3.3 .
