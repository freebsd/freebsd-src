.Nd Kerberos 5 SU PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_ksu
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Kerberos 5 SU authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
for only one PAM category: authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
The module is specifically designed to be used with the
.Xr su 1
utility.
.\" It also provides a null function for session management.
.Ss Kerberos 5 SU Authentication Module
The Kerberos 5 SU authentication component provides functions to verify
the identity of a user
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
and determine whether or not the user is authorized to obtain the
privileges of the target account.
If the target account is
.Dq root ,
then the Kerberos 5 principal used
for authentication and authorization will be the
.Dq root
instance of
the current user, e.g.\&
.Dq Li user/root@REAL.M .
Otherwise, the principal will simply be the current user's default
principal, e.g.\&
.Dq Li user@REAL.M .
.Pp
The user is prompted for a password if necessary.
Authorization is performed
by comparing the Kerberos 5 principal with those listed in the
.Pa .k5login
file in the target account's home directory
(e.g.\&
.Pa /root/.k5login
for root).
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm use_first_pass"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm use_first_pass
If the authentication module
is not the first in the stack,
and a previous module
obtained the user's password,
that password is used
to authenticate the user.
If this fails,
the authentication module returns failure
without prompting the user for a password.
This option has no effect
if the authentication module
is the first in the stack,
or if no previous modules
obtained the user's password.
.It Cm try_first_pass
This option is similar to the
.Cm use_first_pass
option,
except that if the previously obtained password fails,
the user is prompted for another password.
