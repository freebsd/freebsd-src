.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_radius
.Nd RADIUS authentication PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pam_radius.so
.Op Cm use_first_pass
.Op Cm try_first_pass
.Op Cm echo_pass
.Op Cm conf Ns No = Ns Ar pathname
.Op Cm template_user Ns No = Ns Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module provides authentication services based
upon the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) protocol
for the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) framework.
.Pp
The
.Nm
module accepts these optional parameters:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Cm use_first_pass
causes
.Nm
to use a previously entered password instead of prompting for a new one.
If no password has been entered then authentication fails.
.It Cm try_first_pass
causes
.Nm
to use a previously entered password, if one is available.  If no
password has been entered,
.Nm
prompts for one as usual.
.It Cm echo_pass
causes echoing to be left on if
.Nm
prompts for a password.
.It Cm conf Ns No = Ns Ar pathname
specifies a non-standard location for the RADIUS client configuration file
(normally located in /etc/radius.conf).
.It Cm template_user Ns No = Ns Ar username
specifies a user whose
.Xr passwd 5
entry will be used as a template to create the session environment
if the supplied username doesn't exist in local password database.
The user
will be authenticated with the supplied username and password, but his
credentials to the system will be presented as the ones for
.Ar username ,
i.e., his login class, home directory, resource limits, etc. will be set to ones
defined for
.Ar username .
.Pp
If this option is omitted, and there is no username
in the system databases equal to the supplied one (as determined by call to
.Xr getpwnam 3 ) ,
the authentication will fail.
