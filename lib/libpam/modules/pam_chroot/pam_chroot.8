.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The chroot service module for PAM chroots users into either a
predetermined directory or one derived from their home directory.
If a user's home directory as specified in the
.Vt passwd
structure returned by
.Xr getpwnam 3
contains the string
.Dq Li /./ ,
the portion of the directory name to the left of that string is used
as the chroot directory, and the portion to the right will be the
current working directory inside the chroot tree.
Otherwise, the directories specified by the
.Cm dir
and
.Cm cwd
options (see below) are used.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm also_root"
.It Cm also_root
Do not hold user ID 0 exempt from the chroot requirement.
.It Cm always
Report a failure if a chroot directory could not be derived from the
user's home directory, and the
.Cm dir
option was not specified.
.It Cm cwd Ns = Ns Ar directory
Specify the directory to
.Xr chdir 2
into after a successful
.Xr chroot 2
call.
.It Cm dir Ns = Ns Ar directory
Specify the chroot directory to use if one could not be derived from
the user's home directory.
