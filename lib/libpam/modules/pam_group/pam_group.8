.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_group
.Nd Group PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_group
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The group service module for PAM accepts or rejects users based on
their membership in a particular file group.
.Nm pam_group
provides functionality for two PAM categories: authentication and
account management.
In terms of the module-type parameter, they are the ``auth'' and
``account'' features.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the
.Nm
module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm fail_safe"
.It Cm deny
Reverse the meaning of the test, i.e., reject the applicant if and only
if he or she is a member of the specified group.
This can be useful to exclude certain groups of users from certain
services.
.It Cm fail_safe
If the specified group does not exist, or has no members, act as if
it does exist and the applicant is a member.
.It Cm group Ns = Ns Ar groupname
Specify the name of the group to check.
The default is
.Dq Li wheel .
.It Cm luser
Accept or reject based on the target user's group membership.
.It Cm root_only
Skip this module entirely if the target account is not the superuser
account.
.It Cm ruser
Accept or reject based on the supplicant's group membership.
This is the default.
.El
.Pp
Note that the
.Cm luser
and
.Cm ruser
options are mutually exclusive, and that
.Nm
will fail if both are specified.
