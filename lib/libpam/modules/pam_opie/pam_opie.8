.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_opie
.Nd OPIE PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_opie
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The OPIE authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
that of authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides a null function for session management.
.Ss OPIE Authentication Module
The OPIE authentication component
provides functions to verify the identity of a user
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
which obtains the relevant
.Xr opie 4
credentials.
It provides the user with an OPIE challenge,
and verifies that this is correct with
.Xr opiechallenge 3 .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm auth_as_self"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm auth_as_self
This option will require the user
to authenticate themself as the user
given by
.Xr getlogin 2 ,
not as the account they are attempting to access.
This is primarily for services like
.Xr su 1 ,
where the user's ability to retype
their own password
might be deemed sufficient.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/opiekeys" -compact
.It Pa /etc/opiekeys
default OPIE password database.
