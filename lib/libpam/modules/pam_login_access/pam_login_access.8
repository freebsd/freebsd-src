.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_login_access
.Nd login.access PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_login_access
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa login.access
service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
account management.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li account
feature.
.Ss Login.access Account Management Module
The
.Pa login.access
account management component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_acct_mgmt ,
returns success if and only the user is allowed to login on the
specified tty (in the case of a local login) or from the specified
remote host (in the case of a remote login), according to the
restrictions listed in
.Xr login.access 5 .
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm accessfile=pathname"
.It Cm accessfile Ns = Ns Ar pathname
specifies a non-standard location for the
.Pa login.access
configuration file
(normally located in
.Pa /etc/login.access ) .
.It Cm nodefgroup
makes tokens not enclosed in parentheses only match users, requiring groups
to be specified in parentheses.
Without
.Cm nodefgroup
user and group names are intermingled, with user entries taking precedence
over group entries.
This is not backwards compatible with legacy
.Pa login.access
configuration files.
However this mitigates confusion between users and
groups of the same name.
.It Cm fieldsep Ns = Ns Ar separators
changes the field separator from the default ":".
More than one separator
may be specified.
.It Cm listsep Ns = Ns Ar separators
changes the field separator from the default space (''), tab (\\t) and
comma (,).
More than one separator may be specified.
For example, listsep=;
will replace the default with a semicolon (;).
This option may be useful when specifying Active Directory groupnames which
typically contain spaces.
