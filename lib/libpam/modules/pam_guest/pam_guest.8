.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_guest
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The guest service module for PAM allows guest logins.
If successful, the
.Nm
module sets the PAM environment variable
.Ev GUEST
to the login name.
The application can check this variable using
.Xr pam_getenv 3
to differentiate guest logins from normal logins.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the
.Nm
module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm pass_as_ruser"
.It Cm guests Ns = Ns Ar list
Comma-separated list of guest account names.
The default is
.Dq Li guest .
A typical value for
.Xr ftpd 8
would be
.Dq Li anonymous,ftp .
.It Cm nopass
Omits the password prompt if the target account is on the list of
guest accounts.
.It Cm pass_as_ruser
The password typed in by the user is exported as the
.Dv PAM_RUSER
item.
This is useful for applications like
.Xr ftpd 8
where guest users are encouraged to use their email address as
password.
.It Cm pass_is_user
Requires the guest user to type in the guest account name as password.
