.Dt PAM_EXEC 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_exec
.Nd Exec PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_exec
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The exec service module for PAM executes the program designated by
its first argument if no options are specified, with its remaining
arguments as command-line arguments.
If options are specified, the program and its arguments follow the last
option or
.Cm --
if the program name conflicts with an option name.
.Pp
The following options may be passed before the program and its
arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm capture_stderr
Capture text printed by the program to its standard error stream and
pass it to the conversation function as error messages.
No attempt is made at buffering the text, so results may vary.
.It Cm capture_stdout
Capture text printed by the program to its standard output stream and
pass it to the conversation function as informational messages.
No attempt is made at buffering the text, so results may vary.
.It Cm debug
Ignored for compatibility reasons.
.It Cm no_warn
Ignored for compatibility reasons.
.It Cm return_prog_exit_status
Use the program exit status as the return code of the pam_sm_* function.
It must be a valid return value for this function.
.It Cm expose_authtok
Write the authentication token to the program's standard input stream,
followed by a NUL character.
Ignored for
.Fn pam_sm_setcred .
.It Cm use_first_pass
If
.Cm expose_authtok
was specified, do not prompt for an authentication token if one is not
already available.
.It Cm --
Stop options parsing;
program and its arguments follow.
.El
.Pp
The child's environment is set to the current PAM environment list,
as returned by
.Xr pam_getenvlist 3 .
In addition, the following PAM items are exported as environment
variables:
.Ev PAM_RHOST ,
.Ev PAM_RUSER ,
.Ev PAM_SERVICE ,
.Ev PAM_SM_FUNC ,
.Ev PAM_TTY
and
.Ev PAM_USER .
.Pp
The
.Ev PAM_SM_FUNC
variable contains the name of the PAM service module function being
called.
It may be:
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
pam_sm_acct_mgmt
.It
pam_sm_authenticate
.It
pam_sm_chauthtok
.It
pam_sm_close_session
.It
pam_sm_open_session
.It
pam_sm_setcred
.El
.Pp
If
.Cm return_prog_exit_status
is not set (default), the
.Ev PAM_SM_FUNC
function returns
.Er PAM_SUCCESS
if the program exit status is 0,
.Er PAM_PERM_DENIED
otherwise.
.Pp
If
.Cm return_prog_exit_status
is set, the program exit status is used.
It should be
.Er PAM_SUCCESS
or one of the error codes allowed by the calling
.Ev PAM_SM_FUNC
function.
The valid codes are documented in each function man page.
If the exit status is not a valid return code,
.Er PAM_SERVICE_ERR
is returned.
Each valid codes numerical value is available as an environment variable
(eg.\&
.Ev PAM_SUCESS ,
.Ev PAM_USER_UNKNOWN ,
etc).
This is useful in shell scripts for instance.
