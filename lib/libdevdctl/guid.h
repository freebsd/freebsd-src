 * \brief Object that represents guids.
 *
 * It can generally be manipulated as a uint64_t, but with a special
 * value INVALID_GUID that does not equal any valid guid.
 *
 * As of this writing, this class is only used to represent ZFS
 * guids in events and spa_generate_guid() in spa_misc.c explicitly
 * refuses to return a guid of 0.  So this class uses 0 as the value
 * for INVALID_GUID.  In the future, if 0 is allowed to be a valid
 * guid, the implementation of this class must change.
