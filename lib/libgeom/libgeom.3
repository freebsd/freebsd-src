.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Libgeom
is the library which contains the official and publicized API for
interacting with the GEOM subsystem in the kernel.
.Ss "Statistics functions"
GEOM collects statistics data for all consumers and providers, but does
not perform any normalization or presentation on the raw data, this is
left as an excercize for user-land presentation utilities.
.Pp
The
.Fn geom_stats_open
and 
.Fn geom_stats_close
functions opens and closes the necessary pathways to access the raw 
statistics information in the kernel.  These functions are likely to
open one or more files and cache the filedescriptors locally.
.Fn geom_stats_open
returns zero on success, and sets errno if not.
.Pp
The
.Fn geom_stats_resync
function will check if more statistics collection points have been
added in the kernel since
.Fn geom_stats_open
or the previous call to
.Fn geom_stats_resync .
.Pp
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_get
will aquire a snapshot of the raw data from the kernel and while a
reasonable effort is made to make this snapshot as atomic and consistent
as possible, no guarantee is given that it will actually be so.
The snapshot must be freed again using the
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_free
function.
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_get
returns NULL on failure.
.Pp
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_timestamp
provides access to the timestamp aquired in the snapshot.
.Pp
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_reset
and
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_next
provides an iterator over the statistics slots in the snapshot.
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_reset
forces the internal pointer in the snapshot back to before the first item.
.Fn geom_stats_snapshot_next
returns the next item and NULL if there are no more items in the snapshot.
