.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library routines provide services for processes hosting or running in
capability mode.
Depending on the requirements of the host and sandbox, the API can simply be
used to set up and stop sandboxes, used to manage I/O using a
.Xr unix 4
domain socket connection to the sandbox, or can provide a basic remote
procedure call (RPC) facility.
Applications may also use RPC generators such as
.Xr rpcgen 1
to build event handling and marshaling code.
.Pp
This man page describes the sandbox API.
General information on
.Nm
may be found in
.Xr libcapsicum 3 .
.Sh SANDBOX API
The
.Nm
sandbox API allows sandbox processes to interact with their host process.
Sandbox API functions can be identified by their function name prefix,
.Dv lcs_ .
.Pp
Each executing sandbox will have a single corresponding host instance,
described by an opaque
.Dt "struct lc_host" ,
which is returned by
.Fn lcs_get .
.Pp
The socket for the host may be queried using
.Fn lcs_getsock .
.Pp
.Nm
implements a number of I/O functions as part of the sandbox API, which are
documented in
.Xr libcapsicum_sandbox 3 .
.Fn lcs_recv
and
.Fn lcs_send
provide simple wrappers around
.Xr recv 2
and
.Xr send 2
to avoid sandboxes having to query host socket file descriptors before use.
.Pp
.Fn lcs_recv_rights
and
.Fn lcs_send_rights
similarly allow receiving and sending file descriptors with messages.
.Pp
.Fn lcs_recvrpc
and
.Fn lcs_sendrpc
may be used to implement a simple RPC system, in coordination with a host
using
.Fn lch_rpc .
.Fn lcs_recvrpc
blocks awaiting the receipt of an RPC request, which will be returned in a
buffer allocated using
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Va bufferp ,
and with a data size returned via
.Va lenp .
The caller will also receive an operation number and a sequence number via
.Va opnop
and
.Va seqnop .
.Pp
When an RPC is complete, it should be returned to the host via
.Fn lcs_sendrpc ,
which accepts the same operation and sequence number as arguments, as well as
reply data via the
.Vt iovec
.Va rep
and
.Va repcount .
When the sandbox is done with the request data, it should free the memory
using
.Xr free 3 .
.Nm lcs_recvrpc_rights
and
.Nm lcs_sendrpc_rights
allow the receiving and sending of file descriptors along with the RPC.
