.Dt LIBCAPABILITY 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm libcapsicum
.Nd "library interface to capability-mode services"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcapsicum
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/capability.h
.In libcapsicum.h
.Ft int
.Fn lc_limitfd "int fd" "cap_rights_t rights"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
implements APIs that allow applications to create, manage, and interact with
sandboxed software services running in capability mode, described in
.Xr cap_enter 2 .
Applications linked against
.Nm
will use one or both of "host" and "sandbox" APIs, depending on whether they
consume or produce sandboxed services.
.Nm
will start sandboxed components using a sandbox-specific run-time linker,
.Xr rtld-elf-cap 1 ,
rather than the standard
.Xr rtld-elf 1 .
.Pp
Host processes use the
.Nm
host API,
described in
.Xr libcapsicum_host 3 ,
to launch compartmentalized components in sandboxes.
They may also use
.Nm
to communication with the sandboxed service based on socket I/O or remote
procedure call (RPC).
.Pp
Sandbox processes run in capability mode, and are only able to use resources
either assigned to the sandbox during creation, or later explicitly passed to
the process.
Sandbox processes use the
.Nm
sandbox API,
described in
.Xr libcapsicum_sandbox 3 .
Sandboxed processes themselves may launch software components in further
sandboxes, so a single program may use both host and sandbox APIs.
.Sh CAPABILITY API
.Fn lc_limitfd
is a wrapper around
.Xr cap_new 2 ,
.Xr dup2 2 ,
and
.Xr close 2 .
which takes an existing file descriptor and replaces it with a capability
with the requested rights mask.
