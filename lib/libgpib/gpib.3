.Ss Function Description
.Pp
The function
.Fn ibdev
is used to open the GPIB device, and establish the parameters to
communicate with a particular bus device. The device is selected
by its primary address
.Fa pad ,
a numerical value between 0 and 30, possibly additionally by its
secondary address
.Fa sad ,
a numerical value between 96 and 126, or 0 to not use secondary
addressing.
The
.Fa tmo
value specifies the timeout to use when communicating with the device.
This can be any of the constants
.Dv TNONE ,
.Dv T10us ,
.Dv T30us ,
.Dv T100us ,
.Dv T300us ,
.Dv T1ms ,
.Dv T3ms ,
.Dv T10ms ,
.Dv T30ms ,
.Dv T100ms ,
.Dv T300ms ,
.Dv T1s ,
.Dv T3s ,
.Dv T10s ,
.Dv T30s ,
.Dv T100s ,
.Dv T300s ,
or
.Dv T1000s .
The boolean parameter
.Fa eot
specifies whether the bus signal
.Li EOI
(end-or-identify) should be asserted when sending the last byte of a
message to the device.
Finally, the
.Fa eos
parameter determines whether any special character should be used to
identify the end of a device message when transferring messages on the
bus.
The lower 8 bits of
.Fa eos
are interpreted as an end-of-string character,
.Li EOS .
This character can be ORed with the following values:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent
.It Dv REOS
When receiving a message byte on the bus that matches the
.Li EOS
character, treat it as if the
.Li EOI
signal were asserted, and stop receiving.
.It Dv XEOS
When transmitting a message byte on the bus that matches the
.Li EOS
character, assert the
.Li EOI
bus signal by the same time, and stop sending.
.It Dv BIN
If set, include all 8 bits of the
.Li EOS
character in the comparison; if unset, compare only 7 bit ASCII
values.
.El
Passing 0 as
.Fa eos
will turn off any special character treatment, allowing for a fully
8-bit transparent communications channel to the device.
.Pp

will be set to a non-zero value.
.Em This function is currently not implemented.
.Pp
The function
.Fn ibloc
turns the device into local mode.
.Pp
The function
.Fn ibonl
is used to close or reinitialize a device handle.

again.
If it is passed as a non-zero value, all parameters of the handle
will be returned to their defaults;
