# -O2 to -O1 reduces the -j32 time for lib/googletest/test from 131s to 71s.
# Using -O0 further reduces the time to 29s, and also reduces the disk usage
# from 144MB (at -O2) / 92MB (at -O1) to 82MB, so we use -O0.
# Note: Building without debug info saves about 10-15% of the build time, so we
# only enable debug info if DEBUG_FLAGS is not empty (71s -> 64s at -O1 and -j32).
