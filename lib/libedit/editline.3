.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides generic line editing, history and tokenization functions,
similar to those found in
.Xr sh 1 .
.Pp
These functions are available in the
.Nm libedit
library (which needs the
.Nm libtermcap
library).
Programs should be linked with
.Fl ledit ltermcap .
.Sh LINE EDITING FUNCTIONS
The line editing functions use a common data structure,
.Fa EditLine ,
which is created by
.Fn el_init
and freed by
.Fn el_end .
.Pp
The following functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn el_init
Initialise the line editor, and return a data structure
to be used by all other line editing functions.
.Fa prog
is the name of the invoking program, used when reading the
.Xr editrc 5
file to determine which settings to use.
.Fa fin ,
.Fa fout
and
.Fa ferr
are the input, output, and error streams (respectively) to use.
In this documentation, references to
.Dq the tty
are actually to this input/output stream combination.
.It Fn el_end
Clean up and finish with
.Fa e ,
assumed to have been created with
.Fn el_init .
.It Fn el_reset
Reset the tty and the parser.
This should be called after an error which may have upset the tty's
state.
.It Fn el_gets
Read a line from the tty.
.Fa count
is modified to contain the number of characters read.
Returns the line read if successful, or
.Dv NULL
if no characters were read or if an error occurred.
.It Fn el_getc
Read a character from the tty.
.Fa ch
is modified to contain the character read.
Returns the number of characters read if successful, \-1 otherwise.
.It Fn el_push
Pushes
.Fa str
back onto the input stream.
This is used by the macro expansion mechanism.
Refer to the description of
.Ic bind
.Fl s
in
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_parse
Parses the
.Fa argv
array (which is
.Fa argc
elements in size)
to execute builtin
.Nm
commands.
If the command is prefixed with
.Dq prog:
then
.Fn el_parse
will only execute the command if
.Dq prog
matches the
.Fa prog
argument supplied to
.Fn el_init .
The return value is
\-1 if the command is unknown,
0 if there was no error or
.Dq prog
did not match, or
1 if the command returned an error.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_set
Set
.Nm
parameters.
.Fa op
determines which parameter to set, and each operation has its
own parameter list.
.Pp
The following values for
.Fa op
are supported, along with the required argument list:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv EL_PROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"

.Fa f ,
which is to return a string that contains the prompt.
.It Dv EL_RPROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Define right side prompt printing function as

which is to return a string that contains the prompt.
.It Dv EL_TERMINAL , Fa "const char *type"

.Fa type ,
or to
.Ev TERM
if
.Fa type
is
.Dv NULL .
.It Dv EL_EDITOR , Fa "const char *mode"
Set editing mode to
.Fa mode ,
which must be one of
.Dq emacs
or
.Dq vi .
.It Dv EL_SIGNAL , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is non-zero,
.Nm
will install its own signal handler for the following signals when
reading command input:
.Dv SIGCONT ,
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Dv SIGINT ,
.Dv SIGQUIT ,
.Dv SIGSTOP ,
.Dv SIGTERM ,
.Dv SIGTSTP ,
and
.Dv SIGWINCH .
Otherwise, the current signal handlers will be used.

.Fa "const char *help" ,
.Fa "unsigned char (*func)(EditLine *e, int ch)"
.Xc

.Fn func ,
referred to as
.Fa name
which is invoked when a key which is bound to
.Fa name
is entered.
.Fa help

.Fn history_init .
.It Dv EL_EDITMODE , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is non-zero,
editing is enabled (the default).
Note that this is only an indication, and does not
affect the operation of
.Nm .
At this time, it is the caller's responsibility to
check this
(using
.Fn el_get )
to determine if editing should be enabled or not.
.It Dv EL_GETCFN , Fa "int (*f)(EditLine *, char *c)"
Define the character reading function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return the number of characters read and store them in
.Fa c .

The builtin function can be set or restored with the special function
name
.Dv EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN .
.It Dv EL_CLIENTDATA , Fa "void *data"

are supported, along with actual type of
.Fa result :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv EL_PROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"

.It Dv EL_RPROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Return a pointer to the function that displays the rightside prompt.
.It Dv EL_EDITOR , Fa "const char *"
Return the name of the editor, which will be one of
.Dq emacs
or
.Dq vi .
.It Dv EL_GETTC , Fa "const char *name" , Fa "void *value"

.Fa data
previously registered with the corresponding
.Fn el_set
call.
.It Dv EL_UNBUFFERED , Fa "int"

.It Dv EL_PREP_TERM , Fa "int"
Sets or clears terminal editing mode.
.It Dv EL_GETFP , Fa "int fd", Fa "FILE **fp"
Return in
.Fa fp
the current
.Nm editline
file pointer for
.Dq input

then this is done automatically.
Otherwise, it is the responsibility of the application to call
.Fn el_resize
on the appropriate occasions.
.It Fn el_line

    const char *lastchar;  /* address of last character */
} LineInfo;
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa buffer

to obtain the
.Fa LineInfo
structure pertaining to line returned by that function,
and from within user defined functions added with
.Dv EL_ADDFN .

If
.Dv H_SETUNIQUE

will not be entered into the history if its contents match
the ones of the current history element.
If the element is entered

.Fn history
function returns \*[Ge] 0 if the operation
.Fa op
succeeds.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.Fa ev
