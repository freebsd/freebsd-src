.Dt EDITRC 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm editrc
.Nd configuration file for editline library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file defines various settings to be used by the
.Xr editline 3
library.
.Pp
The format of each line is either:
.Dl prog:command [arg [...]]
or
.Dl command [arg [...]]
.Pp
.Ar command
is one of the
.Xr editline 3
builtin commands.
Refer to
.Sx BUILTIN COMMANDS
for more information.
.Pp
.Ar prog
is the program name string that a program defines when it calls
.Xr el_init 3
to setup
.Xr editline 3 ,
which is usually
.Va argv[0] .
.Ar command
will be executed for any program which matches
.Ar prog .
.Pp
.Ar prog
may also be a
.Xr regex 3
style
regular expression, in which case
.Ar command
will be executed for any program that matches the regular expression.
.Sh BUILTIN COMMANDS
The
.Nm editline
library has some builtin commands, which affect the way
that the line editing and history functions operate.
These are based on similar named builtins present in the
.Xr tcsh 1
shell.
.Pp
The following builtin commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ic bind Xo
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl e
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar key Op Ar command
.Xc
Without options, list all bound keys, and the editor command to which
each is bound.
If
.Ar key
is supplied, show the bindings for
.Ar key .
If
.Ar key command
is supplied, bind
.Ar command
to
.Ar key .
Options include:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl e
Bind all keys to the standard GNU Emacs-like bindings.
.It Fl v
Bind all keys to the standard
.Xr vi 1 Ns -like
bindings.
.It Fl a
List or change key bindings in the
.Xr vi 1
mode alternate (command mode) key map.
.It Fl k
.Ar key
is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be one of
.Sq up ,
.Sq down ,
.Sq left
or
.Sq right .
.It Fl l
List all editor commands and a short description of each.
.It Fl r
Remove a key's binding.
.It Fl s
.Ar command
is taken as a literal string and treated as terminal input when
.Ar key
is typed.
Bound keys in
.Ar command
are themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels of
interpretation.
.El
.Pp
.Ar key
and
.Ar command
can contain control characters of the form
.Sm off
.Sq No ^ Ar character
.Sm on
.Po
e.g.
.Sq ^A
.Pc ,
and the following backslashed escape sequences:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width 4n
.It Ic \ea
Bell
.It Ic \eb
Backspace
.It Ic \ee
Escape
.It Ic \ef
Formfeed
.It Ic \en
Newline
.It Ic \er
Carriage return
.It Ic \et
Horizontal tab
.It Ic \ev
Vertical tab
.Sm off
.It Sy \e Ar nnn
.Sm on
The ASCII character corresponding to the octal number
.Ar nnn .
.El
.Pp
.Sq \e
nullifies the special meaning of the following character,
if it has any, notably
.Sq \e
and
.Sq ^ .
.It Ic echotc Xo
.Op Fl sv
.Ar arg
.Ar ...
.Xc
Exercise terminal capabilities given in
.Ar arg Ar ... .
If
.Ar arg
is
.Sq baud ,
.Sq cols ,
.Sq lines ,
.Sq rows ,
.Sq meta or
.Sq tabs ,
the value of that capability is printed, with
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
indicating that the terminal does or does not have that capability.
.Pp
.Fl s
returns an empty string for non-existent capabilities, rather than
causing an error.
.Fl v
causes messages to be verbose.
.It Ic history
List the history.
.It Ic telltc
List the values of all the terminal capabilities (see
.Xr termcap 5 ) .
.It Ic settc Ar cap Ar val
Set the terminal capability
.Ar cap
to
.Ar val ,
as defined in
.Xr termcap 5 .
No sanity checking is done.
.It Ic setty Xo
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl x
.Op Ar +mode
.Op Ar -mode
.Op Ar mode
.Xc
Control which tty modes that
.Nm
won't allow the user to change.
.Fl d ,
.Fl q
or
.Fl x
tells
.Ic setty
to act on the
.Sq edit ,
.Sq quote
or
.Sq execute
set of tty modes respectively; defaulting to
.Fl x .
.Pp
Without other arguments,
.Ic setty
lists the modes in the chosen set which are fixed on
.Po
.Sq +mode
.Pc
or off
.Po
.Sq -mode
.Pc .
.Fl a
lists all tty modes in the chosen set regardless of the setting.
With
.Ar +mode ,
.Ar -mode
or
.Ar mode ,
fixes
.Ar mode
on or off or removes control of
.Ar mode
in the chosen set.
