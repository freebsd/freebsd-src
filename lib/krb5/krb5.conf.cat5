     The kkrrbb55..ccoonnff file specifies several configuration parameters for the
     Kerberos 5 library, as well as for some programs.

     The file consists of one or more sections, containing a number of bind-
     ings.  The value of each binding can be either a string or a list of
     other bindings.  The grammar looks like:

           file:
                   /* empty */
                   sections

           sections:
                   section sections
                   section

           section:
                   '[' section_name ']' bindings

           section_name:
                   STRING

           bindings:
                   binding bindings
                   binding

           binding:
                   name '=' STRING
                   name '=' '{' bindings '}'

           name:
                   STRING

     STRINGs consists of one or more non-whitespace characters.

     STRINGs that are specified later in this man-page uses the following
     notation.

           boolean
                values can be either yes/true or no/false.

           time
                values can be a list of year, month, day, hour, min, second.
                Example: 1 month 2 days 30 min.  If no unit is given, seconds
                is assumed.

           etypes
                valid encryption types are: des-cbc-crc, des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-
                md5, des3-cbc-sha1, arcfour-hmac-md5, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
                and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 .

           address
                an address can be either a IPv4 or a IPv6 address.

     Currently recognised sections and bindings are:

           [appdefaults]
                Specifies the default values to be used for Kerberos applica-
                tions.  You can specify defaults per application, realm, or a
                combination of these.  The preference order is:

                           this to work.  Some applications, like su(1),

                           Scan all network interfaces for addresses, as
                           opposed to simply using the address associated with
                           the system's host name.

                      fcache_version = _i_n_t

                           Use MIT compatible format for file credential
                           cache.  It's the field ticketflags that is stored
                           in reverse bit order for older than Heimdal 0.7.
                           Setting this flag to TRUE make it store the MIT
                           way, this is default for Heimdal 0.7.

                      check-rd-req-server
                           If set to "ignore", the framework will ignore any
                           the server input to krb5_rd_req(3,) this is very
                           useful when the GSS-API server input the wrong
                           server name into the gss_accept_sec_context call.

           [domain_realm]
                This is a list of mappings from DNS domain to Kerberos realm.
                Each binding in this section looks like:

                      domain = realm

                The domain can be either a full name of a host or a trailing
                component, in the latter case the domain-string should start
                with a period.  The trailing component only matches hosts that
                are in the same domain, ie ``.example.com'' matches
                ``foo.example.com'', but not ``foo.test.example.com''.

                The realm may be the token `dns_locate', in which case the
                actual realm will be determined using DNS (independently of
                the setting of the `dns_lookup_realm' option).

                                      ``kerberos/tcp'', and ``http/tcp'' port
                                      (depending on service) will be used.
                                      The kdcs will be used in the order that
                                      they are specified.

                                      The optional _s_e_r_v_i_c_e specifies over what

     Since kkrrbb55..ccoonnff is read and parsed by the krb5 library, there is not a
     lot of opportunities for programs to report parsing errors in any useful
     format.  To help overcome this problem, there is a program
     vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff that reads kkrrbb55..ccoonnff and tries to emit useful diagnos-
     tics from parsing errors.  Note that this program does not have any way
     of knowing what options are actually used and thus cannot warn about
     unknown or misspelled ones.
