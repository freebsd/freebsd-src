(K8 family) CPUs
.Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
AMD K8 PMCs are present in the
.Tn "AMD Athlon64"
and
.Tn "AMD Opteron"
series of CPUs.
They are documented in the
.Rs
.%B "BIOS and Kernel Developer's Guide for the AMD Athlon(tm) 64 and AMD Opteron Processors"
.%N "Publication No. 26094"
.%D "April 2004"
.%Q "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."
.Re
.Ss PMC Features
AMD K8 PMCs are 48 bits wide.
Each CPU contains 4 PMCs with the following capabilities:
.Bl -column "PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT" "Support"
.It Em Capability Ta Em Support
.It PMC_CAP_CASCADE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_EDGE Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INVERT Ta Yes

.El
.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for AMD K8 PMCs can have the following optional
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li count= Ns Ar value
Configure the counter to increment only if the number of configured
events measured in a cycle is greater than or equal to
.Ar value .
.It Li edge
Configure the counter to only count negated-to-asserted transitions
of the conditions expressed by the other fields.
In other words, the counter will increment only once whenever a given
condition becomes true, irrespective of the number of clocks during
which the condition remains true.
.It Li inv
Invert the sense of comparison when the
.Dq Li count
qualifier is present, making the counter to increment when the
number of events per cycle is less than the value specified by
the
.Dq Li count
qualifier.
.It Li mask= Ns Ar qualifier
Many event specifiers for AMD K8 PMCs need to be additionally
qualified using a mask qualifier.
These additional qualifiers are event-specific and are documented
along with their associated event specifiers below.
.It Li os
Configure the PMC to count events happening at privilege level 0.
.It Li usr
Configure the PMC to count events occurring at privilege levels 1, 2
or 3.
