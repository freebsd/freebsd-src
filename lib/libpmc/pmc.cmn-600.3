.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc.cmn-600
.Nd Library for accessing the Arm CoreLink CMN-600 Coherent Mesh Network
Controller performance counter events
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
CMN-600 PMU counters may be configured to count any one of a defined set of
hardware events.
Unlike other performance counters, counters for the CMN-600 require the
node ID to set up.
.Pp
Node ID information currently can be obtained one of two ways.
Using bootverbose, for example set sysctl debug.bootverbose=1 and then load the
.Xr hwpmc 4
KLD module.
The cmn600 module will be loaded automatically as a dependency:
.Dl $ sysctl debug.bootverbose=1
.Dl $ kldload hwpmc
Another way is to use sysctl to trigger
dump of nodes tree to system console:
.Dl $ sysctl dev.cmn600.0.dump_nodes=1
.Pp
Some BIOS versions of dual-socket machines have no NUMA domain information in
ACPI.
In such cases, to get more accurate events statistics, set the kernel
environment variable hint.cmn600.{unit}.domain={value}.
Where {unit} is a cmn600 device unit number and {value} is the NUMA domain of
the CPU package containing that CMN-600 controller.
Example:
.Dl $ kenv hint.cmn600.0.domain=0
.Dl $ kenv hint.cmn600.1.domain=1
.Dl $ kldunload hwpmc cmn600
.Dl $ kldload hwpmc
.Pp
