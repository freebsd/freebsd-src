.It AE25
Performance monitoring counters that count external bus events
may report incorrect values after processor power state transitions.
.It AE28
Performance monitoring events for retired floating point operations
(C1H) may not be accurate.
.It AE29
DR3 address match on MOVD/MOVQ/MOVNTQ memory store
instruction may incorrectly increment performance monitoring count
for saturating SIMD instructions retired (Event CFH).
.It AE33
Hardware prefetch performance monitoring events may be counted
inaccurately.
.It AE36
The
.Li CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
performance monitoring event (Event 3CH) counts
clocks when the processor is in the C1/C2 processor power states.
.It AE39
Certain performance monitoring counters related to bus, L2 cache
and power management are inaccurate.
.It AE51
Performance monitoring events for retired instructions (Event C0H) may
not be accurate.
.It AE67
Performance monitoring event
.Li FP_ASSIST
may not be accurate.
.It AE78
Performance monitoring event for hardware prefetch requests (Event
4EH) and hardware prefetch request cache misses (Event 4FH) may not be
accurate.
.It AE82
Performance monitoring event
.Li FP_MMX_TRANS_TO_MMX
may not count some transitions.
