.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions implement a high-level library for managing FTP connections.
.Pp
.Fn ftpLogin
attempts to log in using the supplied
.Fa user ,
.Fa passwd,
.Fa ftp_port
(if passed as 0,
.Fa ftp_port
defaults to the standard ftp port of 21) and
.Fa verbose
fields.  If it is successful, a
standard stream descriptor is returned which should be passed to
subsequent FTP operations. On failure, NULL is returned and
.Fa retcode
will have the error code returned by the foreign server.
.Pp
.Fn ftpChdir
attempts to issue a server CD command to the directory named in
.Fa dir.
On success, zero is returned.  On failure, the error code from the server.
.Pp
.Fn ftpErrno
returns the server failure code for the last operation (useful for seeing
more about what happened if you're familiar with FTP error codes).
.Fn ftpErrString
returns a human readable version of the supplied server failure code.
.Pp
.Fn ftpGet
attempts to retreive the file named by the
.Fa file
argument (which is assumed to be relative to the FTP server's current directory,
see
.Fn ftpChdir )
and returns a new FILE* pointer for the file or NULL on failure.  If
.Fa seekto
is non-NULL, the contents of the integer it points to will be used
as a restart point for the file, that is to say that the stream
returned will point
.Fa *seekto
bytes into the file gotten (this is handy for restarting failed
transfers efficiently).  If the seek operation fails, the value
of
.Fa *seekto
will be zero'd.
.Pp
.Fn ftpGetModtime
returns the last modification time of the file named by the
.Fa file
argument.  If the file could not be opened or stat'd, 0 is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ftpGetSize
returns the size in bytes of the file named by the
.Fa file
argument.  If the file could not be opened or stat'd, -1 is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ftpPut
attempts to create a new file named by the
.Fa file
argument (which is assumed to be relative to the FTP server's current directory,
see
.Fn ftpChdir )
and returns a new
.Fa stream
pointer for the file or NULL on failure.
.Pp
.Fn ftpAscii
sets ascii mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
.Fn ftpBinary
sets binary mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
.Fn ftpPassive
sets passive mode (for firewalls) for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream
to boolean value
.Fa status .
.Pp
.Fn ftpVerbose
sets the verbosity mode for the current server connection named by
.Fa stream
to boolean value
.Fa status .
.Pp
.Fn ftpGetURL
attempts to retreive the file named by the supplied
.Fa URL
and can be considered equivalent to the combined
.Fn ftpLogin ,
.Fn ftpChdir
and
.Fn ftpGet
operations except that no server
.Fa stream
is ever returned - the connection to the server closes when
the file has been completely read.  Use the lower-level routines
if multiple gets are required as it will be far more efficient.
.Pp
.Fn ftpPutURL
attempts to create the file named by the supplied
.Fa URL
and can be considered equivalent to the combined
.Fn ftpLogin ,
.Fn ftpChdir
and
.Fn ftpPut
operations except that no server stream is ever returned - the connection
to the server closes when the file has been completely written.  Use the
lower-level routines if multiple puts are required as it will be far more
efficient.
.Sh BUGS
I'm sure you can get this thing's internal state machine confused if
you really work at it, but so far it's proven itself pretty robust in
all my tests.
.Sh HISTORY
Started life as Poul-Henning Kamp's ftp driver for the system installation
utility, later significantly mutated into a more general form as an
extension of stdio by Jordan Hubbard.  Also incorporates some ideas and
extensions from Jean-Marc Zucconi.
