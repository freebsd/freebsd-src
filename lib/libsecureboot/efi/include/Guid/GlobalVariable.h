//
// Follow UEFI 2.4 spec:
// To prevent name collisions with possible future globally defined variables,
// other internal firmware data variables that are not defined here must be
// saved with a unique VendorGuid other than EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE or
// any other GUID defined by the UEFI Specification. Implementations must
// only permit the creation of variables with a UEFI Specification-defined
// VendorGuid when these variables are documented in the UEFI Specification.
//
// Note: except the globally defined variables defined below, the spec also defines
// L"Boot####"      - A boot load option.
// L"Driver####"    - A driver load option.
// L"SysPrep####"   - A System Prep application load option.
// L"Key####"       - Describes hot key relationship with a Boot#### load option.
// The attribute for them is NV+BS+RT, #### is a printed hex value, and no 0x or h
// is included in the hex value. They can not be expressed as a #define like other globally
// defined variables, it is because we can not list the Boot0000, Boot0001, etc one by one.
