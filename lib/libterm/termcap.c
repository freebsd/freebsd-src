 * termcap - routines for dealing with the terminal capability data base

 * BUG:		Should use a "last" pointer in tbuf, so that searching
 *		for capabilities alphabetically would not be a n**2/2
 *		process when large numbers of capabilities are given.
 * Note:	If we add a last pointer now we will screw up the
 *		tc capability. We really should compile termcap.
 *
 * Essentially all the work here is scanning and decoding escapes
 * in string capabilities.  We don't use stdio because the editor
 * doesn't, and because living w/o it is not hard.
