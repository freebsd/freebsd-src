.Sh NAME
.Nm sysdecode_cap_rights
.Nd output list of capability rights
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libsysdecode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sysdecode.h
.Ft void
.Fn sysdecode_cap_rights "FILE *fp" "cap_rights_t *rightsp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysdecode_cap_rights
function outputs a comma-separated list of capability rights at
.Fa rightsp
to the stream
.Fa fp .
.Pp
Note that some capability rights are supersets of others; for example,
.Dv CAP_PREAD
is the union of
.Dv CAP_READ
and
.Dv CAP_SEEK .
.Fn sysdecode_cap_rights
emits a minimal list of rights whose union is equal to
.Fa *rightsp .
For example, if both
.Dv CAP_READ
and
.Dv CAP_SEEK
are set in
.Fa *rightsp ,
then
.Fn sysdecode_cap_rights
will include only
.Dv CAP_PREAD
in the output list.
