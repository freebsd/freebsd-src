.Sh NAME
.Nm sysdecode_sigcode
.Nd lookup name of signal code
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libsysdecode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sysdecode.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn sysdecode_sigcode "int signal" "int si_code"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysdecode_sigcode
function returns a text description of the
.Fa si_code
field of the
.Vt siginfo_t
object associated with an instance of signal
.Fa sig .
The text description contains the name of the C macro whose value matches
.Fa si_code .
General purpose signal codes such as
.Dv SI_USER
are handled as well as signal-specific codes for
.Dv SIGBUS ,
.Dv SIGCHLD ,
.Dv SIGFPE ,
.Dv SIGILL ,
.Dv SIGSEGV
and
.Dv SIGTRAP .
If
.Fa si_code
does not represent a known signal code,
.Fn sysdecode_sigcode
returns
.Dv NULL .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sysdecode_sigcode
function returns a pointer to a signal code description or
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa si_code
is not a known signal code.
