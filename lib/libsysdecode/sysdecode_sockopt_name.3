.Sh NAME
.Nm sysdecode_sockopt_name
.Nd lookup name of socket option
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libsysdecode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sysdecode.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn sysdecode_sockopt_name "int level" "int optname"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysdecode_sockopt_name
function returns a text description of the socket option name passed in the
.Fa optname
argument to
.Xr getsockopt 2 .
.Fn sysdecode_sockopt_name
takes the socket option
.Fa level
as well as the option name to uniquely identify the option.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysdecode_sockopt_level 3
.Sh BUGS
Socket option levels and names are protocol-specific.
Both
.Fn sysdecode_sockopt_level
and
.Fn sysdecode_sockopt_name
should possibly accept the protocol family as an additional argument.
