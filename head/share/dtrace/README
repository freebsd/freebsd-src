$FreeBSD$

This directory contains scripts for use with the DTrace system.  The
toolkit/ directory contains the latest vendor import of Brendan
Gregg's DTraceToolkit while all the other files and directories
contain code generated by the FreeBSD Project for use with DTrace on
FreeBSD.

NOTE: Do not add new scripts to the DTraceToolkit contained in this
directory. New DTraceToolkit scripts should be send to the maintainer
of the toolkit and then brought back into FreeBSD via future vendor imports.
