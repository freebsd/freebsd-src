.Sh NAME

.Nm au_read_rec
.Nd "perform I/O involving an audit record"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libbsm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/libbsm.h
.Ft int
.Fn au_fetch_tok "tokenstr_t *tok" "u_char *buf" "int len"
.Ft void
.Fo au_print_tok
.Fa "FILE *outfp" "tokenstr_t *tok" "char *del" "char raw" "char sfrm"

.Ft int
.Fn au_read_rec "FILE *fp" "u_char **buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces support input and output (I/O) involving audit records,
internalizing an audit record from a byte stream, converting a token to
either a raw or default string, and reading a single record from a file.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_fetch_tok
function
reads a token from the passed buffer
.Fa buf
of length
.Fa len
bytes, and returns a pointer to the token via
.Fa tok .
.Pp
The
.Fn au_print_tok
function
prints a string form of the token
.Fa tok
to the file output stream
.Fa outfp ,
either in default mode, or raw mode if
.Fa raw
is set non-zero.
The delimiter
.Fa del
is used when printing.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_read_rec
function
reads an audit record from the file stream
.Fa fp ,
and returns an allocated memory buffer containing the record via
.Fa *buf ,
which must be freed by the caller using
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
A typical use of these routines might open a file with
.Xr fopen 3 ,
then read records from the file sequentially by calling
.Fn au_read_rec .
Each record would be broken down into components tokens through sequential
calls to
.Fn au_fetch_tok
on the buffer, and then invoking
.Fn au_print_tok
to print each token to an output stream such as
.Dv stdout .
On completion of the processing of each record, a call to
.Xr free 3
would be used to free the record buffer.
Finally, the source stream would be closed by a call to
.Xr fclose 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn au_fetch_tok
and
.Fn au_read_rec
functions
return 0 on success, or \-1 on failure along with additional error information
returned via
.Va errno .

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.

.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Va errno
variable
may not always be properly set in the event of an error.
