.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents, briefly, the \fBntpdc\fP command.
The
[= prog-name =]
utility program is used to query an NTP daemon about its
current state and to request changes in that state.
It uses NTP mode 7 control message formats described in the source code.
The program may
be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
arguments.
Extensive state and statistics information is available
through the
[= prog-name =]
interface.
In addition, nearly all the
configuration options which can be specified at startup using
ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
[= prog-name =] .


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-4 ", " \--ipv4
Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.
This option is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
.sp

.SH OPTION PRESETS
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTPDC_<option-name>\fP or \fBNTPDC\fP
.fi
.aj
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
