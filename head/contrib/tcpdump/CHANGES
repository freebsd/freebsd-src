v3.1a1 Wed May  3 19:21:11 PDT 1995

- Include time.h when SVR4 is defined to avoid problems under Solaris
  2.3.

- Fix etheraddr_string() in the ETHER_SERVICE to return the saved
  strings, not the local buffer. Thanks to Stefan Petri
  (petri@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de).

- Detect when pcap raises the snaplen (e.g. with snit). Print a warning
  that the selected value was not used. Thanks to Pascal Hennequin
  (Pascal.Hennequin@hugo.int-evry.fr).

- Add a truncated packet test to print-nfs.c. Thanks to Pascal Hennequin.

- BYTEORDER -> BYTE_ORDER Thanks to Terry Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu).

v3.0.3 Sun Oct  1 18:35:00 GMT 1995

- Although there never was a 3.0.3 release, the linux boys cleverly
  "released" one in late 1995.

v3.0.2 Thu Apr 20 21:28:16 PDT 1995

- Change configuration to not use gcc v2 flags with gcc v1.

- Redo gmt2local() so that it works under BSDI (which seems to return
  an empty timezone struct from gettimeofday()). Based on report from
  Terry Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu).

- Change configure to recognize IP[0-9]* as "mips" SGI hardware. Based
  on report from Mark Andrews (mandrews@alias.com).

- Don't pass cc flags to gcc. Resulted from a bug report from Rainer
  Orth (ro@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de).

- Fixed printout of connection id for uncompressed tcp slip packets.
  Resulted from a bug report from Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

- Add ETHERTYPE_TRAIL define which is missing from irix5.

v3.0.1 Wed Aug 31 22:42:26 PDT 1994

- Fix problems with gcc2 vs. malloc() and read() prototypes under SunOS 4.

v3.0 Mon Jun 20 19:23:27 PDT 1994

- Added support for printing tcp option timestamps thanks to
  Mark Andrews (mandrews@alias.com).

- Reorganize protocol dumpers to take const pointers to packets so they
  never change the contents (i.e., they used to do endian conversions
  in place).  Previously, whenever more than one pass was taken over
  the packet, the packet contents would be dumped incorrectly (i.e.,
  the output form -x would be wrong on little endian machines because
  the protocol dumpers would modify the data).  Thanks to Charles Hannum
  (mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu) for reporting this problem.

- Added support for decnet protocol dumping thanks to Jeff Mogul
  (mogul@pa.dec.com).

- Fix bug that caused length of packet to be incorrectly printed
  (off by ether header size) for unknown ethernet types thanks
  to Greg Miller (gmiller@kayak.mitre.org).

- Added support for IPX protocol dumping thanks to Brad Parker
  (brad@fcr.com).

- Added check to verify IP header checksum under -v thanks to
  Brad Parker (brad@fcr.com).

- Move packet capture code to new libpcap library (which is
  packaged separately).

- Prototype everything and assume an ansi compiler.

- print-arp.c: Print hardware ethernet addresses if they're not
  what we expect.

- print-bootp.c: Decode the cmu vendor field. Add RFC1497 tags.
  Many helpful suggestions from Gordon Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com).

- print-fddi.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul
  (mogul@pa.dec.com).

- print-icmp.c: Byte swap netmask before printing. Thanks to
  Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu). Print icmp type when unknown.

- print-ip.c: Print the inner ip datagram of ip-in-ip encapsulated packets.
  By default, only the inner packet is dumped, appended with the token
  "(encap)".  Under -v, both the inner and output packets are dumped
  (on the same line).  Note that the filter applies to the original packet,
  not the encapsulated packet.  So if you run tcpdump on a net with an
  IP Multicast tunnel, you cannot filter out the datagrams using the
  conventional syntax.  (You can filter away all the ip-in-ip traffic
  with "not ip proto 4".)

- print-nfs.c: Keep pending rpc's in circular table. Add generic
  nfs header and remove os dependences. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.

- print-ospf.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.

- tcpdump.c: Add -T flag allows interpretation of "vat", "wb", "rpc"
  (sunrpc) and rtp packets. Added "inbound" and "outbound" keywords
  Add && and || operators

v2.2.1 Tue Jun 6 17:57:22 PDT 1992

- Fix bug with -c flag.

v2.2 Fri May 22 17:19:41 PDT 1992

- savefile.c: Remove hack that shouldn't have been exported. Add
  truncate checks.

- Added the 'icmp' keyword.  For example, 'icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0'
  matches non-echo/reply ICMP packets.

- Many improvements to filter code optimizer.

- Added 'multicast' keyword and extended the 'broadcast' keyword can now be
  so that protocol qualifications are allowed. For example, "ip broadcast"
  and "ether multicast" are valid filters.

- Added support for monitoring the loopback interface (i.e. 'tcpdump -i lo').
  Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) contributed the kernel
  patches to netinet/if_loop.c.

- Added support for the Ungermann-Bass Ethernet on IBM/PC-RTs running AOS.
  Contact Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) for the diffs.

- Added EGP and OSPF printers, thanks to Jeffrey Honig.

v2.1 Tue Jan 28 11:00:14 PST 1992

- Internal release (never publically exported).

v2.0.1 Sun Jan 26 21:10:10 PDT

- Various byte ordering fixes.

- Add truncation checks.

- inet.c: Support BSD style SIOCGIFCONF.

- nametoaddr.c: Handle multi addresses for single host.

- optimize.c: Rewritten.

- pcap-bpf.c: don't choke when we get ptraced. only set promiscuous
  for broadcast nets.

- print-atal.c: Fix an alignment bug (thanks to
  stanonik@nprdc.navy.mil) Add missing printf() argument.

- print-bootp.c: First attempt at decoding the vendor buffer.

- print-domain.c: Fix truncation checks.

- print-icmp.c: Calculate length of packets from the ip header.

- print-ip.c: Print frag id in decimal (so it's easier to match up
  with non-frags). Add support for ospf, egp and igmp.

- print-nfs.c: Lots of changes.

- print-ntp.c: Make some verbose output depend on -v.

- print-snmp.c: New version from John LoVerso.

- print-tcp.c: Print rfc1072 tcp options.

- tcpdump.c: Print "0x" prefix for %x formats. Always print 6 digits
  (microseconds) worth of precision. Fix uid bugs.

- A packet dumper has been added (thanks to Jeff Mogul of DECWRL).
  With this option, you can create an architecture independent binary
  trace file in real time, without the overhead of the packet printer.
  At a later time, the packets can be filtered (again) and printed.

- BSD is supported.  You must have BPF in your kernel.
  Since the filtering is now done in the kernel, fewer packets are
  dropped.  In fact, with BPF and the packet dumper option, a measly
  Sun 3/50 can keep up with a busy network.

- Compressed SLIP packets can now be dumped, provided you use our
  SLIP software and BPF.  These packets are dumped as any other IP
  packet; the compressed headers are dumped with the '-e' option.

- Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported (thanks to
  Jeff Mogul).

- Ultrix 4.0 is supported (also thanks to Jeff Mogul).

- IBM RT and Stanford Enetfilter support has been added by
  Rayan Zachariassen <rayan@canet.ca>.  Tcpdump has been tested under
  both the vanilla Enetfilter interface, and the extended interface
  (#ifdef'd by IBMRTPC) present in the MERIT version of the Enetfilter.

- TFTP packets are now printed (requests only).

- BOOTP packets are now printed.

- SNMP packets are now printed. (thanks to John LoVerso of Xylogics).

- Sparc architectures, including the Sparcstation-1, are now
  supported thanks to Steve McCanne and Craig Leres.

- SunOS 4 is now supported thanks to Micky Liu of Columbia
  University (micky@cunixc.cc.columbia.edu).

- IP options are now printed.

- RIP packets are now printed.

- There's a -v flag that prints out more information than the
  default (e.g., it will enable printing of IP ttl, tos and id)
  and -q flag that prints out less (e.g., it will disable
  interpretation of AppleTalk-in-UDP).

- The grammar has undergone substantial changes (if you have an
  earlier version of tcpdump, you should re-read the manual
  entry).

  The most useful change is the addition of an expression
  syntax that lets you filter on arbitrary fields or values in the
  packet.  E.g., "ip[0] > 0x45" would print only packets with IP
  options, "tcp[13] & 3 != 0" would print only TCP SYN and FIN
  packets.

  The most painful change is that concatenation no longer means
  "and" -- e.g., you have to say "host foo and port bar" instead
  of "host foo port bar".  The up side to this down is that
  repeated qualifiers can be omitted, making most filter
  expressions shorter.  E.g., you can now say "ip host foo and
  (bar or baz)" to look at ip traffic between hosts foo and bar or
  between hosts foo and baz.  [The old way of saying this was "ip
  host foo and (ip host bar or ip host baz)".]

v2.0 Sun Jan 13 12:20:40 PST 1991

- Initial public release.
