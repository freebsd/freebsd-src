.Dt CAP_ENTER 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_enter ,
.Nm cap_getmode
.Nd Capability mode system calls
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/capability.h
.Ft int
.Fn cap_enter "void"
.Ft int
.Fn cap_getmode "u_int *modep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cap_enter
places the current process into capability mode, a mode of execution in which
processes may only issue system calls operating on file descriptors or
reading limited global system state.
Access to global name spaces, such as file system or IPC name spaces, is
prevented.
If the process is already in a capability mode sandbox, the system call is a
no-op.
Future process descendants create with
.Xr fork 2
or
.Xr pdfork 2
will be placed in capability mode from inception.
.Pp
When combined with capabilities created with
.Xr cap_new 2 ,
.Fn cap_enter
may be used to create kernel-enforced sandboxes in which
appropriately-crafted applications or application components may be run.
.Pp
.Fn cap_getmode
returns a flag indicating whether or not the process is in a capability mode
sandbox.
.Sh CAVEAT
Creating effecive process sandboxes is a tricky process that involves
identifying the least possible rights required by the process and then
passing those rights into the process in a safe manner.
See the CAVEAT
section of
.Xr cap_new 2
for why this is particularly tricky with UNIX file descriptors as the
canonical representation of a right.
Consumers of
.Fn cap_enter
should also be aware of other inherited rights, such as access to VM
resources, memory contents, and other process properties that should be
considered.
It is advisable to use
.Xr fexecve 2
to create a runtime environment inside the sandbox that has as few implicitly
acquired rights as possible.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std cap_enter cap_getmode
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cap_new 2 ,
.Xr fexecve 2
.Sh HISTORY
Support for capabilities and capabilities mode was developed as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
