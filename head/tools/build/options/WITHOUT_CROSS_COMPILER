.\" $FreeBSD$
Set to not build any cross compiler in the cross-tools stage of buildworld.
If you are compiling a different version of
.Fx
than what is installed on the system, you will need to provide an alternate
compiler with XCC to ensure success.
If you are compiling with an identical version of
.Fx
to the host, this option may be safely used.
This option may also be safe when the host version of
.Fx
is close to the sources being built, but all bets are off if there have
been any changes to the toolchain between the versions.
