From: idallen
Subject: nice is not cumulative
   % nice date
   % nice nice date

   Both have a nice of 4; nice does not accumulate.

From: idallen
Subject: no warning on integer overflow
    % @ x=99999999999999999999999
    % echo $x

From: idallen
Subject: goto seeks backwards in terminal input
    % goto x
    goto? ignored
    goto? ignored
    goto? ignored
    goto? x:
    % goto x

    The terminal is now hung - you have to break out.

From: idallen
Subject: nice applied to too many commands
    % nice +20 simple `long`

    The CSH shell applies the nice to both commands "simple" and "long".

From: idallen
Subject: redirection always happens in single-line "if"
   if ( 0 ) echo hi > date

   The file date is created empty.

From: idallen
Subject: Expanding variable with newline generates syntax error
       % set x="abc\

       Unmatched ".

From: idallen
Subject: Expanding variable with newline generates extra word
       % set x="abc\
       def"
       % echo $x
       abc  def
       % set y=( $x ) ; echo $#y
       3

From: idallen
Subject: Modifier ":e" doesn't work on history
    CSH is missing an entry in a case statement for it.

From: idallen
Subject: Shell messages appear on stdout; get redirected
    If a program in a shell script exits with a signal that the shell
    reports (e.g. Terminated), the report appears on standard output
    and if the output of the shell script is redirected the report
    gets sent there and you never find out.

From: Steve Hayman <sahayman>
Subject: No error message given for failure to NICE
    % nice -10 date
    Fri May 30 12:11:12 EDT 1986
    CSH never checks the error returns from nice().

From: Ray Butterworth <rbutterworth>
Subject: CSH history reading takes '#' as a comment
    % echo a b # c d
    a b # c d
    % exit
    % login
    % history
      ...
      99 echo a b

    '#' indicates a comment when reading from a shell script file,
    and of course CSH thinks it is reading from a file when it reads
    the history back in.

From: idallen
Subject: csh: No current job, even if only one job
    % somecommand ^Z
    Suspended
    % bg
    [1]   somecommand &
    % fg
    fg: No current job.

    The C shell always turns off the current job indicator for a job
    that is put in the background with "bg" -- even if it is the only job.

From: idallen (Ian! D. Allen)
Subject: Redirection ignored inside if ( { cmd >xxx } ) ....
    % if ( { date >out } ) echo hi
    Sun Apr 14 13:24:31 EDT 2002
    hi

    The shell does not set up its file descriptors for the forked
    command.  The redirection is completely ignored.

>From idallen
Subject: Error in CSH script causes script exit
    If a script has an error in a built-in command (e.g. redirection file not
    found), the script exits instead of continuing.

From: idallen (Ian! D. Allen)
Subject: Variables $$, $# don't accept :-modifiers
    echo   $$:q   $#:q

Subject: Variable $* (a synonym for argv) doesn't accept subscripts.
    % set argv=( a b c d )
    % echo $argv[2]
    b
    % echo $*[2]
    echo: No match.

>From idallen
Subject: Using WHICH from CSH
    The WHICH command tells the wrong thing if you've created
    a new file and haven't done a REHASH.  WHICH thinks you
    get the new file, but the CSH will give you the old one.

From: idallen (Ian! D. Allen)

    % date | echo hi
    hi
    % % jobs

    Note the duplicate prompt and spurious job entry.

    % % date | echo hi
    hi
    % % date | echo hi
    hi
    % % jobs
    [1]  + Running                       date |

Subject: Stopping jobs in list of command names throws away the rest.
    % a ; b ; c
    CSH documents that if you stop B, C will immediately start.
    It doesn't.  The rest of the list gets thrown away.

From: idallen (Ian! D. Allen)
Subject: Stopping jobs in source'd file aborts the rest of the file.
    With the file TEST containing:

        mail
        echo Hi There you never see this

    and typing

        % source TEST

    and then using ^Z to stop MAIL, the rest of the TEST file is abandoned.
    This is especially annoying in one's .login or .cshrc.

    % date; exit 99 ; date ; date
    Wed Mar 14 19:21:51 EST 1984
    Wed Mar 14 19:21:52 EST 1984
    Wed Mar 14 19:21:53 EST 1984

    The shell doesn't flush pending input when the EXIT is seen.
    The shell then exits with status 0 instead of status 99.

    Note the inability of CSH to tell you the command name used inside
    the back-quotes.

>From idallen Wed Apr 18, 1984
Subject: Inconsistent handling of variables
    The manual says that "set x=word" assigns a single word to x.
    To assign multiple words, one is supposed to use "set x=(words)".
    But, CSH allows "set x=`date`", which sets x to the many words
    resulting from `date`, and $x[1] prints "Mon".
    
    One observes that if x and y are single-word variables, the statements:
    % set x=word2
    % set y[1]=word2
    are identical; both replace the contents of the variable with word2.

    But, you can't assign a word to y[1] if y doesn't exist, even though
    you can (of course) assign a word to plain "y" if y doesn't exist.

>From idallen(Ian! D. Allen)
Subject: extra next level when nested single-line IF line ends in THEN
    Any IF line that ends in THEN is taken as another nesting level, and
    requires a corresponding ENDIF:

    if ( 0 ) then
        if ( 0 ) echo This line ends with then
    endif
    echo You do not see this.
    endif # This shouldn't be needed; but it is.

    for( i=0; i < 20; i++ ){
        printf("%d = %d\n", i, isatty(i) );

Subject: C Shells don't parse when looking for labels.
    The shells just look at the first word on each line.  You can
    cause the shell to branch in to the middle of a HERE document:

    #!/bin/csh -f
    onintr quit
    sleep 999
    cat << EOF
    quit:
    echo Amazing how this prints.
    exit 88  # this exit is taken when break is hit

    echo You never get here.

Subject: bug in CSH (history)
    There are a couple of bugs in the 'history' command of /bin/csh (and
    offspring, such as newcsh):

    1) The maximum number of arguments to the history command is set to 2.
       % history -h -r 2  # fails

>From idallen
Subject: C Shell expression operators explained

    Some odd CSH context-sensitive features.  There is ambiguity on how
    !~ != and !( should be interpreted:

       1 -  % ~idallen/study                 # a valid command line
       2 -  % !~                             # doesn't work
       3 -  % echo " !~ "                    # no history
       4 -  % if ( abc !~ def ) echo hi

       1 -  % =xxx                           # a valid command line
       2 -  % !=                             # doesn't work
       3 -  % echo " != "                    # no history
       4 -  % if ( 1 != 2 ) echo hi

       1 -  % ( date )                       # a valid command line
       2 -  % !(                             # doesn't work
       3 -  % echo " !( "                    # no history
       4 -  % if ( !( 1 + 1 ) ) echo hi

    The C Shell parser isn't clever enough to distinguish any of cases 2,
    3, or 4, so it always behaves as if the character pair was part of an
    expression, not a history substitution.

| >From idallenThu Jun 27 08:20:08 1985
| Subject: Re: Using > vs. | on shell built-in commands.
| 
|     CSH cannot put the output of the JOBS command into a pipe.  In fact,
|     the output is going into the pipe, but the output is empty.  You
|     couldn't know this, but these shells implement piped built-in commands
|     by forking the shell to create an independent process for which the
|     main shell can wait.  But the internal process table is cleaned
|     out after a fork(), since a forked shell is just like a subshell
|     and must have its own clean process table in which to enter its own
|     running jobs.  So by the time the JOBS command executes, it's in a
|     child shell that has no jobs running.  Hence, the output is empty.
|     "echo `jobs`" and "( jobs )" are both empty, for the same reason.

From: jjg@security.UUCP (Jeff Glass)
Subject: csh and I/O redirection

    put these four lines in a file, say cshtest :

        #! /bin/csh -f
        cat << END | ( sh & )
        echo hi there
        END

    ( the intent is to send some commands to sh to be executed in the
    background, without csh printing the job number of the sh. )

    now, from csh, enter the command

        source cshtest

    and note that you see the message "hi there".
    now enter the commands

        chmod +x cshtest
        ./cshtest

    and you get no output.

    removing either the parentheses or the ampersand causes the message
    to appear, but not quietly in the background.  I don't understand why
    it works when source'd but not when exec'd, either.

|     Here's a pointless little csh puzzle:  In the c-shell, it is

|         % setenv "FOO BAR" quux
| 
|     The printenv builtin will show it residing happily in the

|     TO the value of this variable, using only csh builtins?  In
|     other words, is there an <expression> such that
| 
|         % echo <expression>
| 
|     will print "quux" on the screen, where <expression> is formed
|     only from csh commands?

    There are at least two different-sized null strings in csh.
    But sometimes they are equal anyway.

I sent a note to the FreeBSD release engineers and they're inclined 
to hold off on including the new version in the release which they're 
branching later today. If DP2 slips out a bit they might consider 
including it. I'd say go ahead with your current schedule and I'll 
import it whenever it is available. I definitely will be including it 
into the next -stable FreeBSD 4.7 release.

BTW, one of the release engineers pointed out a bug with using 
jobcmd. If you use the example in the book to update an xterm and 
then run something like
    grep bar `cat file.list`
It screws up the xterm title bar containing "Faulty alias 'jobcmd' 
removed" plus the list of files from the cat command.

The good news is that I was able to reproduce this at home last 
night. The bad news is that it is working fine right now here at 
work. Oh wait, let me log in remotely and look at the alias I was 
using...got it! The command fails if you use:

     alias jobcmd 'echo -n "^[]2;\!#^G"'

but works fine if you use: (note the switch of ' and " quotes)

     alias jobcmd "echo -n '^[]2;\!#^G'"

Note: I used the above by vi'ing a file and sourcing it from the shell.

If you can confirm, I think this just needs to be updated in the man page.

>Thanks for all the help BTW...

No problem. I like fixing bugs and contributing code...especially for 
a great piece of software like tcsh that I use *all* the time. Thank 
you for keeping it going!
