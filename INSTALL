Building the Source Tree
========================

The core libraries and utilities that make up the software release are
always built by default.  Builds of the project's test suites (in the
``test/`` subdirectory), and of additional documentation (in the directory
``documentation/``) are optional, and will only be attempted if these
directories are present.

Prerequisites
-------------

:DragonFly BSD 5.2:
    - The core libraries and utilities should build out of the box on
      a stock install of DragonFly BSD.

    - To build and run the test suite:

      #. The current release of the `Test Execution Toolkit`_ needs to
         be downloaded and unpacked into the ``test/tet/`` directory.

      #. The ``py27-yaml`` package needs to be installed::

            % sudo pkg install py27-yaml

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported
      under DragonFly BSD.

:FreeBSD 11.2:
    - The core libraries and utilities should build out of the box on
      a stock install of FreeBSD.

    - To build and run the test suite:

      #. The current release of the `Test Execution Toolkit`_ needs to
         be downloaded and unpacked into the ``test/tet/`` directory::

            % cd <SRCDIR>/test/tet
            % tar -xf /PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/TET-3.8-SOURCES

      #. The ``python`` and ``py27-yaml`` packages need to be installed::

            % sudo pkg install python py27-yaml

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported under
      FreeBSD 11.2.

:Minix 3.2.0:
    - The following packages are pre-requisites for building the
      sources on Minix 3.2.0:

      ===================     =====================================

      The following command line may be used to install the necessary
      pre-requisites::

          # pkgin install gcc44

    - The test suites cannot currently be built under Minix.

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported
      under Minix.

:OpenBSD 6.3:
    - The following packages are pre-requisites for building the
      sources on OpenBSD 6.3:

      ===================     =====================================
      **Package**             **Description**
      ===================     =====================================
      ``libarchive``          An archive access library.
      ===================     =====================================

      The following command line may be used to install the necessary
      pre-requisites::

          # pkg_add libarchive

    - The test suites cannot currently be built under OpenBSD.

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported
      under OpenBSD.

:NetBSD 7.1.2:
    - The core libraries and utilities should build out of the box on
      a stock install of NetBSD 7.1.2.

    - To build and run the test suite:

      #. The current release of the `Test Execution Toolkit`_, needs
         to be downloaded and unpacked into the ``test/tet/``
         directory.

      #. The following additional package needs to be installed, as
         listed in the example command line below ::

            % sudo pkgin install py27-yaml

    - Building additional documentation is not currently supported
      under NetBSD.

:Ubuntu GNU/Linux 17.10:

Building the software
---------------------

The software may be built by running **make**.

On `DragonFly BSD`_,  FreeBSD_, Minix_, NetBSD_ and OpenBSD_, use::

  % make

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **bmake** package installed, use::

  % bmake


Testing the software
---------------------

The ``run-tests`` target in the top-level Makefile will build and
execute the test suites that are part of this software.

On `DragonFly BSD`_, FreeBSD_ and NetBSD_, use::

    % make run-tests

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **bmake** package installed, use::

    % bmake run-tests

Installing the Software
=======================

The software may be installed using the ``install`` target.

On `DragonFly BSD`_, FreeBSD_, Minix_, NetBSD_ and OpenBSD_ use::

    % make install

On Ubuntu GNU/Linux with the **bmake** package installed, use::

    % bmake install


By default the ``install`` target will install utilities into
``/usr/bin/``, libraries into ``/usr/lib/`` and manual pages into
``/usr/share/man/man[0-9]/``.

The installation directory may be changed using the ``DESTDIR``
variable.  For example::

    % bmake DESTDIR=$HOME/local install
