.SH NAME
kdb_util \-  Kerberos key distribution center database utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
kdb_util 
.B operation filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kdb_util
allows the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) database administrator to
perform utility functions on the database.
.PP
.I Operation
must be one of the following:
.TP 10n
.I load
initializes the KDC database with the records described by the
text contained in the file
.IR filename .
Any existing database is overwritten.
.TP
.I dump
dumps the KDC database into a text representation in the file
.IR filename .
.TP
.I slave_dump
performs a database dump like the
.I dump
operation, and additionally creates a semaphore file signalling the
propagation software that an update is available for distribution to
slave KDC databases.
.TP
.I new_master_key
prompts for the old and new master key strings, and then dumps the KDC
database into a text representation in the file
.IR filename .
The keys in the text representation are encrypted in the new master key.
.TP
.I convert_old_db
prompts for the master key string, and then dumps the KDC database into
a text representation in the file
.IR filename .
The existing database is assumed to be encrypted using the old format
(encrypted by the key schedule of the master key); the dumped database
is encrypted using the new format (encrypted directly with master key).
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 20n
"verify_master_key: Invalid master key, does not match database."
The master key string entered was incorrect.
.SH FILES
.TP 20n
/etc/kerberosIV/principal.db

.TP
.IR filename .dump_ok
