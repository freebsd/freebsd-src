	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When preserving links, unlink
	a destination with link count greater than one.  This is so
	that commands like "cp -a" don't get confused when copying into
	a destination that already contains many hard links.  Problem
	reported by Tim Waugh in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-08/msg00053.html

2004-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	A null file arg means standard output.
	(main): "-o -" means to write to a file named "-",
	not to standard output.
	* src/tee.c (usage, tee): "tee -" writes to standard output, not

2004-08-10  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Fix int->bool conversion
	bugs introduced on 2004-07-29.

2004-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	needed for concatenation contexts.
	(INTMAX_MAX, INTMAX_MIN): New macros.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Don't assume st_ino / st_dev fits in

2004-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H (not HAVE_SYSCTL).
	(main) [defined __POWERPC__]: Add a kludge to work around a
	Mac OS X bug, so that uname -p defaults to "powerpc" if

	(main): No need to pass a non-NULL last arg to getopt_long.
	* src/who.c (do_lookup, short_list, short_output, include_idle,
	include_heading, include_mesg, include_exit, need_boottime,
	need_deadprocs, need_login, need_initspawn, need_clockchange,
	need_runlevel, need_users, my_line_only, main): Use bool for booleans.
	(print_runlevel): Use unsigned char for bytes.
	(list_entries_who, scan_entries, who): Use size_t for sizes.
	(main): No need to pass a non-NULL last arg to getopt_long.

	* src/install.c (isdir): Remove decl.
	(install_file_to_path): Rely on make_path to fail if the destination
	is not a directory, by passing preserve_existing==true to it.
	Hence we no longer need to call isdir.
	Free dest_dir immediately when it's no longer needed, rather than
	waiting until the end of the function.
	(copy_file): Don't bother calling isdir, as copy will do the
	right thing if the destination is a directory.

	* src/du.c (fts_debug, opt_all, apparent_size, opt_count_all,
	print_grand_total, opt_separate_dirs, hash_ins, process_file, main):
	Use bool for booleans.
	(max_depth): Now size_t, not int, to avoid an arbitrary limit
	of INT_MAX on depth.
	(G_fail): Remove: no longer needed, now that the relevant
	functions return bool.
	(process_file): Use return value to signal success rather than
	setting a global.  Remove first_call static var; not needed, since
	we can look at n_alloc.  Use size_t for depths.  Remove FIXME
	about size_t casts, as it's now fixed.  Use xnrealloc rather
	than the obsolescent XREALLOC.  Don't bother to check whether
	reallocation is needed unless level > prev_level.
	(du_files): Invert sense of result, for consistency with
	other coreutils code.  All callers changed.
	(main): Allow --max-depth values up to SIZE_MAX.

	* src/df.c (inode_format, show_all_fs, show_local_fs,
	show_listed_fs, posix_format, require_sync, print_type,
	selected_fstype, excluded_fstype, show_dev, show_point, main):
	Use bool for booleans.
	(df_readable, show_dev): Use UINTMAX_MAX instead of -1.
	(show_dev, show_point, main):
	Use EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE instead of 0/1.
	Don't assume disk name lengths are <= INT_MAX.
	Rewrite pct calculation to avoid cast.
	(show_point): Don't assume resolved length is <= SSIZE_MAX.

	* src/cut.c (hash_int) [!defined UINTPTR_MAX]: Use size_t
	instead of uintptr_t.
	* src/shred.c (UINT_MAX_32_BITS): Remove.
	(word32): Remove.  All uses changed to uint32_t.
	(isaac_seed_data): Remove unnecessary cast.
	* src/system.h (ptr_align): Use size_t; in practice, this is just as
	good as uintptr_t in checking for alignments, and has fewer
	configuration hassles.

	* src/Makefile.am (localedir.h): Make it readonly; this
	undoes part of the 2004-07-27 patch.

2004-07-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (UCHAR): Remove; all uses changed to to_uchar.
	(IS_THOUSANDS_SEP): Use bool when appropriate.
	(numcompare, main): Use char, not int, when the value is always a char.
	(numcompare): Remove "register"; compilers are smart enough these days.
	* src/system.h (errno, CHAR_BIT): Remove decls;
	no longer needed now we assume C89 or better.
	Include <inttypes.h> before <stdint.h>, as it's the
	Autoconf-recommended pattern.
	(to_uchar): New inline function, moved here from tr.c.
	Use full names for int types, e.g. "long int" rather than "long".
	* src/tr.c (to_uchar): Remove; now in system.h.
	(is_char_class_member): Use bool when appropriate.

	* src/mkdir.c (create_parents, main): Use bool when appropriate.
	(main): Use EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE instead of 0/1.

2004-07-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/mkfifo.c (main): Use EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE, not 0 and 1.

	* src/chmod.c (recurse, force_silent, process_file, process_files,
	main): Use bool when appropriate.
	* src/cksum.c (cksum, main): Likewise.
	* src/comm.c (hard_LC_COLLATE, only_file_1, only_file_2, both,
	compare_files, main): Likewise.

	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal, is_ancestor, copy_dir, copy_reg,
	same_file_ok, seen_file, copy_internal, valid_options, copy): Likewise.
	* src/cp-hash.h (remember_created): Likewise.
	* src/cp-hash.c (remember_created): Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (struct dir_attr, flag_path, remove_trailing_slashes,
	re_protect, make_path_private, target_directory_operand, do_copy,
	cp_option_init, decode_preserve_arg, main): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (isdir, change_timestamps, change_attributes,
	copy_file, install_file_to_path, install_file_in_dir,
	install_file_in_file, strip_files, dir_arg, cp_option_init, main,
	change_attributes, change_timestamps): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (remove_trailing_slashes, rm_option_init,
	cp_option_init, do_move, movefile, main): Likewise.
	* src/remove.c (right_justify), full_filename_, AD_pop_and_chdir,
	AD_push, prompt, remove_dir): Likewise.
	* src/rm.c (rm_option_init, main): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (top_dir, pop_dir, full_filename_):
	Use size_t for sizes.
	* src/cp.c (target_directory_operand): Do not clear *NEW_DST if stat
	succeeds.  It's not necessary in that case, as *NEW_DST is always
	false already.
	(do_copy): Rewrite slightly to avoid need for "unreachable" comment.
	(main): Use EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE instead of 0, 1.
	* src/rm.c (main): Likewise.

	md5sum, sha1sum integer cleanups.

	* src/checksum.h: Don't include config.h, sys/types.h, stdio.h:
	not needed.
	(ALG_UNSPECIFIED): Remove.
	(ALG_MDT): Don't make it equal to CHAR_MAX + 1; this isn't necessary.
	* src/md5.c: Don't include any files other than checksum.h.
	* src/sha1sum.c: Likewise.
	* src/md5sum.c (OPENOPTS, have_read_stdin, status_only, warn,
	bsd_split_3, split_3, hex_digits, digest_file, digest_check, main):
	Use bool when appropriate.
	(digest_check): Increase limit of number of input lines to
	UINTMAX_MAX from INT_MAX.  Diagnose any overflows of this counter.
	Use ngettext instead of hard-to-i18nize hardcoded stuff for plurals.

2004-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cat.c (exit_status): Remove.  Now done by passing a boolean
	'ok' flag around.
	(simple_cat, cat): Return true if successful.  All callers changed.
	(simple_cat, cat, main): Use bool for booleans.
	(simple_cat): Use size_t for sizes.
	(cat, main): Use the same names for parameters that we use for
	long options, to avoid confusion.  This inverts the sense of the
	show_tabs (formerly output_tabs) and number_nonblank
	(formerly numbers_at_empty_lines) variables.
	(main): Don't mess up (due to integer overflow) if we are given
	INT_MAX - INT_MIN + 1 options.
	[O_BINARY]: Don't invoke isatty unless the other options require it.
	(main): When deciding whether to use simple_cat, don't worry
	about binary option; it's irrelevant.

	* src/dcgen: Remove comments, trailing white space, and empty
	lines from the output strings, to save space.
	Use a narrower type like 'unsigned char' for line lengths, if
	that will do.
	Make the output variables static, not extern.

	* src/chgrp.c (parse_group): Require base 10 when parsing
	groups as integers.
	(main): int -> bool when appropriate.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c: Include inttostr.h.
	(UINT_MAX_DECIMAL_DIGITS, uint_to_string): Remove.
	(gid_to_name, uid_to_name): Use imaxtostr/umaxtostr
	instead of uint_to_string).
	(describe_change): Instead of an int flag, use a char *
	auxiliary; this avoids the need for casts.
	Assume free (NULL) works.
	(change_file_owner): Return true/false, not 0/-1, since
	we don't set errno.  All callers changed.
	Use bool when appropriate.
	(chown_files): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.h (chown_files): Likewise.

	* tests/chown/basic: Test for proper handling of uids like
	"010", which must be parsed as decimal.

	* tests/misc/pwd: Don't assume that Perl's getpwd agrees with our
	pwd when there are multiple names for the working directory
	(which can happen with an automounter, sigh).

	* src/Makefile.am ($(SCRIPTS)): Don't depend on Makefile;
	this causes Solaris 8 'make' to refuse to build "groups".
	(localedir.h): Don't depend on Makefile: this causes Solaris
	8 'make' to build localedir.h unnecessarily.  The dependence
	on Makefile is ineffective anyway, since $(localedir) might
	change even if Makefile hasn't.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): If we can't save the state of the
	working directory, pretend we started from "/", not ".".
	This avoids a bug on hosts like Solaris that don't let you
	remove the working directory.

2004-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/printf.c (strtiomax, strtoumax): Declare if not already
	declared: this fixes a portability bug with Solaris 8 + GCC.
	(STRTOX): Parenthesize use of macro arg as expression.
	(vstrtoimax, vstrtoumax, vstrtold): Remove now-unnecessary
	parentheses.
	* configure.ac: Check for declaration of strtoumax, for
	src/printf.c.

	* src/Makefile.am (cp_LDADD, ginstall_LDADD, mv_LDADD,
	pathchk_LDADD, rm_LDADD, test_LDADD): New vars, for eaccess.

	* tests/readlink/can-e: Don't assume that we can remove the
	working directory: this isn't possible under Solaris 8, say.
	* tests/readlink/can-f: Likewise.
	* tests/readlink/can-m: Likewise.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): find_backup_file_name no longer
	returns NULL, so don't bother to check for this.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (do_link): Likewise.

2004-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/nice.c (GET_NICE_VALUE): Renamed from GET_PRIORITY.
	All uses changed.
	(NZERO): New macro, if system doesn't define it already.
	(usage): Distinguish priorities from nice values.
	Don't assume NZERO is 20.
	(main): Use bool instead of int where appropriate.
	If user specifies an adjustment out of range, always truncate it
	to an inrange value instead of sometimes giving an error message
	and sometimes not.
	Do not assume that -1 is an error return from "nice" or
	"getpriority", as it might be the current nice value minus NZERO.
	If nice/setpriority fails with errno == EPERM, go ahead and run
	the command anyway; POSIX requires this.

	* src/pathchk.c: Include euidaccess.h.
	(dir_ok): Use euidaccess, not access.
	* src/test.c (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK, FOK): Remove; system.h defines them.
	(eaccess): Remove.  All users changed to use euidaccess instead.

2004-07-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime) [defined BOOT_MSG]:
	Don't assume ut_line is null-terminated.
	* src/who.c (print_line): New arguments USERLEN and LINELEN,
	since USER and LINE might not be null terminated.  All callers
	changed.

2004-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug with "tail -f" reported by Rob Holland in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-07/msg00054.html>.
	Also, remove the undocumented and unsupported-since-2000
	--max-consecutive-size-changes options.  Fix another related bug:
	"tail" got confused if stdin, stdout, or stderr were closed.
	Also, use output buffering even with "tail -f".

	* NEWS: Document this, plus yesterday's patch.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tail invocation): "size has remained the same"
	-> "file has not changed", which is more accurate for fifos.
	* src/tail.c: Include fcntl-safer.h.
	(COPY_TO_EOF): Set to UINTMAX_MAX, not OFF_T_MAX (which was wrong).
	(COPY_A_BUFFER): New macro.
	(struct File_spec): New members mtime, mode, blocking.
	Remove member n_consecutive_size_changes.
	(DEFAULT_MAX_N_CONSECUTIVE_SIZE_CHANGES,
	max_n_consecutive_size_changes_between_opens,
	MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SIZE_CHANGES_OPTION): Remove.
	(long_options, tail_forever, parse_options):
	Remove (non-)support for --max-consecutive-size-changes.
	(record_open_fd): New function.
	(recheck, tail_file): Use it.  Don't assume that stdin is open.
	(dump_remainder): Add support for new COPY_A_BUFFER special value.
	Treat errno==EAGAIN like EOF, since it might be a nonblocking read.
	(recheck): New arg BLOCKING, specifying whether to use blocking reads.
	All uses changed.
	(n_live_files): Remove, replacing with...
	(any_live_files): New function.  All uses changed.
	(tail_forever): Use nonblocking I/O unless we know that blocking I/O
	is safe; this avoids some hangs when reading from a fifo.
	Avoid invoking fstat or sleep when using blocking I/O.
	Do not check for changes to size if the file is not a regular file,
	as the size is undefined in that case.
	Check for changes to mtime or mode, too; this works for non-regular
	files.
	(tail_forever, main): Redo fflush strategy to work even when input
	is nonblocking.  Don't use unbuffered output; just flush when needed.

2004-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tail.c (main): Ignore -f if no file operand is specified
	and standard input is a pipe.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tail invocation): Do not ignore -f for
	all pipes, just for when standard input is a pipe and no
	file operand is specified.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm: Reinstate f-1 test, since we now pass.
	Add a new commented-out f-2 test, which we still fail.
	(test_vector): All f-* tests are special cases, not just f-1.

2004-07-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uptime.c: Include c-strtod.h.
	(print_uptime): Use c_strtod instead of setlocale and sscanf.
	Use long int rather than int to count days (for 64-bit hosts),
	and check for arithmetic overflow when converting double to time_t.

2004-07-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/printf.c (vstrtold): Renamed from vstrtod.
	Now returns long double.  All uses changed.
	(print_direc): Use "L" length modifier when printing floating point
	numbers, since we're now printing long double.

2004-07-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Version 5.3.0.

	printf cleanup, to avoid undefined behavior, to add support for
	formats that Bash supports, and to support wide integers like
	Bash does.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/printf.c (UNSPECIFIED): Remove.  All uses now replaced by
	booleans, so that we don't reserve any values for precision or
	width (like Bash).
	(STRTOX): Use prototype, not K&R-style definition.
	(vstrtoimax): Renamed from xstrtol (to avoid confusion with xstrtol
	in ../lib), with type change to intmax_t.
	All uses changed.
	(vstrtoumax): Renamed from xstrtoul, with type change to uintmax_t.
	All uses changed.
	(vstrtod): Renamed from xstrtod.  All uses changed.
	(print_direc): Use boolean arg instead of special value to indicate
	a missing precision or width.  LENGTH no longer includes
	length modifiers or conversion character.  New arg CONVERSION
	now specifies conversion character.
	Use intmax_t-width formatting for integers (like Bash).
	Add support for C99 %a, %A, %F (like Bash).
	Add support for field width with %c (POSIX requires this).
	Add a FIXME for lack of support for field width and precision
	for %b.
	Add support for '\'', '0' flags.
	Check for invalid combinations of flags, field width, precision,
	and conversion, to prevent use of undefined behavior.
	Allow multiple length modifiers, for formats like "%lld" (like Bash).
	Add support for C99 'j', 't', 'z' length modifiers (like Bash).
	In error message, output entire invalid conversion specification,
	instead of merely outputting % followed by the conversion char.
	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the above.

2004-04-03  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	Change "readlink -f" to be more compatible with prior implementations.
	Add more canonicalize options, -e and -m.
	Add comprehensive tests for all readlink modes.

	* m4/canonicalize.m4 (AC_FUNC_CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME):
	Do not add canonicalize.c here.

	* src/readlink.c (longopts): Add new options.
	(usage): Document them.
	(canonicalize_fname): New proxy function.
	(main): Handle new options.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (readlink invocation): Document new
	"readlink -f" behaviour and new canonicalize options, -e and -m.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add tests/readlink/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add readlink.
	* tests/readlink/Makefile.am: New file.
	* tests/readlink/{rl-1,can-e,can-f,can-m}: New readlink tests.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove basic readlink test.
	* tests/misc/readlink: Remove file.

2004-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Add a FIXME comment.

2004-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_dir): Assume path_concat returns non-NULL.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (movefile): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (make_path_private): 2nd arg is now size_t, not int,
	to avoid problem when path_concat dir name is longer than 2 GiB (!).

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't pass NULL first argument to path_concat.
	This cleans up the semantics a bit, as we no longer try to open the
	same file twice.

2004-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Add short names -t and -T for --target-directory
	and --no-target-directory options, respectively.

	* src/cp.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION):
	Remove.  All uses changed to 'T' and 't', respectively.
	* src/install.c, src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (long_opts, usage, do_copy, main): Add -t and -T as
	aliases for --target-directory and --no-target-directory,
	respectively.
	* src/install.c (long_options, main, usage): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.

2004-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_file_system): New target.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	.x-sc_file_system: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* man/sync.x: Use "file system" rather than "filesystem".
	* man/stat.x, man/df.x: Likewise.

2004-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (usage, main): Output "file system" rather than
	"filesystem".
	* src/du.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (long_options, usage): Rename "--filesystem" to
	"--file-system".  But keep the old name around, for compatibility
	reasons.

2004-06-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add support for --no-target-directory option.

	* NEWS: Document it.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Common options, Target directory, cp
	invocation, install invocation, mv invocation, ln invocation):
	Likewise.
	(link invocation): Explain how to rewrite link using ln now
	that we have --no-target-directory.
	(ln invocation): Explain that --no-target-directory subsumes
	--no-dereference.
	(unlink invocation): Modify wording to match new wording in
	link invocation.

	* src/cp.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION): New constant.
	(long_opts, usage, do_copy, main): Add support for
	--no-target-directory,
	* src/install.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, main,
	usage): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, usage,
	main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, usage,
	main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (enum): Sort values.

2004-06-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't let verbose-mode output from a subshell obscure actual differences.
	* tests/rm/inaccessible: Turn off command-echoing just before
	invoking subshell, then turn it back on if VERBOSE=yes afterward.

2004-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add support for 'install --target-directory', an option
	that has been documented for years but not implemented (!).
	* doc/coreutils.texi (install invocation): Document
	--target-directory in synopsis, too.
	* src/install.c (TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION): New var.
	(long_options, main, usage): Add --target-directory.
	(target_directory_operand): New function, stolen from mv.c.
	(main): Use it.  Check for -d and --target-directory.
	Alter wording of diagnostics to match other programs.

2004-06-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (usage): Fix copy+paste error in description of
	--target-directory: s/move/copy/.  From Paul Jarc.

2004-06-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use more-consistent rules among cp, ln, and mv when dealing with
	last operands that are (or look like) directories.

	* src/cp.c (target_directory_operand): New, nearly-common function,
	It reports an error if the destination appears to be a directory
	(e.g., because it has a trailing slash) but is not.
	* src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Use it.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Don't assume argc is positive.
	Don't bother to lstat dest, since copy() will do that for us.
	Use "const" to avoid the need for cast.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Don't output a usage message because of file
	problems (e.g., an operand is not a directory).  Use it only for
	syntax.  Standardize on "target %s is not a directory" for the
	diagnostic.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Remove test for trailing slash, since
	target_directory_operand now does this.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (movefile): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (main): Reject multiple target directories.
	Check whether a specified target is a directory when parsing the
	options, using stat.  This gives more-accurate diagnostics.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/ln.c (isdir): Remove decl; no longer needed.
	* src/mv.c (isdir, lstat): Likewise.

	* src/ln.c (do_link): New arg dest_is_dir.  All uses changed.
	Don't check the destination ourself; rely on dest_is_dir.
	This way we can avoid lstatting the destination in the
	usual case, and in the worst case we lstat 1, not 3 times.
	Don't bother to unlink unless link failed; this saves a syscall.
	Remove unnecessary backup_succeeded flag;
	it was identical to "dest_backup != NULL".

	* src/ln.c (main): Use int to count to argc, not unsigned int.
	This handles negative operand counts.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/mv.c (do_move): Don't call hash_init; expect the caller to
	do it, for consistency with cp.c and ln.c.  All callers changed.
	(movefile): dest_is_dir parameter is now bool, not int.
	(main): Standardize on "missing destination file operand after %s"
	for the diagnostic, for consistency with cp.c.

	* tests/mv/diag: Don't assume "mv --target=nonexistentdir"
	will complain about the arg count.
	Adjust to new (briefer) diagnostics.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Add a test to verify that we get the new
	diagnostic when failing to copy through a symlink-to-inaccessible-dir.

	Fix a bug: formerly, if d/x was a directory and x a file, "ln x
	d/" incorrectly created a link d/x/x.  It also saves some system
	calls.

	* NEWS: Document the fix.

	* src/ln.c (main): Don't append basename to dest if this
	results in an existing directory name.
	* tests/ln/misc: See whether a trailing slash is followed too far.

2004-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/printf.c (main): When given no arguments, print the standard
	"missing operand\nTry printf --help..." message -- to be consistent.

2004-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mknod.c (main): Add \n at the end of message output via fprintf.

2004-06-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ln/misc: Add test for ln subscript error.

2004-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Remove unnecessary call to lstat.
	(main): Avoid subscript error when the destination is "".

2004-06-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/*: Replace all occurrences of `(exit N); exit' with
	`(exit N); exit N'.  Otherwise, those many tests could exit with
	improper exit status when exiting via e.g., a trapped interrupt.
	Thanks to a report from Bob Proulx.

2004-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (idle_string, print_user): New arg boottime,
	specifying the most recent boot time.  All uses changed.
	(idle_string) Consider a line to be "old" if it hasn't been used
	since the last boot time.  Watch out for overflow when computing
	times, and for times in the future.
	(idle_string): Record latest boot time.

2004-06-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (usage): Correct description of `-t FD'.  The file
	descriptor, FD, is no longer optional.  Reported by Ton Nijkes.

2004-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	The 2004-06-19 fix for who and pinky was incomplete, as ctime
	has undefined behavior if the year precedes -999 or follows 9999.
	Since we have to stop using ctime anyway, we might as well use
	strftime and fix the FIXME, and support internationalized dates.

	* NEWS: Document the new behavior.
	* src/who.c: Include "hard-locale.h".
	(time_format, time_format_width): New vars.
	(time_string, print_line): Use them.
	(main): Set them.
	(time_string): Use localtime + strftime instead of
	ctime, to avoid problems with years before -999 or after 9999.
	* src/pinky.c: Likewise.

2004-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug: GNU 'ls' didn't count columns correctly if user or group
	names contained multibyte characters where the column count
	differed from the byte count.  This patch also corrects
	some comments.

	* src/ls.c (format_user_or_group): New function, which counts
	columns correctly.
	(format_user, format_group): Use it.
	(format_user_or_group_width): New function, which counts columns
	correctly.
	(format_user_width, format_group_width): Use it.

2004-06-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/priv-check: Quote "$PATH" in PATH=$PATH.
	Suggestion from Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/priv-check: When running as root, be sure to propagate
	PATH through to the process we exec as non-root.
	Reported by michael@aplatform.com.

	* src/mknod.c (main): Don't segfault when calculating the
	expected number of operands for `mknod NAME'.

	* src/basename.c (main):
	Standardize on the diagnostics given when someone gives

	* NEWS: document this.

2004-06-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Switch back to

	`GNU' to the parenthesized package name in --version output.
	Before, the first argument from AC_INIT, `GNU coreutils', would
	be propagated to the PACKAGE variable.	Now, `GNU ' is trimmed.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

2004-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	would clash with a typedef in Tru64's <sys/types.h>.  From Albert Chin.

2004-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove more special cases for POSIXLY_CORRECT when POSIX

2004-06-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove special cases for POSIXLY_CORRECT when POSIX allows
	the GNU behavior.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (pr invocation, unlink invocation): Document this.
	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Pay attention to TABSIZE even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  POSIX reserves upper-case environment
	variables to the implementation, so it's OK for ls to depend on
	TABSIZE.
	* src/pr.c: Include "hard-locale.h".
	(main): When in a non-POSIX locale, ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT, since
	POSIX specifies the behavior only in the POSIX locale.
	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Support \x, \u, \U even if POSIXLY_CORRECT,
	since POSIX says the behavior is unspecified here.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolescent_option): Support multiple file operands
	even if POSIXLY_CORRECT, since POSIX does not require a diagnostic.
	* src/printf.c (main): Recognize --help, --version even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.  POSIX does not specify any options, but it
	does not prohibit options either, so "printf" is like "expr" here.
	* src/unlink.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/misc/printf: Adjust to the new semantics for \x if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.

2004-06-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/pwd: New test, for fix of 2004-04-19.

2004-06-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (PIDSTR_DECL_AND_INIT): Don't assume pid_t fits in int.
	(UT_ID) [!HAVE_STRUCT_XTMP_UT_ID]: Remove bogus comment,
	as (sizeof "??") reliably returns 3.
	(print_line): Guard against idle and pid being too long
	(which is possible when printing headers).
	(print_user): Allocate enough bytes for idlestr.  Use IDLESTR_LEN.
	Avoid unnecessary cast of sizeof to int.
	(make_id_equals_comment): Do not assume that UT_ID returns
	a string; it might return a non-null-terminated array.
	Use strncat instead.  It's not very often where strncat is
	exactly what you want, but this is one of those rare cases.

2004-06-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (list_entries_who): Don't output a trailing space.

2004-06-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (usage): Improve wording in description of the
	--time=WORD option.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Change names of parameters
	old_uid and old_gid to required_uid and required_gid respectively.

	* src/chmod.c (mode_changed): Return false, not 0, now that the
	function returns `bool'.

2004-06-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust chmod and chown to be similar if -c or -v are given.  In
	particular, a no-op chown is no longer reported as a change; this
	reverts to previous behavior.  Also, fix both commands so that -v
	report failures even if the failure is not due to the chmod or
	chown syscalls.

	* src/chmod.c (CH_NOT_APPLIED): New constant.
	(describe_change): Handle it.
	(process_file): Use it, if a symlink wasn't changed.
	(mode_changed): Return bool, not int.  Accept new argument
	NEW_MODE; all callers changed.  This lets us avoid statting the
	file unless the new mode has unusual bits.
	(process_file): Return -1 on error.  With -v, report all errors
	verbosely, not just some.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Return -1 on error, not
	1 sometimes and -1 on others.  Our caller ORs together our results,
	and (-1 | 1) == 0 on ones-complement hosts.
	With -v report all errors verbosely, not just some.
	Fix bug when chopt->root_dev_ino && !chopt->affect_symlink_referent:
	file_stats wasn't set properly in that case.

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Adjust to above changes.

2004-05-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Test that chgrp -h does not fail on
	symlinks, even on hosts where that's not supported.
	Test that if -R is specified without -H or L, -h is assumed.
	Test that chown() is not optimized away.

2004-05-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Several fixes to chgrp and chown for compatibility with POSIX and BSD:

	  Check for incompatible options.  When -R and --dereference are
	  both used, then either -H or -L must also be used.  When -R and -h
	  are both used, then -P must be in effect.

	  -H, -L, and -P have no effect unless -R is also specified.
	  If -P and -R are both specified, -h is assumed.

	  Do not optimize away the chown() system call when the file's owner
	  and group already have the desired value.  This optimization was
	  incorrect, as it failed to updated the last-changed time and reset
	  special permission bits, as POSIX requires.

	  Do not report an error if the owner or group of a
	  recursively-encountered symbolic link cannot be updated because
	  the file system does not support it.

	* NEWS: Document the above.

	* src/chgrp.c (main): Check for incompatible options.  -R --dereference
	requires either -H or -L, and -R -h requires -P.  If -H, specify
	FTS_PHYSICAL as well as FTS_COMFOLLOW; this is faster.  Make this
	file as much like chown.c as possible.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Use ent->fts_statp only if
	needed.  Chown a directory only after chowning its children; this
	avoids problems if the new directory ownership doesn't permit
	access to the children.  Dereference symlinks before doing
	ROOT_DEV_INO_CHECK, not after, so that we catch symlinks to /.
	Do not optimize away the chown() system call when the file's owner
	and group already have the desired value.  POSIX does not permit
	this optimization.  Rely on chown and lchown to do the right
	thing with symlinks and/or -1 arguments, now that we have wrappers
	to do this.  Use ENOTSUPP not ENOSYS, and ignore all ENOTSUPP
	errors, not just command-line errors.
	(chown_files): Pass FTS_NOSTAT to xfts_open if we don't need file status.

	* src/system.h (ENOTSUP): Remove.

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Use chown --from to discover whether the
	group changed, since chgrp now changes unconditionally.  This
	complicates the sed script a bit.  Do not specify --dereference,
	since it's the default (and we want to test this).  Adjust output
	to match the fact that chgrp no longer optimizes the case of
	changing a file's group to the same value as before.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Do not attempt to combine -h and -H; these
	options are incompatible, and their behavior is undefined with POSIX.
	(changed, not_changed): Adjust to match the fact that -h is no longer
	specified.  Sort names.
	* tests/chown/deref: Adjust error-diagnostic spelling to match new
	behavior.

2004-06-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uname.c (main): Fix typo introduced on 2003-05-10 that
	prevented a diagnostic of any operands.

2004-06-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (direct_mode): Turn it on/off with directio, too.

2004-06-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Enable direct-mode I/O (bypassing the buffer cache), if possible.
	Prompted by a suggestion from Kalle Olavi Niemitalo
	in http://bugs.debian.org/207035.
	* src/shred.c (direct_mode): New function.
	(do_wipefd): Turn on direct-mode I/O.
	(dopass): If a file's first write fails with EINVAL,
	turn off direct-mode I/O and retry the write.

2004-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tr.c (main): "tr -d a b" is now a fatal error even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  The POSIX SYNOPSIS does not allow this
	option combination.

2004-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (dopass): Don't subtract 1 from the offset after
	a write error.  Problem reported by Jon Peatfield in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-06/msg00020.html

2004-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug reported by Buciuman Adrian in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-08/msg00105.html>
	where 'dd' created a file that was too large.  The bug was that dd
	assumed that the input file offset does not advance after a failed
	read; but POSIX says that the input file offset is undefined after
	a failed read.

	* src/dd.c (MAX_BLOCKSIZE): New macro.
	(input_seekable, input_seek_errno, input_offset,
	input_offset_overflow): New vars.
	(scanargs): Reject block sizes greater than MAX_BLOCKSIZE.
	(advance_input_offset): New function.
	(skip_via_lseek): Set errno to zero when reporting our failure,
	so that we don't report based on garbage errno.
	(skip): If fdesc is standard input, advance the input offset.
	Do not quit if reading, and if noerror was specified;
	POSIX seems to require this.
	If read fails on output file, report the earlier lseek failure
	instead; this fixes a FIXME in dd_copy.
	(advance_input_after_read_error): New function.
	(dd_copy): Use it, instead of assuming that failed reads
	do not advance the file pointer.  Advance input offset
	after nonfailed reads.  Advance only a partial block if
	the previous read (before the failed read) succeeded, and
	do not generate an output block of zeros in this case.
	(main): Determine initial input offset, seekability of input,
	and error if it wasn't seekable.

2004-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rm (without -f) could hang unnecessarily when attempting to
	remove a symlink to a file on an off-line NFS-mounted partition.
	Reported by David Howells in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/124699.
	* src/remove.c (write_protected_non_symlink): New function.
	Don't invoke euidaccess on symlinks.
	(prompt): Use write_protected_non_symlink rather than using
	euidaccess directly, being careful not to call lstat twice for a file.

	Fix a bug in how the --output-delimiter=D option works with
	abutting byte or character ranges.  Reported by David Krider in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00132.html
	* src/cut.c (print_kth): Remove special case for open-ended range.
	(set_fields): Record the range start index for an interval even
	when it abuts another interval on its low side.
	Also record the range start index of the longest right-open-interval.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: Add tests of --output-delimiter=S with
	abutting and overlapping byte ranges.

2004-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Some POSIX-conformance cleanups for tr.

	* src/tr.c (posix_pedantic): Remove; no longer needed since
	we need to test this in just one place now.
	(usage): Mention -C.
	(unquote): Note that \055, \n, etc are escaped.
	Do not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT when warning about ambiguous
	escape sequences.
	\ at end of string stands for itself.
	Do not diagnose invalid backslash escapes: POSIX says the behavior
	is unspecified in this case, so we don't need to diagnose it.
	(main): Add support for -C (currently an alias for -c).
	Do not diagnose 'tr [:upper:] [:upper:], as POSIX does not require
	a diagnostic here.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm: New tests bs-055, bs-at-end, repeat-Compl.
	Fix comment for range-a-a.

2004-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve the efficiency (and in one case, correctness) of code
	that reads symlinks.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't use alloca, as it can mess up
	royally if the link length is long (e.g., GNU/Hurd).  Use
	xreadlink instead, it's safer.  Don't bother to read the link if
	it's the wrong size.  Add a FIXME because this area is a bit murky
	and undocumented.
	* src/ls.c (get_link_name): Update use of xreadlink.
	* src/readlink.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Likewise.

	* NEWS: echo compatibility cleanup.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (echo invocation): Document the changes.
	* src/echo.c (V9_ECHO): Remove; always enabled.
	(DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_XPG): Renamed from V9_DEFAULT, so that
	we use the same naming convention as bash.  Now an enum,
	not a macro.
	(usage): Reword to mention -e/-E more accurately.
	Mention \0NNN (the POSIX syntax) rather than \NNN (nonstandard).
	(hextobin): New function.
	(main): Use bool rather than int for local vars when appropriate.
	Do not allow options if POSIXLY_CORRECT, unless we are using
	BSD semantics and the first argument is "-n".
	Don't pass unnecessary extra arg to parse_long_options.
	do_v9 now defaults to DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_XPG, not to allow_options.
	Do not look for options if !allow_options.
	Use size_t rather than int when appropriate.
	Open-code option test rather than using strrchr.
	Use faster test for "-".
	Avoid redundant argc test.
	Add support for \x, for Bash compatibility.
	Use e.g. '\a' rather than '\007', for portability to EBCDIC hosts.
	When '\c' is encountered, stop printing immediately, as POSIX
	requires.
	Add support for \xhh syntax.
	Add support for \0ooo syntax; POSIX requires this.

	* Use automake-1.8b.  Regenerate dependent files.

2004-05-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am.in (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define PATH to include
	the build src/ directory -- at the front.
	($(srcdir)/$x-tests): Depend on Makefile.am.
	Use $x as the program name, except when it would be `test' (test is
	the sole program tested via mk-script that is also a shell built-in).
	In that case, use the old ../../src/$x.

2004-05-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Work around HPUX /bin/cc compiler bug that is exposed, now that
	sets are arrays of type `bool'.  More details here:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2004-05/msg00094.html
	FIXME: verify that the above URL points to the right message

	* src/tr.c (card_of_complement): Use cleaner `sizeof in_set'
	rather than `N_CHARS * sizeof(in_set[0])'.  Using HPUX's /bin/cc
	(aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.55 [Dec 04 2003]) on an ia64-hp-hpux11.22
	system, those two expressions are not the same (256 vs. 1024).
	The effect of this problem was that `tr -c x y' would fail:
	tr: when not truncating set1, string2 must be non-empty
	(set_initialize): Remove unnecessary initialization of the `in_set'
	buffer; that initialization triggered the same compiler bug as above.

2004-05-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tr cleanup, mostly having to do with integer type ranges.
	Remove all casts.

	* tests/tr/Test.pm: Add a few tests for the below.  Alas, most of
	the test cases wouldn't be portable, or would take too much CPU
	time, or both.

	* src/tr.c (N_CHARS, N_CHAR_CLASSES): Now an enum, not a macro.
	This is safe since the code already assumes N_CHARS fits in int.
	(Filter): Remove: we want to prototype everything.
	(ORD, CHR): Remove.  All uses removed.  Some replaced with:
	(uchar): New function.  All places where a char must be converted
	to an unsigned char are now done this way, not by ad-hoc methods.
	(count): New type.  Use it whenever counts or states are needed.
	(BEGIN_STATE): Increase from INT_MAX - 1 (which was bogus, anyway,
	since we used it in an unsigned int context) to UINTMAX_MAX - 1.
	(REPEAT_COUNT_MAXIMUM): New macro.  Use it in place of BEGIN_STATE
	whenever appropriate.
	(NOT_A_CHAR): Remove global macro; now a local enum.
	(UL_LOWER, UL_UPPER, UL_NONE): No longer specify values, since
	the rest of the code no longer depends on them.
	(class_ok): Remove; all uses changed to use inline comparisons.
	(RE_NO_TYPE): Remove; wasn't used or needed.
	(struct List_element): normal_char and equiv_code are now unsigned
	char, not int.
	first_char, last_char, and the_repeated_char are now unsigned char,
	not unsigned int.  repeat_count is now count, not size_t.
	All uses changed.
	(struct Spec_list): state is now count, not unsigned int.
	lengthis now count, not size_t.
	n_indefinite_repeats is now size_t, not int.
	has_equiv_class, has_char_class, and has_restricted_char_class
	are now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(struct E_string): s is now char *, not unsigned char *.
	escaped is now bool *, not int *.  All uses changed.
	(ES_MATCH): Remove macro, replacing with:
	(es_match): New inline function.  All uses changed.
	(squeeze_repeats, complement, posix_pedantic, truncate_set1,
	translating): Now bool, not int.
	(io_buf): Now char array, not unsigned char.
	(SET_TYPE): Remove.  All uses replaced with bool.
	(is_equiv_class_member, unquote, append_range, append_char_class,
	append_equiv_class, find_closing_delim, star_digits_closebracket,
	build_spec_list, parse_str, homogeneous_spec_list):
	Now returns bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(is_equiv_class_member): Now inline.
	(is_equiv_class_member, is_char_class_member, make_printable_str,
	append_normal_char, append_range, append_repeated_char,
	get_s2_spec_stats):
	Args are now of proper integer type.
	(unquote, look_up_char_class, make_printable_str,
	append_equiv_class, build_spec_list, squeeze_filter):
	Avoid unsigned char *p; gently convert *p to unsigned char instead.
	(unquote, get_spec_stats): Do not jump past declarations and then
	use them; C doesn't allow this in portable programs.
	(make_printable_str): Check for overflow in size calculations.
	(xmemdup): Remove.  All uses rewritten.
	(find_bracketed_repeat): Args are now of proper pointer-to-integer
	type.  Do not reject [c*0].  Use xstrtoumax, not xstrtoul.
	(find_bracketed_repeat, star_digits_closebracket): Check that the
	digits are not escaped.
	(build_spec_list): Don't bother to copy opnd_str; not needed.
	(build_spec_list, get_next): Simplify internal logic a bit.
	(card_of_complement): Fix bug due to char overflow.
	(get_spec_stats): Don't assume len fits into int.
	Check for integer overflow.  Use abort() rather than assert(0).
	(string2_extend): Fix subscript error: is_char_class_member (..., 255)
	was being invoked.
	(squeeze_filter): READER is never null now; simplify code.
	READER arg now has a simpler type.  Remove unnecessary casts.
	(squeeze_filter, main): Calls to fwrite improperly checked result
	against zero, rather than against requested size.
	(plain_read): New function.
	(read_and_delete, read_and_xlate):
	Remove unused filter arg, and don't worry about hit_eof.
	Simplify by using plain_read.
	(set_initialize): Args are bool and bool *, not int and SET_TYPE *.
	(main): Always pass a non-null procedure to squeeze_filter.
	Rewrite so that class_ok isn't needed.

2004-05-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (dosync): Ignore EBADF errors, as IRIX 6.5
	fdatasync reports EBADF when syncing (unwritable) directories.
	Problem reported by Albert Chin-A-Young in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00165.html

2004-05-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chown/deref: Fix typo: use ls -ldo, not ls -ldg.
	Patch from Albert Chin.

	* src/ptx.c (text_buffer_maxend): Remove declaration of unused variable.

	* src/remove.c (push_dir): Merge declaration and adjacent assignment
	into a single statement.

2004-05-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_mark_helper): Eliminate an unnecessary comparison.

2004-05-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rm -r would get a failed assertion when run from an inaccessible
	directory and with two or more command line arguments including an
	absolute-named directory followed by a relative-named directory.

	* src/remove.h (struct rm_options) [require_restore_cwd]: New member.
	* src/remove.c (struct cwd_state): Define.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Redesign interface so that a restore_cwd failure
	can be detected by the caller.  Instead of returning a malloc'd
	directory name, communicate it to caller via a new parameter, and
	return an indication of whether restore_cwd failed.  Update caller.
	Eliminate an unnecessary call to AC_stack_top.
	(remove_dir): Change type of cwd_state parameter to `struct cwd_state'
	so we can now communicate to caller whether/how functions like
	restore_cwd have failed.  Update caller.
	(rm_1): Fail if we've failed to restore the working directory
	and the name of the next file to remove is `.'-relative.
	(rm): Fail if the require_restore_cwd flag is true and we've
	failed to restore the working directory.
	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): Initialize new member,
	x->require_restore_cwd.
	* src/rm.c (rm_option_init): Likewise.

2004-05-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/inaccessible: New test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inaccessible.

	* src/remove.c (rm): Use free rather than XFREE.
	(remove_dir): Use xmalloc, not XMALLOC.
	(ds_init): Likewise.

2004-05-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_unmarked_diagnostics): Now that the unmarked
	diagnostics in shred.c have been fixed, don't exempt shred.c from
	this check.

	* src/shred.c: Use translatable diagnostics, e.g.
	change "%s: remove" to _("%s: failed to remove") and
	change "%s: close"  to _("%s: failed to close").

2004-05-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (names): Bring back lower-case letters, "_", and
	".".  But continue to omit +, =, %, @, #, as they're either
	shell metacharacters (for some shells) or are not in some
	character sets, or (in the case of '%') must be a
	metacharacter somewhere.

2004-05-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Adjust to new signature of getndelim2.

2004-05-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (incname): Decrement `len' only once per loop iteration.

	chgrp and chown now dereference symlinks by default, per POSIX.
	Reported by Michal Politowski as http://bugs.debian.org/249177.

	* src/chown-core.c (chopt_init): Affect each symlink referent by default.
	* src/chown.c (usage): Update to reflect this.
	* src/chgrp.c (usage): Likewise.
	* NEWS: Describe the change.
	Adapt tests accordingly.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Use -h where necessary to retain semantics.
	* tests/chgrp/deref: Likewise.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Likewise.

2004-05-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	In shred, check for errors from fdatasync more carefully.  If
	fdatasync fails with errno==EINVAL, it means this implementation
	does not support synchronized I/O for this file.  Do not report
	this as an error, as (for example) AIX 5.2 fdatasync reports it
	for raw disk devices.  Problem reported by Albert Chin in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2004-05/msg00028.html>.

	Check for write errors, though: the old code ignored them.
	Improve error checking in a few other cases, too (e.g., close of a
	directory).

	Also, change several 'int' values to 'bool', so that the error
	checking is a bit clearer.  Similarly, change unsigned values
	to size_t where appropriate.

	* src/shred.c: Include "dirname.h".
	(datasync) [!HAVE_FDATASYNC]: Remove.
	(dosync): New function.
	(dopass): Use it.  Return 1 on write error, -1 on other error.
	All callers changed.  Report write error if dosync does.
	(do_wipefd, wipefd, wipename, wipefile): Return bool (true/false),
	not int (0/-1).  All callers changed.  Return false if there's a
	write error.
	(incname): Return bool (true/false), not int (0/1).  Accept
	size_t length, not unsigned.  All callers changed.  Do not
	bother checking for non-digits; it can't happen.  Replace
	recursion with iteration.
	(wipename): Use dir_name, base_name, etc. instead of assuming
	Unix file names.  Use size_t for length, not unsigned.
	Report error if unlink or close fails.
	(wipename, main): Use bool for booleans.

	(names): Use only digits and uppercase letters, for greater
	portability.

2004-05-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chown/deref: New test for the yesterday's change.
	* tests/chown/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add deref.

2004-05-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chown --dereference did nothing when the owner/group of a
	symlink matched the desired owner/group.  Reported by David Malone.
	Also reported in 1999 as http://bugs.debian.org/39642.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): When --dereference has
	been specified, and when processing a symlink, stat it to get the
	owner and group of the referent.

2004-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/pwd.x, man/echo.x, man/printf.x: Fix typo:
	s/supercede/supersede/ reported by Andrew Fabbro.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve performance of `sort -m' on large files, at the cost of
	making some contrived examples unsafe.  POSIX allows this
	optimization.  Performance problem reported by Jonathan Baker in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00071.html>.

	* src/sort.c (first_same_file): Do not treat input pipes
	differently from other files.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document that "sort -m -o F"
	might write F before reading all the input.
	* NEWS: Likewise.

2004-05-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/od.c (print_ascii, dump_strings): Use e.g. '\a' rather than
	'\007', for portability to EBCDIC hosts.
	* src/printf.c (print_esc_char): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (unquote, make_printable_str): Likewise.

2004-05-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Move lstat-`.' into if-block
	where the result is used.  This avoids one unnecessary lstat call
	per command line argument.

2004-05-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't assume that "make -C" works; Solaris "make" doesn't have -C.

	* src/Makefile.am (all_programs.list): New rule, copied from
	man/Makefile.am and tests/Makefile.am, except that we use the
	system tr rather than ./tr and we don't use tr -s.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Use it.
	* man/Makefile.am (all_programs): Likewise.  Renamed from programs,
	for consistency.  All uses changed.

2004-05-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/unread3: New test, for the above fix and today's
	lib/save-cwd.c improvement.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add unread3.

	* src/rm.c: Don't include "save-cwd.h".  It's no longer used.

2004-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/install/trap: New file.  Test for bug fix of 2004-04-18.
	* tests/install/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add trap.

	* src/remove.c (AD_push): Don't use errno in diagnostic about
	`changed dev/ino'.

	Remove these generated files from CVS.
	* tests/cut/cut-tests, tests/date/date-tests, tests/join/join-tests:
	* tests/ls/ls-tests, tests/pr/pr-tests, tests/tac/tac-tests:
	* tests/tail/tail-tests, tests/test/test-tests, tests/tr/range-tests:
	* tests/tr/tr-tests, tests/wc/wc-tests:

2004-05-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tr.c (unquote): Use xcalloc rather than xmalloc and
	a loop initializing the just-allocated memory to zero.

2004-05-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/no-give-up: New file; check for today's fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-give-up.

2004-05-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug where "rm" gave up too easily, reported by Dan Jacobsen in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00013.html>.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Check for errno values like ENOENT
	that show the file cannot be directory, instead of for errno
	values like EPERM that show the file might be a directory.  This
	is necessary because, when a single unlink() call has multiple
	reasons to fail, it can set errno to any of those reasons; it's
	only the rare errno value like ENOENT that excludes all the other
	possible reasons to fail even when the file is a directory.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Don't attempt chdir if the file is known
	to not be a directory.
	(remove_dir): Use the same method that remove_cwd_entries uses
	(for some reason they differed).  Don't assert that saved_errno
	must be EPERM; it might be just about anything.

2004-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/id.c (xgetgroups): Use xnmalloc, rather than xmalloc.
	Don't add `1' to the buffer size (it was to protect against malloc
	implementations that fail to allocate a buffer of size zero).
	That is no longer necessary, since we use a malloc wrapper
	on such systems.

	* src/wc.c (get_input_fstatus): Use xnmalloc, rather than xmalloc.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_bytes_pipe): Likewise.
	* src/df.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (do_wipefd): Likewise.
	* src/users.c (list_entries_users): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/md5sum.c (main): Likewise.

2004-04-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (show_disk, show_point): If several filesystems are
	mounted on the same mount point, prefer the last one, not the first.
	Problem reported by Christian Jones in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-04/msg00200.html>.
	(show_disk): Remove unused statp arg.  Return bool, not int.
	(show_point): Rewrite to avoid gotos.  Use the same algorithm
	for lofs and dummies for each pass through the mount table,
	rather than subtly different algorithms (which are probably
	inadvertent).

2004-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add m4/ChangeLog, now that we no longer
	have m4/Makefile*.

2004-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	When chown or chgrp is modifying the referent of a symlink,
	use the chown(2) function, if possible.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Don't hard-code the
	open/fchown/close kludge here.  Use `chown' instead.
	The chown function works just fine on conforming systems.
	Other systems now go through the new chown wrapper that
	resorts to the old kludge.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Add a comment.

2004-04-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ptx.c: Make over 40 global extern variables `static'.
	(syntax_table, re_syntax_table): Remove declarations of two unused
	variables (they were exposed by the above change).

	* src/du.c (G_fail, opt_nul_terminate_output): Declare `static'.
	* src/ln.c (backup_type): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (rm): Add `extern' keyword.
	* src/cp-hash.c (forget_created, remember_created)
	(src_to_dest_lookup, remember_copied, hash_init, forget_all): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (dest_info_init, src_info_init, copy): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c (chopt_init, chopt_free, gid_to_name)
	(uid_to_name, chown_files): Likewise.

	* src/Makefile.am (sc_tight_scope): New rule.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_tight_scope): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

2004-04-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.4.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/sort.c (limfield): Make a comment clearer.

2004-04-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix POSIX-conformance bug: "sort -k 3,3.5b" is supposed to skip
	leading blanks when computing the location of the field end;
	it is not supposed to skip trailing blanks.  Solaris 8 "sort"
	does conform to POSIX.  Also fix the documentation to clarify
	this and related issues.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Mention -k earlier, so
	that the options are in alphabetical order.  Describe how -b works
	more-accurately; this involves fixing some examples, too.  Mention
	what happens if the start field falls after an end field or after
	a line end.  Warn about using -k without -b, -g, -M, -n, or -t.
	Add an example of how to sort IPv4 addresses and Apache Common
	Log Format dates.  Remove a duplicate example.
	(Putting the tools together): Use separate options rather
	than agglomerating them.
	* src/sort.c (limfield): Use skipeblanks, not skipsblanks, to
	decode whether to skip leading blanks.
	(trailing_blanks): Remove.
	(fillbuf, getmonth, keycompare): Don't trim trailing blanks.

	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Fix typo in env_default comment.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm: Likewise.
	(18c, 18d): Reverse the order of output lines, so that the
	test cases conform to POSIX.

2004-04-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	More signal-handling cleanup for ls.c.  Do not allow signals to
	happen between arbitrary output bytes, as the
	restore-default-color sequence can bollix up multibyte chars or
	color-change sequences in the ordinary output.  Instead, process
	signals only between printing a file name and changing the color
	back to non_filename_text color.  That way, if the signal handler
	changes the color (to the default), 'ls' will change it back when
	'ls' continues (after being suspended).

	Also, do not bother with signal-handling unless stdout is a
	controlling terminal; this lets stdio buffer better when "ls
	--color" is piped or sent to a file.

	* src/ls.c (sigprocmask, sigset_t) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: New macros.
	Do not include "full-write.h"; no longer needed.
	(tcgetpgrp) [! HAVE_TCGETPGRP]: New macro.
	(put_indicator_direct): Remove.  All callers changed to use
	put_indicator.
	(caught_signals, interrupt_signal, stop_signal_count): New vars.
	(restore_default_color): Don't bother checking for put_indicator
	failure.
	(sighandler): Don't handle SIGTSTP; that's another handler now.
	Simply set interrupt_signal to the signal, then exit.
	(stophandler, process_signals): New functions.
	(main): Don't output any color changes until _after_ the signal
	handlers are set up.  This fixes a race condition where 'ls'
	could be interrupted while initializing colors, and leaving the
	terminal in an undesirable state.
	Don't mess with signal-handling if standard output is not a
	controlling terminal.
	When exiting, restore the default color, then restore the
	default signal handling, then act on any signals that weren't
	acted on yet.
	Do not print //DIRED// etc. in colors; this avoids the need
	to catch signals when printing them.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Process signals just before switching
	color back to non_filename_text.

2004-04-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid segfault on systems for which SIZE_MAX != (size_t) -1.
	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Use SIZE_MAX, not -1, in calls
	of quotearg_buffer.  Patch by Mikulas Patocka.

2004-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	tee ignored SIGPIPE, but POSIX doesn't allow this.

	* src/tee.c (main): Do not ignore SIGPIPE, as POSIX 1003.1-2001
	does not allow this.  This undoes the 1996-10-24 patch.

2004-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Signal-handling cleanup for coreutils.  Here are the highlights:

	 - csplit sometimes failed to remove files when interrupted.
	 - csplit didn't clean up if two signals arrived nearly simultaneously.
	 - install -s would infloop on System V if SIGCHLD was ignored.
	 - ls could incorrectly restore color if multiple signals
	   arrived nearly simultaneously.

	* src/csplit.c (sigprocmask, sigset_t) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]:
	Define.
	(filename_space, prefix, suffix, digits, files_created, remove_files):
	Now volatile.
	(caught_signals): New var.
	(cleanup): Block signals while deleting all files.
	(cleanup_fatal, handle_line_error, regexp_error):
	Mark with ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN.
	(create_output_file, close_output_file, interrupt_handler):
	Block signals while changing the number of output files,
	to fix some race conditions.
	(delete_all_files): Do nothing if remove_files is zero.
	Clear files_created.
	(main): Don't mess with signals until after argument processing
	is done.

	* src/csplit.c (main): Rewrite signal-catching code to make it
	similar to other coreutils programs.  When processing signals,
	block all signals that we catch, but do not block signals that we
	don't catch.  Avoid problems with unsigned int warnings.
	* src/ls.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (interrupt_handler):
	Use void, not (obsolete) RETSIGTYPE.
	* src/shred.c (sigill_handler, isaac_seed_machdep): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (interrupt_handler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]:
	Use simpler "signal (sig, SIG_DFL)" rather than sigaction equivalent.
	* src/ls.c (sighandler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (sighandler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main) [!defined _POSIX_SOURCE]: Likewise, except
	for SIG_IGN.
	* src/tee.c (main) [!defined _POSIX_SOURCE]: Likewise.

	* src/install.c: Include <signal.h>.
	(main) [defined SIGCHLD]: Set SIGCHLD handler to the default, if -s is
	given, since System V fork+wait does not work if SIGCHLD is ignored.

	* src/ls.c (sighandler) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Reset signal
	handler to self, not to SIG_IGN, since SIGTSTP can be received
	more than once.
	(main): Use SA_RESTART, as that is simpler than checking for EINTR
	failures all over the place.

2004-04-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Clarify comment.

	* man/help2man: Accept new option: --program-name=NAME, so that we
	can override the one in --version output.  This is needed solely
	so that test.1 doesn't refer to `[' as the program name.
	Reported by Benjamin Cutler as http://bugs.debian.org/205251.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Use help2man's new --program-name option.

	* src/pwd.c: Don't include pathmax.h; system.h already does it.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Free buffer upon getndelim2 failure.

2004-04-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (isaac_seed_start) [AVOID_USED_UNINITIALIZED_WARNINGS]:

	(nth_parent, find_dir_entry, robust_getcwd): New functions.
	(main): First try getcwd, then, upon failure, robust_getcwd.

2004-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_user): Use xrealloc here, rather than
	unchecked realloc.  Remove anachronistic casts.

	* src/remove.c (full_filename_): Don't leak upon failed realloc.

	* src/system.h (readdir_ignoring_dot_and_dotdot): New inline function,
	from remove.c.

	All uses replaced by ptr_align.
	* src/od.c (gcd, lcm): Remove; now in system.h.
	* src/system.h (gcd, lcm, ptr_align): New functions, moved from od.c.

2004-04-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove m4/Makefile.am: it's no longer needed, with newer automake
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove m4/Makefile.in from the list.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove `m4' from the list.

2004-04-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Change `jm_' in AC_DEFINE'd names to `gl_'.

2004-03-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: cp -pu and mv -u (when copying) now take the destination
	file system time stamp resolution into account.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (mv invocation): Document this.
	(cp invocation): Document -u (it was missing!) with new behavior.

	* src/copy.c: Include "utimecmp.h".
	(copy_internal): Compare time stamps using utimecmp rather than
	MTIME_CMP.

2004-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (.re-list): New rule/file, to replace
	hard-coded list of header file names.
	(sc_system_h_headers): Use the new file.
	Don't look for sys2.h anymore.

	* src/system.h: Include new "stat-macros.h" rather than hard-coding
	all of its macro definitions -- the list was slightly out of date.
	Suggestion from Dmitry V. Levin.

2004-04-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove noctty flag from dd.  Suggested by Philippe Troin.

	(main): Always use O_NOCTTY when opening files.

2004-04-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (dd_copy): Mark two diagnostics for translations.
	(set_fd_flags): Undo part of today's change: it's a little
	cleaner -- and more efficient in the common case -- to go
	ahead and OR in the -1 when fcntl fails.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_dd_max_sym_length): New target.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/md5sum.c (PROGRAM_NAME) [algorithm == ALG_SHA1]:

	(input_flags, output_flags): New vars.
	(LONGEST_SYMBOL): New macro.
	(struct symbol_value): Renamed from struct conversion.  Members
	symbol and value renamed from convname and conversion.  The
	symbol value is now an array instead of a pointer; this saves
	a bit of space and time in practice.  All uses changed.
	(conversions): Add nocreat, excl, fdatasync, fsync.  Now const.
	(flags): New constant array.
	(iflag_error_msgid, oflag_error_msgid): New constants.
	(parse_symbols): Renamed from parse_conversion and generalized
	to handle either conversion or flag symbols.

	support for iflag= and oflag=.  Reject attempts to use
	both excl and nocreat.
	(set_fd_flags): New function.

2004-04-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (makedev) [mkdev && !makedev]: Define in terms of mkdev.
	Interix spells it `mkdev'.  Reported by Mark Funkenhauser.

2004-04-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	A specified format is no longer automatically newline terminated.
	If you want a newline at the end of your format, use `\n'.
	* src/stat.c (print_it): Don't print a newline at the end of
	every format.
	(do_statfs): Add a newline at end of each default format string.

2004-03-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Adjust to new calling convention
	for set_cloexec_flag.

2004-03-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Fetish.pm (run_tests): Remove `.orig' file.
	Remove debugging diagnostic.

	Specifying an invalid --width=N (-w) or --gap-size=N (-g)
	would not elicit an error.
	* src/ptx.c: Include "xstrtol.h" and "quotearg.h".
	(main): Don't use atoi.  Use xstrtoul instead.

2004-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_atoi_atof): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof: New file.

2004-03-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/files0-from: Use new OUT_SUBST directive, so that this
	test is not sensitive to system-dependent block size differences.
	Prompted by a report of Solaris 8 differences from Paul Eggert.

	* tests/Fetish.pm: Accept new directives: OUT_SUBST, ERR_SUBST.
	Rename `%tmp' to `%actual'.  Reverse order of last two args to
	_compare_files (to $actual, $expected) so as to match declaration.

2004-03-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some gotchas encountered when porting to Solaris 8, using
	the Forte 6u2 compiler.

	* src/hostname.c [HAVE_SETHOSTNAME && !defined sethostname]:
	Declare sethostname, since no Solaris header does it.
	* src/who.c: Include "vasprintf.h", for asprintf.

2004-03-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Minor optimization:
	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't record dev/inode for directories.

	Under some circumstances, without -c, du would mistakenly count the
	space of hard-linked files, not just the first one it encountered.
	Reported by Anthony Thyssen.
	* src/du.c (du_files): Don't ever clear the set of `seen' dev/inodes.

	* src/du.c: Rename global `print_totals' to `print_grand_total'.

	* src/du.c (main): Rearrange filtering loop to be a tiny bit
	more efficient.

2004-03-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Remove now-unused declaration of `i'.

2004-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/du.c (main): Filter out file names of length zero before
	invoking fts, so that they don't cause fatal errors.

2004-03-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/files0-from (zero-len): Add a test for the above.

2004-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: New environment var BLOCKSIZE.
	* lib/human.c (humblock): Support BLOCKSIZE as well as BLOCK_SIZE.
	* tests/envvar-check: Test for it.  Factor the code to simplify it.

2004-03-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Shorten the du --files0-from announcement, and say
	"NUL-terminated" rather than "NUL-separated".
	* src/du.c (EXPECTED_BYTES_PER_FILE_NAME, DEFAULT_PROJECTED_N_FILES):
	Remove: not used.
	(usage): Say "NUL-terminated", not "NUL-separated".
	(main): Check for I/O error when istream is closed.
	Allow --files0-from=F even if F is empty; this specifies no files.
	(du_files): Now that we allow the list of files to be empty,
	handle that case.
	* tests/du/files0-from: Adjust to above changes to src/du.c.

2004-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/tail-2/assert: Avoid race condition that could cause
	spurious failure.  Based on a patch from Andreas Schwab.

	* src/du.c (main): Free the hash table, too.

2004-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Remove --info-page= option, reverting
	the change of 2004-01-22.  I can no longer reproduce the problem
	that prompted that change, and `info coreutils pr' would display the
	`printing text' section of the manual, not the one on `pr invocation'.

	* tests/du/files0-from (nul-1, nul-2): Adjust expected diagnostics
	to match corrected output.

	* src/du.c: Include "readtokens0.h" rather than "readtokens.h".
	(main): Use readtoken0 functions rather than readtokens.
	Don't use errno when diagnosing readtokens0 failure.
	Fix off-by-one error in the token number reported in a diagnostic.
	(du_files): Return bool, rather than int.

2004-03-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (ds_free): Plug a small leak.

	* tests/Fetish.pm: Fix typo in comment.

2004-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: du accepts a new option --files0-from=FILE, where FILE
	contains a list of NUL-separated file names.

	* src/du.c: Include "readtokens.h".
	(usage): Describe the new option, and adjust the `Usage':
	with this option, no FILE may be specified on the command line.
	(main): Handle the new option.

	* tests/du/files0-from: New tests, for the above.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add files0-from.

	* src/factor.c (do_stdin): Reflect changes in use of readtoken.
	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Likewise.

2004-02-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add support for a new notation @N to get_date to represent
	the time stamp with numeric value N.  Improve support for
	fractional time stamps.  date's -d and -f options now accept them.
	Likewise for touch -t.  date has a new option --iso-8601=ns.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (touch invocation):
	Describe use of fractional seconds.
	(date invocation, Options for date): Likewise.
	* doc/getdate.texi (General date syntax, Time of day items): Likewise.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (date invocation): Mention effect of LC_TIME.
	(Options for date): Describe new --iso-8601=ns option.

	* doc/getdate.texi: Add copyright notice.  Change getdate to
	get_date when talking about the function name.
	(Seconds since the Epoch): New section, containing the time_t
	info moved from Date input formats section, along with new
	info about the @ syntax.  Mention negative time stamps,
	fractional time stamps, and leap seconds.
	(General date syntax): Modernize examples a bit to reflect new
	features.
	(General date syntax, Relative items in date strings):
	Use ' rather than " to quote formats.
	(Time of day items): Add an example with fractional seconds.
	Describe fractional-second syntax.

	* src/Makefile.am (touch_LDADD): New macro, since `touch' now
	needs clock_gettime.

	* src/date.c (enum Time_spec): New enum TIME_SPEC_NS.
	(time_spec_string, time_spec, show_date): Support it.
	(usage): Remove description of -ITIMESPEC, as it's obsolete and
	confusing.  Mention --iso-8601=ns.
	(batch_convert): getline returns ssize_t, not int.

	* src/touch.c (newtime): Now an array of two timespecs, one
	for access and one for modification.
	(ref_stats): Remove.
	(get_reldate): Use get_date's parameter profile.
	(touch, main): Adjust to above changes.
	(main): Work even if tm_year == INT_MAX (so long as long int is wider).
	Use gettime instead of gettimeofday, for new get_date signature.

	* tests/date/Test.pm (test_vector): New tests epoch, ns-10, ns-max32,
	ns-relative.

2004-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (alpha beta major): `Make' the emit_upload_commands
	target before updating $(prev_version_file).

	* tests/misc/date-sec: New file, to test for just-fixed bug in date.
	See today's change in lib/getdate.y.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add date-sec.

2004-03-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Use `.sig' suffix for
	signature files, not `.asc'.  Reported by angico@yahoo.com.

2004-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Tweak wording in a diagnostic.
	Suggestion from Karl Berry.
	Include "quoatearg.h".
	(do_copy): Use quotearg_colon (not quote) for diagnostics
	that begin with `"%s:'.

	* src/nl.c (usage): Specify that nl uses _basic_ regular expressions.
	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2004-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.1.

	Sometimes, when source and destination partition are different,
	mv mistakenly fails to preserve a hard link.  Reported by IIDA Yosiaki.

	* src/copy.c: When moving a set of N hard-linked files between
	partitions, via two or more command line arguments where the
	command line argument containing the Nth link contains no other
	link to that same file, mv would mistakenly copy the file, rather
	than hard-linking it to the other(s).  That happens because when the
	final link is processed, its link count has been reduced to 1 since
	the other links have been `copied' to the destination partition
	and the source links have been removed.
	(copy_internal): When in move mode, use the source dev/inode
	pair to look up destination name even when st_nlink == 1.
	* src/cp-hash.c (src_to_dest_lookup): New function.
	* src/cp-hash.h (src_to_dest_lookup): Add prototype.
	* tests/mv/part-hardlink: New file.  Test for the above fix.

	* announce-gen: Sync with autoconf.

	* tests/ls/time-1: Exit 77 (not 1) if we can't set up for the test.
	This was triggered on a Linux-2.2.19 system using a file system
	NFS-mounted from some sort of Sun.

2004-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

2004-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/deref-args: Also convert sizes in the 70-79 kB range,
	so that this test works with SELinux-enabled systems.
	Based on a patch from Tim Waugh.

	`join -1 x' would give a misleading diagnostic
	* src/join.c (string_to_join_field): Report that a non-numeric field
	number is invalid, rather than `so large that it is not representable'.
	* tests/join/Test.pm (invalid-j): New partial test for the above fix.

2004-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cp --sparse=always sparse-image-file.img /dev/hda1 could
	produce an invalid copy on the destination device.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Even with --sparse=always, try to
	make `holes' only if the destination is a regular file.
	Reported by Szakacsits Szabolcs.

2004-03-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't invoke set_cloexec_flag with
	a file descriptor of -1.

2004-03-02  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

2004-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/deref-args, tests/du/exclude, tests/du/slash:
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Run envvar-check in case BLOCK_SIZE
	etc. are set.

2004-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

2004-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/comm.c (usage): Tell what comm does when there are no options.
	Reword in terms of FILE1 and FILE2 rather than `left file' and
	`right file'.  Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2004-02-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-conformance bugs in expr.

	* NEWS: document the following changes to src/expr.c.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (expr invocation): Likewise.
	Document what forms integers may take, and say "integer"
	consistently instead of "number".  Warn about operands
	that "expr" can misinterpret, and how to work around the
	problem.
	* src/expr.c (eval, eval7, eval6, eval5, eval4, eval3, eval2, eval1):
	Accept a bool argument specifying whether to evaluate the
	expression.  This is to allow short-circuit evaluation.  All
	callers changed.
	(null): Report that a string is zero even if it has
	a form like "-0" or "00".
	(eval1, eval): Use short-circuit evaluation for | and &.
	(eval): Return 0 if both arguments are null or zero, instead
	of returning the first argument.
	* tests/expr/basic: Add some tests for the above.

2004-02-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.0.

	`make check' from a build inside a chroot environment would fail
	* tests/help-version: Specify an argument (`/') for df, in the
	unusual event that there is no valid entry in /etc/mtab.
	Likewise for id: add the -u option, so we don't get spurious
	failures when there are no user or group names.
	Patch by Tim Waugh.

	* src/sort.c (usage) [-u]: Add punctuation so that the description in
	the help2man-generated (line-joined) man page is more readable.
	Reported by Tim Waugh.
	[-T]: Add a semicolon, for the same reason.

2004-02-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Qualify target with $(srcdir)/ prefix.

2004-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am.in ($(srcdir)/Makefile.am): Use more portable
	$(srcdir)/../Makefile.am.in, rather than $<.
	Suggestion from Michael Elizabeth Chastain.

2004-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* config/install-sh: Make this script executable.
	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): New target, to ensure that config/install-sh
	is executable.  Otherwise, on systems that lack a suitable install
	binary, `make install' would fail, because of the way this script
	is invoked (without `$SHELL ' prefix).
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

2004-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.3.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Avoid triggering a bug in OSF/Tru64's sed
	that would cause an unwarranted test failure.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

2004-02-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove xstat function pointer member.  The way it was used was not
	portable, since some systems (OSF V5.1, Solaris 2.5.1) provide static
	inline `stat' and `lstat' functions, thus making the tests of
	`xstat == lstat' in copy.c always fail.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [xstat]: Remove member.
	(XSTAT): New macro.
	* src/copy.c (copy_dir): Set `.dereference' member, not .xstat.
	(copy_internal): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of `*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	Use `x->dereference == DEREF_NEVER' in place of `x->xstat == lstat'.
	(valid_options): Remove now-obsolete FIXME comments.

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of
	`*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	(do_copy): Declare/use local xstat rather than x->xstat.
	(main): Remove code that set x.xstat.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Don't initialize xstat member.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_ftp_host-alpha, etc.): Un-factor .gnu.org suffix,
	so that emit_upload_commands can use these variables, too.

2004-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Remove `du' stack space test.
	Apparently, `ulimit -s N' isn't portable enough.
	This test will be restored (with a guard against losing ulimit)
	in its own file later.

	* tests/rm/deep-1 (deep): Remove progress-style diagnostics,
	since this test doesn't take long enough to merit them.
	Run du on $tmp (the containing dir), not $deep, the full path to leaf.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Remove definition.
	Now, automake's gnupload handles this.
	(%.sig: %): Remove now-unused rule.
	(rel-files): Use automake's $(DIST_ARCHIVES), rather than
	`$(distdir).tar.bz2 $(distdir).tar.gz'.
	(emit-upload-commands): Adjust to use gnupload.

2004-02-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (ST_TIME_CMP_NS, ST_TIME_CMP): Remove definitions.
	(ATIME_CMP, CTIME_CMP, MTIME_CMP, TIMESPEC_NS): Likewise.
	Now, those are all defined in timespec.h.
	Include timespec.h.

	* src/date.c: Don't include timespec.h, now that system.h does it.

2004-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't dump core if localtime returns NULL (possible on
	hosts with 64-bit time_t and 32-bit int).
	* src/date.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(batch_convert, main):
	If time conversion fails, exit with nonzero status.
	(show_date): Return int to report conversion failure.
	Print the time as an int if localtime fails.
	* src/uptime.c: Print "??" if the current clock can't
	be converted by localtime.  This won't happen until the year
	2*31 + 1900, but we don't want to dump core even if the current
	clock has the wrong value.

	* src/stat.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(human_time): Print the date/time as a number of seconds since the
	epoch if it can't be converted by localtime.  This is better than
	just saying "invalid", and is consistent with what "ls" does.
	Don't dump core if the year has more than 48 digits; this isn't
	possible on any contemporary host, but we might as well do it right.

2004-01-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/stat.c (human_time): Accept time rather than
	pointer-to-const-time parameter, for clarity.  All callers changed.

2004-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): Remove extra trailing newline from
	default formats.  Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	Print actual fractional seconds in time stamps, not just `.00000000'.
	* src/stat.c (human_time): Add and use new parameter, t_ns.
	(print_stat): Update callers.
	* src/ls.c (TIMESPEC_NS): Remove definition.
	* src/system.h (TIMESPEC_NS): Define here, instead, now that stat.c
	also uses this macro.
	Nelson H. F. Beebe noticed that ls --full-time printed nonzero
	fractional seconds for files on an XFS file system, but that stat's
	fractional seconds were always zero.

2004-01-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Use 'double' for loop index, not
	'int', to avoid problems with integer overflow.  On almost all
	machines 'double' works in every case where 'int' works, and
	it works on other cases besides.

2004-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/seq.c (usage): Mention that if INCREMENT is omitted,
	it defaults to 1, even when FIRST is larger than LAST.
	Reword so as not to exclude the possibility that INCREMENT be zero.

2004-01-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.2.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Comment out definition.

2004-01-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (header_regexp): Add exitfail.

	* man/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add help2man.
	Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Prefix help2man invocation with `$(PERL) --'
	so it works on systems with Perl installed somewhere other than in
	/usr/bin.

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Declare local, chr, to be of type
	`int', not `char', since it must hold EOF.  This bug would make
	paste infloop on some systems.  Test failures reported by
	Nelson H. F. Beebe and Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rmdir/fail-perm: New file.  Test for just-fixed rmdir bug.
	* tests/rmdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-perm.

	* man/help2man: Fix it so using --info-page='coreutils PROG' works.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Invoke our own (tweaked) copy of help2man.
	Use --info-page='coreutils PROG' option.
	Now, readlink.1 refers the user to `info coreutils readlink'
	rather than to `info readlink'.  Reported by Matt Swift.

2004-01-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Exit status cleanup.

	* src/basename.c (usage): Use EXIT_SUCCESS, not 0, for clarity.

	* src/users.c, src/wc.c, src/who.c, src/whoami.c, src/yes.c: Likewise.

	* src/cat.c (usage): Don't bother normalizing exit status
	since the arg is already the correct exit status now.
	* src/cksum.c, src/comm.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c,
	* src/dircolors.c, src/expand.c, src/fmt.c, src/fold.c, src/head.c,

	* src/chroot.c (CHROOT_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, CHROOT_FAILURE):
	Remove.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Initialize exit_failure to EXIT_FAIL.
	* src/env.c, src/nice.c, src/su.c: Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main): Likewise, to NOHUP_FAILURE.
	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Likewise, to SETUIDGID_FAILURE.
	* src/expr.c (main): Use initialize_exit_failure rather than
	setting exit_failure directly; this optimizes away redundant
	assignments.
	* src/printenv.c, src/sort.c, src/test.c, src/tty.c: Likewise.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Exit with status 1 rather than 127
	if chroot itself fails, as per documentation.

	* src/chroot.c (main): Use EXIT_ENOENT and EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE
	rather than roll-your-own symbols or integers.
	* src/env.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/su.c (run_shell): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (exit_status): Remove static var....
	(main): Making it local here instead.  Use =, not |=, to set it.

	* src/cut.c (FATAL_ERROR, main): Exit with status EXIT_FAILURE,
	not 2, on errors.
	* src/date.c (batch_convert, main): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (dd_copy): Likewise.
	* src/pr.c (first_last_page, main, getoptarg): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (main): Don't assume EXIT_FAILURE == 1, as
	POSIX doesn't require it.
	* src/dd.c (write_output, skip, dd_copy): Likewise.
	* src/df.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/id.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/hostname.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/nl.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/stty.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/expr.c (EXPR_FAILURE): Renamed from EXPR_ERROR, for
	consistency with the other programs' naming conventions.
	All uses changed.

	* src/factor.c (main): Do not report a usage error simply
	because stdin has bad numbers.

	* src/id.c (problems): Now a boolean int, not a counter,
	so that we don't have to worry about int overflow.  All uses changed.
	* src/touch.c (err): Likewise.

	* src/md5sum.c (main): Use int, not size_t, to store boolean int.

	* src/mkfifo.c (main): Exit with status 1, not 4, if not implemented.
	* src/mknod.c: Likewise.

	* src/nice.c (main): Exit with status EXIT_FAIL, not EXIT_FAILURE,
	on error; this is in case EXIT_FAILURE is unusual.

	changed to EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE.

	* src/printenv.c (PRINTENV_FAILURE): New constant.
	(main): Exit with status PRINTENV_FAILURE, not EXIT_FAILURE, on
	command-line syntax problems.

	* src/rmdir.c (remove_parents): Don't set 'fail' to a negative number.
	(main): Avoid integer overflow when seeing whether errors occurred.

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Now returns void, not (zero) int.
	All callers changed.
	(main): Remove unused local variable 'errs'.  Always exit successfully
	if we reach the end.

	* src/setuidgid.c (SETUIDGID_FAILURE): Renamed from FAIL_STATUS,
	for consistency with other programs here.  All uses changed.
	(main): Use 'error' to exit rather than invoking 'exit' here.

	* src/system.h (EXIT_FAIL, EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE, EXIT_ENOENT):
	New enum values.

	Include exitfail.h here, since we refer to exit_failure.
	All callers changed to not include exitfail.h.

	* src/tty.c (TTY_FAILURE, TTY_WRITE_ERROR): New enum values;
	substitute them for the corresponding integer constants.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_date): Remove, as

2004-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/relative: Remove `command' syntax.
	Thanks to Nelson H. F. Beebe and Paul Eggert.

	* tests/touch/relative: Test only year/month/day, not hours/min/sec,
	so as to avoid problems with systems using TAI clocks.
	Although it's no longer necessary, set TZ=UTC0 also for the
	initial touch command.  Reported by Paul Jarc here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/1504

2004-01-20  Diego Biurrun  <diego@biurrun.de>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add .mov to the list of media files.

2004-01-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/touch/relative: Use TZ=UTC0, not TZ=utc (which isn't
	portable).  Problem reported by Christian Krackowizer.  Also, use
	+0000 rather than +0 to specify a time zone, as the documentation
	requires four digits.

2004-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/hard-4: Run envvar-check in case SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX is set.
	* tests/mv/backup-is-src: Likewise.
	Problem reported by Peter Horst

2004-01-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Use .sig suffix, not .asc.

	* Version 5.1.1.

2003-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: touch -r and -d can now both be specified,
	with -r specifying the origin for -d.
	* src/touch.c (flexible_date): Remove static var.
	(get_reldate): New function.
	(main): Use it, to implement this new behavior.

2004-01-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/relative: New test for the above.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add relative.

	* src/system.h: Include contents of sys2.h.
	* src/sys2.h: Remove file.
	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Remove sys2.h.

	* Use automake-1.8.2.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* configure.ac: Use gettext-0.13.1.
	* .x-sc_space_tab: Add m4/po.m4 to the list of exceptions.

2004-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

	* src/tail.c (main): Warn about following stdin only when it's a tty.

	* configure.ac: Use gl_DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION.

2004-01-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/stat-fmt: Use backticks, not `$()' notation.

2004-01-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Quote underquoted `jm_DUMMY_1' to avoid new warning.

2004-01-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Use %lx, not %x format for `unsigned long'.
	From Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove `/vg' (prerelease test
	remnant) from PATH component.  That would cause tests in this directory
	not to run the just-built binaries, but rather whatever happened
	to be in one's PATH.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (new_control_record): Use x2nrealloc
	rather than xrealloc.

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Use ASSIGN_STRDUPA rather than
	alloca and strcpy.
	(make_path_private): Likewise.

2004-01-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c: Use `bool' (not int) as the type for a few
	global variables.
	(collapse_escapes): Rewrite to set globals rather than modifying
	its parameter.
	Use size_t (not int) for all counters and related index variables.
	(paste_parallel): Remove needless complexity of
	using xrealloc in the loop;  just allocate the buffers up front.
	Free the two temporary buffers.
	Move declarations of locals `down' into scope where used.
	(paste_serial): Remove `register' attributes.
	(main): Simplify delim-related code.
	Free `delims', now that it's malloc'd.

2004-01-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chroot.c: Include "quote.h".
	(CHROOT_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, CHROOT_FAILURE): Define.
	(main): Exit with status of 127, not 1, for too-few-args,
	chroot failure, or chdir failure.
	Give a better diagnostic upon execvp failure.

	* src/du.c (usage): Mention that, with its current meaning,
	-H is deprecated.

	* src/tail.c (main): Warn about following stdin when it's a tty.
	Fail when following by name but no names are specified.

2003-12-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fold.c (main): Use memcpy, not strcpy.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Use ASSIGN_STRDUPA rather than

2003-12-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tee.c (tee): Use xnmalloc rather than xmalloc.

2003-12-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Remove support for join -j1 FIELD, -j2 FIELD, and -o LIST1
	LIST2 in POSIX 1003.1-2001 hosts, as required by POSIX.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (join invocation): Remove documentation
	accordingly.  Document that -t makes all separators significant.

	* src/join.c: Include posixver.h.
	(obsolete_usage): New var.
	(longopts): Put obsolete options first.
	(OBSOLETE_LONG_OPTIONS): New constant.
	(get_option, add_file_name): New functions.
	(main): Use them to support new behavior.
	(usage): Remove documentation for -j1 FIELD and -j2 FIELD.
	Do not mark -j FIELD as obsolescent; it is longstanding
	UNIX tradition and is a valid extension to POSIX.

	* tests/join/Test.pm (tv): Avoid obsolete -o usage.

2003-12-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/join.c (add_field_list): Don't use alloca with unbounded
	size; just modify the argument, which is no longer const *.

	Various other minor cleanups, mostly to avoid the need for casts.

	(extract_field): Renamed from ADD_FIELD, as it's now a function.

	(struct field.beg): Now char *, not unsigned char const *.  All
	uses changed.  It shouldn't be const since xmemcoll writes on its
	arguments.
	(extract_field): Likewise, for 2nd arg.
	(keycmp): Remove now-unnecessary cast of xmemcoll args.

	(is_blank): New function, to avoid need to cast arg to unsigned char.
	(extract_field): Use it.

	(xfields): Rewrite pretty much from scratch.

	(hard_LC_COLLATE): Now bool, not int.
	(get_line, getseq, add_field_list): Now returns bool, not int.
	(decode_field_spec, add_field_list): Return true on success (not
	false), for consistency with the rest of the code.  All uses changed.

	(tab): Now char, not unsigned char.  This wasn't 100% necessary
	but is slightly cleaner.
	(prjoin): Hoist (tab ? tab : ' ') expression, to help the compiler.

	(empty_filler): Now const *.

	(make_blank): Remove; wasn't needed.  Remove all calls.
	(main): Don't set uni_blank.nfields; zero is fine.

2003-12-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/join.c: Include "quote.h".
	(min, max): Remove definitions.
	Make a few function parameters and corresponding
	locals `const'.  Use bool for boolean variables.
	Use size_t (not int) for all counters and related index variables.
	(prjoin): Remove now-useless assertion.
	(string_to_join_field): New function.
	(main): Accept join fields as large as SIZE_MAX.
	(keycmp): Rename `min' to MIN and max to MAX.

2003-12-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	fold -s didn't work on e.g., alpha-based systems.
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Adjust types (int->size_t) so that using
	x2nrealloc works properly on systems with differing sizes for int
	and size_t.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	* src/fold.c: Use `bool' (not int) as the type for a few
	global variables.

2003-12-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (length_of_file_names_and_frills):
	Remove forward decl; not needed.
	(print_file_name_and_frills, length_of_file_name_and_frills):
	With -m, don't output spaces before inum or size.
	(print_with_commas): Don't output space just before newline.

2003-12-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add m-option.
	* tests/ls/m-option: New file.  Test for above fixes.

2003-12-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.0.

	* src/pr.c: Change type of global, buff_allocated, to size_t.

	* src/join.c [struct seq]: Change types of members count and alloc
	from `int' to `size_t'.

	* tests/Makefile.am (root-hint): Tweak wording.

	* src/du.c: Accept new option (-0, --null) that makes it so each
	output line is NUL-terminated rather than newline-terminated.

	* src/dd.c (apply_translations): Don't prohibit conv=unblock,sync.
	Reported by Volker Paul.
	* tests/dd/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add unblock-sync.
	* tests/dd/unblock-sync: New test for the above.

2003-12-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/nohup: Double quote back-ticked expression,
	in case it ends up having an unexpected value.

	* tests/ls/no-arg: Use ls's -1 option in both runs.

	* src/du.c (fts_debug): New global.
	(FTS_CROSS_CHECK, DEBUG_OPT): Define.
	(main): Make fts use FTS_TIGHT_CYCLE_CHECK.
	(main) [DU_DEBUG]: Accept -d option.

2003-12-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (format_user): Increment dired_pos via two statements,
	`dired_pos += width; dired_pos++;' rather than one,
	`dired_pos += width + 1;' since the latter could conceivably overflow.
	(format_group): Likewise.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.8.

2003-12-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-12-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (news-date-check): New rule.
	(alpha beta major): Depend on it.

2003-12-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: ls -l (and similar options) now adjust all columns to
	fit the data.  Generalized from a suggestion by Leah Q for file sizes.
	* src/ls.c (INODE_DIGITS, LOGIN_NAME_MAX, ID_LENGTH_MAX): Remove.
	(format_user_width, format_group_width, unsigned_file_size,
	format_group): New functions.

	(gobble_file): Use a new local variable 'f' to make the code
	smaller and more consistent with other functions.
	(format_user): Output to stdout, not to a buffer, so that we
	don't have to worry about buffer overrun.  Update dired_pos.
	(print_long_file): Don't put owner, group, author into buffer;
	just print them directly.  Don't assume link counts and
	major and minor numbers fit into unsigned long int.
	* tests/cp/same-file, tests/mv/part-symlink: Don't assume that
	'ls' output is fixed-width.

2003-11-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Parse floating-point operands and options in the C locale.
	POSIX requires this for printf, and we might as well be
	consistent elsewhere (tail, sleep, seq).

	* src/printf.c: Remove decls of strtod, strtol, strtoul; no longer
	needed now that we assume C89.  Include "c-strtod.h".

	Reported by Mark Conty.

2003-11-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_xalloc_h_in_src): Remove rule.  Subsumed by...

	* src/join.c (usage): Mention that FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted
	on the join fields.  Suggestion from Bruce Robertson.

2003-11-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`od -c -w9999999' could segfault
	* src/od.c (dump): Use xnmalloc/free, not alloca.

2003-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use autoconf-2.59.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/du/hard-link: Minor tweak: use mkdir -p.

	Fix read-from-free'd-buffer error detected by valgrind.
	* src/csplit.c (remove_line): Don't return a pointer to data in
	a freed buffer.  Instead, arrange to free the buffer on the
	subsequent call.

	* tests/misc/csplit: New test for above fix.

2003-11-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (extract_dirs_from_files): Avoid useless copy operations.
	This avoids a warning from valgrind about memcpy with overlapping
	source and destination.

	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.7.8.

	(mark_printable_field, is_printable_field, is_range_start_index,
	set_fields, set_fields, cut_bytes, cut_fields):
	Use size_t, not unsigned, for field and byte counts.
	(hash_int): Use uintptr_t, not unsigned, for pointers converted
	to integers.  This squeezes more info out of them.
	(set_fields, cut_bytes, cut_fields, main):
	Use bool, not int, for booleans.
	(set_fields): Allocate zeroed byte array with xzalloc, not xcalloc.

2003-11-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* man/Makefile.am (check-programs-vs-x):
	Work even if $(programs) contains '$'.
	Work even if 'missing=1' in environment.
	Don't report an error simply because $(programs) outputs nothing.

	Don't fail when run with VERBOSE=yes.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Do `set +x' before starting the subshell
	from which we invoke chgrp.  Otherwise, the output from the
	VERBOSE=yes-induced `set -x' would result in spurious differences.
	Reported by Russel Coker via Michael Stone.

2003-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chmod now uses fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is
	specified.  Before, it operated on full path names, and as such
	would encounter the PATH_MAX (often 4096) limit.

	* src/chmod.c: Include "xfts.h".
	(process_file): Rename from change_file_mode.
	Adapt to be used with fts.
	(process_files): New function.

2003-10-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2003-10-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chown and chgrp now accept POSIX-mandated -H, -L, -P options and
	use fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is specified.
	Before, they operated on full path names, and as such would
	encounter the PATH_MAX (often 4096) limit.
	They are more efficient.  For example, before, chgrp -R would
	take almost 5 seconds to change about 2000 directories and fail
	(with `File name too long'), while now it succeeds on a hierarchy
	of depth 20,000 in 1/10 the time.

	* src/chown.c: Include "userspec.h" and "fts_.h".
	(WRITTEN_BY): Add my name.

	* src/chgrp.c: Include "fts_.h".
	(WRITTEN_BY): Add my name.
	(MAXUID, MAXGID): Remove definitions.  Use GID_T_MAX instead of
	the latter.
	(usage): Update.
	(main): Handle new options.
	Call new function, chown_files rather than change_file_owner.

	Rewrite to iterate through hierarchies using fts rather than
	via explicit recursion.
	* src/chown-core.c: Include "fts_.h"
	(change_file_owner): Rewrite to use FTS* and FTSENT* and to operate
	on a single file at a time.
	(chown_files): New function.
	* src/chown-core.h [enum Dereference_symlink]: Remove declaration.
	[struct Chown_option] (recurse, force_silent): Change type to `bool'.

	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add posix-H.

	* src/ln.c (usage): Clarify that --directory, -d, -F probably won't

	properly diagnosed.
	* lib/human.c, lib/xstrtoimax.c, lib/xstrtol.c, lib/xstrtol.h,
	lib/xstrtoul.c, lib/xstrtoumax.c: Sync with gnulib.
	* src/sort.c (parse_field_count): Handle the case where overflow
	and invalid suffix char are both reported.

2003-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches) [TIOCGWINSZ]: Comment out the
	warning-inducing test, ws.ws_col <= SIZE_MAX, since it was always
	true on Linux.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix to avoid a denial-of-service attack if the display width is
	enormous.  Also, clean up the code a bit by removing duplicate code.

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Remove forward decl; no longer needed.
	(calculate_columns): New function, that contains code that used
	to be common to print_many_per_line and print_horizontal.
	(print_many_per_line, print_horizontal): Use it.
	(decode_switches): Set max_idx here, not in calculate_columns.
	(print_current_files): Don't call init_column_info; calculate_columns
	now does that.
	(init_column_info): Don't allocate a lot more space than is needed
	to represent the current set of files.  Allocate all the new
	size_t cells in one call to xnmalloc, rather than a row at a time.

2003-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Add another FIXME comment.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix address-arithmetic bug in 'ls', reported by Georgi Guninski.
	Remove several arbitrary limits on hosts where int cannot represent
	all size_t values.

	* src/ls.c (struct bin_str.len, length_of_file_name_and_frills, indent,
	nfiles, files_index, tabsize, line_length, struct column_info.line_len,
	struct column_info.col_arr[0], max_idx):
	Now size_t, not int.
	(get_funky_string): Return bool indicating success, instead of
	a negative count to indicate failure.  Store number of columns
	through new parameter OUTPUT_COUNT; that way, they can never
	go negative.  Change equals_end from int to bool.  All uses
	changed.
	(struct column_info.valid_len): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(dired_dump_obstack, get_funky_string, clear_files,
	extract_dirs_from_files, print_current_files,
	print_many_per_line, print_horizontal, init_column_info,
	put_indicator, length_of_file_name_and_frills,
	print_with_commas): Use size_t, not int, for local variables
	that count sizes.
	(decode_switches): Decode sizes using xstrtoul, not xstrtol.

	(gobble_file): Use xnrealloc, not XREALLOC.
	(print_color_indicator): Remove now-unnecessary cast to size_t.

2003-10-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/no-x: Change wording of diagnostic to match latest du.c.
	* tests/sort/sort-tests: Remove from CVS; assume that people
	brave enough to check coreutils out from CVS can rebuild it.

2003-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	New options: --preserve-root and --no-preserve-root.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Honor new option.
	(change_file_mode): Strip trailing slashes on directory
	argument passed to change_dir_mode.

	(main): Initialize global, root_dev_ino.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't #ifdef-out simple uses of

	via system.h.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Likewise.

2003-10-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (main): Remove obsolete FIXME.

2003-10-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.8.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	csplit cleanup.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (csplit invocation):
	The regexp offset need not have a sign; POSIX requires support
	for signless offets.

	Be more careful about int widths.  For example, remove some
	arbitrary limits by replacing 'unsigned' with 'size_t',
	'uintmax_t', etc.  Use standard bool rather than a homegrown type.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add xstrtoimax.c.
	* src/csplit.c (FALSE, TRUE, boolean): Remove.  All uses changed
	to <stdbool.h> usage.
	(struct control): offset is now intmax_t, not int.
	repeat_forever is now bool, not int.
	(struct cstring): len is now size_t, not unsigned int.

	create_new_buffer, get_new_buffer, load_buffer, find_line,
	process_regexp, split_file, new_control_record, extract_regexp,
	get_format_width, get_format_prec, max_out):
	size args, locals, and returned values are now size_t, not unsigned
	or int.
	(get_first_line_in_buffer, find_line, write_to_file,
	handle_line_error, process_line_count, regexp_error, process_regexp,
	split_file):
	File line, byte, and repetition counts are now uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(check_for_offset): Don't require a sign before the offset.
	Use xstrtoimax to do the real work.
	(extract_regexp): Remove harmful cast of size to unsigned.
	256 -> 1<<CHAR_BIT, for clarity.
	(get_format_flags): Return at most 3, to avoid worries about overflow.

	(bytes_to_octal_digits): Remove.

	(cleanup): Don't check whether output_stream is NULL, since
	close_output_file does that for us.

	(new_line_control, create_new_buffer): Use "foo *p = xmalloc
	(sizeof *p);" instead of the more long-winded alternatives.

	(get_new_buffer): Use O(1) algorithm for resizing a buffer
	to a much larger size, instead of an O(N) algorithm.

	(process_regexp): Use plain NULL rather than casted 0.

	(make_filename): Use %u, not %d, to format unsigned file number.

	(new_control_record): Use xrealloc exclusively, since it handles
	NULL reliably.

	(extract_regexp): Change misspelled word in diagnostic.

	(get_format_width): Even if a minimum field width is specified,
	allow room for enough octal digits to represent the value of
	the maximum representible integer.  This fixes a potential
	buffer overrun.  Calculate this room at compile-time, not
	at run-time; this removes the need for bytes_to_octal_digits.
	Check for overflow; this removes a FIXME.

	(get_format_prec): Don't allow precision to be signed; it's
	not ANSI.  Check for overflow.  Remove hardcoded "11" as
	default precision; this fixes a potential buffer overrun
	on hosts with wider size_t.

	(get_format_conv_type): Change local variable to be of type
	unsigned char, not int; this removes a potential subscript
	violation on hosts where char is signed.

	(max_out): Replace "for (;*p;)" with more-standard "while (*p)".
	Allow "%%" in format.  Don't overflow when
	counting lots of percents.

	(usage): Default sprintf format is %02u, not %d.

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Remove now-unused definition.

	Deprecate existing use of -H (aka --si).
	* src/du.c (enum) [HUMAN_SI_OPTION]: New member.
	[long_options]: Use HUMAN_SI_OPTION, not 'H'.

	POSIX compliant.

2003-10-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/inaccessible-cwd: Ensure that even when run from an
	inaccessible directory, du can still operate on accessible
	directories elsewhere.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inaccessible-cwd.

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Ensure that du can process a hierarchy
	of depth 400 while using no more than 50KB of stack space.

2003-10-01  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* announce-gen (print_news_deltas): New function, extracted from main.
	(main): Make `news_file' an array.
	Use '...=s' => \@var for --news and --url-directory specs.
	Before there were a couple of portability problems.

2003-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_cast_of_alloca_return_value): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/copy.c: Remove unnecessary cast of alloca, since now it's
	guaranteed to be (void *).
	* src/cp.c: Likewise.

2003-09-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't exhaust virtual memory when processing large inputs.
	Fix this by removing csplit's internal free-list management;
	instead rely on malloc for that.

	* src/csplit.c (free_list): Remove global.
	(clear_all_line_control): Remove function.
	(get_new_buffer): Always use create_new_buffer to obtain a
	new buffer, rather than searching free_list.
	(free_buffer): Just call free.
	Reported by Nikola Milutinovic.

2003-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/rm.x: Also list `chattr' in SEE ALSO section.
	Suggestion from Mark Hubbart.

2003-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Don't invoke AC_AIX or AC_MINIX explicitly, now
	that we use gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS, since it AC_REQUIREs them.

	* Use autoconf-2.57d.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Minor efficiency tweak.
	* src/ln.c (PATH_BASENAME_CONCAT): Use memcpy rather than strcpy.
	(do_link): Likewise.

2003-09-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c (paste_serial): Save errno after input error,
	to report proper errno value.
	Based on a patch from Paul Eggert.

	* src/tee.c (tee): Adjust fwrite arguments so that the return
	value is the number of bytes written.

2003-09-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't assume ferror sets errno.  Bug reported by Bruno Haible.

	* src/comm.c (compare_files): Save errno after input error,
	to report proper errno value.
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (check_and_close, skip, read_char, read_block): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (unexpand): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (close_output_file): Don't report bogus errno value
	after ferror discovers an output error.  We don't know the proper
	errno value, since it might have been caused by any of a whole
	bunch of calls, and it might have been trashed in the meantime.
	Fixing this problem will require much more extensive changes;
	in the meantime just say "write error".
	* src/od.c (check_and_close, dump, dump_strings): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/join.c (get_line): Report error right away if I/O fails,
	so that the proper errno value is used.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable, tac_file, save_stdin): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (tee): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (skip): If a read fails, don't retry it later, so
	that we report the proper errno.

	* src/tac.c (tac_mem): Don't return a value; nobody uses it.

	* src/tee.c (tee): Once a write failure has occurred, don't bother
	writing anything more to that stream.

	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Check for ferror (stdout) even if
	ostream == stdout.

	* src/yes.c (UNROLL): Remove.
	(main): Exit immediately when write failure is detected.
	Simplify code by assigning to argv when argc == 1.

2003-09-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Switch encoding from Latin-1 to UTF-8.
	(WRITTEN_BY): Change "Franc,ois" (actually using
	c-with-cedilla in Latin-1) to "F.", so that it's ASCII, as
	xgettext requires.

2003-09-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`du -D symlink-to-dir' would mistakenly omit the slash in
	lines like this: 24	symlink-to-dir/subdir
	* src/du.c (process_file): Fix offset calculation.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #211591;
	http://bugs.debian.org/205251

	* tests/du/deref-args: New file/test for the above.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add deref-args.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Remove useless disjunct.

	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Rename parameter, Authors,
	to Written_by.
	* nearly all src/*.c files (WRITTEN_BY): Rename from AUTHORS.
	Begin each WRITTEN_BY string with `Written by ' and end it with `.'.
	Mark each WRITTEN_BY string as translatable.

	* who.c, whoami.c, yes.c: Revert yesterday's changes.
	Instead, a subsequent change will embed `Written by ' in
	each string along with the author names.

	* src/true.c: Revert yesterday's changes.

	* src/true.c (main): Append NULL to version_etc argument list.
	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Likewise.

	* src/sort.c (numcompare): Rename local, logb, to log_b to avoid

2003-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/factor.c (print_factors): Give a separate diagnostic
	for numbers that are too large, but otherwise valid.
	Reported by Dániel Varga.

2003-09-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.7.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Use ../src/tr -s ' ' '\n' in place
	of `fmt -1'.  Using the just-built tr is a little cleaner.
	Christian Krackowizer reported that HPUX 10.20 doesn't have fmt.
	* man/Makefile.am (programs, check-x-vs-1): Likewise.

2003-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c: Alphabetize includes.
	Remove duplicate inclusion of "same.h".

2003-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Remove --rsyncable.
	Didn't give enough of a benefit, mainly because it's not yet
	in wide enough use.

	* Version 5.0.91.

	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Use ../src, not $(srcdir)/../src.
	(check-programs-vs-x): Fail if $(programs) is empty.

	* src/remove.c: Add a comment.

2003-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (D_INO, ENABLE_CYCLE_CHECK) [D_INO_IN_DIRENT]:
	Don't define.  These symbols are no longer used.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Write ^D as \cD.
	Complete the change of 2003-08-02.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Use cvsu, so that a temporary source
	file in lib/ or src/ doesn't induce an unwarranted failure.
	Add a kludge to filter out the sole generated source file that
	also has translatable messages: src/false.c.

2003-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (enum): Add ALLOW_MISSING_OPTION.
	(parse_options): Give a diagnostic for (but still accept) the
	deprecated --allow-missing option.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't ignore -S if input is a pipe.  Bug report by Michael McFarland in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00008.html>.

	* src/sort.c (sort_buffer_size): Omit SIZE_BOUND arg.  Compute the
	size_bound ourselves. if an input file is a pipe and the user
	specified a size, use that size instead of trying to guess the
	pipe size.  This has the beneficial side effect of avoiding the
	overhead of default_sort_size in that case.  All callers changed.
	(sort): Remove static var size; now done by sort_buffer_size.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.6b and autoconf-2.57b.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: Wait .5 seconds for backgrounded process
	to start, rather than just .1.  Upon failure, print unexpected state.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Don't assign 0 or
	SAFE_READ_ERROR to tmp->nbytes.
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines, pipe_bytes): Likewise.

	* src/head.c (struct linebuffer): Change nbytes and nlines
	from unsigned int to size_t.  unsigned int is safe (after the
	2003-09-03 patch) but size_t is cleaner.
	* src/tail.c (struct linebuffer, struct charbuffer): Likewise.
	(pipe_bytes): Likewise for local variable 'i', which was 'int'.

	Standardize on BUFSIZ as opposed to other macro names and values.
	* src/head.c (BUFSIZE): Remove.  All uses changed to BUFSIZ.
	* src/tail.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Remove.
	stdio.h has always defined it,
	and other code already assumes it's defined.
	* src/tr.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Likewise.
	(IO_BUF_SIZE): Remove; replace all uses with sizeof io_buf.
	(io_buf): IO_BUF_SIZE -> BUFSIZ.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (step): Default to 1.
	(print_numbers): Allow the output to be empty.
	(main): The default step is 1, even if LAST < FIRST;
	as per documentation.
	* tests/seq/basic (onearg-2): Output should be empty.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Temporarily disable, until master
	versions are restored to ftp.gnu.org.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Specify automake-1.7.6.

	Make seq's --width (-w) option work properly even when the
	endpoint requiring the larger width is negative and smaller than
	the other endpoint.
	* src/seq.c (get_width_format): Include `-' in the set of bytes
	allowed in a `simple' number (no decimal point, no exponent).
	Reported by Patrick Mauritz.

2003-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: sort -t '\0' now uses a NUL tab.
	sort option order no longer matters, unless POSIX requires it.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Say "blanks" instead of "whitespace",
	Similar fixes for many comments.
	(TAB_DEFAULT): New constant, so that we can support NUL as
	the field separator.
	(tab): Now int, not char.  Initialize to TAB_DEFAULT.
	(specify_sort_size): If multiple sizes are specified, use the largest.
	(begfield, limfield): Support NUL tab char.
	(set_ordering): Do not let -i override -d.
	(main): Report an error if incompatible -o or -t options are given.
	Report an error for "-t ''".  Allow "-t '\0'" to specify a NUL tab.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sort/Test.pm [o2, nul-tab]: New tests for the above.

2003-09-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	Bug report and patch here:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00009.html>
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines): Don't truncate return value from safe_read.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Likewise.

2003-09-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (AUTHORS): Remove Larry McVoy's name, since the relatively
	small amount of code from him was first moved to lib/human.c, and was
	subsequently rewritten entirely.
	* src/df.c (AUTHORS): Likewise.

2003-08-22  Lawrence Teo  <lcteo@uncc.edu>

	* src/md5sum.c (split_3): Accept the BSD format for generic
	message digest modes.  Currently works with BSD's MD5 and SHA1
	formats since these are the two algorithms presently used in
	coreutils.  Updated comments to reflect this change.
	(bsd_split_3): Updated comments.

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: New test to make sure that
	`md5sum --check' doesn't accept the BSD SHA1 format (adapted
	from `check-bsd' test in tests/sha1sum/basic-1).

	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1 (check-bsd2, check-bsd3): New tests for
	--check exit status and BSD SHA1 format (adapted from tests
	in tests/md5sum/basic-1).

2003-08-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Use SAME_INODE rather than open-coding it.

	When source and destination arguments refer to the same file, reside
	on a partition (e.g. VFAT) on which distinct names may refer to the
	same directory entry (often due to variations in case), and when the
	link count for the file is 1, mv no longer unlinks the file.  Instead,
	it gives the expected diagnostic that the source and destination are
	the same.  WARNING: this is an incomplete fix.  If the file happens
	to have a link count of 2 or greater, such an erroneous mv command
	will still unlink it.
	Although that is not possible on vfat or umsdos, it is possible on
	other file system types, e.g., ntfs, and hpfs.
	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Invoke same_name (which might still
	return false for names that refer to the same directory entry)
	only if the link count is 2 or more.
	* tests/mv/vfat: Show how to demonstrate the above problem.
	This test is not run.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add vfat.

2003-08-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c: Change meaning of -l from --lookup to --login, per POSIX.
	who's -l option has been eliciting an unconditional warning about
	this impending change since sh-utils-2.0.12 (April 2002).

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Don't output `EOF' (aka -1) as a `char'.
	This would happen for nonempty files not ending with a newline.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/misc/paste-no-nl: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add paste-no-nl.

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Avoid buffer overrun that would
	occur when the user-specified format string ends with `%'.
	Patch by Tommi Kyntola.
	* tests/misc/stat-fmt: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-fmt.

2003-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Apply changes from bison.
	* GNUmakefile (SHELL): Define to `sh', if necessary.
	Add copyright.
	* Makefile.maint (WGETFLAGS): Define to `-C off'.
	Update all uses of $(WGET).

2003-08-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): New.
	* Makefile.maint (local-check): Rename as...
	(local-checks-available): this.
	(local-check): New.

2003-08-26  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Neutralize "<#" as
	"<\#" to avoid magic from Gnus when posting parts of this script.

2003-08-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (main): Warn about use of deprecated `-l' option.

2003-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): For link count at end of line, use %h format,
	instead of %-5h.  The latter would make stat emit trailing spaces.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2003-08-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_space_tab .x-sc_sun_os_names

2003-08-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Include stdlib.h unconditionally,
	as we're now assuming that part of hosted C89.

2003-08-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (textdomain, bindtextdomain) [! ENABLE_NLS]: Define away,
	to avoid warnings from gcc.

2003-08-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary and sometimes time-consuming hostname lookups.
	* src/who.c (print_user): Use strchr, not strrchr.
	* src/pinky.c (print_entry): Likewise.
	Patch by Michael Stone.
	This fixes a typo I introduced in who-users.c on 1996-02-23.

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): Add 0-9 to the range of characters
	disallowed between `@...@'.

2003-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.ac (fu_cv_sys_truncating_statfs): Remove; now
	done by gnulib .m4 files.
	(jm_DUMMY_1): Require gl_READUTMP, not jm_PREREQ_READUTMP.
	* src/sys2.h (strtoull): Remove unused declaration.

2003-08-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Ensure that generated PROGRAM.1 files
	are read-only.

	* src/tail.c (tail_lines): Fix a potential (but very hard to exercise)
	race condition bug.  The bug would be triggered when tailing a file
	with file pointer not at beginning of file, and where the file was
	truncated to have a length of less than the initial offset at just
	the right moment (between the two lseek calls in this function).

	An invalid initial value for *read_pos would result in
	`tail -n0 -f FILE' and `tail -c0 -f FILE' doing what amounted to a
	busy-wait rather than sleeping between iterations.  The bug manifests
	itself only when tailing regular files that are initially nonempty.
	* src/tail.c (tail_bytes): Set *read_pos to new file offset after
	each xlseek call.
	(tail_lines): Likewise, after lseek calls.
	Reported by Nick Estes.  See http://bugs.debian.org/205251 for details.
	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: New file.  Test for above fix.
	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add tail-n0f.

2003-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_space_tab): Use exclusion list in separate file.
	(sc_sun_os_names): Likewise.
	* .x-sc_space_tab, .x-sc_sun_os_names: New files.

	* man/help2man: Remove some SPACEs before TAB.

2003-08-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.maint (LC_ALL): Set to C.
	* man/Makefile.am (ASSORT): New var.
	(check-x-vs-1, programs): Use it.
	* src/Makefile.am (ASSORT, check-README, ../AUTHORS): Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (ASSORT, all_programs): Likewise.

2003-08-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	fold -s -wN would infloop for N < 8 with TABs in the input.
	E.g., this would not terminate: printf 'a\tb' | fold -w2 -s
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Move contents of `else'-block
	out of conditional so it's used also for --spaces (-s).
	* tests/misc/fold: Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fold.

2003-08-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <sys/resource.h> after
	system.h so the types from time.h and sys/time.h are available.
	It appears that this is necessary for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
	Darwin 6.5 (MacOS 10.2.5).  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add support for setting file timestamps to microsecond
	resolution, on hosts that support this.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/install.c, src/touch.c: Include utimens.h.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal):
	Set file timestamps with utimens, not utime.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (newtime, touch, main): Likewise.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_sun_os_names): New rule based on a regexp
	from Paul Eggert.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/tail.c (main): Tweak Solaris OS version number in comment.
	* src/wc.c (wc): Likewise
	* tests/tail-2/fflush: Likewise.

	* src/tail.c: Add new undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	(pipe_lines): Use memchr to skip lines, rather than an explicit loop.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use new gnulib 'extensions' module.
	* configure.ac: Invoke gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead of
	AC_GNU_SOURCE.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/basic: Ensure that a/b/F has at least 65 bytes too.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Reflect that `split -a 0' is now accepted.
	For tests of obsolete behavior, don't presume that unsetting
	_POSIX2_VERSION is equivalent to _POSIX2_VERSION=199209.

2003-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (split invocation):
	Add -d or --numeric-suffixes option to 'split'.
	From a suggestion by Jesse Kornblum.
	* src/split.c (suffix_alphabet): New var.
	(longopts, usage, next_file_name, main): Support -d.
	(next_file_name, main): Allow -a0, as POSIX requires.
	(next_file_name): Don't assume ASCII-like encoding;
	'a' through 'z' are not contiguous in EBCDIC.

2003-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge getline from gnulib.
	* lib/getline.h, lib/getline.c, m4/getline.m4: Merge from gnulib.
	* lib/getndelim2.h, lib/getndelim2.c, m4/getndelim2.m4, m4/ssize_t.m4:
	New files, from gnulib.
	* lib/getdelim2.c, lib/getdelim2.h: Remove.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Change getdelim2.c and
	getdelim2.h to getndelim2.c and getndelim2.h.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_MACROS): Use gl_GETNDELIM2 rather than
	checking for getdelim.
	(jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES): Use gt_TYPE_SSIZE_T for ssize_t rather
	than rolling our own.
	* src/cut.c: Include getndelim2.h rather than getdelim2.h.
	(cut_fields): Invoke getndelim2 rather than getdelim2.

2003-08-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (main): Use unsigned int instead of int for `nsigs'
	and for the indices to iterate through nsigs.

2003-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Minor code cleanups, mostly to use more accurate
	types and to remove unnecessary casts.
	(min, max): Remove.  All uses changed to MIN and MAX.
	(hard_lc_collate, hard_LC_TIME, struct buffer.eof, struct
	keyfield.skipsblanks, struct keyfield.skipeblanks, struct
	keyfield.numeric, struct keyfield.general_numeric, struct
	keyfield.month, struct keyfield.reverse, reverse, unique,
	have_read_stdin): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(eolchar): Now char, not int.
	(struct keyfield.ignore): Now bool const *, not int *.
	(struct keyfield.translate): Now char const *, not char *.
	(struct month.name): Likewise.
	(blanks, nonprinting, nondictionary): Now bool[], not int[].
	(cleanup, inittables, keycompare, check, mergefps, first_same_file,
	check, sort, main): Use const * pointers when possible.
	(month_cmp): Rewrite to avoid casts.
	(inittables): Initialize tables unconditionally, to avoid branches.
	(fillbuf): Return bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(fillbuf, keycompare, new_key, main):
	Use SIZE_MAX rather than (size_t) -1.
	(trailing_blanks): Renamed from trim_trailing_blanks.
	Return the number of blanks to trim.  All uses changed.
	(getmonth): Use trailing_blanks rather than open code.
	(keycompare): Do not cast char * to unsigned char *; not needed.
	CMP_WITH_IGNORE converts args to UCHAR, so no need to convert it
	ourselves.
	(compare, main): Use | rather than || to avoid jumps.
	Replace "diff = NONZERO (alen)" with "diff = 1", since alen must
	be nonzero there.
	(check, first_same_file, sort, main):
	Use bool instead of int local vars when possible.
	(check): Merge the old 'checkfp' and 'check' into a single function,
	that returns a boolean (true if the file was ordered).
	All uses changed.
	(main): Use int instead of unsigned for iterating through nsigs.
	Rename local var "posix_pedantic" to "posixly_correct".

2003-08-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <time.h> before <sys/resource.h>
	to avoid compilation error on Ultrix. Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Don't read again after encountering an
	initial EOF.  E.g., `cut -f2' would do so.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Add a test for the above fix.

	* src/sort.c (sortlines): Add description and references.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set PATH so that
	the tests in help-version will use the just-built binaries.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add --rfc-2822 option to GNU date.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Time directives, Options for date, Examples
	of date): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (long_options, usage, main): Likewise.
	* doc/getdate.texi (General date syntax): Likewise.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Options for date): Fix a typo in format:
	it's now %d not %_d.  Add URLs.

2003-08-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/shred/remove: Ensure that $? is 0 for the final `exit 0'.
	Otherwise, with at least the /bin/sh from HPUX 10.20,
	the trap code would end up converting that to exit 1 and thus an
	unexpected test failure.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Do not include bumpalloc.h.
	(WORD_TABLE): New member alloc.
	(ALLOC_NEW_WORD): Remove.
	(occurs_alloc): New var.
	(digest_word_file, find_occurs_in_text): Check for arithmetic
	overflow when computing table size.  Use xrealloc rather than
	bumpalloc primitives.

2003-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.90.

	* README: When running tests as root, suggest using
	sudo with NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Makefile is in ../src, not
	$(srcdir)/../src.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Try Debian/gzip's new --rsyncable option.

2003-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/stdbool.hin (_Bool): Make it signed char, instead of
	an enum type, so that it's guaranteed to promote to int.
	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Undo previous change.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Declare local `swap' to be `int', not
	`bool'.  Otherwise, at least one buggy compiler (alpha gcc-2.95.4)
	would cause lines[-1 - swap] (with swap = false) to evaluate to
	lines[4294967295].

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/priv-check (my_uid): Use `!', not `^' in case pattern `[!0-9]',
	since /bin/sh of at least NetBSD 1.6 and OpenBSD 3.2 don't accept `^'.

	* src/remove.c (prompt) [! recursive]: Don't prompt about unwritable
	directories, as required by POSIX.   Reported by Karl Berry.
	* tests/rm/dir-no-w: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-no-w.

	* tests/mk-script: Emit `$xx', not its expansion.

2003-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	This change was inspired by a similar proposal by Stepan Kasal.
	* src/sort.c (mergelines, sortlines_temp): New functions.
	(sortlines): Use them, to reduce the number of times that
	we need to copy 'struct line' values.  This improved CPU
	performance by about 30% on one 18 MB test.
	(sort): Don't invoke sortlines unless we have 2 or more lines.

2003-07-26  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* src/sort.c (sort): Don't require two `struct line's per text line,
	the new sort algorithm requires just 1.5.

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %lu, not %ld.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/cut.c (is_printable_field): Simplify bit arithmetic.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Put `volatile' in the right place.
	From Paul Eggert.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use only one bit per field/offset in array, not one `int'.
	* src/cut.c (printable_field): Change type to `unsigned char'.
	(mark_printable_field, is_printable_field): New functions.
	Use them in place of all direct accesses of `printable_field'.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tabstops): Detect overflow properly.
	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Likewise.

	* src/rm.c: Include "dirname.h".
	(usage): Use base_name (program_name) in body of --help output.
	This lets me...
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): ...back out the kludge of 2003-07-22.
	Idea from Brendan O'Dea, who suggested using
	`program_name = basename (argv[0]);' everywhere --
	can't do that, but using base_name works just fine here.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Exempt test.

2003-07-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-compliance problems with 'test'.  This makes
	'test' more compatible with Bash.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document the following.
	* src/test.c: Include exitfail.h.
	(TEST_FAILURE): New constant, used for exit status if 'test' fails.
	(test-syntax_error): Use it.
	(binary_operator): Now takes bool arg specifying whether left operand
	is -l ARG, so that caller determines this rather than us.
	All uses changed.
	(term): Use posixtest to evaluate parenthesized subexpressions.
	(unary_operator, one_argument): Remove support for -t without operand.
	(one_argument): Take argument from argv[pos].
	(one_argument, two_arguments, three_arguments): Advance pos.
	All callers changed.
	(three_arguments): Look for binary ops before "!".  Then look
	for parenthesized one_argument expressions, instead of trusting
	expr () to do the right thing.
	(posixtest): Now takes number of args.  All callers changed.
	Treat "( A B )" like "A B".
	(main): Set exit_failure to TEST_FAILURE.  Don't depend on
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, as we now conform to POSIX by default.
	(main) [!LBRACKET]: Do not recognize "--help" or "--verbose" unless.
	* tests/test/Test.pm (test_vector): Add several tests to check
	the above.  Syntax errors now exit with status 2, not 1.
	* man/Makefile.am (mapped_name): Use `../src/[' binary to create test.1.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Adjust for above change in test behavior:
	`[' exits with 2, not 1, and test doesn't accept --help or --version.

	* Makefile.maint (ME): Don't use trick suggested in Make manual.
	It doesn't work for make-3.79.1.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_system_h_headers): Another syntax check.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Cast strlen value to `unsigned long'
	so it matches `%ld' format even on 32-bit systems.

	* src/fmt.c (flush_paragraph): Cast field width to `int' to
	avoid warning on 64-bit systems.

	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Make `func' volatile, so it can't be
	clobbered by a `longjmp' into this function.

2003-07-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %ld format (not %d) for size_t
	value.

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Disable the --line-bytes=$_4gb test,
	because it'd evoke spurious failure on 64-bit systems.

2003-07-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (usage): Document the fact that SIGUSR1 makes dd
	output its current record counts.  Reported by Jurriaan.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm (test_vector): Disable the `PIPE' tests when running
	`wc' with no options.  This goes along with the change of 2003-07-20.

2003-07-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't include headers already included by system.h:

	Don't include closeout.h.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Add a check for whether $NON_ROOT_USERNAME
	can access the required version of rm.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define PACKAGE_VERSION.

	* tests/cut/Test.pm (out-delim3a): New test.

	* man/help2man: Update to version 1.33.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tabstops): Detect overflow in tabstop sizes.

	* src/dircolors.c: Include xstrndup.h.
	(xstrndup): Remove function, now that it's been factored out into
	it's own file.

2003-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (wc): Fix typo in computation of file from file_x,
	which caused the former to be used uninitialized if file_x was
	nonzero.

2003-07-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Use xcalloc in place of xmalloc+memset.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Substitute 's,$t/$*,$*,' on output of
	help2man, to avoid having `rm.td/rm' appear in rm.1.  Reported by
	Thomas Luzat.  See http://bugs.debian.org/202413 for details.

	* src/cut.c (main) [lint]: Initialize spec_list_string to avoid warning.

	* src/hostid.c: Don't include <unistd.h>.  system.h already does that.

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Mark all selected indices before trying to
	determine range endpoints.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: New test for the above fix.

	Begin to address this comment: What if someone wants to
	extract the 1,000,000-th field of some huge input file?
	The first step is to rearrange things so that the values
	in the printable_field array are all 0/1 rather than 0/1/2.
	* src/cut.c (RANGE_START_SENTINEL): Remove.
	Store range-start indices in a hash table, rather than
	overloading the `printable_field' array.
	(range_start_ht): New global.
	(hash_int, hash_compare_ints, is_range_start_index): New functions.
	(print_kth): Use is_range_start_index; don't test printable_field.
	(set_fields): Detect overflow.
	(set_fields): Insert each range-start index into range_start_ht.
	(main): Call set_fields only once, and only after
	output_delimiter_specified and (if required) range_start_ht have
	been defined.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (get_input_fstatus): Fix typo: `stat' was being
	invoked with a null pointer when there were no file arguments.

2003-07-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_changelog): Add another nit-picky check.

	* src/wc.c (write_counts): Add a comment.
	(wc): Rename `file' parameter.
	Set new local, `file', to be the file name, or (when it's NULL)
	_("standard output") so that all uses of `file' use the proper value.
	Use STREQ, not strcmp.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	wc count field widths now are heuristically adjusted depending
	on the input size, if known.  If only one count is printed, it
	is guaranteed to be printed without leading spaces.

	Previously, wc did not align the count fields if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT was set, but POSIX did not actually require
	this undesirable behavior, so it has been removed.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (wc invocation): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c (number_width): New var.
	(posixly_correct): Remove.
	(struct fstatus): New struct.
	(write_counts): Output fields of width number_width.
	Do not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	Use null file, not empty-string file, to denote stdin,
	since "" is a valid file name on some hosts.
	(wc, wc_file): New arg fstatus.  Use it to avoid invoking fstat
	if possible.
	(wc):  Avoid problems if end_pos - current_pos overflows.
	Do not print odd message if stdin has a read error.
	(get_input_fstatus, compute_number_width): New functions.
	(main): Use them to implement the new behavior.
	Ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm: Adjust to the new output widths.

2003-07-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Don't create temporary directory --
	we don't use it.

	* tests/shred/remove: Don't open-code test for UID != 0.
	Use priv-check's require-non-root instead.
	Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_expr): Record that
	expr exits with status of 3 for e.g., a write error.

	* tests/priv-check: Use `id -u' to see if we're running as root,
	rather than trying go write to an write-protected file.
	When running as root, ensure $NON_ROOT_USERNAME is valid.
	When running as root with `require-non-root', ensure that `.'
	is writable by $NON_ROOT_USERNAME, then reinvoke $0 set-user-ID
	to $NON_ROOT_USERNAME.  If `.' is not writable, then skip the test.

	* src/printenv.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure rather than calling close_stdout_set_status.
	* src/date.c: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/tty.c: Likewise.

2003-07-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/not-owner: Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, create a temporary
	directory, and remove Perl-coded `you may not run as root' test.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, rather than
	hard-coding something not quite equivalent.
	Paul Jarc reported the inconsistent diagnostics.

	* src/sort.c (main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `sort --version' and `sort --help' fail, as they should
	when their output is redirected to /dev/full.

	* src/su.c (usage): Don't call close_stdout here.
	(main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `su --version > /dev/full' fails, as it should.
	Somehow, the change of 2000-05-07 that purports to fix this
	was not checked in.

	* tests/help-version (--help/--version vs. /dev/full): Special-case
	`[' to protect it from expected_failure_status-`eval'.

	* src/uniq.c (writeline): Use a SPACE, not a TAB between the
	count and the corresponding line, as required by POSIX.
	Reported by Clement Wang.
	* tests/uniq/Test.pm (101, 102): Update tests of -c accordingly.

	* tests/expr/basic: Add tests for when exit status is 2.

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, NOHUP_FAILURE):
	Use an anonymous `enum', rather than #define.

2003-07-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/expr.c: Include "exitfail.h", "quotearg.h".
	(EXPR_INVALID, EXPR_ERROR): New constants.
	(nomoreargs, null, toarith, nextarg): Return bool, not int.
	(syntax_error): New function, exiting with status 2.  Use it
	insteading of printing "syntax error" ourselves.
	(main): Initialize exit_failure to EXPR_ERROR.
	Exit with EXPR_INVALID on syntax error (too few arguments).
	(nextarg): Use strcmp, not strcoll; strcoll might return
	an undesirable 0, or might fail.
	(docolon, eval4, eval3): Exit with status 3 on invalid argument type
	or other such error.
	(eval2): Report an error if strcoll fails in a string comparison.
	* src/sort.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure, not xalloc_exit_failure and
	xmemcoll_exit_failure.
	* tests/expr/basic: Invalid value exits with status 3, not 2.

2003-07-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Use 5.0.90 as the version, rather than 5.0.2,
	per GNU maintainer guidelines.  The next non-beta release will be 5.1.

	This script would have caught at least two recent bugs:
	those in [ and kill.
	* tests/help-version: Revive this script.
	It wasn't doing anything useful, since $all_programs wasn't being
	defined by the invoking Makefile.am.
	Reflect that nohup is no longer a script, so don't exclude it.
	Add framework to handle the programs added since it was last run:
	kill, stat, unlink, [, link, readlink.
	Fix path-related problems deriving from the move of this script
	from src/ to its present location.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Define.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Use it.

	* src/kill.c (main): Fix bug introduced on 2003-05-10 (for 5.0.1)
	whereby kill would always attempt to operate on argv[0] and fail.

	* src/test.c (integer_expected_error): Improve diagnostic -- now,
	it also matches the one from bash's builtin test.
	(binary_operator): Add \n at end of diagnostic.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Remove setuidgid-related code.  Move it to ...
	* tests/priv-check: Move setuidgid-related and
	NON_ROOT_USERNAME-checking code to this file.

	* README: Update section on testing as `root'.
	Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/test.c (AUTHORS): Replace 3-letter usernames with the actual
	names of authors that I just found in bash's builtins/test.def.

	Running `[' with no arguments would evoke a segfault.
	* src/test.c (main) [LBRACKET]: Move initialization of argv to
	precede potential use via test_syntax_error.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Rename from `INCLUDES', to avoid
	warning from automake -Wall.

2003-07-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.1.

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Remove target first, so gpg doesn't
	prompt us about it.

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Relax tests for matching
	version-number line in NEWS.
	Change the .sig suffix to .asc here, too.

2003-07-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Renamed from %.sig.
	Generate and use ascii-armored signatures.
	Use gpg's -o option.

2003-07-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FAILURE, NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE): Define.
	(main): Use them.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Move each individual check into
	its own target.
	(syntax-check-rules): This is the list of syntax-check targets.
	(sc_unmarked_diagnostics, sc_cast_of_argument_to_free):
	(sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value, sc_space_tab):
	(sc_error_exit_success, sc_xalloc_h_in_src):  New targets.

2003-07-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Remove uses of OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS and last
	traces of the nohup script.

	* src/Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): Remove use of just-removed
	$(OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS).

	* src/Makefile.am (localedir.h): Put the `2>&1' after the redirect
	target, not before the `>'.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd,
	now that that function no longer calls `error'.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Emit a diagnostic for each
	failed syscall, rather than relying on caller to do that.
	The caller couldn't do a good job, anyhow -- too many different
	ways to fail (each with a different referent).
	Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd, now that that function
	no longer calls `error'.
	(show_point): Don't diagnose find_mount_point's errors, now that
	it handles them itself.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Don't let free clobber errno upon
	failed chdir.

	* src/sys2.h: Remove alloca-related block.
	* src/system.h: Include <alloca.h> here, instead.

	It appears that the `#pragma alloca' included via "system.h" is
	adequate, since join.c uses alloca, yet lacked an in-file #pragma.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/df.c, src/install.c, src/ln.c:
	* src/ls.c, src/mv.c, src/remove.c: Remove `#pragma alloca'.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Do not restore any special
	permission bits (e.g., set-user-ID, set-group-ID) that are reset
	by chown(2) on some systems.  Suggestion and insistence :-) from
	Michael Stone.

	* tests/input-tty: Also check `test -t 1'.
	This is necessary on linux-2.4.21.  Otherwise, the stty/basic-1
	test would block when run in the background.

2003-07-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sample-test: Also fail if cat-to-create-expected-output
	fails.  Otherwise, if both `exp' and `out' were to end up empty
	because of e.g., a full disk, they would mistakenly compare equal.

	* src/nohup.c: New file.  Rewrite of nohup.sh in C.
	This solves a portability problem: on at least Solaris systems,
	when nohup.sh used the vendor /bin/sh, it would exit with status
	of `1' rather than the required 126 or 127 upon failure to exec
	the specified program.

	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_SCRIPTS): Remove definition.
	(bin_PROGRAMS): Add nohup.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Remove nohup.sh.
	(all_programs): Remove use of $(EXTRA_SCRIPTS).
	* src/nohup.sh: Remove file.
	* man/Makefile.am (nohup.1): Depend on nohup.c, rather than nohup.sh.

	* tests/misc/nohup: Tests for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nohup.

	* src/head.c (diagnose_copy_fd_failure): New function, renamed from
	the macro, COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE.
	(diagnose_copy_fd_failure): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	(head_file): Likewise.

	* src/date.c: Include "quote.h".
	(batch_convert): Use the quote function rather than using literal `...'
	in a diagnostic.

	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	* src/fmt.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable): Likewise.
	* src/yes.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_attributes): Likewise.

2003-07-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (usage): Use 1024*1024 in place of 1048576.
	* src/tail.c (usage): Likewise.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Now that we have setuidgid, use it in
	place of the kludge in this test.  Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Define to setuidgid.
	* src/setuidgid.c: New program, solely for testing (not installed).

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Don't leak file descriptors
	when dereferencing symlinks.

2003-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/slash: New file/test for today's lib/ftw.c fix.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add slash

	* src/tail.c (xlseek): Avoid warning about ``return without value
	from function returning non-void''.

2003-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/help2man: Update to version 1.29.

	* man/help2man: Add END handler to close STDOUT and check for errors.

2003-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for a "[" that conforms to the GNU coding standards,
	i.e., that does not depend on its name.
	* src/lbracket.c: New file.
	* README: Add "[".
	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Ignore "[", since it doesn't have
	a separate man page.
	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add "[".
	(__SOURCES): New var.
	* src/test.c (LBRACKET): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(main): Use LBRACKET rather than argv[0].

	* src/test.c (one_argument): Do not check for -t if POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	Reported by Paul Jarc and Dan Jacobson.

	* src/test.c (main): Do not recognize --help or --version if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, when invoked as "test".  Handle "[ ]" correctly.
	Do not bother testing that margv[margc] is non-null.

2003-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_line): Rewrite to use asprintf, in order to be
	able to avoid emitting trailing spaces.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: Add tests of head's new --lines=-N
	option, and perform the +1600 invocations of head IFF the envvar
	RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS is set.

2003-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Give a better diagnostic when failing due
	to nonexistent destination directory.  Reported by Dmitry Rutsky.
	See http://bugs.debian.org/199730 for details.

2003-06-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	split's --verbose option did nothing [broken in 4.5.10 and 5.0]
	* src/split.c (longopts): Use `1', not `0' as the value for
	for &verbose.  Reported by Keith Thompson.

	Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/split-a: Also use --verbose and compare stderr
	output with what we'd expect.

2003-06-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	Use `error_t' (rather than int) as type for local `err'.
	From Alfred M. Szmidt.

2003-06-19  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	Fix author preservation code.

2003-06-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (ENABLE_HARD_LINK_TO_SYMLINK_WARNING): Define to 0.
	(do_link): Don't warn about hard link to symlink.

2003-06-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c: Include "getdelim2.h", not "getstr.h".
	Reflect renaming: getstr -> getdelim2.

	* src/comm.c, src/join.c, src/nl.c, src/uniq.c: Reflect renaming:
	readline -> readlinebuffer.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	* src/readlink.c: Include <sys/types.h> before system.h (because
	the latter includes <sys/stat.h>).  Required on Ultrix 4.3.

2003-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (initialize_main): Define.
	Use it in every `main'.  Applied via this:
	p='initialize_main (&argc, &argv);'
	perl -ni -e '/program_name.=.argv.0/ and print "  '"$p"'\n"; print' \
	  $(grep -l program_name.=.argv.0 *.c)
	test.c uses margc/margv, so I made the change manually for that file.
	Based on a patch from Bernard Giroud.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Fix for build failure on Ultrix 4.3.
	* src/stat.c: Include sys/statvfs.h in preference to sys/vfs.h.
	Include sys/param.h and sys/mount.h on ultrix.

2003-06-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_NOCTTY, EISDIR): Remove
	definitions.
	* src/system.h (O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_NOCTTY, EISDIR): Define
	them here instead, but with one change: define EISDIR to -1, not 0.

	* src/cat.c (cat): Remove `#ifndef ENOSYS', now that it's
	guaranteed to be defined.
	* src/system.h (ENOSYS, ENOTSUP): Define to -1 if not defined.

	* README: Mention the CVS repository.
	Encourage addition of test cases.

2003-06-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Call close only if necessary.
	From Bruno Haible.

	* src/wc.c (usage): Correct wording: wc prints counts in the order
	`newline, word, byte'.  Reported by Keith M. Briggs.
	* man/wc.x: Fix it here, too.  And change `lines' to `newlines'.

2003-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date/Test.pm: Add a test for the new format, e.g., May-23-2003.

2003-06-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Add commented-out (over-aggressive)
	rule.

2003-06-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/extract-magic (main): Avoid newer 3-arg form of open,
	so this script works also with e.g., perl5.005_03.
	Patch by John David Anglin.

2003-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/system.h: Include <stdbool.h> unconditionally.

2003-06-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (check-programs-vs-x): Rename target
	from check-programs-vs-1.  Adjust rule to check for the
	primary (.x) file, not the generated one (.1).

2003-06-03  Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu>

	* man/kill.x: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add kill.1.
	(kill.1): New rule.

2003-06-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Ensure that the .x file for a new program is never forgotten again.
	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Define.
	(check-programs-vs-1): New phony target.
	(check-local): Depend on it.

2003-06-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary copying of environment.
	* src/env.c (main): Rather than clearing the environment and --
	unless told to ignore environment -- copying all settings from
	the saved, original environment, clear the environment only when
	that is requested.  Suggested by Jens Elkner.

2003-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Always include <string.h>, since we assume C89.
	Include <limits.h> without checking for HAVE_LIMITS_H.

	* src/test.c [!TEST_STANDALONE]: Remove #if-0'd block.
	(STREQ, S_IXUGO): Remove redundant (in system.h) definitions.

2003-06-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a race condition in `tail -f' described by Ken Raeburn in
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-textutils/2003-05/msg00007.html
	* src/tail.c (file_lines): Add new parameter, *read_pos, and set it.
	(pipe_lines, pipe_bytes, start_bytes, start_lines): Likewise.
	(tail_bytes, tail_lines, tail): Likewise.
	(tail_file): Use the new `read_pos' value as the size,
	rather than stats.st_size from the fstat call.

2003-05-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/extract-magic: Allow expansion of `$file' in the here-
	document corresponding to the comment at the top of fs.h.

2003-05-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Fix portability problem on FreeBSD5.0: don't include
	<sys/statvfs.h> on systems without HAVE_STRUCT_STATVFS_F_BASETYPE.
	Use #if/#elif/... cascade so we get only one set of include files.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-05-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (split_3): Accept the BSD format only when in MD5 mode.
	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1: Make sure `sha1sum --check' doesn't
	accept the BSD format.

2003-03-28  Joe Orton  <jorton@redhat.com>

	* src/md5sum.c (bsd_split_3): New function.
	(split_3): Detect checksums from BSD 'md5' command and handle them
	using bsd_split_3.

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: New tests for --check exit status, and for
	BSD-style checksum files.

2003-05-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Fix a thinko.
	This sort of thing is why it'd be *Really Good* to factor
	out the common code used here and in tail.c.

2003-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (usage): Document new feature: --bytes=-N and --lines=-N.

	* tests/du/slink: Skip this test if `.' is on an XFS file system.

	* tests/du/fd-leak: New file.  Test for the bug in du that
	was fixed by the 2003-05-12 change to lib/ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fd-leak.

	* src/head.c (AUTHORS): Enclose string in N_(...), now that it
	includes a translatable word, `and'.

	* src/dd.c (usage): Don't use `,' as the thousands separator
	in e.g. 1,000,000 and 1,048,576.  Instead, do this:
	`SIZE may be ..., MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024 and so on...'
	* src/df.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/du.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (usage): Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Add another check.

2003-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix uniq to conform to POSIX, which requires that "uniq -d -u"
	must output nothing.  Problem reported by Josh Hyman.

	* src/uniq.c (enum output_mode, mode): Remove, replacing with:
	(output_unique, output_first_repeated, output_later_repeated):
	New vars.  All uses of "mode" changed to use these variables,
	which are not mutually exclusive as "mode" was.
	(writeline): New arg "match", used to control whether to
	obey output_first_repeated or output_later_repeated.
	All callers changed.
	(check_file, main): Adjust to above changes.

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Test that 'uniq -d -u' outputs nothing.

2003-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/rm3: Use tr's \n notation rather than \012.
	This package can afford to do that, since its tests are guaranteed use
	GNU tr, which has accepted the more modern notation for 10 years.
	* tests/rm/rm5: Likewise.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Likewise.
	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Likewise.

	* src/sort.c (sort): Likewise.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Likewise.

	* src/tail.c: Include "quote.h".
	Use quote in diagnostics.  Change many error format strings
	from just `%s' to e.g., `error reading %s'.
	(pipe_lines): Change type of parameter, n_lines, to uintmax_t.
	Rewrite newline-counting loop to use memchr.

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Use `if', not assert.
	Now that assert is no longer used, don't include <assert.h>.

2003-05-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c: Include <assert.h>.
	(AUTHORS): Add my name.
	(elide_tail_lines_pipe): New function.

2003-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Check for `error (EXIT_SUCCESS,'.

	* src/readlink.c (main): Set program_name before first use.
	Remove that (redundant) first use.
	Don't exit successfully just because --verbose was specified.
	Pass 0, not EXIT_SUCCESS, as first argument to error; when that
	parameter is 0, error does not exit.

	* src/uname.c (main): When failing due to too many arguments, also say
	that, rather than just "Try `uname --help' for more information.".
	* src/comm.c (main): Likewise, but for too few arguments.
	* src/logname.c: Include error.h.
	(main): Say why we're failing.

	* src/uniq.c (main): Don't segfault when argc < optind.

	* src/basename.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (main): Test for `missing argument' before computing n_files.
	* src/tail.c (main): Test for the case of no arguments before
	computing n_files.

	* src/kill.c (send_signals): Don't check command line arguments here.
	(main): Check them here instead.  Handle argc < optind.

	* src/logname.c (main): Use error, rather than fprintf, for the sake
	of consistency.

	* src/rm.c (main): Don't overrun array bound if argc is 0.

2003-05-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (main): Don't overrun array bound if argc is 0.
	That would happen when invoked via: execl ("/usr/bin/sort", NULL);
	Reported by Wartan Hachaturow.

2003-05-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Implement support so that `head --lines=-N' works on seekable files.
	* src/head.c (enum Copy_fd_status): Define.
	(COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE): New macro.
	(elide_tail_lines_seekable): New funtion.
	(elide_tail_lines_file): Call it here.

2003-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (CHAR_BIT): Remove duplicate definition.

2003-05-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/head/Test.pm: Remove tests of --bytes=-N; using that framework
	caused the addition of thousands of small files to the tar archive.
	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: New file.  Add them here instead.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add head-elide-tail.

2003-05-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/remove.c (HAVE_WORKING_READDIR): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Remove.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Rewrite to avoid IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR,
	which was a bit weird because it couldn't be emulated by a function.

2003-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Extend head to accept --lines=-N (--bytes=-N) and to print all
	but the N lines (bytes) at the end of the file.
	* src/head.c: Include full-write.h, full-read.h, inttostr.h, quote.h.
	Use quote() in diagnostics, rather than literal `' marks.
	(copy_fd, elide_tail_bytes_pipe, elide_tail_bytes_file):
	New functions.
	(elide_tail_lines_pipe, elide_tail_lines_file): New functions.
	(head_file): Reorganize so as to call head from only one place.
	(main): Likewise, for head_file.
	Handle new, undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	Handle negative line and byte counts.
	* tests/head/Test.pm: Add lots of tests to exercise --bytes=-N.

	* tests/du/8gb: Skip test if the file system of `.' doesn't support
	sparse files -- otherwise it'd create a file of size 8GB.

2003-05-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c (usage): Don't mention obsolescent -WIDTH option.
	Instead explain about `-' and standard input.
	(main): Give a proper diagnostic for e.g., `fmt -c -72'.
	Reported by Keith Thompson.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	* src/fmt.c: Include "quote.h".
	Use quote() in diagnostics, rather than literal `' marks.
	(main): Exit nonzero when unable to open an input file.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	* src/fmt.c (main): Diagnose invalid suffix on obsolescent width
	specifications like `-72x'.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	Work around nasty readdir bug on Darwin6.5.
	* src/remove.c (IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Define.
	[! HAVE_WORKING_READDIR] (remove_cwd_entries): If readdir has just
	returned NULL and there has been at least one successful unlink or
	rmdir call since the opendir or previous rewinddir, then call
	rewinddir and reiterate the loop.

	Factor out common code.
	* src/remove.c (readdir_ignoring_dotdirs): New function.
	(is_empty_dir): Use it here.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Use it here.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/r-3: Create 500 rather than just 300 files.
	There's a bug in Darwin6.5's readdir that shows up only with
	338 or more files.
	Fix a bug in this test: `cd $pwd' (not to `..'), now that $tmp
	has two components.

	* src/tail.c:
	Change type of n_units, n_bytes, n_lines to be `uintmax_t'.
	(dump_remainder): Move two declarations `down' into the scope
	where they are used.
	(xlseek): Return the resulting offset.
	(file_lines): Rename parameter, file_length, to end_pos.
	(pipe_lines): Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int'.
	Adapt tests accordingly.
	(pipe_bytes) [struct charbuffer] (nbytes): Change type from `int'
	to `unsigned int'.
	Change type of `total_bytes' from `int' to `size_t',
	since the former wouldn't always be wide enough.
	Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int',
	and adapt tests accordingly.
	Now that testing for a read error no longer involves
	using `tmp', handle that case *after* freeing `tmp'.
	(start_bytes): Clean up.
	(tail_bytes): Now that `n_bytes' may be larger than
	OFF_T_MAX, test for that condition and, if it's true, don't
	use lseek optimizations.
	(parse_options): Don't fail just because N_UNITS is larger than
	the maximum size of a file -- tail may be applied to an input
	stream (e.g., a pipe) with more data than that.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Rename from alloc-check.
	Also check for SPACE-TAB sequences.
	Also check for malloc/calloc/realloc casts.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (start_lines): Rewrite to use memchr.  Clean up.

2003-04-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Send two tokens, not just one, so we don't
	make the now-more-picky tsort fail.

2003-04-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Remove unnecessary test of have_read_stdin.
	(main): Minor syntactic clean-up.

	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Fail if the input contains an odd number of
	tokens.  Reported by junkio@cox.net.

	* tests/tsort/basic-1: Test for the above fix.

2003-04-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the printf fixes below.

	* Makefile.cfg (cvs_files): Add $(srcdir)/config/depcomp to the list.

2003-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix printf POSIX compatibility bug reported by Ben Harris in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-04/msg00070.html>.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (printf invocation): It's \NNN in the format,
	\0NNN in the %b operand.
	* src/printf.c (usage): Likewise.
	(print_esc): New arg OCTAL0 to specify whether \0NNN or \NNN
	is desired.  All uses changed.  Behave like Bash printf if %b
	operand uses \NNN where the initial N is not 0.

2003-04-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stty.c: Remove uses of PROTOTYPE macro.

2003-04-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint: Remove (or replace-with-TAB(s) to retain alignment)
	each sequence of spaces before a TAB character.

2003-04-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't closedir (NULL).

2003-04-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Giving nl an invalid STYLE argument (in --header-numbering=STYLE (-h),
	--body-numbering=STYLE (-b), or --footer-numbering=STYLE (-f)) or
	FORMAT (--number-format=FORMAT (-n)) would not give a useful diagnostic.
	* src/nl.c (main): Fix those problems and remove literal quote marks
	(e.g., "`%s'") from format string; instead use "%s" in each format
	string and `quote (optarg)' as the corresponding argument.
	Also, diagnose all invalid command line options before failing.

	* src/nl.c (proc_text): Fix a bug that would make nl output extra
	newlines in some cases.  Details here: http://bugs.debian.org/177256.
	This bug was introduced on 2001-11-10 for textutils-2.0.17.
	* tests/misc/nl: Add test for the above-fixed bug.

	* tests/misc/readlink: New file.  Test the --canonicalize option.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add readlink.

2003-04-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Clean up.
	* src/chown.c, src/cp.c, src/dircolors.hin, src/du.c, src/ln.c:
	* src/mkfifo.c, src/ptx.c, src/spline.c, src/stty.c, src/tail.c:
	* src/test.c, src/unexpand.c: Remove (or replace-with-TAB(s) to
	retain alignment) each sequence of spaces before a TAB character.

	* src/ls.c: Include <stdlib.h> unconditionally.

	* Makefile.maint (xalloc-check): Rename from header-check.

	* src/yes.c: Include error.h after system.h, not before.

	Clean up.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp-hash.c, src/cp.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c:
	* src/date.c, src/df.c, src/du.c, src/expand.c, src/expr.c, src/id.c:
	* src/join.c, src/md5sum.c, src/nl.c, src/od.c, src/paste.c, src/pr.c:
	* src/ptx.c, src/sort.c, src/split.c, src/su.c, src/tail.c, src/tee.c:
	* src/tr.c: * src/unexpand.c, src/users.c:
	Remove anachronistic casts of xmalloc, xrealloc, and xcalloc
	return values and of xrealloc's first argument.
	Fix the former with this:
	perl -pi -e 's/\([^(]*?\*\) *(x(m|c|re)alloc)\b/$1/'

2003-04-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stty.c (wrapf): Declare with format attribute.

	The S_MAGIC_... names shouldn't be maintained in two places (prior
	to this change, one would have to keep stat.c and fs.h in sync).
	This change makes it so those names and the corresponding
	hexadecimal constants all reside in stat.c.  fs.h is now generated.
	* src/Makefile.am (fs.h): New rule to generate fs.h from stat.c.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Add fs.h, now that it's generated.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add extract-magic.
	* src/extract-magic: New script to extract fs.h definitions from stat.c.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype) [__linux__]: Append each hex constant from
	fs.h in a comment after the corresponding `case S_MAGIC_...:' statement.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Skip this test (don't fail) if creating a
	file with nominal length > 4GB fails.  Reported by Michael Deutschmann.

	* man/unexpand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to expand.
	* man/expand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to unexpand.
	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2003-04-10  Maciej W. Rozycki  <macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl>

	* src/fs.h (S_MAGIC_DEVPTS): New magic for Linux's devpts.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Handle Linux's devpts.

2003-04-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/split.c (line_bytes_split): Arg is of type size_t, since
	that's all that is supported for now.
	(main): Check for overflow in obsolescent line count option.

2003-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Add a new test for the above fix.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Use size_t temporary (rather than
	uintmax_t original) in remaining computations.  From Paul Eggert.

	Handle command line option arguments larger than 2^31.
	This allows e.g., splitting into files of size 2GB and larger,
	and running split --lines=N with N=2^31 or more.
	But for --line-bytes=N, the restriction that N <= SIZE_MAX
	remains (for now), due to the way it is implemented.

	* src/split.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split, main):
	Use uintmax_t, not size_t, for file sizes.
	(main): Give a better diagnostic for option arguments == 0.
	Use umaxtostr to print file sizes.
	Reported by Luke Hassell.

2003-04-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rm.c (usage): Mention that --directory (-d) works only
	on some systems.  Suggestion from Samuel Tardieu.

	* tests/basename/basic: Run $PERL to see if it is available,
	rather than testing its value.
	* tests/sum/sysv, tests/tsort/basic-1, tests/unexpand/basic-1:
	* tests/basename/basic, tests/dd/skip-seek, tests/dircolors/simple:
	* tests/expr/basic, tests/factor/basic, tests/fmt/basic:
	* tests/ls-2/tests, tests/md5sum/basic-1, tests/md5sum/newline-1:
	* tests/misc/sort, tests/misc/tty-eof, tests/mv/i-1:
	* tests/rm/empty-name, tests/rm/fail-eperm, tests/rm/unreadable:
	* tests/seq/basic, tests/sha1sum/basic-1, tests/sha1sum/sample-vec:
	* tests/sum/basic-1, tests/seq/basic: Likewise.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add split-fail.
	* tests/misc/split-fail: New file.

	* src/split.c: Rename local variables: nchars -> n_bytes.
	(lines_split): Rename local, nlines -> n_lines.
	(main): Rename local variable: s/accum/n_units/.
	(main): Use STDIN_FILENO, not literal `0'.

2003-04-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Add #include directives for Ultrix 4.4.
	Based on a suggested change from Bert Deknuydt.

2003-04-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): New rule.
	(local-check): Add it.

2003-04-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (nearly all of them):
	Use $(VAR) rather than @VAR@, now that we can rely on automake to
	emit a definition for each substituted variable.
	* tests/Makefile.am.in: Likewise.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Add a comment explaining why this test fails when
	using Tru64's broken sed.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

	Make `kill -t' output signal descriptions (not `?') on Tru64.
	* src/kill.c (sys_siglist): Also check for __sys_siglist.
	Patch by Tony Leneis.
	* configure.ac: Also check for declaration of __sys_siglist.
	Required for Tru64 4.0D, 4.0F, and 5.1.
	Reported by Tony Leneis.

2003-04-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove unnecessary definition.

	Because of inappropriate (but POSIX-mandated) behavior of rename,
	`mv a b' would not remove `a' in some unusual cases.  Work around
	this by unlinking `a' when necessary.

	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Add an output parameter.
	Set it in the offending case.
	(copy_internal): When necessary, unlink SRC_PATH and inform caller.
	Reported by Ed Avis.
	* tests/mv/hard-4: New test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-4.

	Clean up rules for automatically generated sources:
	* src/Makefile.am (dircolors.h, wheel-size.h, wheel.h, false.c):
	Make each generated file be read-only.
	Add each file name to BUILT_SOURCES separately.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Set to $(BUILT_SOURCES).

	Put LOCALEDIR macro definition in new file: localedir.h.
	* src/Makefile.am (DEFS): Remove definition.
	(localedir.h): New rule.
	(BUILT_SOURCES, DISTCLEANFILES): Add localedir.h.
	* src/system.h: Include "localedir.h".

2003-04-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add false.

	* Makefile.maint (TMPDIR): Make sure it's defined.
	(my-distcheck): Build in $(TMPDIR), not `.'.

	* src/Makefile.am (false.c): Change all occurrences of
	`(EXIT_SUCCESS)' to `(EXIT_FAILURE)' so that false exits
	unsuccessfully also with --help.  Reported by Paul Jarc,
	* tests/misc/false: New test for the above.

2003-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Note the location of older NEWS files.

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't let a failing closedir
	clobber errno.  Spotted by Arnold Robbins.

	* src/env.c: Fix typo in comment.  From Arnold Robbins.

2003-03-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.12.

	* README: Note to expect build problems for stat.c on Ultrix 4.3.
	Note that there are some harmless test failures when running
	`make check' as root on some systems.

2003-03-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Skip this test if stty can't get window size.
	This happens when connecting to sparc-solaris5.7 via ssh from within
	emacs.  Reported by Karl Berry.

	* tests/du/basic: Use seq, not `yes' to generate 4KB of data.
	Otherwise, on systems (DJGPP) that emulate pipes using files,
	this test would never complete, waiting for `yes' to terminate.
	* tests/du/slink: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate link target.
	* tests/rm/hash: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate dir name.
	Reported by Rich Dawe.

2003-03-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/id.c: Remove Arnold Robbins' obsolete e-mail address
	from `written by...' comment, at his request.

2003-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix buffer overrun problem reported by TAKAI Kousuke, along
	with some other POSIX incompatibilities.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Do not treat \x specially if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.  Avoid buffer overrun if the format ends
	in backslash.  Treat incomplete escape sequences as strings
	of characters, as POSIX requires.
	(print_formatted): Allow multiple flags.  Avoid buffer overrun
	if the format is incomplete.

2003-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the above fixes and changes.

2003-03-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): Add a comment.

2003-03-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Describe problem with 64-bit mode on HPUX 11.x,
	with patch for /usr/include/inttypes.h.
	* TODO: Plan to add an autoconf test to work around the bug.

2003-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Don't include <sys/sysmacros.h>.
	That is already done via system.h.  Otherwise, the multiple
	inclusion would evoke redefinition warnings from Cray's /bin/cc,
	aka Cray Standard C Version 4.0.3  (057126) Mar 22 2003  22:02:28.
	(human_fstype): Factor some directives `up', out of this function.
	Cast away `const' to avoid error from Cray's /bin/cc.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Ensure that a newline
	precedes each row of `*'s.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.11.

	* src/seq.c (valid_format): Also accept ` ' and `'' as valid
	format flag characters.
	Do not require that a field width be specified.
	Do not fail when given a field width of `0'.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/seq/basic: Add new tests for the above-fixed bug.

	* src/Makefile.am (all-local): Append $(EXEEXT) to use of `su'
	(install-root): Likewise.
	(install-exec-local): Likewise.
	Based on a patch from Richard Dawe.

2003-03-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Use $(LN_S) instead of 'ln -s',
	because the DJGPP 2.03 port of 'ln -s' doesn't work.
	Include $(EXEEXT) in program names.
	Since $(LN_S) may degenerate to `cp -p', be careful
	to invoke it from the destination directory.
	Mostly from Richard Dawe.
	* configure.ac: Use AC_PROG_LN_S.

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c [struct Word] (paren, period, punct, final): Change the
	type of each member from bool <MEMBER>:1 to unsigned int <MEMBER>:1.
	AIX 5.1's xlc could not compile the former.
	Patch by Petter Reinholdtsen.  Also reported by Mike Jetzer.

2003-03-17  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Include $(EXEEXT) in OPTIONAL_BIN_PROGS'
	program names, since automake only adds $(EXEEXT) to programs
	in its *_PROGRAMS.

2003-03-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Put two local variables in static storage,
	so they can't be clobbered by the potential longjmp.

2003-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_rel_host): Fix code to match the comment
	so that a version number with a two-digit component can still count
	as an alpha release.  Reported by Richard A Downing.
	(gnu_rel_host): Define in terms of $(RELEASE_TYPE) instead.

2003-03-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ansi2knr.c: Remove no-longer-used file.
	* src/ansi2knr.1: Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (prev_version_file): Don't use ?= for this particular
	assignment, since it causes trouble with old versions of GNU make
	(e.g. 3.76.1).  The other uses of `?=' are inoffensive.  Details here.
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-03/msg00028.html
	Patch from Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

	* Use patched automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate Makefile.in files in
	subdirectories so that each includes a definition of ACLOCAL_M4.

	* announce-gen (main): Label the compressed source URLs.

	* Version 4.5.10.

	* tests/du/slink: Relax the test for the `local'ness of a file system,
	so that now it works also for tmpfs.

	* tests/du/hard-link: Transform output from first du, so that this
	test doesn't fail on file systems like tmpfs that order directory
	entries differently.

2003-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/8gb: Work around what appears to be an NFS failure that
	would make this test fail on some systems.

2003-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file exactly 4k bytes long.

	* src/split.c (longopts): Don't hard-code `2' here.
	Instead, just specify `&verbose', and ...
	(main): ... remove the `case 2:' block for --verbose.

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file larger than 64 bytes, so that
	we don't immediately disqualify file systems (e.g., NetApp) on which
	smaller files take up zero disk blocks.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

2003-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't segfault for a negative field width or precision in format string.
	Note that this is just a stopgap fix.  The longer term solution may
	involve adapting bash's builtins/printf.def.

	* src/printf.c: (UNSPECIFIED): Define.
	(print_direc): Use the special value, UNSPECIFIED, to indicate
	that field_width or precision has not been specified.
	(print_formatted): Fail if field_width or precision is the
	special value, UNSPECIFIED.
	Reported by Oliver Kiddle <okiddle@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/sys2.h (INT_MIN): Define, if necessary.
	* tests/misc/printf: Add a test for the above-fixed bug.

2003-03-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_stack_pop): Cast sizeof... to int before
	changing its sign.  This avoids a warning from gcc on 64-bit systems.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.
	(pop_dir): Reverse order of sign change and cast, to be consistent
	with the above.

2003-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (evar-check): Check for POSIXLY_CORRECT not as a
	shell variable, but only in the environment.  With /bin/sh->bash, the
	shell variable is set to `y', and that would cause a spurious warning.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Remove touch/fifo.
	It doesn't appear to have to be run as root.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Rather than simply using the first non-root
	user name, make sure that the selected user name has a usable shell.
	Reported by Paul Jarc.

	Before, when using shred on a device, one had to specify --exact,
	or be careful to choose a size that would not be rounded up and
	exceed the maximum value;  that could result in a failure of
	the final write.
	* src/shred.c (do_wipefd): --exact is now the default for non-regular
	files.  Suggestion from Ben Elliston.
	(usage): Say it.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Require at least version 1.11 of Expect.pm.
	Old versions of Expect.pm (e.g., 1.07) lack the log_user function.
	Patch by Bob Proulx.

	* src/Makefile.am (check-misc): Check for use of `defined' in
	#define directives.
	Change to $(srcdir) before running grep.

	* src/sleep.c: Remove now-unused #include and #define directives.

	* src/du.c (process_file): If a file's size is not being counted
	e.g., because it's a hard link to a file we've already counted,
	then don't print a line for it.

	* tests/du/hard-link: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-link.

	`du -S' didn't work
	* src/du.c: Revert most of the `reorganization' change of 2003-02-20,
	and make the two-array approach work.

	* tests/du/basic: Correct/add tests for the above fix.
	Set LC_ALL, etc., now that we use sort.
	Check the block/size of a small file, too.
	Correct expected results for simple dir1/dir2/file case.
	Add another test of du -S.

2003-03-07  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Avoid build failure with gcc on hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20 (see GCC PR
	middle-end/9986).  As one of GCC's optimizations, it transforms a
	fputs_unlocked call to a fputc_unlocked call when the string is
	one character long.  However, hpux doesn't have fputc_unlocked.

	* expr.c (usage): Use putchar, not fputs, to output a single character.
	* ls.c (dired_dump_obstack): Likewise.
	* ptx.c (output_one_tex_line, output_one_dumb_line): Likewise.
	* stat.c (print_it): Likewise.

2003-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the two changes of 2003-02-21.
	* src/du.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the change of 2003-02-19.

2003-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.9.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Remove pointless comparison of unsigned
	integer with zero, to avoid a warning from Intel's ecc.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Sizes must all be of type uintmax_t.
	Otherwise, for files or totals that are too big, numbers would
	be truncated.  Patch mostly by Michael Stone.
	Reported by Ingo Saitz as Debian bug #183210.

	* tests/du/8gb: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add 8gb.

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Use 3 * UTILS_OPEN_MAX / 4
	rather than UTILS_OPEN_MAX - 10.

2003-03-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Refer new feature discussion to bug-coreutils@gnu.org,
	rather than bug-gnu-utils, now that the former is better known.
	Suggestion from Göran Uddeborg.

	* src/stat.c (usage): Capitalize consistently.
	Reported by Göran Uddeborg.

	* Makefile.maint (rel-files): Include $(signatures), so that
	those files are also copied into $(release_archive_dir).

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Call error here, now that restore_cwd
	no longer does it.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Likewise.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Add fail-2eperm.

2003-03-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Include the full filename of
	the offending file, not just the basename.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Set $ME properly.

	* Makefile.maint (THIS_VERSION_REGEXP, PREV_VERSION_REGEXP):
	Remove now-unused variables.
	(tag-prev-version, prev-cvs-tag): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries) [!ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS]: Give an
	accurate diagnostic when failing to remove a file owned by some other
	user.  Reported by Ivo Timmermans via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian bug# 178471.

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-2eperm.
	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a report from Ivo Timmermans.

2003-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [un_backup]: When recovering from a
	failure to create a hard link, do not remove the entry associating
	the source dev/ino with the destination file name.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-3.
	* tests/mv/hard-3: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Inspired by a report from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-03-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/df.c (print_header): Don't embed spaces in a separate `Type'
	header string.  Instead, put `Filesystem' and `Type' headers in the
	same string, so translators can use horizontal space as needed.
	Reported by Jean Charles Delepine.

2003-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When link fails because of an
	existing destination file, unlink that file and try again.
	Reported by Iida Yosiaki.

	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-2.
	* tests/mv/hard-2: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a test case from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-02-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Don't test du's -b option here.  Directory byte
	counts are smaller (512 rather than 4096) on at least OSF/1 5.1
	and IBM AIX 4.2.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-02-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that ChangeLog entries
	are output by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): New function.
	(main): Use it.

2003-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: New option: --release-type=TYPE
	* Makefile.maint (beta, major): New targets.  Remove `release'.
	Put them all together on a line.
	Pass the release type (via RELEASE_TYPE envvar) to the MAKE
	invocation of `announcement'.
	(announcement): Invoke announce-gen with --release-type=$RELEASE_TYPE.

	* announce-gen: New option: --news=NEWS_FILE.
	Extract NEWS entries here, not via rules in Makefile.maint.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that NEWS entries are
	extracted by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	(news-r1, news-r2): Remove now-unused definitions.

2003-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.8.

	Merge in changes from autoconf's version of this file.
	* Makefile.maint (www-gnu): Define.
	(standards.texi-url_prefix): Use $(www-gnu).
	(make-stds.texi-url_prefix): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(main): Invoke `run' through a macro that (when possible) runs it
	with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/cp.c (run): New function, preparing for the above.
	Exit from this function, not from main
	(main): Call run.

	* src/du.c: New option: --apparent-size.
	(enum) [APPARENT_SIZE_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add it.
	(usage): Describe it.
	(main): Handle it.
	['b']: Set apparent_size.
	David Eisner reported that the behavior of --bytes had changed.
	Paul Eggert proposed the use of a new option, --apparent-size.

	* src/du.c (apparent_size): New global.
	(print_only_size): Reflect the fact that we're printing byte counts,
	not ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte-block counts.
	(print_size): Call print_only_size rather than duplicating its code.
	(process_file): Accumulate byte counts, rather than block counts.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Always reset size_to_propagate_to_parent
	for --separate-dirs (-S).

2003-02-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): New format: %B (to print ST_NBLOCKSIZE).
	This makes %b (number of ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte blocks) more useful.
	(usage) [%B]: Describe it.
	[%b]: Refer to %B.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Reorganize the code to use only
	one `sum' array, and change how -S works back to the way it was
	before 2003-01-31.  Patch by Bruno Haible.

	* tests/du/basic: New test.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add basic.

	* tests/envvar-check: Add checks for the following:
	BLOCK_SIZE, DU_BLOCK_SIZE, DF_BLOCK_SIZE, LS_BLOCK_SIZE.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Rename phony target envvar-check to evar-check
	so as not to conflict with the distributed file by the same name.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Set info->skip before any possible return.

	Report correct usage for directories, not 0.
	* src/du.c (process_file): Return for `file_type == FTW_DPRE'
	_before_ recording the dev/ino of a directory.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	Now, df always displays the device file name corresponding to the
	listed mount point under `Filesystem'.  Before, for an unmounted
	block- or character-special file argument, it would display the
	command-line argument instead.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Return a value indicating whether
	there was a match.  Don't try to find a mount point here.
	(show_entry): If show_disk doesn't find a match, call show_point.

2003-02-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(du_files): Add prototype with ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN.
	Exit from this function, not from...
	(main): ...here.
	Instead, if possible, invoke du_files through a macro that
	runs it with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/join.c (usage): Change wording in --help output:
	use FILENUM instead of `SIDE' and say what FILENUM means.
	Reported by Bernhard Gabler.

	* src/df.c (print_header): Rather than using a hard-coded literal
	string of spaces matching the length of the English `...Type' header,
	output the right number of spaces to match the selected translation.
	Reported by Yann Dirson and Jean Charles Delepine as Debian bug 131113.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Remove unnecessary `else' after break.
	(lines_split): Likewise.  and correct misleading indentation.

	* src/split.c: Include "full-read.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split): Use full_read,
	not safe_read.   The way split was using the latter, a short read
	could cause split to terminate before EOF.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Test all programs that can read stdin,
	requiring no arguments and that write to standard output.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: New file.  Renamed from ...
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Remove file.  Rename to tty-eof.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

2003-02-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cksum would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Exit the loop upon EOF, too.
	Patch by Michael Bacarella.

	Test for the bug fixed today in cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum.
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Generalize, clean-up, and test for
	cat, cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum all in the same loop.

2003-02-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c: Include "euidaccess.h".
	Remove declaration of euidaccess.

2003-02-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (portable_chars_only): Remove unnecessary `const'
	in cast to avoid warning from icc.  Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

2003-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c: Don't include group-member.h.
	Include euidaccess.h.
	(eaccess): Rewrite function to set the real uid and gid temporarily
	to the effective uid and gid, then invoke 'access', and then set the
	real uid and gid back.  On systems that lack setreuid or setregid,
	fall back on the kludges in euidaccess.  Before, it would not work
	for e.g., files with ACLs, files that were marked immutable,
	or on file systems mounted read-only.  Nelson Beebe raised the issue.
	Paul Eggert suggested the new implementation.

2003-02-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (test_stat): Remove function.  It's job is done (only
	when necessary) by the wrapper in lib/stat.c.  Adjust all uses.

2003-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.7.

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Don't assume that the file owner username

	altogether.  Reported by, and suggested fix from, Ferdinand.

	* tests/du/restore-wd: New test for just-fixed bug in ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add restore-wd.

	* src/rm.c: Correct now-invalid comment about cycle-detection.

2003-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Add entries from old/*/NEWS
	from fileutils-4.1 through 4.1.11 and
	from sh-utils-2.0 through 2.0.15.  Suggestion from Karl Berry.

	* Version 4.5.6.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't return early for excluded files
	or for files whose dev/inode we've already seen.

2003-02-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2003-02-04  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/who.c (print_boottime, print_deadprocs, print_runlevel):
	Fix memory allocation arithmetic.

2003-02-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`df /dev/block-or-char-device-file--not-mounted' now reports
	the name of the file system on which the file resides, usually `/'.
	Before, it would leave the `Mounted on' field blank.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Move function to precede find_mount_point.
	(show_disk): Add parameter: STATP.
	If we don't find a matching device name, then resort to calling
	find_mount_point.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

2003-02-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* tests/rm/cycle: Require non-root.
	* tests/rm/isatty: Likewise.

2003-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.5.

	* man/Makefile.am (check-x-vs-1): Use @PATH_SEPARATOR@, not `:'.

	Ensure that there are no offending uses of `:'.
	* Makefile.maint (makefile_path_separator_check): New rule.
	(local-check): Add it to the list.

2003-02-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Define.

	* src/stat.c (G_fail): New global.
	(human_time): Diagnose failed localtime, not failed nstrftime.
	(main): Fail if G_fail is set.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* tests/basename/Makefile.am: Use @PATH_SEPARATOR@ instead of
	hard-coding the path-separator.  Also double-quote the new PATH,
	to avoid problems when the path-separator is a semi-colon or when
	`pwd` contains e.g. a space.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Include "file-type.h"
	(print_human_type): Remove function.
	(human_access): Rename from print_human_access.  Return a string.
	(human_time): Rename from print_human_time.  Return a string.
	(print_stat): Arrange so that field width and an alignment specifier
	are honored for the %A, %F, %x, %y, and %z formats.
	[%F]: Use file_type; this gives slightly different file type strings,
	e.g., `directory' instead of `Directory' and `regular file' or
	`regular empty file' instead of `Regular file'.
	Prompted by a report from Richard Dawe that the uses of
	S_IFSOCK and S_IFIFO in print_human_time were not portable
	to systems using e.g., DJGPP.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Use S_ISLNK rather than an explicit
	test using S_IFMT and S_IFLNK.  S_IFLNK may not be defined.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Upon processing an invalid option or an invalid
	--exclude-from or --max-depth option argument, don't exit right away,
	in case there are others.  Rather record the failure and exit after
	processing other options.

	* GNUmakefile (TAR_OPTIONS): Set and export, in order to make
	tar archive easier to reproduce.

	Rewrite to perform directory traversal using nftw.

	* src/du.c: Include "dirname.h", "ftw.h", and "quotearg.h".
	(AUTHORS): Add self.
	(opt_one_file_system): Move global into `main'.
	(path, xstat, exit_status): Remove declarations.
	(arg_length, suffix_length): New globals.
	(G_fail): New global, sort of like the old `exit_status'.
	(IS_FTW_DIR_TYPE): Define.
	(print_only_size): New function.
	(process_file): New function.
	(str_init, ensure_space, str_copyc, str_concatc): Remove functions.

	(du_files): Rewrite to use nftw.

2003-01-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Ensure that du/ftw follows a command-line
	symlink-to-directory with -L, even without the trailing slash.

2003-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (check-misc): Check for st_blocks, too.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Use ST_NBLOCKS rather than `->st_blocks'.
	Reported by Richard Dawe.

2003-01-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Add fourth parameter, width, into which to
	store the screen columns, and return the number of bytes instead.
	(print_dir): Pass NULL as fourth parameter of quote_name.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Likewise.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Get the width from the fourth
	parameter of quote_name instead of return value.

2003-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): If `dired' is set without
	`format == long_format', then silently reset dired.  This doesn't
	change the behavior of ls (all prior uses of dired were protected
	by `&& format == long_format'), and lets us...
	(DIRED_INDENT): ... remove the `format == long_format' conjunct.
	(PUSH_CURRENT_DIRED_POS): Likewise.
	(main): Likewise.

2003-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/no-x: New test, for functionality added to lib/ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-x.

2003-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry) [ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS
	&& HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: If a file has d_type == DT_UNKNOWN
	it may still be a directory -- or not (e.g., with FreeBSD on an
	NFS-mounted file system), so resort to calling lstat to find out.
	Based on a patch by Michael van Elst.

	* tests/cp/same-file: Don't assume that the file owner username
	length is less than 9 in ls output: instead, omit that field
	altogether.  Reported by, and suggested fix from, Ferdinand.

2003-01-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date/Test.pm (wide-fmt): New test to demonstrate that
	large format widths no longer cause strftime to infloop.

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Remove now-unused definition.

2003-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/readlink.c: Include "canonicalize.h".

2003-01-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (Dereference_symlink) [DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR]:
	New member.
	(enum) [DEREFERENCE_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add option --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(main): Make DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR be the default,
	rather than DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS, when none of the
	-d, -F, -l options is specified.
	(decode_switches): Handle --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(gobble_file): Honor DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR.
	Change --dereference-command-line (-H) to dereference *all*
	command line arguments, including broken symlinks.

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Change ls -H back to the way it was yesterday, since this is
	compatible with FreeBSD and the POSIX spec is confusing
	and somewhat contradictory.

	* src/ls.c (DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS): Change name back
	from DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR, updating all uses.
	(long_options): Change the long option name back.
	(usage): Change the usage back.
	(gobble_file): When -H is specified, dereference a top-level
	arg even if it points to a non-directory.

2003-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fall back on using lstat when required:
	when --dereference (-L) is not specified, and
	- when operating on a dangling symlink
	- when operating on command-line-symlink-to-directories
	This fixes numerous problems.  Here are examples:
	- `ls dangling-symlink' would fail with `no such file...'
	Now it prints `dangling-symlink'.
	- `ls -i symlink' would mistakenly print the inode of the referent.
	Now it prints the inode of the symlink.  Likewise for --size (-s).
	Based on a patch from Michael Stone.
	Reported by Deepak Goel as Debian bug #173793.

	Rename ls's --dereference-command-line (-H)
	option to   --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	* src/ls.c [enum Dereference_symlink]
	(DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR): Rename from
	DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS.  Update all uses.
	(long_options): Rename the long option.
	(usage): Say that --dereference-... changes how ls treats
	only symlinks to directories specified on the command line.

2003-01-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/dangle: New file/test, for the above fix.
	* tests/ls/inode: Another new file/test, for the above fix.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dangle and inode.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fix a bug introduced in 4.5.4 that made it
	so that ls --color would no longer highlight the names of files with
	the execute bit set when not specified on the command line.
	Patch by Michael Stone.  Reported by Stephen Depooter as
	Debian bug 175135.

	* tests/ls-2/tests (color-exe): New test, for the above fix.

2003-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/shred/exact: Also test for just fixed bug with --zero.

	* src/shred.c (long_opts): --zero does not require an argument.
	Patch by Michael Stone.  Reported by Roland Turner as Debian bug 172019.

2003-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (cvs-update): Skip any file with local modifications.

2002-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove definition (to ansi2knr)

	* ls.c (gobble_file): Remove the block of code that caused
	`ls --color -F symlink-to-dir' to list the files in
	`symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now, it prints `symlink-to-dir@', (just
	like `ls -F symlink-to-dir') but with the addition of highlighting.
	Similarly, `ls --color -dF symlink-to-dir' would print
	`symlink-to-dir/';  now it prints `symlink-to-dir@'.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #168203.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (sl-F-color, sl-dF-color): New tests for the above.

	ls is now more efficient: with certain options, it no longer needs
	to stat each directory entry on systems with valid dirent.d_type.
	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Add DT_LNK and DT_REG.
	(main): Make --recursive set format_needs_type, not format_needs_stat.

	the empty string.
	(count_entry): When appending a file name component,

	François Pinard reported that `du symlink-to-dir/' was not
	equivalent to `du symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now it is.
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Make optional.
	(announcement): Use the new variable.

	* Makefile.maint: Sync with Bison, i.e.:
	(po-check): Scan .l and .y files instead of the
	.c and the .h files that they generate.  This fixes the bug
	reported by Tim Van Holder in:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bison-patches/2002-November/001352.html>
	Look for N_ as well as for _.  Try to avoid matching #define for

	at most two hex. digits, not three.  Reported by Padraig Brady.
	(usage): Update description.
	* tests/misc/printf-hex: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-10-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for locale-specific size indications (e.g.,
	thousands-separators) and for explicit size suffixes on output.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Block size): Say that:
	This affects display format as well as block size.
	Fractional block counts are rounded up.
	ls file size blocksize defaults to 1.
	A block size spec preceded by ' generates thousands separators.
	A suffix without a preceding integer generates suffixes.
	(tail invocation): 32k -> 32 KiB.
	(What information is listed): ls -h is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=human, and ls -H is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=si.  Displayed file size is now always affected by
	--block-size.

	* lib/inttostr.c, lib/inttostr.h, lib/imaxtostr.c, lib/offtostr.c,

	(human_readable): Rename from human_readable_inexact; put the
	options before the sizes.  All uses changed.  The old human_readable
	function has been removed; use inttostr.h instead.
	(human_options): Renamed from human_block_size, with new signature
	that allows block sizes up to UINTMAX_MAX.  All callers changed.

	* m4/prereq.m4 (jm_PREREQ_HUMAN): Check for locale.h, localeconv,
	AC_HEADER_STDBOOL.  No need to check for limits.h since it's in
	freestanding C89.  No need to check for stdlib.h or string.h since
	autoconf does this now.

	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Use primitives from inttostr.h, not
	human.h, to print large numbers simply.

	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.

	* src/df.c (print_header): In the header line, prefer SI to human
	representation if it's shorter; if neither is shorter, try to
	intuit what the user would prefer.

	* src/expr.c (inttostr): Remove; use new imaxtostr library
	function instead.

	* src/ls.c (file_output_block_size): New var, to distinguish
	file sizes from other sizes.
	(decode_switches): Set it.

	* src/shred.c (OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE): remove.
	(dopass): When printing progress, use floor for what has been done
	so far (since we should be conservative there), and ceiling for
	what needs to be done (since that's what other programs use).

	Reported by Petter Reinholdtsen.

2002-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Specifying a printf conversion specifer as nl's separator string
	could cause nl to segfault.
	* src/nl.c (build_print_fmt): Don't include separator string

	since that's how it's always used and avoids a new warning from gcc.
	(read_input): Adapt to new safe_read ABI.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Add a temporary size_t variable, n_bytes,
	to avoid warnings.

	* src/pinky.c (print_long_entry): fread returns size_t.
	Declare local `bytes' accordingly, to avoid warning.

	tail -c +N would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	[this change is analogous (bytes vs. lines) to the one of 2002-01-27]

	* tests/cp/backup-is-src: Ensure that certain environment variables
	are not set (e.g., SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX).  Reported by Duncan Roe.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Mark this as an expensive test; it would
	consume 4GB of disk space on systems without support for sparse files.
	Fix a logic error that'd make it `cat err' even though dd didn't fail.

	* src/dircolors.hin (.jar): Fix typo: s/;3$/;31/.

	Reported by Bob Proulx.
	Change all the rest like this: grep -lR "testing framework'" .\
	|xargs perl -pi -e 's/'\''(\$0: failure in testing framework)'\''/"$1"/'

	* src/sum.c (sysv_sum_file): Adapt to new safe_read ABI.

2002-10-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove `old'.
	(EXTRA_DIST): List the files in old/.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove old/* names.
	Suggestion from Akim Demaille.

2002-10-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (SSIZE_MAX): Define.

2002-09-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add slink.
	* tests/du/slink: New test for system.h change of 2002-08-31.

	In move mode, always first try to rename.  Before, upon failure to
	rename a directory, this code would never attempt to rename any
	other file in that directory, but would thenceforth always copy.
	On some systems (e.g., NetApp's OnTap-6.4), renaming a directory
	may fail with EXDEV, yet renaming files within that directory to
	a newly-created destination directory succeeds.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Remove local, move_mode;
	use x->move_mode instead.  Based on a patch from Tom Haynes.

2002-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/split.c (FAIL_ONLY_ONE_WAY): New macro.
	Factor out some duplication.
	(main): Use it.
	[case 'a']: Use strtoul rather than strtol to avoid compiler warnings.

	* src/sort.c (begfield, limfield): Rearrange comparisons to avoid
	compiler warnings.
	(fillbuf, keycompare): Cast literal `-1' to size_t in comparisons,
	to avoid compiler warnings.

	* src/shred.c (dopass): Use a uintmax_t temporary to avoid bogus
	compiler warnings.

	Fix things so `mkdir -p' can create very deep directories, e.g.,
	mkdir -p $(perl -e 'print "a/" x 40000') now works.
	* src/mkdir.c (main): For --parents (-p), call make_path with the
	entire directory name, so we don't ever require that file operations
	like stat or chmod be performed on the entire command line argument.
	* makepath.c (make_path): Restore umask *before* creating the final
	component.

2002-09-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/rmdir.c: Include "dirname.h", for declaration of
	strip_trailing_slashes.

	* src/stat.c, src/wc.c: Remove all inclusions of inttypes.h,
	since it's already included from sys2.h via system.h.

	* Use automake-1.6f.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove duplicate definition.

	fmt's -s, -t, -c options didn't work properly for long lines.
	Since get_line may end up calling put_paragraph (for long lines),
	be sure to set global, `other_indent', before it is used there.

	* src/fmt.c (set_other_indent): New function, factored out of...
	(get_paragraph): ... here.  Call it.
	(get_line): Call set_other_indent before calling flush_paragraph,
	which calls fmt_paragraph, which in turn calls put_paragraph,
	which uses other_indent.

	* tests/fmt/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add long-line.
	* tests/fmt/long-line: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-09-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/od.c: No longer include deprecated <values.h>.
	It was required solely for now-removed reference to BITSPERBYTE.
	* src/install.c: Likewise.
	Suggestion from Bruno Haible.

2002-09-06  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

2002-09-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`od -t x8' used the wrong (`l'-prefixed) printf format.
	Likewise for the o8 and u8 formats.
	* src/od.c (ISPEC_TO_FORMAT): Define macro.
	(decode_one_format): Use PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, etc. for LONG_LONG.
	Reported by Arun Sharma.

2002-09-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, PRIuMAX, PRIxMAX): Define if necessary.
	From gettext's intl/loadmsgcat.c.

	* tests/od/x8: New file/test, for the above fix.

	* src/dd.c (main, skip): Add casts to avoid warnings about
	`comparison between signed and unsigned'.

	* src/id.c (print_full_info, print_group_list): Add casts to avoid

	* src/md5sum.c: Change type of global, digest_hex_bytes, to size_t
	to avoid warnings about `comparison between signed and unsigned'.
	(split_3): Change parameter names to be readable and add comment.
	Clean up the test for whether a line may be ignored.

2002-09-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/printf.c (main): Handle leading command line argument of `--'.
	Reported by Raul: DervishD <raul@pleyades.net>
	* tests/misc/printf: New file: test for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add printf.

	* src/date.c (usage): Explain that %S's range of [0..60] is required --
	rather than 0..59 -- to accommodate the occasional positive leap second.
	Reported by Richard Neill.

2002-09-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (nanosec_libs): Define.
	(sleep_LDADD, tail_LDADD): Use it here.

	* src/sleep.c: Include xnanosleep.h.
	Factor out fenv.h-related code.
	(timespec_subtract): Remove function.
	(main): Remove code that deals with computing start and stop times
	as well as the loop around nanosleep.  Now that's in xnanosleep.c.

	Allow S (in --sleep-interval=S) to be a floating point value.
	* src/tail.c: Include xnanosleep.h and xstrtod.h.
	Move declaration of global variable, sleep_interval, to ...
	(main): ...here.

	Symlinks were always reported as using 0 blocks.
	* src/system.h (ST_NBLOCKS): Don't depend on file type.
	This reverts the change of 2000-01-30.
	Based on a report and patch from Neil Brown via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian Bug#156358.

	* Most files: Change `exit (0)' to `exit (EXIT_SUCCESS)',
	`exit (1)' to `exit (EXIT_FAILURE)', and
	`usage (1)' to `usage (EXIT_FAILURE)'.

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, chroot.c, cp.c, date.c, dd.c, du.c,

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Use closedir (not CLOSEDIR)
	when ignoring any return value.

2002-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.sh: Don't use "exec --"; it's not portable and
	shouldn't be needed.

2002-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pr.c (main): Don't ignore -COLUMN if it's the last option.

	programs in ../src.

2002-08-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Patch by GOTO Masanori.

2002-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some minor time-related bugs with POSIX time arguments.
	Some valid time stamps were being rejected (notably -1, and
	time stamps before 1900 on 64-bit hosts).  And some invalid
	time stamps were being accepted, e.g. September 31.

	(hard_LC_COLLATE): New var.
	(different): Args are now char *, not const char *.
	Use xmemcoll instead of memcmp to compare lines, so that
	LC_COLLATE has effect.  However, use memcmp if it is an
	easy locale.
	(check_file): Do not include newline in comparison, so that
	xmemcoll has a byte to stomp on temporarily.
	(main): Set hard_LC_COLLATE.

2002-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>
