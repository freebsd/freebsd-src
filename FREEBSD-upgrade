xz

The source code is pulled with git:

	git clone git://ctrl.tukaani.org/xz.git xz

ChangeLog is generated with:
	
	git log > ChangeLog

For the import files and directories were pruned by:
	
sh -c 'for F in `cat FREEBSD-Xlist | grep -v FreeBSD`; do rm -rf ./$F ; done'

You may check if there are any new files that we don't need.

The instructions for importing new release and merging to HEAD can be found
at FreeBSD wiki:

	http://wiki.freebsd.org/SubversionPrimer/VendorImports

To make local changes to xz, simply patch and commit to the trunk
branch (aka HEAD).  Never make local changes on the vendor branch.
