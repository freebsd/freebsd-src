r364896:
	A series of commits ending with r364896 added NFS over TLS
	to the kernel.  This is believed to be compatible with
	the Internet Draft titled "Towards Remote Procedure Call Encryption
	By Default" (expected to soon become an RFC).
	The mount_nfs(8) and exports(5) man pages describe the mount and
	export option(s) related to NFS over TLS.
	For NFS over TLS to work, the rpctlscd(8) { client } or rpctlssd(8)
	{ server } must be running on a kernel built with "options KERN_TLS"
	on an architecture where PMAP_HAS_DMAP != 0.

r364725:
	Changes to one obscure devd event generated on resume need to
	be documented. The old form will still be generated in 13, but not
	in 14.

r363679:
	Applications using regex(3), e.g. sed/grep, will no longer accept
	redundant escapes for most ordinary characters.

r363253:
	SCTP support has been removed from GENERIC kernel configurations.
	The SCTP stack is now built as sctp.ko and can be dynamically loaded.

r363233:
	Merge sendmail 8.16.1: See contrib/sendmail/RELEASE_NOTES for details.

r363180:
	The safexcel(4) crypto offload driver has been added.

r363084:
	nc(1) now implements SCTP mode, enabled by specifying the --sctp option.

r362681:
	A new implementation of bc and dc has been imported. It offers
	better standards compliance, performance, localization and comes
	with extensive test cases that are optionally installed.
	Use WITHOUT_GH_BC=yes to build and install the world with the
	previous version instead of the new one, if required.

r362158, r362163:
	struct export_args has changed so that the "user" specified for
	the -maproot and -mapall exports(5) options may be in more than
	16 groups.

r361884:
	sed(1) has learned about hex escapes (e.g. \x27) and will now do the
	right thing with them, removing the need for printf magic or obnoxious
	escaping in many scenarios.

r361238, r361798, r361799:
	ZFS will now unconditionally reject read(2) of a directory with EISDIR.
	Additionally, read(2) of a directory is now rejected with EISDIR by
	default and may be re-enabled for non-ZFS filesystems that allow it with
	the sysctl(8) MIB 'security.bsd.allow_read_dir'.

	Aliases for grep to default to '-d skip' may be desired if commonly
	non-recursively grepping a list that includes directories and the
	possibility of EISDIR errors in stderr is not tolerable.  Example
	aliases, commented out, have been installed in /root/.cshrc and
	/root/.shrc.

r361066:
	Add exec.prepare and exec.release hooks for jail(8) and jail.conf(5).
	exec.prepare runs before mounts, so can be used to populate new jails.
	exec.release runs after unmounts, so can be used to remove ephemeral
	jails.

r360920,r360923,r360924,r360927,r360928,r360931,r360933,r360936:
	Remove support for ARC4, Blowfish, Cast, DES, Triple DES, MD5,
	MD5-KPDK, MD5-HMAC, SHA1-KPDK, and Skipjack algorithms from
	the kernel open cryptographic framework (OCF).

r360562:
	Remove support for ARC4, Blowfish, Cast, DES, Triple DES,
	MD5-HMAC, and Skipjack algorithms from /dev/crypto.

r360557:
	Remove support for DES, Triple DES, Blowfish, Cast, and
	Camellia ciphers from IPsec(4).  Remove support for MD5-HMAC,
	Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA1, and RIPEMD160-HMAC from IPsec(4).

r359945:
	Remove support for Triple DES, Blowfish, and MD5 HMAC from
	geli(4).

r359786-r359787:
	Remove support for DES, Triple DES, and RC4 from in-kernel GSS
	authentication.

r357627:
	remove elf2aout.

r357560-r357565:
	init(8), service(8), and cron(8) will now adopt user/class environment
	variables (excluding PATH, by default, which will be overwritten) by
	default.  Notably, environment variables for all cron jobs and rc
	services can now be set via login.conf(5).

r357455:
	sparc64 has been removed from FreeBSD.

r355677:
	Adds support for NFSv4.2 (RFC-7862) and Extended Attributes
	(RFC-8276) to the NFS client and server.
	NFSv4.2 is comprised of several optional features that can be supported
	in addition to NFSv4.1. This patch adds the following optional features:
	- posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED/POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)
	- posix_fallocate()
	- intra server file range copying via the copy_file_range(2) syscall
	--> Avoiding data tranfer over the wire to/from the NFS client.
	- lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)
	- Extended attribute syscalls for "user" namespace attributes as defined
	  by RFC-8276.
	
	For the client, NFSv4.2 is only used if the mount command line option
	minorversion=2 is specified.
	For the server, two new sysctls called vfs.nfsd.server_min_minorversion4
 	and vfs.nfsd.server_max_minorversion4 have been added that allow
	sysadmins to limit the minor versions of NFSv4 supported by the nfsd
	server.
	Setting vfs.nfsd.server_max_minorversion4 to 0 or 1 will disable NFSv4.2
	on the server.

r356263:
	armv5 support has been removed from FreeBSD.

r354517:
	iwm(4) now supports most Intel 9260, 9460 and 9560 Wi-Fi devices.

r354269:
	sqlite3 is updated to sqlite3-3.30.1.

r352668:
	cron(8) now supports the -n (suppress mail on succesful run) and -q
	(suppress logging of command execution) options in the crontab format.
	See the crontab(5) manpage for details.

r352304:
	ntpd is no longer by default locked in memory. rlimit memlock 32
	or rlimit memlock 0 can be used to restore this behaviour.

r351770,r352920,r352922,r352923:
	dd(1) now supports conv=fsync, conv=fdatasync, oflag=fsync, oflag=sync,
	and iflag=fullblock flags, compatible with illumos and GNU.

r351522:
	Add kernel-side support for in-kernel Transport Layer Security
	(KTLS).  KTLS permits using sendfile(2) over sockets using
	TLS.

r351397:
	WPA is updated from 2.8 to 2.9.

r351361:
	Add probes for lockmgr(9) to the lockstat DTrace provider, add
	corresponding lockstat(1) events, and document the new probes in
	dtrace_lockstat.4.

r351356:
	Intel RST is a new 'feature' that remaps NVMe devices from
	their normal location to part of the AHCI bar space.  This
	will eliminate the need to set the BIOS SATA setting from RST
	to AHCI causing the nvme drive to be erased before FreeBSD
	will see the nvme drive. FreeBSD will now be able to see the
	nvme drive now in the default config.

r351201, r351372:
	Add a vop_stdioctl() call, so that file systems that do not support
	holes will have a trivial implementation of lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE).
	The algorithm appears to be compatible with the POSIX draft and
	the implementation in Linux for the case of a file system that
	does not support holes.  Prior to this patch, lseek(2) would reply
	-1 with errno set to ENOTTY for SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE on files in
	file systems that do not support holes.
	r351372 maps ENOTTY to EINVAL for lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE) for
	any other cases, such as a ENOTTY return from vn_bmap_seekhole().

r350665:
	The fuse driver has been renamed to fusefs(5) and been substantially
	rewritten.  The new driver includes many bug fixes and performance
	enhancements, as well as the following user-visible features:
	* Optional kernel-side permissions checks (-o default_permissions)
	* mknod(2), socket(2), and pipe(2) support
	* server side locking with fcntl(2)
	* FUSE operations are now interruptible when mounted with -o intr
	* server side handling of UTIME_NOW during utimensat(2)
	* mount options may be updated with "mount -u"
	* fusefs file system may now be exported over NFS
	* RLIMIT_FSIZE support
	* support for fuse file systems using protocols as old as 7.4
	
	FUSE file system developers should also take note of the following new
	features:
	* The protocol level has been raised from 7.8 to 7.23
	* kqueue support on /dev/fuse
	* server-initiated cache invalidation via FUSE_NOTIFY_REPLY

r350471:
	gnop(8) can now configure a delay to be applied to read and write
	request delays.  See the -d, -q and -x parameters.

r350315, r350316:
	Adds a Linux compatible copy_file_range(2) syscall.

r350307:
	libcap_random(3) has been removed.  Applications can use native
	APIs to get random data in capability mode.

r349529,r349530:
	Add support for using unmapped mbufs with sendfile(2).

r349352:
	nand(4) and related components have been removed.

r349349:
	The UEFI loader now supports HTTP boot.

r349335:
	bhyve(8) now implements a High Definition Audio (HDA) driver, allowing
	guests to play to and record audio data from the host.

r349286:
	swapon(8) can now erase a swap device immediately before enabling it,
	similar to newfs(8)'s -E option.  This behaviour can be specified by
	adding -E to swapon(8)'s command-line parameters, or by adding the
	"trimonce" option to a swap device's /etc/fstab entry.

r347908-r347923:
	The following network drivers have been removed: bm(4), cs(4), de(4),
	ed(4), ep(4), ex(4), fe(4), pcn(4), sf(4), sn(4), tl(4), tx(4), txp(4),
	vx(4), wb(4), xe(4).

r347532:
	Wired page accounting has been split into kernel wirings and user
	wirings (e.g., by mlock(2)).  Kernel wirings no long count towards
	the global limit, which is renamed to vm.max_user_wired.  bhyve -S
	allocates user-wired memory and is now subject to that limit.
