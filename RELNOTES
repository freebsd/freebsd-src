Release notes for FreeBSD 13.0.

This file describes new user-visible features, changes and updates relevant to
users of binary FreeBSD releases.  Each entry should describe the change in no
more than several sentences and should reference manual pages where an
interested user can find more information.  Entries should wrap after 80
columns.  Each entry should begin with one or more commit IDs on one line,
specified as a comma separated list and/or range, followed by a colon and a
newline.  Entries should be separated by a newline.

Changes to this file should not be MFCed.

r355677:
	Adds support for NFSv4.2 (RFC-7862) and Extended Attributes
	(RFC-8276) to the NFS client and server.
	NFSv4.2 is comprised of several optional features that can be supported
	in addition to NFSv4.1. This patch adds the following optional features:
	- posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED/POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)
	- posix_fallocate()
	- intra server file range copying via the copy_file_range(2) syscall
	--> Avoiding data tranfer over the wire to/from the NFS client.
	- lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)
	- Extended attribute syscalls for "user" namespace attributes as defined
	  by RFC-8276.
	
	For the client, NFSv4.2 is only used if the mount command line option
	minorversion=2 is specified.
	For the server, two new sysctls called vfs.nfsd.server_min_minorversion4
 	and vfs.nfsd.server_max_minorversion4 have been added that allow
	sysadmins to limit the minor versions of NFSv4 supported by the nfsd
	server.
	Setting vfs.nfsd.server_max_minorversion4 to 0 or 1 will disable NFSv4.2
	on the server.

r354517:
	iwm(4) now supports most Intel 9260, 9460 and 9560 Wi-Fi devices.

r354269:
	sqlite3 is updated to sqlite3-3.30.1.

r352668:
	cron(8) now supports the -n (suppress mail on succesful run) and -q
	(suppress logging of command execution) options in the crontab format.
	See the crontab(5) manpage for details.

r352304:
	ntpd is no longer by default locked in memory. rlimit memlock 32
	or rlimit memlock 0 can be used to restore this behaviour.

r351522:
	Add kernel-side support for in-kernel Transport Layer Security
	(KTLS).  KTLS permits using sendfile(2) over sockets using
	TLS.

r351397:
	WPA is updated from 2.8 to 2.9.

r351361:
	Add probes for lockmgr(9) to the lockstat DTrace provider, add
	corresponding lockstat(1) events, and document the new probes in
	dtrace_lockstat.4.

r351356:
	Intel RST is a new 'feature' that remaps NVMe devices from
	their normal location to part of the AHCI bar space.  This
	will eliminate the need to set the BIOS SATA setting from RST
	to AHCI causing the nvme drive to be erased before FreeBSD
	will see the nvme drive. FreeBSD will now be able to see the
	nvme drive now in the default config.

r351201, r351372:
	Add a vop_stdioctl() call, so that file systems that do not support
	holes will have a trivial implementation of lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE).
	The algorithm appears to be compatible with the POSIX draft and
	the implementation in Linux for the case of a file system that
	does not support holes.  Prior to this patch, lseek(2) would reply
	-1 with errno set to ENOTTY for SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE on files in
	file systems that do not support holes.
	r351372 maps ENOTTY to EINVAL for lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE) for
	any other cases, such as a ENOTTY return from vn_bmap_seekhole().

r350665:
	The fuse driver has been renamed to fusefs(5) and been substantially
	rewritten.  The new driver includes many bug fixes and performance
	enhancements, as well as the following user-visible features:
	* Optional kernel-side permissions checks (-o default_permissions)
	* mknod(2), socket(2), and pipe(2) support
	* server side locking with fcntl(2)
	* FUSE operations are now interruptible when mounted with -o intr
	* server side handling of UTIME_NOW during utimensat(2)
	* mount options may be updated with "mount -u"
	* fusefs file system may now be exported over NFS
	* RLIMIT_FSIZE support
	* support for fuse file systems using protocols as old as 7.4
	
	FUSE file system developers should also take note of the following new
	features:
	* The protocol level has been raised from 7.8 to 7.23
	* kqueue support on /dev/fuse
	* server-initiated cache invalidation via FUSE_NOTIFY_REPLY

r350471:
	gnop(8) can now configure a delay to be applied to read and write
	request delays.  See the -d, -q and -x parameters.

r350315, r350316:
	Adds a Linux compatible copy_file_range(2) syscall.

r350307:
	libcap_random(3) has been removed.  Applications can use native
	APIs to get random data in capability mode.

r349529,r349530:
	Add support for using unmapped mbufs with sendfile(2).

r349352:
	nand(4) and related components have been removed.

r349349:
	The UEFI loader now supports HTTP boot.

r349335:
	bhyve(8) now implements a High Definition Audio (HDA) driver, allowing
	guests to play to and record audio data from the host.

r349286:
	swapon(8) can now erase a swap device immediately before enabling it,
	similar to newfs(8)'s -E option.  This behaviour can be specified by
	adding -E to swapon(8)'s command-line parameters, or by adding the
	"trimonce" option to a swap device's /etc/fstab entry.

r347908-r347923:
	The following network drivers have been removed: bm(4), cs(4), de(4),
	ed(4), ep(4), ex(4), fe(4), pcn(4), sf(4), sn(4), tl(4), tx(4), txp(4),
	vx(4), wb(4), xe(4).
