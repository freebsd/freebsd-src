 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> This API documentation may contain both functions which
 * are public and functions that are for internal use only. Since we have not
 * reviewed every part of the documentation yet, <i>some internal functions
 * are not marked as such</i>. Until we finish reviewing the API documentation
 * and add appropriate comments to functions which are only for internal use,
 * you should take this into account. In case you want to use a function of
 * this kernel subsystem in another kernel subsystem you should search for
 * precedence of use outside this subsystem. If the function is not used
 * outside this subsystem you should ask on the mailinglists about it, else
 * you risk breaking something.
