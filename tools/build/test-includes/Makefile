#
# A number of header files in sys/* have, going back to 7th Edition Unix in
# 1979, reqiured other files (like sys/types.h) to compile. Likewise the 4BSD
# networking code has had prerequisites. However, going back to around the turn
# of the century, other systems have made them be independently includable
# (wide-spread header include protection post-dates 7th edition Unix by maybe 4
# or 5 years judging from netnews sources). Start down the path of making them
# all independently includable by creating this test that fails buildworld when
# they are not.
#
# The _foo.h files are excluded as they are internal-only headers and/or have
# special requirements. Since the purpose of this is to allow autoconfig
# programs to detect FreeBSD has different headers, omitting internal
# headers cuts down on the noise w/o causing problems for the goal.
