Opportunistically skip building a cross-compiler during the
bootstrap phase of the build.
If the currently installed compiler matches the planned bootstrap compiler
type and revision, then it will not be built.
This does not prevent a compiler from being built for installation though,
only for building one for the build itself.
The
.Va WITHOUT_CLANG
option controls that.
