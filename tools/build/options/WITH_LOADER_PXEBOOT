Build pxeboot on i386/amd64 for BIOS booting.
The PXE Boot loader package needs more space than we may have in the boot loader.
If you need to increase
.Va LOADERSIZE
beyond 500000, then building
.Xr pxeboot 8
will fail.
To allow a larger
.Va LOADERSIZE
for some environments, it may be necessary to disable pxeboot builds or adjust
its defaults.
You can set the default loader for pxeboot to use independently of the system
default by setting
.Va PXEBOOT_DEFAULT_INTERP
to one of
.Dq lua ,
.Dq 4th ,
or
.Dq simp .
The limit on the size of the loader used for
.Xr pxeboot 8
can be set independently with
.Va PXEBOOTSIZE .
.Pp
This option only has an effect on x86.
