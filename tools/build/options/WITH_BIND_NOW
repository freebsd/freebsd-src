.\" $FreeBSD$
Build all binaries with the
.Dv DF_BIND_NOW
flag set to indicate that the run-time loader should perform all relocation
processing at process startup rather than on demand.
The combination of the
.Va BIND_NOW
and
.Va RELRO
options provide "full" Relocation Read-Only (RELRO) support.
With full RELRO the entire GOT is made read-only after performing relocation at
startup, avoiding GOT overwrite attacks.
