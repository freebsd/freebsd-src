Do not opportunistically skip building a cross-linker during the
bootstrap phase of the build.
Normally, if the currently installed linker matches the planned bootstrap
linker type and revision, then it will not be built.
This does not prevent a linker from being built for installation though,
only for building one for the build itself.
The
.Va WITHOUT_LLD
option controls that.
.Pp
This option is only relevant when
.Va WITH_LLD_BOOTSTRAP
is set.
