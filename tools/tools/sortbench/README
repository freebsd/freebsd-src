Running:
1. Compile mergesort_bench.c into mergesort_bench
2. Run bench.py with python bench.py [elts]
2a. Bench will optionally run 2 ^ elts elements as the dataset size when provided. Otherwise it will run 2 ^ 20 elements.

Output:
Files will be output in a new folder called stats with separate files for each statistical comparison and the raw results in a subfolder called data.
This files will contain the results of the running of ministat with time required to sort as the dataset.

Modifications:
Change bench.py's WIKI variable to be true if you have wiki.c implemented and want to test it.

As the script runs, it is running each of the stdlib sorting algorithms (and wikisort if provided) with 2 ^ elts elements,
5 trials of the sort time as it's output. That output is saved in the data folder and then passed into the command line
utility ministat which then provides the confidence interval of difference between the data in stats folder.
