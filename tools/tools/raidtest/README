This utility can be used to test performance of storage devices.
First, one need to generate file with I/O operations:

	# set mediasize=`diskinfo /dev/<device> | awk '{print $3}'`
	# set sectorsize=`diskinfo /dev/<device> | awk '{print $2}'`
	# raidtest genfile -s $mediasize -S $sectorsize -n 50000

It will generate test which contains 50000 I/O requests with random
size and random offset. Size is a multiple of sectorsize, but less than or
equal to 128kB (maxium size of I/O request). I/O request type (READ or WRITE)
is random as well.
All test data are stored in 'raidtest.data' file in current working directory.

To run test, one should type:

	# raidtest test -d /dev/<device> -n 10

This command will read test data from 'raidtest.data' file, run 10 processes
which will be used to send requests to the given device in parallel.
When test is finished you will see statistics:

	Bytes per second: <x>
	Requests per second: <y>

If you compare performance of two storage devices, use the same data file!


usage: raidtest genfile [-frw] <-s mediasize> [-S sectorsize] <-n nrequests> [file]
       raidtest test [-Rrw] <-d device> [-n processes] [file]

where:
	-d device	path to tested device
	-f		if raidtest.data file or specified file already exists,
			remove it and create new one
	-n nrequests	number of requests to generate
	-n processes	number of processes to run
	-r		generate/run only READ requests
	-R		generate random data for write requests
	-s		size of destination device
	-S		sector size of destination device
	-w		generate/run only WRITE requests
	file		path to the data file instead of default 'raidtest.data'
