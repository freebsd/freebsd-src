.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple netmap application that bridges packets between two netmap ports.
If the two netmap ports use the same netmap memory region
.Nm
forwards packets without copying the packets payload (zero-copy mode), unless
explicitly prevented by the
.Fl c
flag.
.Pp
When bridging two physical ports, it is necessary that both NICS are in
promiscuous mode, otherwise unicast traffic directed to other hosts will
be dropped by the hardware, and bridging will not work.
.Pp
When bridging the hardware rings of a physical port with the corresponding
host rings, it is necessary to turn off the offloads, because netmap does
not prepare the NIC rings with offload information.
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig em0 -rxcsum -txcsum -tso4 -tso6 -lro
.Ed
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i Ar port
Name of the netmap port.
It can be supplied up to two times to identify the ports that must be bridged.
Any netmap port type (physical interface, VALE switch, pipe, monitor port...)
can be used.
If the option is supplied only once, then it must be for a physical interface and, in that case,
.Nm
will bridge the port and the host stack.
.It Fl b Ar batch-size
Maximum number of packets to send in one operation.
.It Fl w Ar wait-link
indicates the number of seconds to wait before transmitting.
It defaults to 2, and may be useful when talking to physical
ports to let link negotiation complete before starting transmission.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose mode
.It Fl c
Disable zero-copy mode.
