# This file specifies various information about terminals on the system.
# It is used by several different programs.  Common entries for the
# various columns include:
#
# name  The name of the terminal device.
#
# getty The program to start running on the terminal.  Typically a
#       getty program, as the name implies.  Other common entries
#       include none, when no getty is needed, and xdm, to start the
#       X Window System.
#
# type The initial terminal type for this port.  For hardwired
#      terminal lines, this will contain the type of terminal used.
#      For virtual consoles, the correct type is typically xterm, but
#      vt220 will work better if you need interoperability with other
#      systems like Solaris or GNU/Linux.
#      Other common values include network for network connections on
#      pseudo-terminals, dialup for incoming modem ports, and unknown
#      when the terminal type cannot be predetermined.
#
# status Must be on or off.  If on, init will run the getty program on
#        the specified port.  If the word "secure" appears, this tty
#        allows root login.
#
# name	getty				type	status		comments
#
# If console is marked "insecure", then init will ask for the root password
# when going to single-user mode.
