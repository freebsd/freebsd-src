.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates and manages
.Fx
Phabricator reviews based on git commits.
It is geared towards
.Fx
development.
It requires the
.Pa devel/git ,
.Pa devel/arcanist-lib
and
.Pa textproc/jq
packages; these will be installed automatically if
.Nm
is installed via the
.Pa devel/freebsd-git-devtools
package.
.Pp
.Nm
assumes a one-to-one relationship between git commits and
Differential Revisions, and requires the titles in a pair to match.
Commit titles must therefore be unique across all open
Differential Revisions authored by the submitter.
If the title of either a commit or its associated Differential Revision is
changed, the other must be updated manually to maintain the match.
.Pp
The first parameter must be a verb.
Most verbs accept one or more git commit references: commit hashes, branch
names, commit ranges, and so on.
A branch name refers to the single commit at its tip; use a commit range to
operate on multiple commits.
See
.Xr git-rev-parse 1
for details on specifying commit references.
The available verbs are:
.Bl -tag -width "create"
.It Cm create
Create new Differential Revisions from the specified commits.
Accepts options:
.Bl -tag -width "-s subscriber"
.It Fl l
Before processing commit(s) display list of commits to be processed
and wait for confirmation.
.It Fl r Ar reviewer
Add one or more reviewers, separated by commas, to revision(s) being created.
Each argument must be an existing Phabricator user or group.
Note that group reviewers must be specified using their
hashtag (e.g. #jails for the "Jails" group).
.It Fl s Ar subscriber
Add one or more subscribers, separated by commas, to revision(s) being created.
Each argument must be an existing Phabricator user or group.
.It Fl p Ar parent
Specify the parent of the first commit in the list.
This is useful when adding more commits on top of an already existing
stack in Phabricator.
.El
.It Cm list
Print the associated Differential Revisions for the specified commits.
.It Cm patch
Try to apply patches from one or more Differential Revision to the currently
checked out tree.
The following options are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width "-b"
.It Fl b
Switch to a new branch before applying the patches.
.It Fl c
Commit each applied patch to the git checkout.
The commit message and author are taken from the Differential Revision.
.It Fl r
Rather than using the
.Sy arc
command to apply the patch, download the raw patch file and apply it using
.Xr git-apply 1 .
This is useful for avoiding some misfeatures of
.Sy arc ,
particularly its behavior of trying to update all remotes in the tree in some
cases.
.It Fl s
Recursively apply the parent revisions of the specified commit.
This can be used to apply patch stacks by specifying the top-most, i.e.,
most recent commit in the stack.
.El
.It Cm stage
Prepare a series of commits to be pushed to the upstream
.Fx
repository.
.Pp
First, the target branch is checked out; by default this is the
main branch but can be overridden with the
.Fl b
option.
Then, the specified commits are cherry-picked with review tags added to the
commit log message, and the log message is opened in an editor for any final
updates.
The commits need not have associated Differential Revisions.
.Pp
This is intended to be used after code review has been completed, and the
commits are ready to be pushed to an upstream repository.
.It Cm update
Synchronize the Differential Revisions associated with the
specified commits.
Currently only the diff is updated; the review description and other
metadata are not synchronized.
If a message is specified with
.Fl m ,
that message is added as a note to the Differential Revision.
If no message is supplied,
the user's editor will be opened to provide an update message for
each revision.
If an empty message is supplied via
.Fl m ,
then no notes will be added when updating Differential Revisions.
.Pp
If
.Fl l
is used, display list of commits to be updated and wait for confirmation
of the list rather than prompting for each commit.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
These are manipulated by
.Nm git-config :
.Bl -tag -width "arc.assume_yes"
.It Va arc.assume_yes
Assume a
.Dq yes
answer to all prompts instead of
prompting the user.
Equivalent to the
.Fl y
flag.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.browse
Try to open newly created reviews in a browser tab.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.list
Always use
.Dq list mode
.Pq Fl l
with create and update.
In this mode, the list of git revisions to use
is listed with a single prompt before creating or updating reviews.
The diffs for individual commits are not shown.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.verbose
Always use verbose output.
Equivalent to the
.Fl v
flag.
Defaults to false.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical end-to-end usage looks something like this.
.Pp
Commit changes with a message and create a Differential Review:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git commit -m "kern: Rewrite in Rust"
$ git arc create HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Make changes to the diff based on review feedback, then amend the
changes to the existing commit and update the Differential Review:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git commit --amend
$ git arc update HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Now that all reviewers are happy, it is time to stage the commit and
push it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc stage HEAD
$ git push freebsd HEAD:main
.Ed
.Pp
Create a Phabricator review using the contents of the most recent
commit in your git checkout:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create -r markj,#jails HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
The commit title is used as the review title, the commit log
message is used as the review description, and
.Aq Mt markj@FreeBSD.org
is added as a reviewer.
Also, the
.Dq Jails
reviewer group is added using its hashtag.
.Pp
Create a series of Phabricator reviews for each of HEAD~2, HEAD~ and
HEAD:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create HEAD~3..HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Pairs of consecutive commits are linked into a patch stack.
Note that the first commit in the specified range is excluded.
.Pp
Create a series of separate reviews for each of the following commits:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create b409afcfedcdda ca03ed1345aff0
.Ed
.Pp
Update the review corresponding to commit b409afcfedcdda:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc update b409afcfedcdda
.Ed
.Pp
The title of the commit must be the same as it was when the review
was created.
Note that the review description is not automatically updated.
.Pp
Apply the patch in review D12345 to the currently checked-out tree,
and stage it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc patch D12345
.Ed
.Pp
Apply the patch in review D23456 to the currently checked-out tree,
and commit it to the tree with the commit message in the review and
make the best guess for what to use for author.
If the guess is considered unreliable, the user is prompted to see
if they wish to use it (or abort).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc patch -c D23456
.Ed
.Pp
List the status of reviews for all the commits in the branch
.Dq feature :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc list main..feature
.Ed
.Pp
Update reviews for all commits in the branch
.Dq feature
after rebasing:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc update -lm "Rebase" main..feature
.Ed
