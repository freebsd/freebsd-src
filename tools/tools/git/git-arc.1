.Nd a wrapper to improve integration between git and arcanist
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl s Ar subscriber1 Ns Op Cm \&, Ns Ar subscriber2 ...
.Op Fl p Ar parent

.Op Fl b Ar branch
.Op Ar commit ... Ns | Ns Ar commit-range
.Nm
.Cm update
.Op Fl m Ar message
.Op Ar commit ... Ns | Ns Ar commit-range
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates and manages
.Fx
Phabricator reviews based on git commits.
.Pp
Git
assumes a one-to-one relationship between git commits and
Differential Revisions, and the Differential Revision title must match
the summary line of the corresponding commit.
In particular, the commit summaries must be unique across all open
Differential Revisions authored by the submitter.
.Pp
The first parameter must be a verb.
The available verbs are:
.Bl -tag -width "create"
.It Cm create
Create new Differential Revisions from the specified commits.
Accepts options:
.Bl -tag -width subscriber
.It Fl l
Before processing commit(s) display list of commits to be processed
and wait for confirmation.
.It Fl r Ar reviewer
Add one or more reviewers, separated by commas, to revision(s) being created.
Argument(s) must be existing Phabricator user or group.
.It Fl s Ar subscriber
Add one or more subscribers, separated by commas, to revision(s) being created.
Each argument must be an existing Phabricator user or group.
.It Fl p Ar parent
Specify the parent of the first commit in the list.
This is useful when adding more commits on top of the already existing
stack in Phabricator.
.El
.It Cm list
Print the associated Differential Revisions for the specified commits.
.It Cm patch
Try to apply a patch from a Differential Revision to the currently
checked out tree.
.It Cm stage
Prepare a series of commits to be pushed to the upstream
.Fx
repository.
The commits are cherry-picked to a branch (by default the
.Dq main
branch), review tags are added to the commit log message, and
the log message is opened in an editor for any last-minute
updates.
The commits need not have associated Differential
Revisions.
.It Cm update
Synchronize the Differential Revisions associated with the
specified commits.
Currently only the diff is updated; the review description and other
metadata are not synchronized.
If a message is specified with
.Fl m ,
that message is added as a note to the Differential Revision.
If no message is supplied,
the user's editor will be opened to provide an update message for
each revision.
If an empty message is supplied via
.Fl m ,
then no notes will be added when updating Differential Revisions.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
These are manipulated by
.Nm git-config :
.Bl -tag -width "arc.assume_yes"
.It Va arc.assume_yes
Assume a
.Dq yes
answer to all prompts instead of
prompting the user.
Equivalent to the
.Fl y
flag.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.browse
Try to open newly created reviews in a browser tab.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.list
Always use
.Dq list mode
.Pq Fl l
with create.
In this mode, the list of git revisions to create reviews for
is listed with a single prompt before creating reviews.
The diffs for individual commits are not shown.
Defaults to false.
.It Va arc.verbose
Always use verbose output.
Equivalent to the
.Fl v
flag.
Defaults to false.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical end-to-end usage looks something like this.
.Pp
Commit changes with a message and create a Differential Review:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git commit -m "kern: Rewrite in Rust"
$ git arc create HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Make changes to the diff based on review feedback, then amend the
changes to the existing commit and update the Differential Review:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git commit --amend
$ git arc update HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Now that all reviewers are happy, it is time to stage the commit and
push it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc stage HEAD
$ git push freebsd HEAD:main
.Ed
.Pp
Create a Phabricator review using the contents of the most recent
commit in your git checkout:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create -r markj HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
The commit title is used as the review title, the commit log
message is used as the review description, and
.Aq Mt markj@FreeBSD.org
is added as a reviewer.
.Pp
Create a series of Phabricator reviews for each of HEAD~2, HEAD~ and
HEAD:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create HEAD~3..HEAD
.Ed
.Pp
Pairs of consecutive commits are linked into a patch stack.
Note that the first commit in the specified range is excluded.
.Pp
Create a series of separate reviews for each of the following commits:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc create b409afcfedcdda ca03ed1345aff0
.Ed
.Pp
Update the review corresponding to commit b409afcfedcdda:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc update b409afcfedcdda
.Ed
.Pp
The title of the commit must be the same as it was when the review
was created.
Note that the review description is not automatically updated.
.Pp
Apply the patch in review D12345 to the currently checked-out tree,
and stage it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc patch D12345
.Ed
.Pp
List the status of reviews for all the commits in the branch
.Dq feature :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ git arc list main..feature
.Ed
