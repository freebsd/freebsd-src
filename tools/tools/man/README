man scripts
===========

checkmlinks.sh
--------------

This is a simple script used to check if a man page's Nm/Fo/Fn macro
names are in the Makefile.

To run, switch to the directory with the pages in it and run the script:
```
cd /usr/src/share/man/man9
sh /usr/src/tools/tools/man/checkmlinks.sh
```

The script will output the name that is missing, and the file that it
was sourced from.

There are a number of exceptions, and those should be added to the
script to skip over, e.g. `SDT_PROBE`.  The last one is added because
adding the numbered args is a bit redundant.
