This is a simple program to drive net80211::ieee80211_sta_join1() calls from
user space.

The program optionally accepts an interface name (e.g., wlan42), or an
interface name, an SSID and a BSSID.

In the former case of no SSID/BSSID passed it will query the scan results and
then try to join each entry from the scan with a short delay.

In the lastter case giving the SSID/BSSID one can trigger the "canreassoc" case
in ieee80211_sta_join1() or not depending on whether one passes the currently
associated SSID/BSSID or not.

The tool is useful to trigger net80211::newstate() changes while other
newstate() changes are pending or being executed.

I was specifically developed to show a problem with the LinuxKPI 802.11 compat
code.  The reason is that ieee80211_sta_join1() also calls in (*iv_update_bss)()
swapping nodes before initiating the state changes and in LinuxKPI state is on
the sta and not the vif causing all kinds of troubles, especially if we lose
a state transition before the taskq is run or if the iv_bss node gets swapped
before a task is executed.
