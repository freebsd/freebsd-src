This is an implementation of the frag attack described in:
http://tapir.cs.ucl.ac.uk/bittau-wep.pdf
It will only work with Atheros.  It could be made to work with other cards, but
it is more difficult.

wesside's features:
===================
* Channel hops, finds a WEP wifi, finds a MAC to spoof if necessary and
  associates.
* Waits for a packet.  Uses fragmentation to recover some keystream.
* Discovers the network's IP using the linear keystream expansion technique in
  order to decrypt an ARP packet.
* Generates traffic on the network for weak IV attack:
  - Either by flooding with ARP requests.
  - Or, by contacting someone on the Internet [udps] and telling it to flood.
* Uses aircrack periodically to attempt to crack the WEP key.  The supplied
  aircrack is modified to work with wesside.
* Binds to a tap interface to allow TX.  RX works if a dictionary is being built
  [dics] and a packet with a known IV traverses the network.

Examples:
=========
For the skiddies:
./wesside

To cause the Internet to flood:
[Internet box]~$ ./udps 500
./wesside -s ip_of_internet_box

To build a dictionary:
[Internet box]~# ./dics source_ip_of_box 100
./wesside -s ip_of_internet_box
Use tap3 as if it were the wifi.
