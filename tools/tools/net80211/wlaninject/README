This tool generates raw 802.11 frames.  The resulting frame will
depend on the capabilities of the hardware.  Some hardware mangles
the 802.11 header [e.g. wi] other hardware does not [e.g. ath].
This tool does not deal with layers above 802.11.  A payload from
a file must be supplied if, for example, IP data needs to be sent.

Refer to the usage for a complete list of options.  Here, the most
relevant will be described.  There are three types of switches:

physical layer	Physical parameters for transmission
		[such as iface and chan].
802.11 header	Fields in the 802.11 header.
802.11 body	The payload of the 802.11 frame.  This includes
		management information elements.

Interesting physical layer options.
-----------------------------------
-i The network interface to use to TX; defaults to ath0.
-c The channel to TX on; defaults to 1.
-N Mark transmitted frames such that no ACK is expected. In practice,
   this will disable any retransmission done by the card.  This
   way, you are sure that a single copy of your packet will be TXed.
-V Verify that the packet you TXed did indeed fly in the air as
   expected.  This is done by sniffing on a second network interface
   and comparing the received frame to what was sent.  This option
   is especially useful because some cards mangle 802.11 header
   fields such as duration and fragment numbers.
-W The WME AC to use for transmission.  Symbolic names are used:
	ac_be, be	best effort
	ac_bk, bk	background
	ac_vi, vi	video
	ac_vo, vo	voice
-X The rate to use for transmission; defaults to 1Mbps.
-P The txpower to use; defaults to the maximum permitted by the driver.

Interesting 802.11 header options.
----------------------------------
-t The 802.11 frame type.  Symbolic names are:
	mgt	Management frame
	ctl	Control frame
	data	Data frame
   Otherwise the numerical type must be supplied.
-s The 802.11 frame subtype.  At this point, the length of the 802.11 header
   will be calculated.  Symbolic names are:
	preq, probereq	Probe Request
	auth		Authenticate
	areq, assocreq	Association Request
	data		Data
   Otherwise the numerical subtype must be supplied.
-4 The 4th MAC addr used for WDS.  Make sure you specify this before
   -s so the header length is calculated correctly.
-l Override the length of the packet.  This is useful for sending
   truncated packets.
-b Specify a file which will be used as a payload inside the 802.11
   frame.  The length should be calculated automatically correctly.

Interesting 802.11 payload options.
-----------------------------------
This is mainly used for management frames.  For data frames, -b
would typically be used.

-e Add an information element.  You can supply multiple -e options,
   but make sure you add them in the expected order.  The format
   of the information element is a list of 2 digit hex numbers.
   That is, 010203...  The first hexdigit is the type of the IE.
   Therefore, 00616161 should correspond to the SSID IE of 'aaa'.
   The length is calculated automatically---you do not need to
   supply it.
-S Add an SSID IE with the data specified in ascii; e.g. -S 'aaa'
   is the equivalent of -e 0061616161.
-R Add an IE of 11b supported rates.   

Examples:
---------

wlaninject -t data -s data -i ral0 -V ath0 -m -n 1 -f 1

Transmit a data frame on ral0 and verify the transmission on ath0.
The frame is sent with sequence number 1, fragment number 1, and
the MoreFrag bit marked in the 802.11 header.
