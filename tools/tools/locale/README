Files in this directory are used to generate locale source files
from files in CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository).

To generate the files, do the following:

	cd /usr/src/tools/tools/locale
	make obj	(mandatory)
	make fetch	(download the CLDR source)
	make extract	(and extract it)
	make -j16	(-jN recommended)
	make diff	(check if the changes are reasonable)
	make install

"make" downloads the necessary files, build them, and install the
results into /usr/src/share/* as source files for locales.

More details are as follows:

Variables:
	LOCALESRCDIR
		Destination path for the generated locale files.
		Default: ${SRCTOP}/share.
	TMPDIR
		Temporary directory.
		Default: /tmp

Targets:
	make obj
		Create a temporary directory for building.

	make clean
		Clean up the obj directories.  Note that this does not
		clean up tools or posix locale source files generated
		from the CLDR files because it takes a long time to generate
		them and they are not changed as long as using the same
		CLDR files.  "make clean && make build" will
		regenerate the locale source files for src/share/*def.

	make cleandir
		Remove the obj directories completely.

	make tools-test
		Check if necessary tools are installed or not.
		If something is missing, install them.

	make fetch
		Download necessary files from CLDR.

	make build-tools
		Build a tool to generate locale source files.

	make posix
		Build POSIX locale source files.

	make build
		Build locale files.

	make diff
		Run diff(1) the build results against $LOCALESRCDIR.

	make install
		Install the build results into $LOCALESRCDIR.

	make widths
		Generate widths.txt.  Requires pkgconf and utf8proc
		packages to be installed.
