find-sb is a program which scans the input file you specify (normally a
raw disk slice) for filesystems.  It's not very smart, nor particularly
efficient.  All it does is read the input file one device block at a time,
and when it reads a block that has a UFS superblock magic number in the
right place, it tells you about it.  It helped me find an important partition
after the disklabel got somehow trashed.  It might not work for you.  After
looking carefully at the output of this program and creating a new disklabel,
you should use `fsck -n' or a tool like ffsinfo(8) to verify that there is
in fact something vaguely sane located at that spot on the disk.  (There are
checks that fsck can do to verify the validity of the superblock which
this program does not even attempt.)

If you use this program and as a result trash what was left of your disk,
well, too bad.  You should have kept a backup anyway.  If you read the source
code and don't immediately understand how it works and what it's doing, then
DON'T USE IT.
