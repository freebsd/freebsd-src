.Nd manage tinderbox runs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script manages
.Xr tinderbox 1
runs, generates log summaries, and mails out failure reports.
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Fl c Ar NAME , Fl -config Ns = Ns Ar NAME
The name of the configuration to use.
If specified multiple times, all listed configurations will be run in
sequence.
The default is the hostname minus the domain part.
.It Fl d , Fl -dump
Dumps the configuration and exits without running the tinderbox.
.It Fl e Ar DIR , Fl -etcdir Ns = Ns Ar DIR
The directory where configuration files are located.
The default is
.Pa $HOME/etc .
.It Fl l Ar FILE
The name of a file to lock upon startup.
If the lock is already held by another process,
.Nm
will terminate immediately rather than block.
.El
.Ss Configuration
The
.Nm
script uses named configurations located in individual files named for
the setup they describe, with a
.Pa .rc
suffix.
For instance, the
.Dq snoosnoo
configuration is contained in
.Pa snoosnoo.rc .
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm
attempts to read
.Pa default.rc
before reading the actual configuration file; thus, that file may be
used to specify default values shared by multiple configurations.
.Pp
The configuration consists of a list of single- or multiple-value
variable assignments:
.Bl -tag
.It Va variable Ns = Ns Ar value
.It Va variable Ns = Ns Ar value1 , Ar value 2, ...
.El
.Pp
Whitespace around the equal sign and around the commas separating
multiple values is optional.
.Pp
Blank lines are ignored, as is anything following a hash sign
.Pq Dq # .
.Pp
The following configuration variables are defined:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It ARCH
.Pq Vt single
The architecture currently being built for.
Read-only.
.It BRANCH
.Pq Vt single
The branch currently being built.

.Pq Vt multiple
A list of source branches to build.
The default value is
.Dq CURRENT .
.It CFLAGS
.Pq Vt single
The desired value for the
.Va CFLAGS
.Xr make 1
variable.
This is equivalent to specifying
.Va CFLAGS
in
.Va ENV .
No default value.
.It COPTFLAGS
.Pq Vt single
The desired value for the
.Va COPTFLAGS
.Xr make 1
variable.
This is equivalent to specifying

A list of environment variables to pass to the
.Xr tinderbox 1

Each value is the name and value of an environment variable, separated
by an equal sign
.Pq Dq = .

.Xr make 1
jobs to run.
No default value.
.It LOGDIR

of the patch to apply if the
.Dq patch
command is specified.
No default value.
.It PLATFORMS
.Pq Vt multiple
Which architectures and machines to build for.
Each value is the name of an architecture, optionally followed by a
forward slash
.Pq Dq /
and a machine name.
If the machine name is not specified, it is assumed to be identical to
the architecture name.
The default value is
.Dq i386 .

The subject to use on failure reports.
The default value is
.Dq Tinderbox failure on %%arch%%/%%machine%% .
.It TARGETS
.Pq Vt multiple
A list of targets (commands) to specify to the
.Xr tinderbox 1

.El
.Pp
Fields which are left undefined are filled in from the
.Dq global
setup.
.Ss Variable Substitution
All single-valued configuration variables are subject to variable
substitution immediately before use.
If a variable's value contains strings of the form
.Va %%VAR%%
or
.Va %%var%% ,
those strings are replaced with the values of the corresponding
variables.
The difference between the first and the second form is that the
latter expands to lower-case.
For instance,
.Dq %%BRANCH%%
might expand to
.Dq RELENG_4
while
.Dq %%branch%%
would expand to
.Dq releng_4 .
