.Sh NAME
.Nm tinderbox
.Nd build and release testing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
.Ar command Op ...
.Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script tests the
.Fx
build and release system by performing a cross-build (and optionally a
cross-release) of an arbitrary branch of the source tree for an
arbitrary target platform.
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Fl a Ar ARCH , Fl -arch Ns = Ns Ar ARCH
Specifies the target architecture.
The default value is whatever the host system's
.Xr uname 1
reports.
.It Fl b Ar BRANCH , Fl -branch Ns = Ns Ar BRANCH
The branch to specify to
.Xr cvs 1
or
.Xr cvsup 1
when updating the source tree.
The default is to use
.Fl A
instead, to get the head.
Specifying
.Va CURRENT
as the argument to
.Fl -branch
is equivalent to leaving it unspecified.
.It Fl c Ar NAME , Fl -cvsup Ns = Ns Ar NAME
The name of the
.Xr cvsup 1
server from which to update the source tree
.Cm update
command is specified.
The default is to use
.Xr cvs 1
instead.
.It Fl d Ar DATE , Fl -date Ns = Ns Ar DATE
The date to specify to
.Xr cvs 1
or
.Xr cvsup 1
when updating the source tree.
As a special case, the value
.Dq today
corresponds to midnight UTC the day the run starts.
The default is to use the top of whichever branch was specified.
.It Fl h Ar NAME , Fl -hostname Ns = Ns Ar NAME
The name of the host running the tinderbox.
This defaults to the name reported by the
.Fl n
option of the
.Xr uname 1
command, and is only used for cosmetic purposes.
.It Fl j Ar NUM , Fl -jobs Ns = Ns Ar NUM
The maximum number of paralell jobs, as specified to
.Xr make 1
using the
.Fl j
option.
The default is 1.
.It Fl l Ar FILE , Fl -logfile Ns = Ns Ar FILE
The name of a file to which the output and error messages produced by
the build should be written.
Note that this file can grow quite large.
The default is to redirect all output to
.Pa /dev/stdout .
.It Fl m Ar MACHINE , Fl -machine Ns = Ns Ar MACHINE
Specifies the target machine.
The default value is whatever the host system's
.Xr uname 1
reports.
.It Fl p Ar PATCH , Fl -patch Ns = Ns Ar PATCH
The file name of a patch to apply to the source tree before building
if the
.Cm patch
command is specified.
The patch should be relative to the root of the source tree.
When building a release, the patch is passed to the release process
through the
.Ev LOCAL_PATCHES
environment variable (see
.Xr release 7
for more information), regardless of whether the
.Cm patch
command was specified.
The default is to not apply any patches.
.It Fl r Ar DIR , Fl -repository Ns = Ns Ar DIR
The location of the
.Xr cvs 1
repository from which to update the source tree if the
.Cm update
command is specified.
The default is
.Pa /home/ncvs .
.It Fl s Ar DIR , Fl -sandbox Ns = Ns Ar DIR
The location of the sandbox in which the builds are to take place.
This directory should reside on a reasonably fast disk with at least
1.5 GB available (3 GB if building a release).
.It Fl t Ar NUM , Fl -timeout Ns = Ns Ar NUM
The maximum wall-time duration of the run, in seconds.
The default is to continue until all targets are completed.
.It Fl v , Fl -verbose
Enable additional debugging output.
.El
.Pp
Following the options on the command line, at least one of the
following commands must be specified:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Cm clean
Delete the source and object trees.
This is highly recommended when sources are patched, as successive
builds will fail due to repeated application of the same patch to the
same sources.
.Pp
Note that this does not remove the chroot tree created and populated
by the release build.
.It Cm update
Update the sources using
.Xr cvs 1 .
This is highly recommended, for obvious reasons, if the
.Cm clean
command is specified.
.It Cm patch
Apply the patch specified with the
.Fl -patch
option to the source tree.
If the specified patch file does not exist, the
.Cm patch
command will fail gracefully.
.It Cm world
Build the world.
.It Cm generic
Build a GENERIC kernel.
.It Cm lint
Build a LINT kernel if available.
In
.Fx
5, the
.Pa LINT
configuration file will first be generated from the corresponding
.Pa NOTES
file.
If neither
.Pa LINT
nor
.Pa NOTES
exist in the kernel configuration directory, the
.Cm lint
command will fail gracefully.
.It Cm release
Build a release by following the procedure described in
.Xr release 7 .
Note that this is a lengthy process which requires root privileges.
.El
.Pp
The commands are executed in the order in which they are listed above,
regardless of the order in which they are listed on the command line.
.Pp
Finally, any arguments of the form
.Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
are interpreted as environment variables which are exported into the
build environment.
These variables are not allowed to override those set by the script
itself (see
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
below).
.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
script was originally written to perform daily build testing of
.Fx
4 and 5.
It is not intended for use with older releases, and probably will not
work with anything older than
.Fx 4.2 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
script clears its environment at startup and provides its child
processes with a tailored environment.
The following variables are set for all builds:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It PATH
.Va /usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
.It TZ
.Va UTC
.It __MAKE_CONF
.Va /dev/null
.It CFLAGS
.Va -O -pipe
.El
.Pp
In addition, if one or more of the
.Cm generic ,
.Cm lint
or
.Cm release
command was specified, the following variables, which affect kernel
builds, are set:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It COPTFLAGS
.Va -O -pipe
.El
.Pp
Finally, the following variables are set for release builds:
.Bl -tag -width 18n
.It CHROOTDIR
.Va $SANDBOX/root
.It CVSROOT
As specified with the
.Fl -repository
option.
.It RELEASETAG
.Va -rBRANCH
if
.Fl -branch Ns = Ns Ar BRANCH
was specified, or
.Va -A
otherwise.
.It CVSCMDARGS
.Va -DDATE
if
.Fl -date Ns = Ns Ar DATE
was specified.
.It WORLD_FLAGS , KERNEL_FLAGS
Both of these are set to
.Va -jN
if
.Fl -jobs Ns = Ns Ar N
was specified, or
.Va -B
otherwise.
.It LOCAL_PATCHES
Set to the path of the patch that was specified with the
.Fl -patch
option, if any.
.It PATCH_FLAGS
Set to
.Va -fs
if a patch was specified.
.It NOCDROM
.Va YES
.It NODOC
.Va YES
.It NOPORTS
.Va YES
.El
.Pp
Except for
.Va CFLAGS
and
.Va COPTFLAGS ,
none of these variables may be overridden by command-line arguments.
