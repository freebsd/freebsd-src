.Sy port
.Li [,
.Sy idtype
.Li :
.Sy id
.Li :

for userid matching, or
.Li gid
for group ID matching.
.Sy id
The user or group ID (depending on
.Sy idtype )
allowed to bind to the specified port.
.Bf -emphasis
NOTE: User and group names are not valid; only the actual ID numbers
may be used.
.Ef
.Sy protocol
Describes which protocol this entry applies to.
Either
.Li tcp
or
.Li udp
are supported.
.Sy port
Describes which port this entry applies to.
.Bf -emphasis
NOTE: MAC security policies may not override other security system policies
by allowing accesses that they may deny, such as
