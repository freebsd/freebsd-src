This is a port of Jason Thorpe's kttcp tool for testing network
performance for in-kernel applications (like NFS).  The tool consists
of a loadable module and a small user-mode application.  Beware
that you should match the kernel module to the kernel it is to be
used with.  By default SYSDIR is set to /usr/src/sys in Makefile.
You may want to change that.

To use the tool do something like on each of two machines:

1. make
2. su; make install (installs module and kttcp in /usr/local/bin)
3. kldload kttcp

Then:

4. kttcp -r on one machine
5. kttcp -t foo on the other machine, where foo is the
   machine where #4 was done.

kttcp w/o arguments gives usage.  Otherwise the source is your
friend.  Beware that the kernel code must mimic soreceive and sosend
for results to be meaningful.
