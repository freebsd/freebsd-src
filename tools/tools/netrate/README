Netsend and Netreceive
----------------------

This pair of binaries is used to fixed rate UDP performance testing.

The netreceive tool consists solely of a UDP packet sink bound to a
specified UDP port.  Packets received on its port are copied to user space
and discarded.

The netsend tool acts as a packet source, generating packets of the
specified size at the specified rate to a target IP address and port
number:

   netsend [ip] [port] [payloadsize] [rate] [duration]

The payloadsize field specifies the size of the UDP payload, not the total 
packet size, which will also include a variety of headers (typically, 
ethernet, IP, and UDP).

The rate indicates the number of packets/second to attempt to deliver.

The duration is the duration of the run in seconds.

The netsend tool will wait for around two seconds to synchronize with the
wall clock for timing purposes.  It will then busy-wait between packet
transmits.
