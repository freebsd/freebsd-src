This directory has snippets of what will eventually become camio. This program
can take an expression for the types of things to trace, and then custom write a
dtrace script to do that.

camio is a d-traced tcpdump-like program for examining CAM traffic (and
therefore I/O and other traffic to storage media) that written during covid, but
with fbp providers that recent clang optimizations make unuseable, hence the
shift to the cam provider, but retooling them and finishing the grammar will
take some time (but these scripts are useful today).
