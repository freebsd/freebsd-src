This directory is for regression test programs.

A regression test program is one that will exercise a particular bit of the
system to check that we have not reintroduced an old bug.

Tests that are for parts of the base system should go into a directory here
which is the same as their path relative to src/, for example the uuencode(1)
utility resides in src/usr.bin/uuencode so its regression test resides in
src/tools/regression/usr.bin/uuencode.

Base system regression tests should prefix their test results with 'PASS' or
'FAIL' accordingly, to make checking for failed tests easier.  For now the
tests are very free-form, and it's up to you to do that.  Eventually, it
should be a part of the regression test framework.

Please make a subdir per other regression test, and add a brief description to
this file.
