/*
 * This regression test attempts to exercise two instances of uprintf(9) in
 * UFS: (1) when blocks are exhausted, and (2) when inodes are exhausted, in
 * order to attempt to trigger races in the uprintf(9) code.  The test
 * accepts a pointer to a path -- ideally, a very small UFS partition -- and
 * then proceeds to fill it in various ways.
 *
 * This tool assumes that it is alright to create, and delete, entries in the
 * directory with names of integer values.  Don't run this tool against a
 * directory that has files with names along those lines if you want to keep
 * the files.
 *
 * Suggested usage is:
 *
 * mdconfig -a -t malloc -s 512
 * newfs /dev/mdX
 * mount /dev/mdX /mnt
 * ufs_uprintf /mnt
 * umount /mnt
 * mdconfig -d -u X
