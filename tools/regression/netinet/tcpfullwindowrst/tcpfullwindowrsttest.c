 * The following code sets up two connected TCP sockets that send data to each
 * other until the window is closed. Then one of the sockets is closed, which
 * will generate a RST once the TCP at the other socket does a window probe.
 *
 * All versions of FreeBSD prior to 11/26/2004 will ignore this RST into a 0
 * window, causing the connection (and application) to hang indefinitely.
 * On patched versions of FreeBSD (and other operating systems), the RST
 * will be accepted and the program will exit in a few seconds.
