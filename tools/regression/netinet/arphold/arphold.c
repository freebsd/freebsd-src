 * Description: The following is a test of the arp entry packet queues
 * which replaced the single packet hold entry that existed in the BSDs
 * since time immemorial.  The test process is:
 *
 * 1) Find out the current system limit (maxhold)
 * 2) Using an IP address for which we do not yet have an entry
 *    load up an ARP entry packet queue with exactly that many packets.
 * 3) Check the arp dropped stat to make sure that we have not dropped
 *    any packets as yet.
 * 4) Add one more packet to the queue.
 * 5) Make sure that only one packet was dropped.
 *
 * CAVEAT: The ARP timer will flush the queue after 1 second so it is
 * important not to run this code in a fast loop or the test will
 * fail.
