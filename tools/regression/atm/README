This directory contains tests for the ATM stuff. Specific tests for HARP
are in the harp subdirectory and are not automatically run. All
other tests can be run from the top-level or from their sub-directories by
starting RunTest.sh.

These tests require ports/net/atmsupport to be installed - the
scripts will remind you if they cannot find the package.
