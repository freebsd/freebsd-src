This directory tree contains tools used for the maintenance and
testing of FreeBSD.  There is no toplevel Makefile structure since
these tools are not meant to be built as part of the standard system,
though there may be individual Makefiles in some of the subdirs.

Please read the README files in the subdirs for further information.
