stress2 is a tool for finding problems in the kernel.

It is composed of a large number of regression tests, tests that
stress various components of the kernel and a few validation tests.
There are currently some 700 different tests.

The key idea behind stress2 is to randomize as much as possible in
a test, as a way of achieving better coverage.  For example, varying
VM pressure, varying numbers of threads, varying delays, etc.
stress2 has found a large number of problems:

To run the full test suite type "make test" in the stress2 directory.

To run a subset of tests, go to the stress2/misc directory.
    To run for example all tmpfs tests, type ./all.sh -o $(grep -l tmpfs *.sh)
    To run fdatasync.sh for one hour, type ./all.sh -m 60 fdatasync.sh"
    To run dup2.sh three times, type ./all.sh -l 3 dup2.sh
