DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     kkddcc serves requests for tickets.  When it starts, it first checks the
     flags passed, any options that are not specified with a command line flag
     are taken from a config file, or from a default compiled-in value.

     Options supported:

     --cc _f_i_l_e, ----ccoonnffiigg--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e
             Specifies the location of the config file, the default is
             _/_v_a_r_/_h_e_i_m_d_a_l_/_k_d_c_._c_o_n_f.  This is the only value that can't be
             specified in the config file.

     --pp, ----nnoo--rreeqquuiirree--pprreeaauutthh
             Turn off the requirement for pre-autentication in the initial AS-
             REQ for all principals.  The use of pre-authentication makes it
             more difficult to do offline password attacks.  You might want to
             turn it off if you have clients that don't support pre-authenti-
             cation.  Since the version 4 protocol doesn't support any pre-
             authentication, serving version 4 clients is just about the same
             as not requiring pre-athentication.  The default is to require
             pre-authentication.  Adding the require-preauth per principal is
             a more flexible way of handling this.

     ----mmaaxx--rreeqquueesstt==_s_i_z_e
             Gives an upper limit on the size of the requests that the kdc is
             willing to handle.

     --HH, ----eennaabbllee--hhttttpp
             Makes the kdc listen on port 80 and handle requests encapsulated
             in HTTP.

     ----nnoo--552244
             don't respond to 524 requests

     ----kkeerrbbeerrooss44
             respond to Kerberos 4 requests

     ----kkeerrbbeerrooss44--ccrroossss--rreeaallmm
             respond to Kerberos 4 requests from foreign realms.  This is a
             known security hole and should not be enabled unless you under-
             stand the consequences and are willing to live with them.

     --rr _s_t_r_i_n_g, ----vv44--rreeaallmm==_s_t_r_i_n_g
             What realm this server should act as when dealing with version 4
             requests.  The database can contain any number of realms, but
             since the version 4 protocol doesn't contain a realm for the
             server, it must be explicitly specified.  The default is whatever
             is returned by kkrrbb__ggeett__llrreeaallmm().  This option is only available
             if the KDC has been compiled with version 4 support.

     --KK, ----kkaasseerrvveerr
             Enable kaserver emulation (in case it's compiled in).

     --PP _p_o_r_t_s_p_e_c, ----ppoorrttss==_p_o_r_t_s_p_e_c
             Specifies the set of ports the KDC should listen on.  It is given
             as a white-space separated list of services or port numbers.

     ----aaddddrreesssseess==_l_i_s_t _o_f _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_s
             The list of addresses to listen for requests on.  By default, the
             kdc will listen on all the locally configured addresses.  If only
             a subset is desired, or the automatic detection fails, this
             option might be used.

     ----ddeettaacchh
             detach from pty and run as a daemon.

     ----ddiissaabbllee--ddeess
             disable add des encryption types, makes the kdc not use them.

     All activities are logged to one or more destinations, see krb5.conf(5),
     and krb5_openlog(3).  The entity used for logging is kkddcc.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE
     The configuration file has the same syntax as krb5.conf(5), but will be
     read before _/_e_t_c_/_k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f, so it may override settings found there.
     Options specific to the KDC only are found in the ``[kdc]'' section.  All
     the command-line options can preferably be added in the configuration
     file.  The only difference is the pre-authentication flag, which has to
     be specified as:

           require-preauth = no

     (in fact you can specify the option as ----rreeqquuiirree--pprreeaauutthh==nnoo).

     And there are some configuration options which do not have command-line
     equivalents:

           enable-digest = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                turn on support for digest processing in the KDC.  The default
                is FALSE.

           check-ticket-addresses = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                Check the addresses in the ticket when processing TGS
                requests.  The default is TRUE.

           allow-null-ticket-addresses = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                Permit tickets with no addresses.  This option is only rele-
                vant when check-ticket-addresses is TRUE.

           allow-anonymous = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                Permit anonymous tickets with no addresses.

           max-kdc-datagram-reply-length = _n_u_m_b_e_r
                Maximum packet size the UDP rely that the KDC will transmit,
                instead the KDC sends back a reply telling the client to use
                TCP instead.

           transited-policy = always-check | allow-per-principal |
                always-honour-request
                This controls how KDC requests with the
                disable-transited-check flag are handled. It can be one of:

                      always-check
                           Always check transited encoding, this is the
                           default.

                      allow-per-principal
                           Currently this is identical to always-check.  In a
                           future release, it will be possible to mark a prin-
                           cipal as able to handle unchecked requests.

                      always-honour-request
                           Always do what the client asked.  In a future
                           release, it will be possible to force a check per
                           principal.

           encode_as_rep_as_tgs_rep = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                Encode AS-Rep as TGS-Rep to be bug-compatible with old DCE
                code.  The Heimdal clients allow both.

           kdc_warn_pwexpire = _t_i_m_e
                How long before password/principal expiration the KDC should
                start sending out warning messages.

     The configuration file is only read when the kkddcc is started.  If changes
     made to the configuration file are to take effect, the kkddcc needs to be
     restarted.

     An example of a config file:

           [kdc]
                   require-preauth = no
                   v4-realm = FOO.SE

BBUUGGSS
     If the machine running the KDC has new addresses added to it, the KDC
     will have to be restarted to listen to them.  The reason it doesn't just
     listen to wildcarded (like INADDR_ANY) addresses, is that the replies has
     to come from the same address they were sent to, and most OS:es doesn't
     pass this information to the application.  If your normal mode of opera-
     tion require that you add and remove addresses, the best option is proba-
     bly to listen to a wildcarded TCP socket, and make sure your clients use
     TCP to connect.  For instance, this will listen to IPv4 TCP port 88 only:

           kdc --addresses=0.0.0.0 --ports="88/tcp"

     There should be a way to specify protocol, port, and address triplets,
     not just addresses and protocol, port tuples.
