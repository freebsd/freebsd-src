.Sh NAME
.Nm de4ctl
.Nd Read and configure parameters from the Terasic DE4
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl q
.Ar command
.\" .Op Ar options
.Op Ar args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows various parameters of the Terasic DE4 to be read and
devices to be configured.
The command line interface of
.Nm
is set of commands.
.Sh OPTIONS
The .Nm command supports a single option:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Avoid unnecessicary output including field names when reporting values.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Nm fan
Display power supplied to the fan as a range from 0 to 255.
.It Nm temp
Display the FPGA temperature in degrees Celsius.
.It Nm hdmi
Controls the HDMI daughter card via subcommands:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It Nm reset
Reset the HDMI chip via
.Pa /dev/de4_hdmi_reset .
.It Nm setup
Resets the HDMI chip and then configure the output to a fixed 720x480 output via
.Pa /dev/de4_hdmi_i2c .
.El
.It Nm hdmires
Display the HDMI resolution parameters from the PixelStream device via
.Pa /dev/ps_reg0
.It Nm hdmires xres yres refresh
Set the HDMI resolution and refresh rate using the PixelStream device
.Pa /dev/ps_reg0
and set the pixel clock rate using a reconfigurable phased locked loop via
.Pa /dev/altpll_reconfig

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm hdmi
command should perform actual negotiation with the attached monitor to
selection a resolution rather than just spewing 720x480 and praying.

.It
The
.Nm hdmires xres yres refresh
command sets the resolution and pixel clock rate without checking that
the attached monitor can cope with the parameters.
