These are the GNU core utilities.  This package is the union of
the GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

Most of these programs have significant advantages over their Unix
counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer
arbitrary limits.

The programs that can be built with this package are:

  [ basename cat chgrp chmod chown chroot cksum comm cp csplit cut date dd
  df dir dircolors dirname du echo env expand expr factor false fmt fold
  ginstall groups head hostid hostname id join kill link ln logname ls
  md5sum mkdir mkfifo mknod mv nice nl nohup od paste pathchk pinky pr
  printenv printf ptx pwd readlink rm rmdir seq sha1sum shred sleep sort
  split stat stty su sum sync tac tail tee test touch tr true tsort tty
  uname unexpand uniq unlink uptime users vdir wc who whoami yes

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

These programs are intended to conform to POSIX (with BSD and other
extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  By default they conform
to older POSIX (1003.2-1992), and therefore support obsolete usages
like "head -10" and "chown owner.group file".  This default is
overridden at build-time by the value of <unistd.h>'s _POSIX2_VERSION
macro, and this in turn can be overridden at runtime as described in
the documentation under "Standards conformance".

The ls, dir, and vdir commands are all separate executables instead of
one program that checks argv[0] because people often rename these
programs to things like gls, gnuls, l, etc.  Renaming a program
file shouldn't affect how it operates, so that people can get the
behavior they want with whatever name they want.

Special thanks to Paul Eggert, Brian Matthews, Bruce Evans, Karl Berry,
Kaveh Ghazi, and François Pinard for help with debugging and porting
these programs.  Many thanks to all of the people who have taken the
time to submit problem reports and fixes.  All contributed changes are
attributed in the ChangeLog file.

And thanks to the following people who have provided accounts for
portability testing on many different types of systems: Bob Proulx,
Christian Robert, François Pinard, Greg McGary, Harlan Stenn,
Joel N. Weber, Mark D. Roth, Matt Schalit, Nelson H. F. Beebe,
Réjean Payette, Sam Tardieu.

Thanks to Michael Stone for inflicting test releases of the fileutils
on Debian's unstable distribution, and to all the kind folks who used
that distribution and found and reported bugs.

Note that each man page is now automatically generated from a template
and from the corresponding --help usage message.  Patches to the template
files (man/*.x) are welcome.  However, the authoritative documentation
is in texinfo form in the doc directory.

If you run the tests on a SunOS4.1.4 system, expect the ctime-part of
the ls `time-1' test to fail.  I believe that is due to a bug in the
way Sun implemented link(2) and chmod(2).

Last-minute notes, before coreutils-5.0
---------------------------------------

A known problem exists when compiling on HPUX on both hppa and ia64
in 64-bit mode (i.e. +DD64) on all known HPUX 11.x versions.  This
is not due to a bug in the package but instead due to a bug in the
system header file which breaks things in 64-bit mode.  The default
compilation mode is 32-bit and the software compiles fine using the
default mode.  To build this software in 64-bit mode you will need
to fix the system /usr/include/inttypes.h header file.  After
correcting that file the software also compiles fine in 64-bit mode.
Here is one possible patch to correct the problem.

If you run the tests as root, note that a few of them create files
and/or run programs as a non-root user, `nobody' by default.
If you want to use some other non-root username, specify it via
the NON_ROOT_USERNAME environment variable.  Depending on the
permissions with which the working directories have been created,
using `nobody' may fail, because that user won't have the required
read and write access to the build and test directories.
I find that it is best to unpack and build as a non-privileged
user, and then to run the following command as that user in order
to run the privilege-requiring tests:

  sudo env NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER make check

If you can run the tests as root, please do so and report any
problems.  We get much less test coverage in that mode, and it's
arguably more important that these tools work well when run by
root than when run by less privileged users.

***************************************

There are pretty many tests, but nowhere near as many as we need.
Additions and corrections are very welcome.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to re-report
it -- it won't bother me to get a reminder.  Besides, the more messages I
get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll be fixed -- usually.
If you sent a complete patch and, after a couple weeks you haven't
received any acknowledgement, please ping us.  A complete patch includes
a well-written ChangeLog entry, unified (diff -u format) diffs relative
to the most recent test release (or, better, relative to the latest
sources in the CVS repository), an explanation for why the patch is
necessary or useful, and if at all possible, enough information to
reproduce whatever problem prompted it.  Plus, you'll earn lots of
karma if you include a test case to exercise any bug(s) you fix.
Instructions for checking out the latest source via CVS are here:

If your patch adds a new feature, please try to get some sort of consensus
that it is a worthwhile change.  One way to do that is to send mail to
bug-coreutils@gnu.org including as much description and justification
as you can.  Based on the feedback that generates, you may be able to
convince us that it's worth adding.


WARNING:  If you modify files like configure.in, m4/*.m4, aclocal.m4,
or any Makefile.am, then don't be surprised if what gets regenerated no
longer works.  To make things work, you'll have to be using appropriate
versions of automake and autoconf.  As for what versions are `appropriate',
use the versions of

  * autoconf specified via AC_PREREQ in m4/jm-macros.m4
  * automake specified via AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE in configure.ac

Usually it's fine to use versions that are newer than those specified.

These programs all recognize the `--version' option.  When reporting
bugs, please include in the subject line both the package name/version
and the name of the program for which you found a problem.

For general documentation on the coding and usage standards
this distribution follows, see the GNU Coding Standards,
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
the address on the last line of --help output.
