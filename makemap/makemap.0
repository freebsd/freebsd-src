       MMaakkeemmaapp creates the database maps used by  the  keyed  map  lookups  in
       sendmail(8).   It  reads input from the standard input and outputs them
       to the indicated _m_a_p_n_a_m_e_.

       Depending on how it is compiled,  mmaakkeemmaapp  handles  different  database
       formats, selected using the _m_a_p_t_y_p_e parameter.  They may be

       dbm    DBM format maps.  This requires the ndbm(3) library.

       btree  B-Tree  format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley DB library.

       hash   Hash format maps.  This also requires the Berkeley DB library.

       cdb    CDB (Constant DataBase) format maps.  This requires the  tinycdb
              library.

       implicit
              The  first  available  format in the following order: hash, dbm,
              and cdb.

       In all cases, mmaakkeemmaapp reads lines from the standard input consisting of
       two words separated by white space.  The first is the database key, the
       second is the value.  The value may contain ``%_n'' strings to  indicate
       parameter  substitution.   Literal percents should be doubled (``%%'').
       Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

       Notice: do nnoott use  mmaakkeemmaapp  to  create  the  aliases  data  base,  but
       nneewwaalliiaasseess  which  puts  a  special  token  into  the data base that is
       required by sseennddmmaaiill..

       If the _T_r_u_s_t_e_d_U_s_e_r option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
       mmaakkeemmaapp  is  invoked  as root, the generated files will be owned by the
       specified _T_r_u_s_t_e_d_U_s_e_r_.

   FFllaaggss
       --CC     Use the specified sseennddmmaaiill configuration file for looking up the
              TrustedUser option.

       --NN     Include  the null byte that terminates strings in the map.  This
              must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf ``K'' line.

       --cc     Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.

       --DD     Use to specify the character to use to indicate a comment (which
              is ignored) instead of the default of '#'.

       --dd     Allow duplicate keys in the map.  This is only allowed on B-Tree
              format maps.  If two identical keys are read, they will both  be
              inserted into the map.

       --ee     Allow empty value (right hand side).

       --ff     Normally  all  upper case letters in the key are folded to lower
              case.  This flag disables that behaviour.  This is  intended  to
              mesh  with  the -f flag in the KK line in sendmail.cf.  The value
              is never case folded.

       --ii     Use the specified type as fallback if the given _m_a_p_t_y_p_e  is  not
              available.

       --ll     List supported map types.

       --oo     Append  to  an old file.  This allows you to augment an existing
              file.  Note: this might not be supported by all database  types,
              e.g., cdb.

       --rr     Allow  replacement of existing keys.  Normally mmaakkeemmaapp complains
              if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.

       --ss     Ignore safety checks  on  maps  being  created.   This  includes
              checking  for  hard or symbolic links in world writable directo-
              ries.

       --tt     Use the specified delimiter instead of  white  space  (also  for
              dumping a map).

       --uu     dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.

       --vv     Verbosely print what it is doing.
