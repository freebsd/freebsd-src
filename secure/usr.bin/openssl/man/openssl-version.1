.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
In OpenSSL versions prior to 3.4, OpenSSL had a limitation regarding the
\&\fBOPENSSLDIR\fR, \fBMODULESDIR\fR and \fBENGINESDIR\fR build time macros.  These macros
were defined at build time, and represented filesystem paths.  This is common
practice on unix like systems, as there was an expectation that a given build
would be installed to a pre-determined location.  On Windows however, there is
no such expectation, as libraries can be installed to arbitrary locations.
\&\fBOSSL_WINCTX\fR was introduced as a new build time variable to define a set of
registry keys identified by the name openssl\-<version>\-<ctx>, in which the
<version> value is derived from the version string in the openssl source, and
the <ctx> extension is derived from the \fBOSSL_WINCTX\fR variable.  The values of
\&\fBOPENSSLDIR\fR, \fBENGINESDIR\fR and \fBMODULESDIR\fR can be set to various paths
underneath this key to break the requirement to predict the installation path at
build time.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The output of \f(CW\*(C`openssl version \-a\*(C'\fR would typically be used when sending
in a bug report.
