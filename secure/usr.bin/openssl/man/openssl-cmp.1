.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBcmp\fR command is a client implementation for the Certificate
Management Protocol (\s-1CMP\s0) as defined in \s-1RFC4210.\s0
It can be used to request certificates from a \s-1CA\s0 server,
update their certificates,
request certificates to be revoked, and perform other types of \s-1CMP\s0 requests.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"

.SS "Certificate enrollment options"
.IX Subsection "Certificate enrollment options"
.IP "\fB\-newkey\fR \fIfilename\fR|\fIuri\fR" 4
.IX Item "-newkey filename|uri"
The source of the private or public key for the certificate being requested.
Defaults to the public key in the PKCS#10 \s-1CSR\s0 given with the \fB\-csr\fR option,
the public key of the reference certificate, or the current client key.
.Sp
The public portion of the key is placed in the certification request.
.Sp
Unless \fB\-cmd\fR \fIp10cr\fR, \fB\-popo\fR \fI\-1\fR, or \fB\-popo\fR \fI0\fR is given, the
private key will be needed as well to provide the proof of possession (\s-1POPO\s0),
where the \fB\-key\fR option may provide a fallback.
.IP "\fB\-newkeypass\fR \fIarg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-newkeypass arg"
Pass phrase source for the key given with the \fB\-newkey\fR option.
If not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.
.Sp
For more information about the format of \fIarg\fR see
\&\fBopenssl\-passphrase\-options\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-subject\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-subject name"
X509 Distinguished Name (\s-1DN\s0) of subject to use in the requested certificate
template.
If the NULL-DN (\f(CW"/"\fR) is given then no subject is placed in the template.
Default is the subject \s-1DN\s0 of any PKCS#10 \s-1CSR\s0 given with the \fB\-csr\fR option.
For \s-1KUR,\s0 a further fallback is the subject \s-1DN\s0
of the reference certificate (see \fB\-oldcert\fR) if provided.
This fallback is used for \s-1IR\s0 and \s-1CR\s0 only if no SANs are set.
.Sp
If provided and neither \fB\-cert\fR nor \fB\-oldcert\fR is given,
the subject \s-1DN\s0 is used as fallback sender of outgoing \s-1CMP\s0 messages.
.Sp
The argument must be formatted as \fI/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\fR.
Special characters may be escaped by \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR (backslash); whitespace is retained.
Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included.
Giving a single \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR will lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN).
Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR character instead of a \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR
between the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set.
Example:
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fB\-issuer\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-issuer name"
X509 issuer Distinguished Name (\s-1DN\s0) of the \s-1CA\s0 server
to place in the requested certificate template in \s-1IR/CR/KUR.\s0
If the NULL-DN (\f(CW"/"\fR) is given then no issuer is placed in the template.
.Sp
If provided and neither \fB\-recipient\fR nor \fB\-srvcert\fR is given,
the issuer \s-1DN\s0 is used as fallback recipient of outgoing \s-1CMP\s0 messages.
.Sp
The argument must be formatted as \fI/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\fR.
For details see the description of the \fB\-subject\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-days\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-days number"
Number of days the new certificate is requested to be valid for, counting from
the current time of the host.
Also triggers the explicit request that the
validity period starts from the current time (as seen by the host).
.IP "\fB\-reqexts\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-reqexts name"
Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining certificate request extensions.
If the \fB\-csr\fR option is present, these extensions augment the extensions
contained the given PKCS#10 \s-1CSR,\s0 overriding any extensions with same OIDs.
.IP "\fB\-sans\fR \fIspec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sans spec"
One or more \s-1IP\s0 addresses, \s-1DNS\s0 names, or URIs separated by commas or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in \*(L"...\*(R")
to add as Subject Alternative Name(s) (\s-1SAN\s0) certificate request extension.
If the special element \*(L"critical\*(R" is given the SANs are flagged as critical.
Cannot be used if any Subject Alternative Name extension is set via \fB\-reqexts\fR.
.IP "\fB\-san_nodefault\fR" 4
.IX Item "-san_nodefault"
When Subject Alternative Names are not given via \fB\-sans\fR
nor defined via \fB\-reqexts\fR,
they are copied by default from the reference certificate (see \fB\-oldcert\fR).
This can be disabled by giving the \fB\-san_nodefault\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-policies\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policies name"
Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining policies to be set
as certificate request extension.
This option cannot be used together with \fB\-policy_oids\fR.
.IP "\fB\-policy_oids\fR \fInames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policy_oids names"
One or more \s-1OID\s0(s), separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in \*(L"...\*(R")
to add as certificate policies request extension.
This option cannot be used together with \fB\-policies\fR.
.IP "\fB\-policy_oids_critical\fR" 4
.IX Item "-policy_oids_critical"
Flag the policies given with \fB\-policy_oids\fR as critical.
.IP "\fB\-popo\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-popo number"
Proof-of-possession (\s-1POPO\s0) method to use for \s-1IR/CR/KUR\s0; values: \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR..<2> where
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR = \s-1NONE,\s0 \f(CW0\fR = \s-1RAVERIFIED,\s0 \f(CW1\fR = \s-1SIGNATURE\s0 (default), \f(CW2\fR = \s-1KEYENC.\s0
.Sp
Note that a signature-based \s-1POPO\s0 can only be produced if a private key
is provided via the \fB\-newkey\fR or \fB\-key\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-csr\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-csr filename"
PKCS#10 \s-1CSR\s0 in \s-1PEM\s0 or \s-1DER\s0 format containing a certificate request.
With \fB\-cmd\fR \fIp10cr\fR it is used directly in a legacy P10CR message.
.Sp
When used with \fB\-cmd\fR \fIir\fR, \fIcr\fR, or \fIkur\fR,
it is transformed into the respective regular \s-1CMP\s0 request.
In this case, a private key must be provided (with \fB\-newkey\fR or \fB\-key\fR)
for the proof of possession (unless \fB\-popo\fR \fI\-1\fR or \fB\-popo\fR \fI0\fR is used)
and the respective public key is placed in the certification request
(rather than taking over the public key contained in the PKCS#10 \s-1CSR\s0).
.Sp
PKCS#10 \s-1CSR\s0 input may also be used with \fB\-cmd\fR \fIrr\fR
to specify the certificate to be revoked
via the included subject name and public key.
.IP "\fB\-out_trusted\fR \fIfilenames\fR|\fIuris\fR" 4

The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in Key Update Request
(\s-1KUR\s0) messages or to be revoked in Revocation Request (\s-1RR\s0) messages.
For \s-1KUR\s0 the certificate to be updated defaults to \fB\-cert\fR,

.Sp
The recipient field in the header of a \s-1CMP\s0 message is mandatory.
If not given explicitly the recipient is determined in the following order:
the subject of the \s-1CMP\s0 server certificate given with the \fB\-srvcert\fR option,
the \fB\-issuer\fR option,
the issuer of the certificate given with the \fB\-oldcert\fR option,

If the given value is 0 then \s-1HTTP\s0 connections are not kept open
after receiving a response, which is the default behavior for \s-1HTTP 1.0.\s0
If the value is 1 or 2 then persistent connections are requested.
If the value is 2 then persistent connections are required,
i.e., in case the server does not grant them an error occurs.
The default value is 1, which means preferring to keep the connection open.

.IX Item "-trusted filenames|uris"
The certificate(s), typically of root CAs, the client shall use as trust anchors
when validating signature-based protection of \s-1CMP\s0 response messages.
This option is ignored if the \fB\-srvcert\fR option is given as well.
It provides more flexibility than \fB\-srvcert\fR because the \s-1CMP\s0 protection
certificate of the server is not pinned but may be any certificate
from which a chain to one of the given trust anchors can be constructed.
.Sp
If none of \fB\-trusted\fR, \fB\-srvcert\fR, and \fB\-secret\fR is given, message validation
errors will be thrown unless \fB\-unprotected_errors\fR permits an exception.

Non-trusted intermediate \s-1CA\s0 certificate(s).
Any extra certificates given with the \fB\-cert\fR option are appended to it.
All these certificates may be useful for cert path construction
for the own \s-1CMP\s0 signer certificate (to include in the extraCerts field of
request messages) and for the \s-1TLS\s0 client certificate (if \s-1TLS\s0 is enabled)
as well as for chain building
when validating server certificates (checking signature-based

.IX Item "-srvcert filename|uri"
The specific \s-1CMP\s0 server certificate to expect and directly trust (even if it is
expired) when verifying signature-based protection of \s-1CMP\s0 response messages.
This pins the accepted server and results in ignoring the \fB\-trusted\fR option.
.Sp
If set, the subject of the certificate is also used
as default value for the recipient of \s-1CMP\s0 requests
and as default value for the expected sender of \s-1CMP\s0 responses.
.IP "\fB\-expect_sender\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-expect_sender name"
Distinguished Name (\s-1DN\s0) expected in the sender field of incoming \s-1CMP\s0 messages.
Defaults to the subject \s-1DN\s0 of the pinned \fB\-srvcert\fR, if any.
.Sp
This can be used to make sure that only a particular entity is accepted as
\&\s-1CMP\s0 message signer, and attackers are not able to use arbitrary certificates
of a trusted \s-1PKI\s0 hierarchy to fraudulently pose as a \s-1CMP\s0 server.
Note that this option gives slightly more freedom than setting the \fB\-srvcert\fR,
which pins the server to the holder of a particular certificate, while the
expected sender name will continue to match after updates of the server cert.
.Sp
The argument must be formatted as \fI/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\fR.

The subject and the public key contained in this certificate
serve as fallback values in the certificate template of \s-1IR/CR/KUR\s0 messages.
.Sp
The subject of this certificate will be used as sender of outgoing \s-1CMP\s0 messages,
while the subject of \fB\-oldcert\fR or \fB\-subjectName\fR may provide fallback values.
.Sp
The issuer of this certificate is used as one of the recipient fallback values
and as fallback issuer entry in the certificate template of \s-1IR/CR/KUR\s0 messages.
.Sp
When performing signature-based message protection,
this \*(L"protection certificate\*(R", also called \*(L"signer certificate\*(R",
will be included first in the extraCerts field of outgoing messages
and the signature is done with the corresponding key.
In Initialization Request (\s-1IR\s0) messages this can be used for authenticating
using an external entity certificate as defined in appendix E.7 of \s-1RFC 4210.\s0
.Sp
For Key Update Request (\s-1KUR\s0) messages this is also used as
the certificate to be updated if the \fB\-oldcert\fR option is not given.

If the file includes further certs, they are appended to the untrusted certs
because they typically constitute the chain of the client certificate, which
is included in the extraCerts field in signature-protected request messages.

.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
When a client obtains from a \s-1CMP\s0 server \s-1CA\s0 certificates that it is going to
trust, for instance via the \f(CW\*(C`caPubs\*(C'\fR field of a certificate response,
authentication of the \s-1CMP\s0 server is particularly critical.
So special care must be taken setting up server authentication
using \fB\-trusted\fR and related options for certificate-based authentication
or \fB\-secret\fR for MAC-based protection.
.PP
When setting up \s-1CMP\s0 configurations and experimenting with enrollment options
typically various errors occur until the configuration is correct and complete.
When the \s-1CMP\s0 server reports an error the client will by default
check the protection of the \s-1CMP\s0 response message.
Yet some \s-1CMP\s0 services tend not to protect negative responses.
In this case the client will reject them, and thus their contents are not shown
although they usually contain hints that would be helpful for diagnostics.
For assisting in such cases the \s-1CMP\s0 client offers a workaround via the
\&\fB\-unprotected_errors\fR option, which allows accepting such negative messages.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Simple examples using the default OpenSSL configuration file"
.IX Subsection "Simple examples using the default OpenSSL configuration file"
This \s-1CMP\s0 client implementation comes with demonstrative \s-1CMP\s0 sections
in the example configuration file \fIopenssl/apps/openssl.cnf\fR,
which can be used to interact conveniently with the Insta Demo \s-1CA.\s0
.PP
In order to enroll an initial certificate from that \s-1CA\s0 it is sufficient
to issue the following shell commands.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  export OPENSSL_CONF=/path/to/openssl/apps/openssl.cnf
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  openssl genrsa \-out insta.priv.pem
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta
.Ve
.PP
This should produce the file \fIinsta.cert.pem\fR containing a new certificate
for the private key held in \fIinsta.priv.pem\fR.
It can be viewed using, e.g.,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl x509 \-noout \-text \-in insta.cert.pem
.Ve
.PP
In case the network setup requires using an \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy it may be given as usual
via the environment variable \fBhttp_proxy\fR or via the \fB\-proxy\fR option in the
configuration file or the \s-1CMP\s0 command-line argument \fB\-proxy\fR, for example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \-proxy http://192.168.1.1:8080
.Ve
.PP
In the Insta Demo \s-1CA\s0 scenario both clients and the server may use the pre-shared
secret \fIinsta\fR and the reference value \fI3078\fR to authenticate to each other.
.PP
Alternatively, \s-1CMP\s0 messages may be protected in signature-based manner,
where the trust anchor in this case is \fIinsta.ca.crt\fR
and the client may use any certificate already obtained from that \s-1CA,\s0
as specified in the \fB[signature]\fR section of the example configuration.
This can be used in combination with the \fB[insta]\fR section simply by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,signature
.Ve
.PP
By default the \s-1CMP IR\s0 message type is used, yet \s-1CR\s0 works equally here.
This may be specified directly at the command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta \-cmd cr
.Ve
.PP
or by referencing in addition the \fB[cr]\fR section of the example configuration:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,cr
.Ve
.PP
In order to update the enrolled certificate one may call
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,kur
.Ve
.PP
using MAC-based protection with \s-1PBM\s0 or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,kur,signature
.Ve
.PP
using signature-based protection.
.PP
In a similar way any previously enrolled certificate may be revoked by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,rr \-trusted insta.ca.crt
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,rr,signature
.Ve
.PP
Many more options can be given in the configuration file
and/or on the command line.
For instance, the \fB\-reqexts\fR \s-1CLI\s0 option may refer to a section in the
configuration file defining X.509 extensions to use in certificate requests,
such as \f(CW\*(C`v3_req\*(C'\fR in \fIopenssl/apps/openssl.cnf\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  openssl cmp \-section insta,cr \-reqexts v3_req
.Ve
.SS "Certificate enrollment"
.IX Subsection "Certificate enrollment"
The following examples do not make use of a configuration file at first.
They assume that a \s-1CMP\s0 server can be contacted on the local \s-1TCP\s0 port 80
and accepts requests under the alias \fI/pkix/\fR.
.PP
For enrolling its very first certificate the client generates a client key
and sends an initial request message to the local \s-1CMP\s0 server
using a pre-shared secret key for mutual authentication.
In this example the client does not have the \s-1CA\s0 certificate yet,
so we specify the name of the \s-1CA\s0 with the \fB\-recipient\fR option
and save any \s-1CA\s0 certificates that we may receive in the \f(CW\*(C`capubs.pem\*(C'\fR file.
.PP
In below command line usage examples the \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR at line ends is used just
for formatting; each of the command invocations should be on a single line.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  openssl genrsa \-out cl_key.pem
\&  openssl cmp \-cmd ir \-server 127.0.0.1:80/pkix/ \-recipient "/CN=CMPserver" \e
\&    \-ref 1234 \-secret pass:1234\-5678 \e
\&    \-newkey cl_key.pem \-subject "/CN=MyName" \e
\&    \-cacertsout capubs.pem \-certout cl_cert.pem
.Ve
.SS "Certificate update"
.IX Subsection "Certificate update"
Then, when the client certificate and its related key pair needs to be updated,
the client can send a key update request taking the certs in \f(CW\*(C`capubs.pem\*(C'\fR
as trusted for authenticating the server and using the previous cert and key
for its own authentication.
Then it can start using the new cert and key.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  openssl genrsa \-out cl_key_new.pem
\&  openssl cmp \-cmd kur \-server 127.0.0.1:80/pkix/ \e
\&    \-trusted capubs.pem \e
\&    \-cert cl_cert.pem \-key cl_key.pem \e
\&    \-newkey cl_key_new.pem \-certout cl_cert.pem

.SS "Using a custom configuration file"
.IX Subsection "Using a custom configuration file"
For \s-1CMP\s0 client invocations, in particular for certificate enrollment,
usually many parameters need to be set, which is tedious and error-prone to do
on the command line.
Therefore, the client offers the possibility to read
options from sections of the OpenSSL config file, usually called \fIopenssl.cnf\fR.
The values found there can still be extended and even overridden by any
subsequently loaded sections and on the command line.
.PP
After including in the configuration file the following sections:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  [cmp]
\&  server = 127.0.0.1
\&  path = pkix/
\&  trusted = capubs.pem
\&  cert = cl_cert.pem
\&  key = cl_key.pem
\&  newkey = cl_key.pem
\&  certout = cl_cert.pem
\&
\&  [init]
\&  recipient = "/CN=CMPserver"
\&  trusted =
\&  cert =
\&  key =
\&  ref = 1234
\&  secret = pass:1234\-5678\-1234\-567
\&  subject = "/CN=MyName"
\&  cacertsout = capubs.pem
.Ve
.PP
the above enrollment transactions reduce to
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  openssl cmp \-section cmp,init
\&  openssl cmp \-cmd kur \-newkey cl_key_new.pem
.Ve
.PP
and the above transaction using a general message reduces to
