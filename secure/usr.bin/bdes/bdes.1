.Sh NAME
.Nm bdes
.Nd "encrypt/decrypt using the Data Encryption Standard"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abdp
.Op Fl F Ar N
.Op Fl f Ar N
.Op Fl k Ar key
.Op Fl m Ar N
.Op Fl o Ar N
.Op Fl v Ar vector
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Bdes
implements all
.Tn DES
modes of operation described in
.%T "FIPS PUB 81" ,
including alternative cipher feedback mode and both authentication
modes.
.Nm Bdes
reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
By default, the input is encrypted using cipher block chaining mode.
Using the same key for encryption and decryption preserves plain text.
.Pp
All modes but the electronic code book mode require an initialization
vector; if none is supplied, the zero vector is used.
If no
.Ar key
is specified on the command line, the user is prompted for one (see
.Xr getpass 3
for more details).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
The key and initialization vector strings are to be taken as
.Tn ASCII ,
suppressing the special interpretation given to leading
.Dq Li 0X ,
.Dq Li 0x ,
.Dq Li 0B ,
and
.Dq Li 0b
characters.
This flag applies to
.Em both
the key and initialization vector.
.It Fl b
Use electronic code book mode.
.It Fl d
Decrypt the input.
.It Fl F Ar N
Use
.Ar N Ns \-bit
alternative cipher feedback mode.
Currently
.Ar N
must be a multiple of 7 between 7 and 56 inclusive (this does not conform
to the alternative CFB mode specification).
.It Fl f Ar N
Use
.Ar N Ns \-bit
cipher feedback mode.
Currently
.Ar N
must be a multiple of 8 between 8 and 64 inclusive (this does not conform
to the standard CFB mode specification).
.It Fl k Ar key
Use
.Ar key
as the cryptographic key.
.It Fl m Ar N
Compute a message authentication code (MAC) of
.Ar N
bits on the input.
The value of
.Ar N
must be between 1 and 64 inclusive; if
.Ar N
is not a multiple of 8, enough 0 bits will be added to pad the MAC length
to the nearest multiple of 8.
Only the MAC is output.
MACs are only available in cipher block chaining mode or in cipher feedback
mode.
.It Fl o Ar N
Use
.Ar N Ns \-bit
output feedback mode.
Currently
.Ar N
must be a multiple of 8 between 8 and 64 inclusive (this does not conform
to the OFB mode specification).
.It Fl p
Disable the resetting of the parity bit.
This flag forces the parity bit of the key to be used as typed, rather than
making each character be of odd parity.
It is used only if the key is given in
.Tn ASCII .
.It Fl v Ar vector
Set the initialization vector to
.Ar vector ;
the vector is interpreted in the same way as the key.
The vector is ignored in electronic codebook mode.
.El
.Pp
The key and initialization vector are taken as sequences of
.Tn ASCII
characters which are then mapped into their bit representations.
If either begins with
.Dq Li 0X
or
.Dq Li 0x ,
that one is taken as a sequence of hexadecimal digits indicating the
bit pattern;
if either begins with
.Dq Li 0B
or
.Dq Li 0b ,
that one is taken as a sequence of binary digits indicating the bit pattern.
In either case,
only the leading 64 bits of the key or initialization vector
are used,
and if fewer than 64 bits are provided, enough 0 bits are appended
to pad the key to 64 bits.
.Pp
According to the
.Tn DES
standard, the low-order bit of each character in the
key string is deleted.
Since most
.Tn ASCII
representations set the high-order bit to 0, simply
deleting the low-order bit effectively reduces the size of the key space
from 2^56 to 2^48 keys.
To prevent this, the high-order bit must be a function depending in part
upon the low-order bit; so, the high-order bit is set to whatever value
gives odd parity.
This preserves the key space size.
Note this resetting of the parity bit is
.Em not
done if the key is given in binary or hex, and can be disabled for
.Tn ASCII
keys as well.
.Pp
The
.Tn DES
is considered a very strong cryptosystem, and other than table lookup
attacks, key search attacks, and Hellman's time-memory tradeoff (all of which
are very expensive and time-consuming), no cryptanalytic methods for breaking
the
.Tn DES
are known in the open literature.
No doubt the choice of keys and key security are the most vulnerable aspect
of
.Nm .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
For implementors wishing to write software compatible with this program,
the following notes are provided.
This software is believed to be compatible with the implementation of the
data encryption standard distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
.Pp
In the ECB and CBC modes, plaintext is encrypted in units of 64 bits (8 bytes,
also called a block).
To ensure that the plaintext file is encrypted correctly,
.Nm
will (internally) append from 1 to 8 bytes, the last byte containing an
integer stating how many bytes of that final block are from the plaintext
file, and encrypt the resulting block.
Hence, when decrypting, the last block may contain from 0 to 7 characters
present in the plaintext file, and the last byte tells how many.
Note that if during decryption the last byte of the file does not contain an
integer between 0 and 7, either the file has been corrupted or an incorrect
key has been given.
A similar mechanism is used for the OFB and CFB modes, except that those
simply require the length of the input to be a multiple of the mode size,
and the final byte contains an integer between 0 and one less than the number
of bytes being used as the mode.
(This was another reason that the mode size must be a multiple of 8 for those
modes.)
.Pp
Unlike Sun's implementation, unused bytes of that last block are not filled
with random data, but instead contain what was in those byte positions in
the preceding block.
This is quicker and more portable, and does not weaken the encryption
significantly.
.Pp
If the key is entered in
.Tn ASCII ,
the parity bits of the key characters are set
so that each key character is of odd parity.
Unlike Sun's implementation, it is possible to enter binary or hexadecimal
keys on the command line, and if this is done, the parity bits are
.Em not
reset.
This allows testing using arbitrary bit patterns as keys.
.Pp
The Sun implementation always uses an initialization vector of 0
(that is, all zeroes).
By default,
.Nm
does too, but this may be changed from the command line.

.Ed
.Sh BUGS
There is a controversy raging over whether the
.Tn DES
will still be secure
in a few years.
The advent of special-purpose hardware could reduce the cost of any of the
methods of attack named above so that they are no longer computationally
infeasible.
.Pp
As the key or key schedule is stored in memory, the encryption can be
compromised if memory is readable.
Additionally, programs which display programs' arguments may compromise the
key and initialization vector, if they are specified on the command line.
To avoid this
.Nm
overwrites its arguments, however, the obvious race cannot currently be
avoided.
.Pp
Certain specific keys should be avoided because they introduce potential
weaknesses; these keys, called the
.Em weak
and
.Em semiweak
keys, are (in hex notation, where
.Ar p
is either 0 or 1, and
.Ar P
is either
.Ql e
or
.Ql f ) :
