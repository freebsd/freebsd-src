.SH NAME
life_cycle\-rand \- The RAND algorithm life\-cycle
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All random number generator (RANDs)
go through a number of stages in their life-cycle:
.IP start 4
.IX Item "start"
This state represents the RAND before it has been allocated.  It is the
starting state for any life-cycle transitions.
.IP newed 4
.IX Item "newed"
This state represents the RAND after it has been allocated but unable to
generate any output.
.IP instantiated 4
.IX Item "instantiated"
This state represents the RAND when it is set up and capable of generating
output.
.IP uninstantiated 4
.IX Item "uninstantiated"
This state represents the RAND when it has been shutdown and it is no longer
capable of generating output.
.IP freed 4
.IX Item "freed"
This state is entered when the RAND is freed.  It is the terminal state
for all life-cycle transitions.
.SS "State Transition Diagram"

The usual life-cycle of a RAND is illustrated:
