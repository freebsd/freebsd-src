.SH NAME
OSSL_STORE\-winstore \- OpenSSL built in OSSL_STORE for Windows
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The OSSL_STORE implementation for Windows provides access to Windows' system
\&\f(CW\*(C`ROOT\*(C'\fR certificate store through URIs, using the URI scheme
\&\f(CW\*(C`org.openssl.winstore\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Supported URIs"
.IX Subsection "Supported URIs"
There is only one supported URI:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  org.openssl.winstore:
.Ve
.PP
No authority (host, etc), no path, no query, no fragment.
.SS "Supported OSSL_STORE_SEARCH operations"
.IX Subsection "Supported OSSL_STORE_SEARCH operations"
.IP \fBOSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name\fR\|(3) 4
.IX Item "OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name"
As a matter of fact, this must be used.  It is not possible to enumerate all
available certificates in the store.
.SS "Windows certificate store features"
.IX Subsection "Windows certificate store features"
Apart from diverse constraints present in the certificates themselves, the
Windows certificate store also has the ability to associate additional
constraining properties alongside a certificate in the store. This includes
both documented and undocumented capabilities:
.IP \(bu 4
The documented capability to override EKU
.IP \(bu 4
The undocumented capability to add name constraints
.IP \(bu 4
The undocumented capability to override the certificate expiry date
.PP
\&\fISuch constraints are not checked by this OSSL_STORE implementation, and
thereby not honoured\fR.
.PP
However, once extracted with \fBOSSL_STORE_load\fR\|(3), certificates that have
constraints in their X.509 extensions will go through the usual constraint
checks when used by OpenSSL, and are thereby honoured.

.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
The winstore (\f(CW\*(C`org.openssl.winstore\*(C'\fR) implementation was added in OpenSSL
3.2.0.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
OpenSSL uses \fBOSSL_DECODER\fR\|(3) implementations under the hood.
To influence what \fBOSSL_DECODER\fR\|(3) implementations are used, it's advisable
to use \fBOSSL_STORE_open_ex\fR\|(3) and set the \fIpropq\fR argument.
