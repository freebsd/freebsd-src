\&\- OpenSSL Guide: An introduction to the OpenSSL libraries
.SH INTRODUCTION
.IX Header "INTRODUCTION"
OpenSSL supplies two libraries that can be used by applications known as
\&\f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`libssl\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR library provides APIs for general purpose cryptography such as
encryption, digital signatures, hash functions, etc. It additionally supplies
supporting APIs for cryptography related standards, e.g. for reading and writing
digital certificates (also known as X.509 certificates). Finally it also
supplies various additional supporting APIs that are not directly cryptography
related but are nonetheless useful and depended upon by other APIs. For
example the "BIO" functions provide capabilities for abstracting I/O, e.g. via a
file or over a network.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`libssl\*(C'\fR library provides functions to perform secure communication between
two peers across a network. Most significantly it implements support for the
SSL/TLS, DTLS and QUIC standards.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`libssl\*(C'\fR library depends on and uses many of the capabilities supplied by
\&\f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR. Any application linked against \f(CW\*(C`libssl\*(C'\fR will also link against
\&\f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR, and most applications that do this will directly use API functions
supplied by both libraries.
.PP
Applications may be written that only use \f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR capabilities and do not
link against \f(CW\*(C`libssl\*(C'\fR at all.
.SH PROVIDERS
.IX Header "PROVIDERS"
As well as the two main libraries, OpenSSL also comes with a set of providers.
.PP
A provider in OpenSSL is a component that collects together algorithm
implementations (for example an implementation of the symmetric encryption
algorithm AES). In order to use an algorithm you must have at least one
provider loaded that contains an implementation of it. OpenSSL comes with a
number of providers and they may also be obtained from third parties.
.PP
Providers may either be "built-in" or in the form of a separate loadable module
file (typically one ending in ".so" or ".dll" dependent on the platform). A
built-in provider is one that is either already present in \f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR or one
that the application has supplied itself directly. Third parties can also supply
providers in the form of loadable modules.
.PP
If you don't load a provider explicitly (either in program code or via config)
then the OpenSSL built-in "default" provider will be automatically loaded.
.PP
See "OPENSSL PROVIDERS" below for a description of the providers that OpenSSL
itself supplies.
.PP
Loading and unloading providers is quite an expensive operation. It is normally
done once, early on in the application lifecycle and those providers are kept
loaded for the duration of the application execution.
.SH "LIBRARY CONTEXTS"
.IX Header "LIBRARY CONTEXTS"
Many OpenSSL API functions make use of a library context. A library context can
be thought of as a "scope" within which configuration options take effect. When
a provider is loaded, it is only loaded within the scope of a given library
context. In this way it is possible for different components of a complex
application to each use a different library context and have different providers
loaded with different configuration settings.
.PP
If an application does not explicitly create a library context then the
"default" library context will be used.
.PP
Library contexts are represented by the \fBOSSL_LIB_CTX\fR type. Many OpenSSL API
functions take a library context as a parameter. Applications can always pass
\&\fBNULL\fR for this parameter to just use the default library context.
.PP
The default library context is automatically created the first time it is
needed. This will automatically load any available configuration file and will
initialise OpenSSL for use. Unlike in earlier versions of OpenSSL (prior to
1.1.0) no explicit initialisation steps need to be taken.
.PP
Similarly when the application exits, the default library context is
automatically destroyed. No explicit de-initialisation steps need to be taken.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_LIB_CTX\fR\|(3) for more information about library contexts.
See also "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in \fBossl\-guide\-libcrypto\-introduction\fR\|(7).
.SH "PROPERTY QUERY STRINGS"
.IX Header "PROPERTY QUERY STRINGS"
In some cases the available providers may mean that more than one implementation
of any given algorithm might be available. For example the OpenSSL FIPS provider
supplies alternative implementations of many of the same algorithms that are
available in the OpenSSL default provider.
.PP
The process of selecting an algorithm implementation is known as "fetching".
When OpenSSL fetches an algorithm to use it is possible to specify a "property
query string" to guide the selection process. For example a property query
string of "provider=default" could be used to force the selection to only
consider algorithm implementations in the default provider.
.PP
Property query strings can be specified explicitly as an argument to a function.
It is also possible to specify a default property query string for the whole
library context using the \fBEVP_set_default_properties\fR\|(3) or
\&\fBEVP_default_properties_enable_fips\fR\|(3) functions. Where both
default properties and function specific properties are specified then they are
combined. Function specific properties will override default properties where
there is a conflict.
.PP
See "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in \fBossl\-guide\-libcrypto\-introduction\fR\|(7) for more
information about fetching. See \fBproperty\fR\|(7) for more information about
properties.
.SH "MULTI-THREADED APPLICATIONS"
.IX Header "MULTI-THREADED APPLICATIONS"
As long as OpenSSL has been built with support for threads (the default case
on most platforms) then most OpenSSL \fIfunctions\fR are thread-safe in the sense
that it is safe to call the same function from multiple threads at the same
time. However most OpenSSL \fIdata structures\fR are not thread-safe. For example
the \fBBIO_write\fR\|(3) and \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3) functions are thread safe. However it
would not be thread safe to call \fBBIO_write()\fR from one thread while calling
\&\fBBIO_read()\fR in another where both functions are passed the same \fBBIO\fR object
since both of them may attempt to make changes to the same \fBBIO\fR object.
.PP
There are exceptions to these rules. A small number of functions are not thread
safe at all. Where this is the case this restriction should be noted in the
documentation for the function. Similarly some data structures may be partially
or fully thread safe. For example it is always safe to use an \fBOSSL_LIB_CTX\fR in
multiple threads.
.PP
See \fBopenssl\-threads\fR\|(7) for a more detailed discussion on OpenSSL threading
support.
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.IX Header "ERROR HANDLING"
Most OpenSSL functions will provide a return value indicating whether the
function has been successful or not. It is considered best practice to always
check the return value from OpenSSL functions (where one is available).
.PP
Most functions that return a pointer value will return NULL in the event of a
failure.
.PP
Most functions that return an integer value will return a positive integer for
success. Some of these functions will return 0 to indicate failure. Others may
return 0 or a negative value for failure.
.PP
Some functions cannot fail and have a \fBvoid\fR return type. There are also a
small number of functions that do not conform to the above conventions (e.g.
they may return 0 to indicate success).
.PP
Due to the above variations in behaviour it is important to check the
documentation for each function for information about how to interpret the
return value for it.
.PP
It is sometimes necessary to get further information about the cause of a
failure (e.g. for debugging or logging purposes). Many (but not all) functions
will add further information about a failure to the OpenSSL error stack. By
using the error stack you can find out information such as a reason code/string
for the error as well as the exact file and source line within OpenSSL that
emitted the error.
.PP
OpenSSL supplies a set of error handling functions to query the error stack. See
\&\fBERR_get_error\fR\|(3) for information about the functions available for querying
error data. Also see \fBERR_print_errors\fR\|(3) for information on some simple
helper functions for printing error data. Finally look at \fBERR_clear_error\fR\|(3)
for how to clear old errors from the error stack.
.SH "OPENSSL PROVIDERS"
.IX Header "OPENSSL PROVIDERS"
OpenSSL comes with a set of providers.
.PP
The algorithms available in each of these providers may vary due to build time
configuration options. The \fBopenssl\-list\fR\|(1) command can be used to list the
currently available algorithms.
.PP
The names of the algorithms shown from \fBopenssl\-list\fR\|(1) can be used as an
algorithm identifier to the appropriate fetching function. Also see the provider
specific manual pages linked below for further details about using the
algorithms available in each of the providers.
.PP
As well as the OpenSSL providers third parties can also implement providers.
For information on writing a provider see \fBprovider\fR\|(7).
.SS "Default provider"
.IX Subsection "Default provider"
The default provider is built-in as part of the \fIlibcrypto\fR library and
contains all of the most commonly used algorithm implementations. Should it be
needed (if other providers are loaded and offer implementations of the same
algorithms), the property query string "provider=default" can be used as a
search criterion for these implementations.  The default provider includes all
of the functionality in the base provider below.
.PP
If you don't load any providers at all then the "default" provider will be
automatically loaded. If you explicitly load any provider then the "default"
provider would also need to be explicitly loaded if it is required.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_PROVIDER\-default\fR\|(7).
.SS "Base provider"
.IX Subsection "Base provider"
The base provider is built in as part of the \fIlibcrypto\fR library and contains
algorithm implementations for encoding and decoding of OpenSSL keys.
Should it be needed (if other providers are loaded and offer
implementations of the same algorithms), the property query string
"provider=base" can be used as a search criterion for these implementations.
Some encoding and decoding algorithm implementations are not FIPS algorithm
implementations in themselves but support algorithms from the FIPS provider and
are allowed for use in "FIPS mode". The property query string "fips=yes" can be
used to select such algorithms.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_PROVIDER\-base\fR\|(7).
.SS "FIPS provider"
.IX Subsection "FIPS provider"
The FIPS provider is a dynamically loadable module, and must therefore
be loaded explicitly, either in code or through OpenSSL configuration
(see \fBconfig\fR\|(5)). It contains algorithm implementations that have been
validated according to FIPS standards. Should it be needed (if other
providers are loaded and offer implementations of the same algorithms), the
property query string "provider=fips" can be used as a search criterion for
these implementations. All approved algorithm implementations in the FIPS
provider can also be selected with the property "fips=yes". The FIPS provider
may also contain non-approved algorithm implementations and these can be
selected with the property "fips=no".
.PP
Typically the "Base provider" will also need to be loaded because the FIPS
provider does not support the encoding or decoding of keys.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_PROVIDER\-FIPS\fR\|(7) and \fBfips_module\fR\|(7).
.SS "Legacy provider"
.IX Subsection "Legacy provider"
The legacy provider is a dynamically loadable module, and must therefore
be loaded explicitly, either in code or through OpenSSL configuration
(see \fBconfig\fR\|(5)). It contains algorithm implementations that are considered
insecure, or are no longer in common use such as MD2 or RC4. Should it be needed
(if other providers are loaded and offer implementations of the same algorithms),
the property "provider=legacy" can be used as a search criterion for these
implementations.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_PROVIDER\-legacy\fR\|(7).
.SS "Null provider"
.IX Subsection "Null provider"
The null provider is built in as part of the \fIlibcrypto\fR library. It contains
no algorithms in it at all. When fetching algorithms the default provider will
be automatically loaded if no other provider has been explicitly loaded. To
prevent that from happening you can explicitly load the null provider.
.PP
You can use this if you create your own library context and want to ensure that
all API calls have correctly passed the created library context and are not
accidentally using the default library context. Load the null provider into the
default library context so that the default library context has no algorithm
implementations available.
.PP
See \fBOSSL_PROVIDER\-null\fR\|(7).
.SH CONFIGURATION
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
By default OpenSSL will load a configuration file when it is first used. This
will set up various configuration settings within the default library context.
Applications that create their own library contexts may optionally configure
them with a config file using the \fBOSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config\fR\|(3) function.
.PP
The configuration file can be used to automatically load providers and set up
default property query strings.
.PP
For information on the OpenSSL configuration file format see \fBconfig\fR\|(5).
.SH "LIBRARY CONVENTIONS"
.IX Header "LIBRARY CONVENTIONS"
Many OpenSSL functions that "get" or "set" a value follow a naming convention
using the numbers \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR, i.e. "get0", "get1", "set0" and "set1". This
can also apply to some functions that "add" a value to an existing set, i.e.
"add0" and "add1".
.PP
For example the functions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& int X509_CRL_add0_revoked(X509_CRL *crl, X509_REVOKED *rev);
\& int X509_add1_trust_object(X509 *x, const ASN1_OBJECT *obj);
.Ve
.PP
In the \fB0\fR version the ownership of the object is passed to (for an add or set)
or retained by (for a get) the parent object. For example after calling the
\&\fBX509_CRL_add0_revoked()\fR function above, ownership of the \fIrev\fR object is passed
to the \fIcrl\fR object. Therefore, after calling this function \fIrev\fR should not
be freed directly. It will be freed implicitly when \fIcrl\fR is freed.
.PP
In the \fB1\fR version the ownership of the object is not passed to or retained by
the parent object. Instead a copy or "up ref" of the object is performed. So
after calling the \fBX509_add1_trust_object()\fR function above the application will
still be responsible for freeing the \fIobj\fR value where appropriate.
.PP
Many OpenSSL functions conform to a naming convention of the form
\&\fBCLASSNAME_func_name()\fR. In this naming convention the \fBCLASSNAME\fR is the name
of an OpenSSL data structure (given in capital letters) that the function is
primarily operating on. The \fBfunc_name\fR portion of the name is usually in
lowercase letters and indicates the purpose of the function.
.SH "DEMO APPLICATIONS"
.IX Header "DEMO APPLICATIONS"
OpenSSL is distributed with a set of demo applications which provide some
examples of how to use the various API functions. To look at them download the
OpenSSL source code from the OpenSSL website
(<https://www.openssl.org/source/>). Extract the downloaded \fB.tar.gz\fR file for
the version of OpenSSL that you are using and look at the various files in the
\&\fBdemos\fR sub-directory.
.PP
The Makefiles in the subdirectories give instructions on how to build and run
the demo applications.
.SH "FURTHER READING"
.IX Header "FURTHER READING"

using \f(CW\*(C`libcrypto\*(C'\fR and \fBossl\-guide\-libssl\-introduction\fR\|(7) for more information
