.SH NAME
life_cycle\-kdf \- The KDF algorithm life\-cycle
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All key derivation functions (KDFs) and pseudo random functions (PRFs)
go through a number of stages in their life-cycle:
.IP start 4
.IX Item "start"
This state represents the KDF/PRF before it has been allocated.  It is the
starting state for any life-cycle transitions.
.IP newed 4
.IX Item "newed"
This state represents the KDF/PRF after it has been allocated.
.IP deriving 4
.IX Item "deriving"
This state represents the KDF/PRF when it is set up and capable of generating
output.
.IP freed 4
.IX Item "freed"
This state is entered when the KDF/PRF is freed.  It is the terminal state
for all life-cycle transitions.
.SS "State Transition Diagram"
.IX Subsection "State Transition Diagram"
The usual life-cycle of a KDF/PRF is illustrated:
