.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBSSL_get_stream_id()\fR function returns the QUIC stream ID for a QUIC stream
SSL object, or for a QUIC connection SSL object which has a default stream
attached.
.PP
The \fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR function identifies what operations can be performed
on the stream, and returns one of the following values:
.IP \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE"
The SSL object is a QUIC connection SSL object without a default stream
attached.
.IP \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI"
The SSL object is a non-QUIC SSL object, or is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC
connection SSL object with a default stream attached), and that stream is a
bidirectional QUIC stream.
.IP \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ"
The SSL object is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object with a
default stream attached), and that stream is a unidirectional QUIC stream which
was initiated by the remote peer; thus, it can be read from, but not written to.
.IP \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE"
The SSL object is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object with a
default stream attached), and that stream is a unidirectional QUIC stream which
was initiated by the local application; thus, it can be written to, but not read
from.
.PP
The \fBSSL_is_stream_local()\fR function determines whether a stream was locally
created.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
While QUICv1 assigns specific meaning to the low two bits of a QUIC stream ID,
QUIC stream IDs in future versions of QUIC are not required to have the same
semantics. Do not determine stream properties using these bits. Instead, use
\&\fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR to determine the stream type and \fBSSL_get_stream_is_local()\fR
to determine the stream initiator.
.PP
The \fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR identifies the type of a QUIC stream based on its
identity, and does not indicate whether an operation can currently be
successfully performed on a stream. For example, you might locally initiate a
unidirectional stream, write to it, and then conclude the stream using
\&\fBSSL_stream_conclude\fR\|(3), meaning that it can no longer be written to, but
\&\fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR would still return \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE\fR. The value
returned by \fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR does not vary over the lifespan of a stream.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_get_stream_id()\fR returns a QUIC stream ID, or \fBUINT64_MAX\fR if called on an
SSL object which is not a QUIC SSL object, or if called on a QUIC connection SSL
object without a default stream attached. Note that valid QUIC stream IDs are
always below 2**62.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_stream_type()\fR returns one of the \fBSSL_STREAM_TYPE\fR values.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_is_stream_local()\fR returns 1 if called on a QUIC stream SSL object which
represents a stream which was locally initiated. It returns 0 if called on a
QUIC stream SSL object which represents a stream which was remotely initiated by
a peer, and \-1 if called on any other kind of SSL object.
