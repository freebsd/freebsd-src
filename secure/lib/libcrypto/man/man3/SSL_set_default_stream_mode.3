.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A QUIC connection SSL object may have a default stream attached to it. A default
stream is a QUIC stream to which calls to \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) and \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3)
made on a QUIC connection SSL object are redirected. Default stream handling
allows legacy applications to use QUIC similarly to a traditional TLS
connection.
.PP
When not disabled, a default stream is automatically created on an outgoing
connection once \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) or \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) is called.
.PP
A QUIC stream must be explicitly designated as client-initiated or
server-initiated up front. This broadly corresponds to whether an application
protocol involves the client transmitting first, or the server transmitting
first. As such, if \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) is called first (before any call to
\&\fBSSL_write\fR\|(3))  after establishing a connection, OpenSSL will wait for the
server to open the first server-initiated stream, and then bind this as the
default stream. Conversely, if \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) is called before any call to
\&\fBSSL_read\fR\|(3), OpenSSL assumes the client wishes to transmit first, creates a
client-initiated stream, and binds this as the default stream.
.PP
By default, the default stream created is bidirectional. If a unidirectional
stream is desired, or if the application wishes to disable default stream
functionality, \fBSSL_set_default_stream_mode()\fR (discussed below) can be used to
accomplish this.
.PP
When a QUIC connection SSL object has no default stream currently associated
with it, for example because default stream functionality was disabled, calls to
functions which require a stream on the QUIC connection SSL object (for example,
\&\fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) and \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3)) will fail.
.PP
It is recommended that new applications and applications which rely on multiple
streams forego use of the default stream functionality, which is intended for
legacy applications.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_set_default_stream_mode()\fR can be used to configure or disable default stream
handling. It can only be called on a QUIC connection SSL object prior to any
default stream being created. If used, it is recommended to call it immediately
after calling \fBSSL_new\fR\|(3), prior to initiating a connection. The argument
\&\fImode\fR may be one of the following options:
.IP SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_BIDI 4
.IX Item "SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_BIDI"
This is the default setting. If \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) is called prior to any call to
\&\fBSSL_read\fR\|(3), a bidirectional client-initiated stream is created and bound as
the default stream. If \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) is called prior to any call to
\&\fBSSL_write\fR\|(3), OpenSSL waits for an incoming stream from the peer (causing
\&\fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) to block if the connection is in blocking mode), and then binds
that stream as the default stream. Note that this incoming stream may be either
bidirectional or unidirectional; thus, this setting does not guarantee the
presence of a bidirectional stream when \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) is called first. To
determine the type of a stream after a call to \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3), use
\&\fBSSL_get_stream_type\fR\|(3).
.IP SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_UNI 4
.IX Item "SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_UNI"
In this mode, if \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) is called prior to any call to \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3),
a unidirectional client-initiated stream is created and bound as the default
stream. The behaviour is otherwise identical to that of
\&\fBSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_BIDI\fR. The behaviour when \fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) is
called prior to any call to \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) is unchanged.
.IP SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE 4
.IX Item "SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE"
Default stream creation is inhibited. This is the recommended mode of operation.
\&\fBSSL_read\fR\|(3) and \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) calls cannot be made on the QUIC connection
SSL object directly. You must obtain streams using \fBSSL_new_stream\fR\|(3) or
\&\fBSSL_accept_stream\fR\|(3) in order to communicate with the peer.
.PP
A default stream will not be automatically created on a QUIC connection SSL
object if the default stream mode is set to \fBSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE\fR.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_set_incoming_stream_policy\fR\|(3) interacts significantly with the default
stream functionality.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_set_default_stream_mode()\fR returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_set_default_stream_mode()\fR fails if it is called after a default stream has
already been established.
.PP
These functions fail if called on a QUIC stream SSL object or on a non-QUIC SSL
object.
