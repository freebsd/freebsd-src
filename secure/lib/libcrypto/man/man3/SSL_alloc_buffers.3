.SH NAME
SSL_free_buffers, SSL_alloc_buffers \- manage SSL structure buffers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_free_buffers(SSL *ssl);
\& int SSL_alloc_buffers(SSL *ssl);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_free_buffers()\fR frees the read and write buffers of the given \fBssl\fR.
\&\fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR allocates the read and write buffers of the given \fBssl\fR.
.PP
The \fBSSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS\fR mode releases read or write buffers whenever
the buffers have been drained. These functions allow applications to manually
control when buffers are freed and allocated.
.PP
After freeing the buffers, the buffers are automatically reallocated upon a
new read or write. The \fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR does not need to be called, but
can be used to make sure the buffers are preallocated. This can be used to
avoid allocation during data processing or with \fBCRYPTO_set_mem_functions()\fR
to control where and how buffers are allocated.
.PP
These functions are no-ops when used with QUIC SSL objects. For QUIC,
\&\fBSSL_free_buffers()\fR always fails, and \fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR always succeeds.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The following return values can occur:
.IP "0 (Failure)" 4
.IX Item "0 (Failure)"
The \fBSSL_free_buffers()\fR function returns 0 when there is pending data to be
read or written. The \fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR function returns 0 when there is
an allocation failure.
.IP "1 (Success)" 4
.IX Item "1 (Success)"
The \fBSSL_free_buffers()\fR function returns 1 if the buffers have been freed. This
value is also returned if the buffers had been freed before calling
\&\fBSSL_free_buffers()\fR.
The \fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR function returns 1 if the buffers have been allocated.
This value is also returned if the buffers had been allocated before calling
\&\fBSSL_alloc_buffers()\fR.
