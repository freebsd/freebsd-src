.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR is a BIO implementation designed for use with network sockets
which provide datagram semantics, such as UDP sockets. It is suitable for use
with DTLSv1 or QUIC.
.PP
Because \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR has datagram semantics, a single \fBBIO_write()\fR call sends
a single datagram and a single \fBBIO_read()\fR call receives a single datagram. If
the size of the buffer passed to \fBBIO_read()\fR is inadequate, the datagram is
silently truncated.
.PP
For a memory-based BIO which provides datagram semantics identical to those of
\&\fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR, see \fBBIO_s_dgram_pair\fR\|(3).
.PP
This BIO supports the \fBBIO_sendmmsg\fR\|(3) and \fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3) functions.
.PP
When using \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR, it is important to note that:
.IP \(bu 4
This BIO can be used with either a connected or unconnected network socket. A
connected socket is a network socket which has had \fBBIO_connect\fR\|(3) or a
similar OS-specific function called on it. Such a socket can only receive
datagrams from the specified peer. Any other socket is an unconnected socket and
can receive datagrams from any host.
.IP \(bu 4
Despite their naming,
neither \fBBIO_ctrl_dgram_connect()\fR nor \fBBIO_ctrl_set_connected()\fR cause a socket
to become connected. These controls are provided to indicate to the BIO how
the underlying socket is configured and how it is to be used; see below.
.IP \(bu 4
Use of \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR with an unconnected network socket is hazardous hecause
any successful call to \fBBIO_read()\fR results in the peer address used for any
subsequent call to \fBBIO_write()\fR being set to the source address of the datagram
received by that call to \fBBIO_read()\fR. Thus, unless the caller calls
\&\fBBIO_dgram_set_peer()\fR immediately prior to every call to \fBBIO_write()\fR, or never
calls \fBBIO_read()\fR, any host on the network may cause future datagrams written to
be redirected to that host. Therefore, it is recommended that users either use
\&\fBBIO_s_dgram()\fR only with a connected socket, or, if using \fBBIO_s_dgram()\fR with an
unconnected socket, to use the \fBBIO_sendmmsg\fR\|(3) and \fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3) methods
only and forego use of \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3) and \fBBIO_write\fR\|(3). An exception is where
\&\fBDTLSv1_listen\fR\|(3) must be used; see \fBDTLSv1_listen\fR\|(3) for further
discussion.
.IP \(bu 4
Unlike \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3) and \fBBIO_write\fR\|(3), the \fBBIO_sendmmsg\fR\|(3) and
\&\fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3) methods are stateless and do not cause the internal state of
the \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR to change.
.PP
Various controls are available for configuring the \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR using
\&\fBBIO_ctrl\fR\|(3):
.IP "BIO_ctrl_dgram_connect (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_CONNECT)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_ctrl_dgram_connect (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_CONNECT)"
This is equivalent to calling \fBBIO_dgram_set_peer\fR\|(3).
.Sp
Despite its name, this function does not cause the underlying socket to become
connected.
.IP "BIO_ctrl_set_connected (BIO_CTRL_SET_CONNECTED)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_ctrl_set_connected (BIO_CTRL_SET_CONNECTED)"
This informs the \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR whether the underlying socket has been
connected, and therefore how the \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR should attempt to use the
socket.
.Sp
If the \fIpeer\fR argument is non-NULL, \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR assumes that the
underlying socket has been connected and will attempt to use the socket using OS
APIs which do not specify peer addresses (for example, \fBsend\fR\|(3) and \fBrecv\fR\|(3) or
similar). The \fIpeer\fR argument should specify the peer address to which the socket
is connected.
.Sp
If the \fIpeer\fR argument is NULL, \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR assumes that the underlying
socket is not connected and will attempt to use the socket using an OS APIs
which specify peer addresses (for example, \fBsendto\fR\|(3) and \fBrecvfrom\fR\|(3)).
.Sp
This control does not affect the operation of \fBBIO_sendmmsg\fR\|(3) or
\&\fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3).
.IP "BIO_dgram_get_peer (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_PEER)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_get_peer (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_PEER)"
This outputs a \fBBIO_ADDR\fR which specifies one of the following values,
whichever happened most recently:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 4
The peer address last passed to \fBBIO_dgram_set_peer()\fR, \fBBIO_ctrl_dgram_connect()\fR
or \fBBIO_ctrl_set_connected()\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
The peer address of the datagram last received by a call to \fBBIO_read()\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "BIO_dgram_set_peer (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_PEER)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_set_peer (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_PEER)"
Sets the peer address to be used for subsequent writes to this BIO.
.Sp
Warning: When used with an unconnected network socket, the value set may be
modified by future calls to \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3), making use of \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR
hazardous when used with unconnected network sockets; see above.
.Sp
This does not affect the operation of \fBBIO_sendmmsg\fR\|(3).
\&\fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3) does not affect the value set by \fBBIO_dgram_set_peer()\fR.
.IP "BIO_dgram_detect_peer_addr (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_DETECT_PEER_ADDR)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_detect_peer_addr (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_DETECT_PEER_ADDR)"
This is similar to \fBBIO_dgram_get_peer()\fR except that if the peer address has not
been set on the BIO object, an OS call such as \fBgetpeername\fR\|(2) will be attempted
to try and autodetect the peer address to which the underlying socket is
connected. Other BIOs may also implement this control if they are capable of
sensing a peer address, without necessarily also implementing
\&\fBBIO_dgram_set_peer()\fR and \fBBIO_dgram_get_peer()\fR.
.IP "BIO_dgram_recv_timeout (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_RECV_TIMER_EXP)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_recv_timeout (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_RECV_TIMER_EXP)"
Returns 1 if the last I/O operation performed on the BIO (for example, via a
call to \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3)) may have been caused by a receive timeout.
.IP "BIO_dgram_send_timedout (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_SEND_TIMER_EXP)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_send_timedout (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_SEND_TIMER_EXP)"
Returns 1 if the last I/O operation performed on the BIO (for example, via a
call to \fBBIO_write\fR\|(3)) may have been caused by a send timeout.
.IP "BIO_dgram_get_mtu_overhead (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_MTU_OVERHEAD)" 4
.IX Item "BIO_dgram_get_mtu_overhead (BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_MTU_OVERHEAD)"
Returns a quantity in bytes which is a rough estimate of the number of bytes of
overhead which should typically be added to a datagram payload size in order to
estimate the final size of the Layer 3 (e.g. IP) packet which will contain the
datagram. In most cases, the maximum datagram payload size which can be
transmitted can be determined by determining the link MTU in bytes and
subtracting the value returned by this call.
.Sp
The value returned by this call depends on the network layer protocol being
used.
.Sp
The value returned is not fully reliable because datagram overheads can be
higher in atypical network configurations, for example where IPv6 extension
headers or IPv4 options are used.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_DONT_FRAG 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_DONT_FRAG"
If \fInum\fR is nonzero, configures the underlying network socket to enable Don't
Fragment mode, in which datagrams will be set with the IP Don't Fragment (DF)
bit set. If \fInum\fR is zero, Don't Fragment mode is disabled.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_QUERY_MTU 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_QUERY_MTU"
Queries the OS for its assessment of the Path MTU for the destination to which
the underlying network socket, and returns that Path MTU in bytes. This control
can only be used with a connected socket.
.Sp
This is not supported on all platforms and depends on OS support being
available. Returns 0 on failure.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_MTU_DISCOVER 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_MTU_DISCOVER"
This control requests that Path MTU discovery be enabled on the underlying
network socket.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_FALLBACK_MTU 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_FALLBACK_MTU"
Returns the estimated minimum size of datagram payload which should always be
supported on the BIO. This size is determined by the minimum MTU required to be
supported by the applicable underlying network layer. Use of datagrams of this
size may lead to suboptimal performance, but should be routable in all
circumstances. The value returned is the datagram payload size in bytes and does
not include the size of layer 3 or layer 4 protocol headers.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_MTU_EXCEEDED 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_MTU_EXCEEDED"
Returns 1 if the last attempted write to the BIO failed due to the size of the
attempted write exceeding the applicable MTU.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_NEXT_TIMEOUT 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_NEXT_TIMEOUT"
Accepts a pointer to a \fBstruct timeval\fR. If the time specified is zero,
disables receive timeouts. Otherwise, configures the specified time interval as
the receive timeout for the socket for the purposes of future \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3)
calls.
.IP BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_PEEK_MODE 4
.IX Item "BIO_CTRL_DGRAM_SET_PEEK_MODE"
If \fBnum\fR is nonzero, enables peek mode; otherwise, disables peek mode. Where
peek mode is enabled, calls to \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3) read datagrams from the underlying
network socket in peek mode, meaning that a future call to \fBBIO_read\fR\|(3) will
yield the same datagram until peek mode is disabled.
.Sp
\&\fBBIO_recvmmsg\fR\|(3) is not affected by this control.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_new_dgram()\fR is a helper function which instantiates a \fBBIO_s_datagram()\fR and
sets the BIO to use the socket given in \fIfd\fR by calling \fBBIO_set_fd()\fR.
