X509_add_cert,

X509 certificate list addition functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/x509.h>
\&
\& int X509_add_cert(STACK_OF(X509) *sk, X509 *cert, int flags);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBX509_add_cert()\fR adds a certificate \fIcert\fR to the given list \fIsk\fR.
It is an error for the \fIcert\fR argument to be NULL.
.PP
\&\fBX509_add_certs()\fR adds a list of certificate \fIcerts\fR to the given list \fIsk\fR.
The \fIcerts\fR argument may be NULL, which implies no effect.
It does not modify the list \fIcerts\fR but
in case the \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF\fR flag (described below) is set
the reference counters of those of its members added to \fIsk\fR are increased.
.PP
Both these functions have a \fIflags\fR parameter,
which is used to control details of the operation.
.PP
The value \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_DEFAULT\fR, which equals 0, means no special semantics.
.PP
If \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF\fR is set then
the reference counts of those certificates added successfully are increased.
.PP
If \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_PREPEND\fR is set then the certificates are prepended to \fIsk\fR.
By default they are appended to \fIsk\fR.
In both cases the original order of the added certificates is preserved.
.PP
If \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_NO_DUP\fR is set then certificates already contained in \fIsk\fR,
which is determined using \fBX509_cmp\fR\|(3), are ignored.
.PP
If \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_NO_SS\fR is set then certificates that are marked self-signed,
which is determined using \fBX509_self_signed\fR\|(3), are ignored.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
Both functions return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
If \fBX509_add_certs()\fR is used with the flags \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_NO_DUP\fR or
\&\fBX509_ADD_FLAG_NO_SS\fR it is advisable to use also \fBX509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF\fR
because otherwise likely not for all members of the \fIcerts\fR list
the ownership is transferred to the list of certificates \fIsk\fR.
.PP
Care should also be taken in case the \fIcerts\fR argument equals \fIsk\fR.
