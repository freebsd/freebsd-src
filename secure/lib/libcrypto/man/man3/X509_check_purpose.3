.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBX509_check_purpose()\fR checks if certificate \fIx\fR was created with the purpose
represented by \fIid\fR. If \fIca\fR is nonzero, then certificate \fIx\fR is
checked to determine if it's a possible CA with various levels of certainty
possibly returned. The certificate \fIx\fR must be a complete certificate
otherwise the function returns an error.
.PP
Below are the potential ID's that can be checked:

.PP
The checks performed take into account the X.509 extensions
keyUsage, extendedKeyUsage, and basicConstraints.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_count()\fR returns the number of currently defined purposes.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id()\fR returns the smallest purpose id not yet used,
which is guaranteed to be unique and larger than \fBX509_PURPOSE_MAX\fR.
The \fIlibctx\fR parameter should be used to provide the library context.
It is currently ignored as the purpose mapping table is global.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_by_sname()\fR returns the index of
the purpose with the given short name or \-1 if not found.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_by_id()\fR returns the index of
the purpose with the given id or \-1 if not found.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_add()\fR adds or modifies a purpose entry identified by \fIsname\fR.
Unless the id stays the same for an existing entry, \fIid\fR must be fresh,
which can be achieved by using the result of \fBX509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id()\fR.
The function also sets in the entry the trust id \fItrust\fR, the given \fIflags\fR,
the purpose (long) name \fIname\fR, the short name \fIsname\fR, the purpose checking
function \fIck\fR of type \fBint (*) (const X509_PURPOSE *, const X509 *, int)\fR,
and its user data \fIarg\fR which may be retrieved via the \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR pointer.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_cleanup()\fR removes all purposes that are not pre-defined.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get0()\fR returns an \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR pointer or NULL on error.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_id()\fR returns the id of the given \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR structure.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get0_name()\fR returns the (long) name of the given \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get0_sname()\fR returns the short name of the given \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_trust()\fR returns the trust id of the given \fBX509_PURPOSE\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_set()\fR assigns the given \fIpurpose\fR id to the location pointed at by
\&\fIp\fR.
This resets to the any purpose if \fIpurpose\fR is \fBX509_PURPOSE_DEFAULT_ANY\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBX509_check_purpose()\fR returns the following values.
For non-CA checks

.IX Header "BUGS"
The X509_PURPOSE implementation so far is not thread-safe.
There may be race conditions retrieving purpose information while

.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id()\fR was added in OpensSL 3.5.
