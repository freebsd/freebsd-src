.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBBIO_f_cipher()\fR returns the cipher BIO method. This is a filter
BIO that encrypts any data written through it, and decrypts any data
read from it. It is a BIO wrapper for the cipher routines
\&\fBEVP_CipherInit()\fR, \fBEVP_CipherUpdate()\fR and \fBEVP_CipherFinal()\fR.
.PP
Cipher BIOs do not support \fBBIO_gets()\fR or \fBBIO_puts()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_flush()\fR on an encryption BIO that is being written through is
used to signal that no more data is to be encrypted: this is used
to flush and possibly pad the final block through the BIO.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_cipher()\fR sets the cipher of BIO \fBb\fR to \fBcipher\fR using key \fBkey\fR
and IV \fBiv\fR. \fBenc\fR should be set to 1 for encryption and zero for
decryption.
.PP
When reading from an encryption BIO the final block is automatically
decrypted and checked when EOF is detected. \fBBIO_get_cipher_status()\fR
is a \fBBIO_ctrl()\fR macro which can be called to determine whether the
decryption operation was successful.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_cipher_ctx()\fR is a \fBBIO_ctrl()\fR macro which retrieves the internal
BIO cipher context. The retrieved context can be used in conjunction
with the standard cipher routines to set it up. This is useful when
\&\fBBIO_set_cipher()\fR is not flexible enough for the applications needs.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
When encrypting \fBBIO_flush()\fR \fBmust\fR be called to flush the final block
through the BIO. If it is not then the final block will fail a subsequent
decrypt.
.PP
When decrypting an error on the final block is signaled by a zero
return value from the read operation. A successful decrypt followed
by EOF will also return zero for the final read. \fBBIO_get_cipher_status()\fR
should be called to determine if the decrypt was successful.
.PP
As always, if \fBBIO_gets()\fR or \fBBIO_puts()\fR support is needed then it can
be achieved by preceding the cipher BIO with a buffering BIO.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBBIO_f_cipher()\fR returns the cipher BIO method.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_cipher()\fR returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_cipher_status()\fR returns 1 for a successful decrypt and <=0
for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_cipher_ctx()\fR returns 1 for success and <=0 for failure.
