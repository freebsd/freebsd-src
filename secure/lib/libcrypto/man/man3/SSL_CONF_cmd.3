.SH NAME
SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type,
SSL_CONF_cmd \- send configuration command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_CONF_cmd(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option, const char *value);
\& int SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The function \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR performs configuration operation \fBoption\fR with
optional parameter \fBvalue\fR on \fBctx\fR. Its purpose is to simplify application
configuration of \fBSSL_CTX\fR or \fBSSL\fR structures by providing a common
framework for command line options or configuration files.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()\fR returns the type of value that \fBoption\fR refers to.
.SH "SUPPORTED COMMAND LINE COMMANDS"
.IX Header "SUPPORTED COMMAND LINE COMMANDS"
Currently supported \fBoption\fR names for command lines (i.e. when the
flag \fBSSL_CONF_FLAG_CMDLINE\fR is set) are listed below. Note: all \fBoption\fR
names are case sensitive. Unless otherwise stated commands can be used by
both clients and servers and the \fBvalue\fR parameter is not used. The default
prefix for command line commands is \fB\-\fR and that is reflected below.
.IP \fB\-bugs\fR 4
.IX Item "-bugs"
Various bug workarounds are set, same as setting \fBSSL_OP_ALL\fR.
.IP \fB\-no_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_comp"
Disables support for SSL/TLS compression, same as setting
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION\fR.
As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, compression is off by default.
.IP \fB\-comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-comp"
Enables support for SSL/TLS compression, same as clearing
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION\fR.
This command was introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, compression is off by default. TLS compression can only be
used in security level 1 or lower. From OpenSSL 3.2.0 and above the default
security level is 2, so this option will have no effect without also changing
the security level. See \fBSSL_CTX_set_security_level\fR\|(3).
.IP \fB\-no_ticket\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_ticket"
Disables support for session tickets, same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_TICKET\fR.
.IP \fB\-serverpref\fR 4
.IX Item "-serverpref"
Use server and not client preference order when determining which cipher suite,
signature algorithm or elliptic curve to use for an incoming connection.
Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE\fR. Only used by servers.
.IP \fB\-client_renegotiation\fR 4
.IX Item "-client_renegotiation"
Allows servers to accept client-initiated renegotiation. Equivalent to
setting \fBSSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION\fR.
Only used by servers.
.IP \fB\-legacy_renegotiation\fR 4
.IX Item "-legacy_renegotiation"
Permits the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation. Equivalent to setting
\&\fBSSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION\fR.
.IP \fB\-no_renegotiation\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_renegotiation"
Disables all attempts at renegotiation in (D)TLSv1.2 and earlier, same as setting
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION\fR.
.IP \fB\-no_resumption_on_reneg\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_resumption_on_reneg"
Sets \fBSSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION\fR. Only used by servers.
.IP "\fB\-legacy_server_connect\fR, \fB\-no_legacy_server_connect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-legacy_server_connect, -no_legacy_server_connect"
Permits or prohibits the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation for OpenSSL
clients only. Equivalent to setting or clearing \fBSSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT\fR.
.IP \fB\-prioritize_chacha\fR 4
.IX Item "-prioritize_chacha"
Prioritize ChaCha ciphers when the client has a ChaCha20 cipher at the top of
its preference list. This usually indicates a client without AES hardware
acceleration (e.g. mobile) is in use. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA\fR.
Only used by servers. Requires \fB\-serverpref\fR.
.IP \fB\-allow_no_dhe_kex\fR 4
.IX Item "-allow_no_dhe_kex"
In TLSv1.3 allow a non\-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means
that there will be no forward secrecy for the resumed session.
.IP \fB\-prefer_no_dhe_kex\fR 4
.IX Item "-prefer_no_dhe_kex"
In TLSv1.3, on resumption let the server prefer a non\-(ec)dhe based key
exchange mode over an (ec)dhe based one. Requires \fB\-allow_no_dhe_kex\fR.
Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX\fR. Only used by servers.
.IP \fB\-strict\fR 4
.IX Item "-strict"
Enables strict mode protocol handling. Equivalent to setting
\&\fBSSL_CERT_FLAG_TLS_STRICT\fR.
.IP "\fB\-sigalgs\fR \fIalgs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sigalgs algs"
This sets the supported signature algorithms for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.
For clients this value is used directly for the supported signature
algorithms extension. For servers it is used to determine which signature
algorithms to support.
.Sp
The \fBalgs\fR argument should be a colon separated list of signature
algorithms in order of decreasing preference of the form \fBalgorithm+hash\fR
or \fBsignature_scheme\fR. For the default providers shipped with OpenSSL,
\&\fBalgorithm\fR is one of \fBRSA\fR, \fBDSA\fR or \fBECDSA\fR and
\&\fBhash\fR is a supported algorithm OID short name such as \fBSHA1\fR, \fBSHA224\fR,
\&\fBSHA256\fR, \fBSHA384\fR or \fBSHA512\fR.
\&\fBsignature_scheme\fR is one of the signature schemes defined
in TLSv1.3, specified using the IETF name, e.g., \fBecdsa_secp256r1_sha256\fR,
\&\fBed25519\fR, or \fBrsa_pss_pss_sha256\fR. Additional providers may make available
further algorithms via the TLS-SIGALG capability.
Signature scheme names and public key algorithm names (but not the hash names)
in the \fBalgorithm+hash\fR form are case-insensitive.
See \fBprovider\-base\fR\|(7).
.Sp
If this option is not set then all signature algorithms supported by all
activated providers are permissible.
.Sp
Note: algorithms which specify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (either by
using \fBRSA\fR as the \fBalgorithm\fR or by using one of the \fBrsa_pkcs1_*\fR
identifiers) are ignored in TLSv1.3 and will not be negotiated.
.IP "\fB\-client_sigalgs\fR \fIalgs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-client_sigalgs algs"
This sets the supported signature algorithms associated with client
authentication for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.  For servers the \fBalgs\fR is used
in the \fBsignature_algorithms\fR field of a \fBCertificateRequest\fR message.
For clients it is used to determine which signature algorithm to use with
the client certificate.  If a server does not request a certificate this
option has no effect.
.Sp
The syntax of \fBalgs\fR is identical to \fB\-sigalgs\fR. If not set, then the
value set for \fB\-sigalgs\fR will be used instead.
.IP "\fB\-groups\fR \fIgroups\fR" 4
.IX Item "-groups groups"
This sets the supported groups. For clients, the groups are sent using
the supported groups extension. For servers, it is used to determine which
group to use. This setting affects groups used for signatures (in TLSv1.2
and earlier) and key exchange.
.Sp
In its simplest form the \fIgroups\fR argument is a colon separated list of
groups.  The preferred names are those listed in the IANA
TLS Supported Groups <https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8>
registry.
.Sp
For some groups, OpenSSL supports additional aliases.
Such an alias could be a \fBNIST\fR name (e.g. \fBP\-256\fR), an OpenSSL OID name
(e.g. \fBprime256v1\fR), or some other commonly used name.
Group names are case-insensitive in OpenSSL 3.5 and later.
The list should be in order of preference with the most preferred group first.
.Sp
The first group listed will also be used for the \fBkey_share\fR sent by a client
in a TLSv1.3 \fBClientHello\fR.
.Sp
The commands below list the IANA names for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3,
respectively:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $ openssl list \-tls1_2 \-tls\-groups
\&    $ openssl list \-tls1_3 \-tls\-groups
.Ve
.Sp
The recommended groups (in order of decreasing performance) for TLS 1.3 are presently:
.Sp
\&\fBx25519\fR,
\&\fBsecp256r1\fR,
\&\fBx448\fR,
and
\&\fBsecp384r1\fR.
.Sp
The stronger security margins of the last two, come at a significant
performance penalty.
.Sp
An enriched alternative syntax, that enables clients to send multiple keyshares
and allows servers to prioritise some groups over others, is described in
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set1_groups_list\fR\|(3).
Since TLS 1.2 has neither keyshares nor a hello retry mechanism, with TLS 1.2
the enriched syntax is ultimately equivalent to just a simple ordered list of
groups, as with the simple form above.
.IP "\fB\-curves\fR \fIgroups\fR" 4
.IX Item "-curves groups"
This is a synonym for the \fB\-groups\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-named_curve\fR \fIcurve\fR" 4
.IX Item "-named_curve curve"
This sets the temporary curve used for ephemeral ECDH modes.
This is only applicable in TLS 1.0 and 1.1, and should not be used with later
protocol versions.
.Sp
The \fIcurve\fR argument is a curve name or the special value \fBauto\fR which
picks an appropriate curve based on client and server preferences. The
curve can be either the \fBNIST\fR name (e.g. \fBP\-256\fR) or an OpenSSL OID name
(e.g. \fBprime256v1\fR).
Even with TLS 1.0 and 1.1, the default value of \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR is strongly recommended
over choosing a specific curve.
Curve names are case-insensitive in OpenSSL 3.5 and later.
.IP \fB\-tx_cert_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-tx_cert_comp"
Enables support for sending TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.
.IP \fB\-no_tx_cert_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_tx_cert_comp"
Disables support for sending TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.
.IP \fB\-rx_cert_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-rx_cert_comp"
Enables support for receiving TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.
.IP \fB\-no_rx_cert_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_rx_cert_comp"
Disables support for receiving TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.
.IP \fB\-comp\fR 4
.IX Item "-comp"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-cipher\fR \fIciphers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cipher ciphers"
.PD
Sets the TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuite list to \fBciphers\fR. This list will be
combined with any configured TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Note: syntax checking
of \fBciphers\fR is currently not performed unless a \fBSSL\fR or \fBSSL_CTX\fR
structure is associated with \fBctx\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ciphersuites\fR \fI1.3ciphers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ciphersuites 1.3ciphers"
Sets the available ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 to value. This is a
colon-separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names in order of preference. This
list will be combined any configured TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites.
See \fBopenssl\-ciphers\fR\|(1) for more information.
.IP "\fB\-min_protocol\fR \fIminprot\fR, \fB\-max_protocol\fR \fImaxprot\fR" 4
.IX Item "-min_protocol minprot, -max_protocol maxprot"
Sets the minimum and maximum supported protocol.
Currently supported protocol values are \fBSSLv3\fR, \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR,
\&\fBTLSv1.2\fR, \fBTLSv1.3\fR for TLS; \fBDTLSv1\fR, \fBDTLSv1.2\fR for DTLS, and \fBNone\fR
for no limit.
If either the lower or upper bound is not specified then only the other bound
applies, if specified.
If your application supports both TLS and DTLS you can specify any of these
options twice, once with a bound for TLS and again with an appropriate bound
for DTLS.
To restrict the supported protocol versions use these commands rather than the
deprecated alternative commands below.
.IP "\fB\-record_padding\fR \fIpadding\fR" 4
.IX Item "-record_padding padding"
Controls use of TLSv1.3 record layer padding.  \fBpadding\fR is a string of the
form "number[,number]" where the (required) first number is the padding block
size (in octets) for application data, and the optional second number is the
padding block size for handshake and alert messages.  If the optional second
number is omitted, the same padding will be applied to all messages.
.Sp
Padding attempts to pad TLSv1.3 records so that they are a multiple of the set
length on send. A value of 0 or 1 turns off padding as relevant. Otherwise, the
values must be >1 or <=16384.
.IP \fB\-debug_broken_protocol\fR 4
.IX Item "-debug_broken_protocol"
Ignored.
.IP \fB\-no_middlebox\fR 4
.IX Item "-no_middlebox"
Turn off "middlebox compatibility", as described below.
.SS "Additional Options"
.IX Subsection "Additional Options"
The following options are accepted by \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR, but are not
processed by the OpenSSL commands.
.IP "\fB\-cert\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cert file"
Attempts to use \fBfile\fR as the certificate for the appropriate context. It
currently uses \fBSSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file()\fR if an \fBSSL_CTX\fR
structure is set or \fBSSL_use_certificate_file()\fR with filetype PEM if an
\&\fBSSL\fR structure is set. This option is only supported if certificate
operations are permitted.
.IP "\fB\-key\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-key file"
Attempts to use \fBfile\fR as the private key for the appropriate context. This
option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted. Note:
if no \fB\-key\fR option is set then a private key is not loaded unless the
flag \fBSSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE\fR is set.
.IP "\fB\-dhparam\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dhparam file"
Attempts to use \fBfile\fR as the set of temporary DH parameters for
the appropriate context. This option is only supported if certificate
operations are permitted.
.IP "\fB\-no_ssl3\fR, \fB\-no_tls1\fR, \fB\-no_tls1_1\fR, \fB\-no_tls1_2\fR, \fB\-no_tls1_3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_ssl3, -no_tls1, -no_tls1_1, -no_tls1_2, -no_tls1_3"
Disables protocol support for SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 by
setting the corresponding options \fBSSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\fR, \fBSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1\fR,
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1\fR, \fBSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2\fR and \fBSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_3\fR
respectively. These options are deprecated, use \fB\-min_protocol\fR and
\&\fB\-max_protocol\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-anti_replay\fR, \fB\-no_anti_replay\fR" 4
.IX Item "-anti_replay, -no_anti_replay"
Switches replay protection, on or off respectively. With replay protection on,
OpenSSL will automatically detect if a session ticket has been used more than
once, TLSv1.3 has been negotiated, and early data is enabled on the server. A
full handshake is forced if a session ticket is used a second or subsequent
time. Anti-Replay is on by default unless overridden by a configuration file and
is only used by servers. Anti-replay measures are required for compliance with
the TLSv1.3 specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay
risks in other ways and in such cases the built-in OpenSSL functionality is not
required. Switching off anti-replay is equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY\fR.
.SH "SUPPORTED CONFIGURATION FILE COMMANDS"
.IX Header "SUPPORTED CONFIGURATION FILE COMMANDS"
Currently supported \fBoption\fR names for configuration files (i.e., when the
flag \fBSSL_CONF_FLAG_FILE\fR is set) are listed below. All configuration file
\&\fBoption\fR names are case insensitive so \fBsignaturealgorithms\fR is recognised
as well as \fBSignatureAlgorithms\fR. Unless otherwise stated the \fBvalue\fR names
are also case insensitive.
.PP
Note: the command prefix (if set) alters the recognised \fBoption\fR values.
.IP \fBCipherString\fR 4
.IX Item "CipherString"
Sets the ciphersuite list for TLSv1.2 and below to \fBvalue\fR. This list will be
combined with any configured TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Note: syntax
checking of \fBvalue\fR is currently not performed unless an \fBSSL\fR or \fBSSL_CTX\fR
structure is associated with \fBctx\fR.
.IP \fBCiphersuites\fR 4
.IX Item "Ciphersuites"
Sets the available ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 to \fBvalue\fR. This is a
colon-separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names in order of preference. This
list will be combined any configured TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites.
See \fBopenssl\-ciphers\fR\|(1) for more information.
.IP \fBCertificate\fR 4
.IX Item "Certificate"
Attempts to use the file \fBvalue\fR as the certificate for the appropriate
context. It currently uses \fBSSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file()\fR if an \fBSSL_CTX\fR
structure is set or \fBSSL_use_certificate_file()\fR with filetype PEM if an \fBSSL\fR
structure is set. This option is only supported if certificate operations
are permitted.
.IP \fBPrivateKey\fR 4
.IX Item "PrivateKey"
Attempts to use the file \fBvalue\fR as the private key for the appropriate
context. This option is only supported if certificate operations
are permitted. Note: if no \fBPrivateKey\fR option is set then a private key is
not loaded unless the \fBSSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE\fR is set.
.IP "\fBChainCAFile\fR, \fBChainCAPath\fR, \fBVerifyCAFile\fR, \fBVerifyCAPath\fR" 4
.IX Item "ChainCAFile, ChainCAPath, VerifyCAFile, VerifyCAPath"
These options indicate a file or directory used for building certificate
chains or verifying certificate chains. These options are only supported
if certificate operations are permitted.
.IP \fBRequestCAFile\fR 4
.IX Item "RequestCAFile"
This option indicates a file containing a set of certificates in PEM form.
The subject names of the certificates are sent to the peer in the
\&\fBcertificate_authorities\fR extension for TLS 1.3 (in ClientHello or
CertificateRequest) or in a certificate request for previous versions or
TLS.
.IP \fBServerInfoFile\fR 4
.IX Item "ServerInfoFile"
Attempts to use the file \fBvalue\fR in the "serverinfo" extension using the
function SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file.
.IP \fBDHParameters\fR 4
.IX Item "DHParameters"
Attempts to use the file \fBvalue\fR as the set of temporary DH parameters for
the appropriate context. This option is only supported if certificate
operations are permitted.
.IP \fBRecordPadding\fR 4
.IX Item "RecordPadding"
Controls use of TLSv1.3 record layer padding.  \fBvalue\fR is a string of the form
"number[,number]" where the (required) first number is the padding block size
(in octets) for application data, and the optional second number is the padding
block size for handshake and alert messages.  If the optional second number is
omitted, the same padding will be applied to all messages.
.Sp
Padding attempts to pad TLSv1.3 records so that they are a multiple of the set
length on send. A value of 0 or 1 turns off padding as relevant. Otherwise, the
values must be >1 or <=16384.
.IP \fBSignatureAlgorithms\fR 4
.IX Item "SignatureAlgorithms"
This sets the supported signature algorithms for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.
For clients this
value is used directly for the supported signature algorithms extension. For
servers it is used to determine which signature algorithms to support.
.Sp
The \fBvalue\fR argument should be a colon separated list of signature algorithms
in order of decreasing preference of the form \fBalgorithm+hash\fR or
\&\fBsignature_scheme\fR. For the default providers shipped with OpenSSL,
\&\fBalgorithm\fR is one of \fBRSA\fR, \fBDSA\fR or \fBECDSA\fR and \fBhash\fR is a supported
algorithm OID short name such as \fBSHA1\fR, \fBSHA224\fR, \fBSHA256\fR, \fBSHA384\fR
or \fBSHA512\fR.
\&\fBsignature_scheme\fR is one of the signature schemes defined in TLSv1.3,
specified using the IANA name, e.g., \fBecdsa_secp256r1_sha256\fR, \fBed25519\fR,
or \fBrsa_pss_pss_sha256\fR.
Signature scheme names and public key algorithm names (but not the hash names)
in the \fBalgorithm+hash\fR form are case-insensitive.
Additional providers may make available further signature schemes via the
TLS_SIGALG capability. See "CAPABILITIES" in \fBprovider\-base\fR\|(7).
.Sp
If this option is not set then all signature algorithms supported by all
activated providers are permissible.
.Sp
Note: algorithms which specify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (either by
using \fBRSA\fR as the \fBalgorithm\fR or by using one of the \fBrsa_pkcs1_*\fR
identifiers) are ignored in TLSv1.3 and will not be negotiated.
.IP \fBClientSignatureAlgorithms\fR 4
.IX Item "ClientSignatureAlgorithms"
This sets the supported signature algorithms associated with client
authentication for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.
For servers the value is used in the
\&\fBsignature_algorithms\fR field of a \fBCertificateRequest\fR message.
For clients it is
used to determine which signature algorithm to use with the client certificate.
If a server does not request a certificate this option has no effect.
.Sp
The syntax of \fBvalue\fR is identical to \fBSignatureAlgorithms\fR. If not set then
the value set for \fBSignatureAlgorithms\fR will be used instead.
.IP \fBGroups\fR 4
.IX Item "Groups"
This sets the supported groups. For clients, the groups are
sent using the supported groups extension. For servers, it is used
to determine which group to use. This setting affects groups used for
signatures (in TLSv1.2 and earlier) and key exchange. The first group listed
will also be used for the \fBkey_share\fR sent by a client in a TLSv1.3
\&\fBClientHello\fR.
.Sp
The \fBgroups\fR argument is a colon separated list of groups.  The preferred
names are those listed in the IANA
TLS Supported Groups <https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8>
registry.
For some groups, OpenSSL supports additional aliases.
Such an alias could be a \fBNIST\fR name (e.g. \fBP\-256\fR), an OpenSSL OID name
(e.g. \fBprime256v1\fR), or some other commonly used name.
Group names are case-insensitive in OpenSSL 3.5 and later.
The list should be in order of preference with the most preferred group first.

The commands below list the available groups for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3,
respectively:
.Sp
.Vb 2

An enriched alternative syntax, that enables clients to send multiple keyshares
and allows servers to prioritise some groups over others, is described in
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set1_groups_list\fR\|(3).
Since TLS 1.2 has neither keyshares nor a hello retry mechanism, with TLS 1.2
the enriched syntax is ultimately equivalent to just a simple ordered list of
groups, as with the simple form above.
.IP \fBCurves\fR 4
.IX Item "Curves"
This is a synonym for the "Groups" command.
.IP \fBMinProtocol\fR 4
.IX Item "MinProtocol"
This sets the minimum supported SSL, TLS or DTLS version.
.Sp
Currently supported protocol values are \fBSSLv3\fR, \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR,
\&\fBTLSv1.2\fR, \fBTLSv1.3\fR, \fBDTLSv1\fR and \fBDTLSv1.2\fR.
The SSL and TLS bounds apply only to TLS-based contexts, while the DTLS bounds
apply only to DTLS-based contexts.
The command can be repeated with one instance setting a TLS bound, and the
other setting a DTLS bound.
The value \fBNone\fR applies to both types of contexts and disables the limits.
.IP \fBMaxProtocol\fR 4
.IX Item "MaxProtocol"
This sets the maximum supported SSL, TLS or DTLS version.
.Sp
Currently supported protocol values are \fBSSLv3\fR, \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR,
\&\fBTLSv1.2\fR, \fBTLSv1.3\fR, \fBDTLSv1\fR and \fBDTLSv1.2\fR.
The SSL and TLS bounds apply only to TLS-based contexts, while the DTLS bounds
apply only to DTLS-based contexts.
The command can be repeated with one instance setting a TLS bound, and the
other setting a DTLS bound.
The value \fBNone\fR applies to both types of contexts and disables the limits.
.IP \fBProtocol\fR 4

This can be used to enable or disable certain versions of the SSL,
TLS or DTLS protocol.
.Sp
The \fBvalue\fR argument is a comma separated list of supported protocols
to enable or disable.
If a protocol is preceded by \fB\-\fR that version is disabled.
.Sp
All protocol versions are enabled by default.
You need to disable at least one protocol version for this setting have any
effect.
Only enabling some protocol versions does not disable the other protocol
versions.
.Sp
Currently supported protocol values are \fBSSLv3\fR, \fBTLSv1\fR, \fBTLSv1.1\fR,
\&\fBTLSv1.2\fR, \fBTLSv1.3\fR, \fBDTLSv1\fR and \fBDTLSv1.2\fR.
The special value \fBALL\fR refers to all supported versions.
.Sp
This can't enable protocols that are disabled using \fBMinProtocol\fR
or \fBMaxProtocol\fR, but can disable protocols that are still allowed
by them.
.Sp
The \fBProtocol\fR command is fragile and deprecated; do not use it.
Use \fBMinProtocol\fR and \fBMaxProtocol\fR instead.
If you do use \fBProtocol\fR, make sure that the resulting range of enabled
protocols has no "holes", e.g. if TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.2 are both enabled, make
sure to also leave TLS 1.1 enabled.
.IP \fBOptions\fR 4
.IX Item "Options"
The \fBvalue\fR argument is a comma separated list of various flags to set.
If a flag string is preceded \fB\-\fR it is disabled.
See the \fBSSL_CTX_set_options\fR\|(3) function for more details of
individual options.
.Sp
Each option is listed below. Where an operation is enabled by default
the \fB\-flag\fR syntax is needed to disable it.
.Sp
\&\fBSessionTicket\fR: session ticket support, enabled by default. Inverse of
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_TICKET\fR: that is \fB\-SessionTicket\fR is the same as setting
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_TICKET\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBCompression\fR: SSL/TLS compression support, disabled by default. Inverse
of \fBSSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBEmptyFragments\fR: use empty fragments as a countermeasure against a
SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 protocol vulnerability affecting CBC ciphers. It
is set by default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBBugs\fR: enable various bug workarounds. Same as \fBSSL_OP_ALL\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBDHSingle\fR: enable single use DH keys, set by default. Inverse of
\&\fBSSL_OP_DH_SINGLE\fR. Only used by servers.
.Sp
\&\fBECDHSingle\fR: enable single use ECDH keys, set by default. Inverse of
\&\fBSSL_OP_ECDH_SINGLE\fR. Only used by servers.
.Sp
\&\fBServerPreference\fR: use server and not client preference order when
determining which cipher suite, signature algorithm or elliptic curve
to use for an incoming connection.  Equivalent to
\&\fBSSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE\fR. Only used by servers.
.Sp
\&\fBPrioritizeChaCha\fR: prioritizes ChaCha ciphers when the client has a
ChaCha20 cipher at the top of its preference list. This usually indicates
a mobile client is in use. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA\fR.
Only used by servers.
.Sp
\&\fBNoResumptionOnRenegotiation\fR: set
\&\fBSSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION\fR flag. Only used by servers.
.Sp
\&\fBNoRenegotiation\fR: disables all attempts at renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and
earlier, same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation\fR: permits the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation.
Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBUnsafeLegacyServerConnect\fR: permits the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation
for OpenSSL clients only. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBEncryptThenMac\fR: use encrypt-then-mac extension, enabled by
default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_NO_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC\fR: that is,
\&\fB\-EncryptThenMac\fR is the same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBAllowNoDHEKEX\fR: In TLSv1.3 allow a non\-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on
resumption. This means that there will be no forward secrecy for the resumed
session. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBPreferNoDHEKEX\fR: In TLSv1.3, on resumption let the server prefer a
non\-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode over an (ec)dhe based one. Requires
\&\fBAllowNoDHEKEX\fR. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX\fR. Only used by
servers.
.Sp
\&\fBMiddleboxCompat\fR: If set then dummy Change Cipher Spec (CCS) messages are sent
in TLSv1.3. This has the effect of making TLSv1.3 look more like TLSv1.2 so that
middleboxes that do not understand TLSv1.3 will not drop the connection. This
option is set by default. A future version of OpenSSL may not set this by
default. Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBAntiReplay\fR: If set then OpenSSL will automatically detect if a session ticket
has been used more than once, TLSv1.3 has been negotiated, and early data is
enabled on the server. A full handshake is forced if a session ticket is used a
second or subsequent time. This option is set by default and is only used by
servers. Anti-replay measures are required to comply with the TLSv1.3
specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in
other ways and in such cases the built-in OpenSSL functionality is not required.
Disabling anti-replay is equivalent to setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBExtendedMasterSecret\fR: use extended master secret extension, enabled by
default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET\fR: that is,
\&\fB\-ExtendedMasterSecret\fR is the same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBCANames\fR: use CA names extension, enabled by
default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES\fR: that is,
\&\fB\-CANames\fR is the same as setting \fBSSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBKTLS\fR: Enables kernel TLS if support has been compiled in, and it is supported
by the negotiated ciphersuites and extensions. Equivalent to
\&\fBSSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBStrictCertCheck\fR: Enable strict certificate checking. Equivalent to
setting \fBSSL_CERT_FLAG_TLS_STRICT\fR with \fBSSL_CTX_set_cert_flags()\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBTxCertificateCompression\fR: support sending compressed certificates, enabled by
default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION\fR: that is,
\&\fB\-TxCertificateCompression\fR is the same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBRxCertificateCompression\fR: support receiving compressed certificates, enabled by
default. Inverse of \fBSSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION\fR: that is,
\&\fB\-RxCertificateCompression\fR is the same as setting \fBSSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBKTLSTxZerocopySendfile\fR: use the zerocopy TX mode of \fBsendfile()\fR, which gives
a performance boost when used with KTLS hardware offload. Note that invalid TLS
records might be transmitted if the file is changed while being sent. This
option has no effect if \fBKTLS\fR is not enabled. Equivalent to
\&\fBSSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS_TX_ZEROCOPY_SENDFILE\fR. This option only applies to Linux.
KTLS sendfile on FreeBSD doesn't offer an option to disable zerocopy and
always runs in this mode.
.Sp
\&\fBIgnoreUnexpectedEOF\fR: Equivalent to \fBSSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF\fR.
You should only enable this option if the protocol running over TLS can detect
a truncation attack itself, and that the application is checking for that
truncation attack.
.IP \fBVerifyMode\fR 4
.IX Item "VerifyMode"
The \fBvalue\fR argument is a comma separated list of flags to set.
.Sp
\&\fBPeer\fR enables peer verification: for clients only.
.Sp
\&\fBRequest\fR requests but does not require a certificate from the client.
Servers only.
.Sp
\&\fBRequire\fR requests and requires a certificate from the client: an error
occurs if the client does not present a certificate. Servers only.
.Sp
\&\fBOnce\fR requests a certificate from a client only on the initial connection:
not when renegotiating. Servers only.
.Sp
\&\fBRequestPostHandshake\fR configures the connection to support requests but does
not require a certificate from the client post-handshake. A certificate will
not be requested during the initial handshake. The server application must
provide a mechanism to request a certificate post-handshake. Servers only.
TLSv1.3 only.
.Sp
\&\fBRequiresPostHandshake\fR configures the connection to support requests and
requires a certificate from the client post-handshake: an error occurs if the
client does not present a certificate. A certificate will not be requested
during the initial handshake. The server application must provide a mechanism
to request a certificate post-handshake. Servers only. TLSv1.3 only.
.IP "\fBClientCAFile\fR, \fBClientCAPath\fR" 4
.IX Item "ClientCAFile, ClientCAPath"
A file or directory of certificates in PEM format whose names are used as the
set of acceptable names for client CAs. Servers only. This option is only
supported if certificate operations are permitted.
.SH "SUPPORTED COMMAND TYPES"
.IX Header "SUPPORTED COMMAND TYPES"
The function \fBSSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()\fR currently returns one of the following
types:
.IP \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN"
The \fBoption\fR string is unrecognised, this return value can be use to flag
syntax errors.
.IP \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_STRING\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_CONF_TYPE_STRING"
The value is a string without any specific structure.
.IP \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE"
The value is a filename.
.IP \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_DIR\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_CONF_TYPE_DIR"
The value is a directory name.
.IP \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE\fR 4
.IX Item "SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE"
The value string is not used e.g. a command line option which doesn't take an
argument.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The order of operations is significant. This can be used to set either defaults
or values which cannot be overridden. For example if an application calls:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "\-SSLv3");
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);
.Ve
.PP
it will disable SSLv3 support by default but the user can override it. If
however the call sequence is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "\-SSLv3");
.Ve
.PP
SSLv3 is \fBalways\fR disabled and attempt to override this by the user are
ignored.
.PP
By checking the return code of \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR it is possible to query if a
given \fBoption\fR is recognised, this is useful if \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR values are
mixed with additional application specific operations.
.PP
For example an application might call \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR and if it returns
\&\-2 (unrecognised command) continue with processing of application specific
commands.
.PP
Applications can also use \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR to process command lines though the
utility function \fBSSL_CONF_cmd_argv()\fR is normally used instead. One way
to do this is to set the prefix to an appropriate value using
\&\fBSSL_CONF_CTX_set1_prefix()\fR, pass the current argument to \fBoption\fR and the
following argument to \fBvalue\fR (which may be NULL).
.PP
In this case if the return value is positive then it is used to skip that
number of arguments as they have been processed by \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR. If \-2 is
returned then \fBoption\fR is not recognised and application specific arguments
can be checked instead. If \-3 is returned a required argument is missing
and an error is indicated. If 0 is returned some other error occurred and
this can be reported back to the user.
.PP
The function \fBSSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()\fR can be used by applications to
check for the existence of a command or to perform additional syntax
checking or translation of the command value. For example if the return
value is \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE\fR an application could translate a relative
pathname to an absolute pathname.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR returns 1 if the value of \fBoption\fR is recognised and \fBvalue\fR is
\&\fBNOT\fR used and 2 if both \fBoption\fR and \fBvalue\fR are used. In other words it
returns the number of arguments processed. This is useful when processing
command lines.
.PP
A return value of \-2 means \fBoption\fR is not recognised.
.PP
A return value of \-3 means \fBoption\fR is recognised and the command requires a
value but \fBvalue\fR is NULL.
.PP
A return code of 0 indicates that both \fBoption\fR and \fBvalue\fR are valid but an
error occurred attempting to perform the operation: for example due to an
error in the syntax of \fBvalue\fR in this case the error queue may provide
additional information.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
Set supported signature algorithms:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "SignatureAlgorithms", "ECDSA+SHA256:RSA+SHA256:DSA+SHA256");
.Ve
.PP
There are various ways to select the supported protocols.
.PP
This set the minimum protocol version to TLSv1, and so disables SSLv3.
This is the recommended way to disable protocols.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MinProtocol", "TLSv1");
.Ve
.PP
The following also disables SSLv3:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "\-SSLv3");
.Ve
.PP
The following will first enable all protocols, and then disable
SSLv3.
If no protocol versions were disabled before this has the same effect as
"\-SSLv3", but if some versions were disables this will re-enable them before
disabling SSLv3.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "ALL,\-SSLv3");
.Ve
.PP
Only enable TLSv1.2:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MinProtocol", "TLSv1.2");
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MaxProtocol", "TLSv1.2");
.Ve
.PP
This also only enables TLSv1.2:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "\-ALL,TLSv1.2");
.Ve
.PP
Disable TLS session tickets:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Options", "\-SessionTicket");
.Ve
.PP
Enable compression:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Options", "Compression");
.Ve
.PP
Set supported curves to P\-256, P\-384:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Curves", "P\-256:P\-384");
.Ve

.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
The \fBSSL_CONF_cmd()\fR function was added in OpenSSL 1.0.2.
.PP
The \fBSSL_OP_NO_SSL2\fR option doesn't have effect since 1.1.0, but the macro
is retained for backwards compatibility.
.PP
The \fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE\fR was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0. In earlier versions of
OpenSSL passing a command which didn't take an argument would return
\&\fBSSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN\fR.
.PP
\&\fBMinProtocol\fR and \fBMaxProtocol\fR where added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
.PP
\&\fBAllowNoDHEKEX\fR and \fBPrioritizeChaCha\fR were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
.PP
The \fBUnsafeLegacyServerConnect\fR option is no longer set by default from
OpenSSL 3.0.
.PP
The \fBTxCertificateCompression\fR and \fBRxCertificateCompression\fR options were
added in OpenSSL 3.2.
.PP
\&\fBPreferNoDHEKEX\fR was added in OpenSSL 3.3.
.PP
OpenSSL 3.5 introduces support for post-quantum (PQ) TLS key exchange via the
\&\fBMLKEM512\fR, \fBMLKEM768\fR and \fBMLKEM1024\fR TLS groups.
These are based on the underlying \fBML\-KEM\-512\fR, \fBML\-KEM\-768\fR and
\&\fBML\-KEM\-1024\fR algorithms from FIPS 203.
.PP
OpenSSL 3.5 also introduces support for three \fBhybrid\fR ECDH PQ key exchange
TLS groups: \fBX25519MLKEM768\fR, \fBSecP256r1MLKEM768\fR and
\&\fBSecP384r1MLKEM1024\fR.
They offer CPU performance comparable to the associated ECDH group, though at
the cost of significantly larger key exchange messages.
The third group, \fBSecP384r1MLKEM1024\fR is substantially more CPU-intensive,
largely as a result of the high CPU cost of ECDH for the underlying \fBP\-384\fR
group.
Also its key exchange messages at close to 1700 bytes are larger than the
roughly 1200 bytes for the first two groups.
.PP
As of OpenSSL 3.5 key exchange group names are case-insensitive.
