.SH NAME
OPENSSL_ia32cap \- the x86[_64] processor capabilities vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"

\& env OPENSSL_ia32cap=... <application>
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
OpenSSL supports a range of x86[_64] instruction set extensions and
features. These extensions are denoted by individual bits or groups of bits
stored internally as ten 32\-bit capability vectors and for simplicity
represented logically below as five 64\-bit vectors. This logical
vector (LV) representation is used to streamline the definition of the
OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable.
.PP
Upon toolkit initialization, the capability vectors are populated through
successive executions of the CPUID instruction, after which any OPENSSL_ia32cap
environment variable capability bit modifications are applied. After toolkit
initialization is complete, populated vectors are then used to choose
between different code paths to provide optimal performance across a wide
range of x86[_64] based processors.
.PP
Further CPUID information can be found in the Intel(R) Architecture
Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference, and the AMD64 Architecture
Programmer's Manual (Volume 3).

.SS "OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable"
.IX Subsection "OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable"
The \fBOPENSSL_ia32cap\fR environment variable provides a mechanism to override
the default capability vector values at library initialization time.
The variable consists of a series of 64\-bit numbers representing each
of the logical vectors (LV) described above. Each value is delimited by a '\fB:\fR'.
Decimal/Octal/Hexadecimal values representations are supported.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=LV0:LV1:LV2:LV3:LV4\*(C'\fR
.PP
Used in this form, each non-null logical vector will *overwrite* the entire corresponding
capability vector pair with the provided value. To keep compatibility with the
behaviour of the original OPENSSL_ia32cap environment variable
<env OPENSSL_ia32cap=LV0:LV1>, the next capability vector pairs will be set to zero.
.PP
To illustrate, the following will zero all capability bits in logical vectors 1 and further
(disable all post-AVX extensions):
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:0\*(C'\fR
.PP
The following will zero all capability bits in logical vectors 2 and further:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=::0\*(C'\fR
.PP
The following will zero all capability bits only in logical vector 1:
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:0::::\*(C'\fR
.PP
A more likely usage scenario would be to disable specific instruction set extensions.
The '\fB~\fR' character is used to specify a bit mask of the extensions to be disabled for
a particular logical vector.
.PP
To illustrate, the following will disable AVX2 code paths and further extensions:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x20000000000\*(C'\fR
.PP
The following will disable AESNI (LV0 bit 57) and VAES (LV1 bit 41)
extensions and therefore any code paths using those extensions but leave
the rest of the logical vectors unchanged:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`env OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x200000000000000:~0x20000000000:~0x0:~0x0:~0x0\*(C'\fR
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
Not all capability bits are copied from CPUID output verbatim. An example
of this is the somewhat less intuitive clearing of LV0 bit #28, or ~0x10000000
in the "environment variable" terms. It has been adjusted to reflect whether or
not the data cache is actually shared between logical cores. This in turn affects
the decision on whether or not expensive countermeasures against cache-timing attacks
are applied, most notably in AES assembler module.
