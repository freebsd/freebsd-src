SSL_stream_reset \- reset a QUIC stream
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBSSL_stream_reset()\fR function resets the send part of a QUIC stream when
called on a QUIC stream SSL object, or on a QUIC connection SSL object with  a
default stream attached.
.PP
If \fIargs\fR is non-NULL, \fIargs_len\fR must be set to \f(CWsizeof(*args)\fR.
.PP
\&\fIquic_error_code\fR is an application-specified error code, which must be in the
range [0, 2**62\-1]. If \fIargs\fR is NULL, a value of 0 is used.
.PP
Resetting a stream indicates to an application that the sending part of the
stream is terminating abnormally. When a stream is reset, the implementation
does not guarantee that any data already passed to \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) will be
received by the peer, and data already passed to \fBSSL_write\fR\|(3) but not yet
transmitted may or may not be discarded. As such, you should only reset
a stream when the information transmitted on the stream no longer matters, for
example due to an error condition.
.PP
This function cannot be called on a unidirectional stream initiated by the peer,
as only the sending side of a stream can initiate a stream reset.
.PP
It is also possible to trigger a stream reset by calling \fBSSL_free\fR\|(3); see the
documentation for \fBSSL_free\fR\|(3) for details.
.PP
The receiving part of the stream (for bidirectional streams) continues to
function normally.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
This function corresponds to the QUIC \fBRESET_STREAM\fR frame.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
.PP
This function fails if called on a QUIC connection SSL object without a default
stream attached, or on a non-QUIC SSL object.
.PP
After the first call to this function succeeds for a given stream,
subsequent calls succeed but are ignored. The application error code
used is that passed to the first successful call to this function.
