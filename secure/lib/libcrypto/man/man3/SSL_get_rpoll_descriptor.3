.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The functions \fBSSL_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBSSL_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR can be
used to determine when an SSL object which represents a QUIC connection can
perform useful network I/O, so that an application using a QUIC connection SSL
object in nonblocking mode can determine when it should call \fBSSL_handle_events()\fR.
.PP
On success, these functions output poll descriptors. For more information on
poll descriptors, see \fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor\fR\|(3).
.PP
The functions \fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR and \fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR return 1 or 0
depending on whether the SSL object is currently interested in receiving data
from the network and/or writing data to the network respectively.
If an SSL object is not interested in reading data from the network at the
current time, \fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR will return 0; likewise, if an SSL object is
not interested in writing data to the network at the current time,
\&\fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR will return 0.
.PP
The intention is that an application using QUIC in nonblocking mode can use
these calls, in conjunction with \fBSSL_get_event_timeout\fR\|(3) to wait for network
I/O conditions which allow the SSL object to perform useful work. When such a
condition arises, \fBSSL_handle_events\fR\|(3) should be called.
.PP
In particular, the expected usage is as follows:
.IP \(bu 4
\&\fBSSL_handle_events()\fR should be called whenever the timeout returned by
\&\fBSSL_get_event_timeout\fR\|(3) (if any) expires
.IP \(bu 4
If the last call to \fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR returned 1, \fBSSL_handle_events()\fR should be called
whenever the poll descriptor output by \fBSSL_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR becomes
readable.
.IP \(bu 4
If the last call to \fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR returned 1, \fBSSL_handle_events()\fR should be called
whenever the poll descriptor output by \fBSSL_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR becomes
writable.
.PP
The return values of the \fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR and \fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR functions
may change in response to any call to the SSL object other than
\&\fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR, \fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR, \fBSSL_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR,
\&\fBSSL_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR.
.PP
On non-QUIC SSL objects, calls to \fBSSL_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and
\&\fBSSL_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR function the same as calls to
\&\fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR on the respective read
and write BIOs configured on the SSL object.
.PP
On non-QUIC SSL objects, calls to \fBSSL_net_read_desired()\fR and
\&\fBSSL_net_write_desired()\fR function identically to calls to \fBSSL_want_read()\fR and
\&\fBSSL_want_write()\fR respectively.
