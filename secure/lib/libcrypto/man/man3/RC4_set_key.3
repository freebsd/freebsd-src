.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All of the functions described on this page are deprecated. Applications should
instead use \fBEVP_EncryptInit_ex\fR\|(3), \fBEVP_EncryptUpdate\fR\|(3) and
\&\fBEVP_EncryptFinal_ex\fR\|(3) or the equivalently named decrypt functions.
.PP
This library implements the Alleged RC4 cipher, which is described for
example in \fIApplied Cryptography\fR.  It is believed to be compatible
with RC4[TM], a proprietary cipher of RSA Security Inc.
.PP
RC4 is a stream cipher with variable key length.  Typically, 128 bit
(16 byte) keys are used for strong encryption, but shorter insecure
key sizes have been widely used due to export restrictions.
.PP
RC4 consists of a key setup phase and the actual encryption or
decryption phase.
.PP
\&\fBRC4_set_key()\fR sets up the \fBRC4_KEY\fR \fBkey\fR using the \fBlen\fR bytes long
key at \fBdata\fR.
.PP
\&\fBRC4()\fR encrypts or decrypts the \fBlen\fR bytes of data at \fBindata\fR using
\&\fBkey\fR and places the result at \fBoutdata\fR.  Repeated \fBRC4()\fR calls with
the same \fBkey\fR yield a continuous key stream.
.PP
Since RC4 is a stream cipher (the input is XORed with a pseudo-random
key stream to produce the output), decryption uses the same function
calls as encryption.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBRC4_set_key()\fR and \fBRC4()\fR do not return values.
.SH NOTE
.IX Header "NOTE"
Applications should use the higher level functions
\&\fBEVP_EncryptInit\fR\|(3) etc. instead of calling these
functions directly.
.PP
It is difficult to securely use stream ciphers. For example, do not perform
multiple encryptions using the same key stream.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"

All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
