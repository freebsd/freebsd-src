.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos()\fR and \fBSSL_set_alpn_protos()\fR are used by the client to
set the list of protocols available to be negotiated. The \fBprotos\fR must be in
protocol-list format, described below. The length of \fBprotos\fR is specified in
\&\fBprotos_len\fR. Setting \fBprotos_len\fR to 0 clears any existing list of ALPN
protocols and no ALPN extension will be sent to the server.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb()\fR sets the application callback \fBcb\fR used by a
server to select which protocol to use for the incoming connection. When \fBcb\fR
is NULL, ALPN is not used. The \fBarg\fR value is a pointer which is passed to
the application callback.
.PP
\&\fBcb\fR is the application defined callback. The \fBin\fR, \fBinlen\fR parameters are a
vector in protocol-list format. The value of the \fBout\fR, \fBoutlen\fR vector
should be set to the value of a single protocol selected from the \fBin\fR,
\&\fBinlen\fR vector. The \fBout\fR buffer may point directly into \fBin\fR, or to a
buffer that outlives the handshake. The \fBarg\fR parameter is the pointer set via
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_select_next_proto()\fR is a helper function used to select protocols. It
implements the standard protocol selection. It is expected that this function
is called from the application callback \fBcb\fR. The protocol data in \fBserver\fR,
\&\fBserver_len\fR and \fBclient\fR, \fBclient_len\fR must be in the protocol-list format
described below. The first item in the \fBserver\fR, \fBserver_len\fR list that
matches an item in the \fBclient\fR, \fBclient_len\fR list is selected, and returned
in \fBout\fR, \fBoutlen\fR. The \fBout\fR value will point into either \fBserver\fR or
\&\fBclient\fR, so it should be copied immediately. The client list must include at
least one valid (nonempty) protocol entry in the list.
.PP
The \fBSSL_select_next_proto()\fR helper function can be useful from either the ALPN
callback or the NPN callback (described below). If no match is found, the first
item in \fBclient\fR, \fBclient_len\fR is returned in \fBout\fR, \fBoutlen\fR and
\&\fBOPENSSL_NPN_NO_OVERLAP\fR is returned. This can be useful when implementing
the NPN callback. In the ALPN case, the value returned in \fBout\fR and \fBoutlen\fR
must be ignored if \fBOPENSSL_NPN_NO_OVERLAP\fR has been returned from
\&\fBSSL_select_next_proto()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb()\fR sets a callback \fBcb\fR that is called when a
client needs to select a protocol from the server's provided list, and a
user-defined pointer argument \fBarg\fR which will be passed to this callback.
For the callback itself, \fBout\fR
must be set to point to the selected protocol (which may be within \fBin\fR).
The length of the protocol name must be written into \fBoutlen\fR. The
server's advertised protocols are provided in \fBin\fR and \fBinlen\fR. The
callback can assume that \fBin\fR is syntactically valid. The client must
select a protocol (although it may be an empty, zero length protocol). It is
fatal to the connection if this callback returns a value other than
\&\fBSSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK\fR or if the zero length protocol is selected. The \fBarg\fR
parameter is the pointer set via \fBSSL_CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_next_protos_advertised_cb()\fR sets a callback \fBcb\fR that is called
when a TLS server needs a list of supported protocols for Next Protocol
Negotiation. The returned list must be in protocol-list format, described
below.  The list is
returned by setting \fBout\fR to point to it and \fBoutlen\fR to its length. This
memory will not be modified, but the \fBSSL\fR does keep a
reference to it. The callback should return \fBSSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK\fR if it
wishes to advertise. Otherwise, no such extension will be included in the
ServerHello.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get0_alpn_selected()\fR returns a pointer to the selected protocol in \fBdata\fR
with length \fBlen\fR. It is not NUL-terminated. \fBdata\fR is set to NULL and \fBlen\fR
is set to 0 if no protocol has been selected. \fBdata\fR must not be freed.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get0_next_proto_negotiated()\fR sets \fBdata\fR and \fBlen\fR to point to the
client's requested protocol for this connection. If the client did not
request any protocol or NPN is not enabled, then \fBdata\fR is set to NULL and
\&\fBlen\fR to 0. Note that
the client can request any protocol it chooses. The value returned from
this function need not be a member of the list of supported protocols
provided by the callback.
.PP
NPN functionality cannot be used with QUIC SSL objects. Use of ALPN is mandatory
when using QUIC SSL objects. \fBSSL_CTX_set_next_protos_advertised_cb()\fR and
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb()\fR have no effect if called on a QUIC SSL
context.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The protocol-lists must be in wire-format, which is defined as a vector of
nonempty, 8\-bit length-prefixed, byte strings. The length-prefix byte is not
included in the length. Each string is limited to 255 bytes. A byte-string
length of 0 is invalid. A truncated byte-string is invalid. The length of the
vector is not in the vector itself, but in a separate variable.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& unsigned char vector[] = {
\&     6, \*(Aqs\*(Aq, \*(Aqp\*(Aq, \*(Aqd\*(Aq, \*(Aqy\*(Aq, \*(Aq/\*(Aq, \*(Aq1\*(Aq,
\&     8, \*(Aqh\*(Aq, \*(Aqt\*(Aq, \*(Aqt\*(Aq, \*(Aqp\*(Aq, \*(Aq/\*(Aq, \*(Aq1\*(Aq, \*(Aq.\*(Aq, \*(Aq1\*(Aq
\& };
\& unsigned int length = sizeof(vector);
.Ve
.PP
The ALPN callback is executed after the servername callback; as that servername
callback may update the SSL_CTX, and subsequently, the ALPN callback.
.PP
If there is no ALPN proposed in the ClientHello, the ALPN callback is not
invoked.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos()\fR and \fBSSL_set_alpn_protos()\fR return 0 on success, and
non\-0 on failure. WARNING: these functions reverse the return value convention.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_select_next_proto()\fR returns one of the following:
.IP OPENSSL_NPN_NEGOTIATED 4
.IX Item "OPENSSL_NPN_NEGOTIATED"
A match was found and is returned in \fBout\fR, \fBoutlen\fR.
.IP OPENSSL_NPN_NO_OVERLAP 4
.IX Item "OPENSSL_NPN_NO_OVERLAP"
No match was found. The first item in \fBclient\fR, \fBclient_len\fR is returned in
\&\fBout\fR, \fBoutlen\fR (or \fBNULL\fR and 0 in the case where the first entry in
\&\fBclient\fR is invalid).
.PP
The ALPN select callback \fBcb\fR, must return one of the following:
.IP SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK 4
.IX Item "SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK"
ALPN protocol selected.
.IP SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL 4
.IX Item "SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL"
There was no overlap between the client's supplied list and the server
configuration.
.IP SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK 4
.IX Item "SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK"
ALPN protocol not selected, e.g., because no ALPN protocols are configured for
this connection.
.PP
The callback set using \fBSSL_CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb()\fR should return
\&\fBSSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK\fR if successful. Any other value is fatal to the connection.
.PP
The callback set using \fBSSL_CTX_set_next_protos_advertised_cb()\fR should return
\&\fBSSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK\fR if it wishes to advertise. Otherwise, no such extension
will be included in the ServerHello.
