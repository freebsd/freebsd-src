.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.
Applications should instead use \fBEVP_PKEY_paramgen_init\fR\|(3) and
\&\fBEVP_PKEY_keygen\fR\|(3) as described in \fBEVP_PKEY\-DSA\fR\|(7).
.PP
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters_ex()\fR generates primes p and q and a generator g
for use in the DSA and stores the result in \fBdsa\fR.
.PP
\&\fBbits\fR is the length of the prime p to be generated.
For lengths under 2048 bits, the length of q is 160 bits; for lengths
greater than or equal to 2048 bits, the length of q is set to 256 bits.
.PP
If \fBseed\fR is NULL, the primes will be generated at random.
If \fBseed_len\fR is less than the length of q, an error is returned.
.PP
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters_ex()\fR places the iteration count in
*\fBcounter_ret\fR and a counter used for finding a generator in
*\fBh_ret\fR, unless these are \fBNULL\fR.
.PP
A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress
of the key generation. If \fBcb\fR is not \fBNULL\fR, it will be
called as shown below. For information on the BN_GENCB structure and the
BN_GENCB_call function discussed below, refer to
\&\fBBN_generate_prime\fR\|(3).
.PP
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters()\fR is similar to \fBDSA_generate_parameters_ex()\fR but
expects an old-style callback function; see
\&\fBBN_generate_prime\fR\|(3) for information on the old-style callback.
.IP \(bu 2
When a candidate for q is generated, \fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 0, m++)\fR is called
(m is 0 for the first candidate).
.IP \(bu 2
When a candidate for q has passed a test by trial division,
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 1, \-1)\fR is called.
While a candidate for q is tested by Miller-Rabin primality tests,
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 1, i)\fR is called in the outer loop
(once for each witness that confirms that the candidate may be prime);
i is the loop counter (starting at 0).
.IP \(bu 2
When a prime q has been found, \fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 2, 0)\fR and
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 3, 0)\fR are called.
.IP \(bu 2
Before a candidate for p (other than the first) is generated and tested,
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 0, counter)\fR is called.
.IP \(bu 2
When a candidate for p has passed the test by trial division,
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 1, \-1)\fR is called.
While it is tested by the Miller-Rabin primality test,
\&\fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 1, i)\fR is called in the outer loop
(once for each witness that confirms that the candidate may be prime).
i is the loop counter (starting at 0).
.IP \(bu 2
When p has been found, \fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 2, 1)\fR is called.
.IP \(bu 2
When the generator has been found, \fBBN_GENCB_call(cb, 3, 1)\fR is called.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters_ex()\fR returns a 1 on success, or 0 otherwise.
The error codes can be obtained by \fBERR_get_error\fR\|(3).
.PP
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters()\fR returns a pointer to the DSA structure or
\&\fBNULL\fR if the parameter generation fails.
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
Seed lengths greater than 20 are not supported.

.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
\&\fBDSA_generate_parameters_ex()\fR was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
