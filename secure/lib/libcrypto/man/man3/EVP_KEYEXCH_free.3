.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_fetch()\fR fetches the key exchange implementation for the given
\&\fIalgorithm\fR from any provider offering it, within the criteria given
by the \fIproperties\fR.
See "ALGORITHM FETCHING" in \fBcrypto\fR\|(7) for further information.
.PP
The returned value must eventually be freed with \fBEVP_KEYEXCH_free()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_free()\fR decrements the reference count for the \fBEVP_KEYEXCH\fR
structure. Typically this structure will have been obtained from an earlier call
to \fBEVP_KEYEXCH_fetch()\fR. If the reference count drops to 0 then the
structure is freed. If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref()\fR increments the reference count for an \fBEVP_KEYEXCH\fR
structure.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_get0_provider()\fR returns the provider that \fIexchange\fR was
fetched from.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_is_a()\fR checks if \fIexchange\fR is an implementation of an
algorithm that's identifiable with \fIname\fR.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_get0_name()\fR returns the algorithm name from the provided
implementation for the given \fIexchange\fR. Note that the \fIexchange\fR may have
multiple synonyms associated with it. In this case the first name from the
algorithm definition is returned. Ownership of the returned string is retained
by the \fIexchange\fR object and should not be freed by the caller.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_names_do_all()\fR traverses all names for the \fIexchange\fR, and
calls \fIfn\fR with each name and \fIdata\fR.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_get0_description()\fR returns a description of the \fIkeyexch\fR, meant
for display and human consumption.  The description is at the discretion of
the \fIkeyexch\fR implementation.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_do_all_provided()\fR traverses all key exchange implementations by
all activated providers in the library context \fIlibctx\fR, and for each
of the implementations, calls \fIfn\fR with the implementation method and
\&\fIdata\fR as arguments.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_gettable_ctx_params()\fR and \fBEVP_KEYEXCH_settable_ctx_params()\fR return
a constant \fBOSSL_PARAM\fR\|(3) array that describes the names and types of key
parameters that can be retrieved or set by a key exchange algorithm using
\&\fBEVP_PKEY_CTX_get_params\fR\|(3) and \fBEVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params\fR\|(3).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_fetch()\fR returns a pointer to a \fBEVP_KEYEXCH\fR for success
or NULL for failure.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref()\fR returns 1 for success or 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_names_do_all()\fR returns 1 if the callback was called for all
names. A return value of 0 means that the callback was not called for any names.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_is_a()\fR returns 1 of \fIexchange\fR was identifiable,
otherwise 0.
.PP
\&\fBEVP_KEYEXCH_gettable_ctx_params()\fR and \fBEVP_KEYEXCH_settable_ctx_params()\fR return
a constant \fBOSSL_PARAM\fR\|(3) array or NULL on error.
