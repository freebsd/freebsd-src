.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR, on success, fill
\&\fI*desc\fR with a poll descriptor. A poll descriptor is a tagged union structure
which represents some kind of OS or non-OS resource which can be used to
synchronise on I/O availability events.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR outputs a descriptor which can be used to determine
when the BIO can (potentially) next be read, and \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR
outputs a descriptor which can be used to determine when the BIO can
(potentially) next be written.
.PP
It is permissible for \fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR
to output the same descriptor.
.PP
Poll descriptors can represent different kinds of information. A typical kind of
resource which might be represented by a poll descriptor is an OS file
descriptor which can be used with APIs such as \fBselect()\fR.
.PP
The kinds of poll descriptor defined by OpenSSL are:
.IP BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE 4
.IX Item "BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE"
Represents the absence of a valid poll descriptor. It may be used by
\&\fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR or \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR to indicate that the
BIO is not pollable for readability or writeability respectively.
.Sp
For this type, no field within the \fIvalue\fR field of the \fBBIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR\fR
is valid.
.IP BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SOCK_FD 4
.IX Item "BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SOCK_FD"
The poll descriptor represents an OS socket resource. The field \fIvalue.fd\fR
in the \fBBIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR\fR is valid if it is not set to \-1.
.Sp
The resource is whatever kind of handle is used by a given OS to represent
sockets, which may vary by OS. For example, on Windows, the value is a \fBSOCKET\fR
for use with the Winsock API. On POSIX-like platforms, it is a file descriptor.
.Sp
Where a poll descriptor of this type is output by \fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR, it
should be polled for readability to determine when the BIO might next be able to
successfully complete a \fBBIO_read()\fR operation; likewise, where a poll descriptor
of this type is output by \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR, it should be polled for
writeability to determine when the BIO might next be able to successfully
complete a \fBBIO_write()\fR operation.
.IP BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_CUSTOM_START 4
.IX Item "BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_CUSTOM_START"
Type values beginning with this value (inclusive) are reserved for application
allocation for custom poll descriptor types. Any of the definitions in the union
field \fIvalue\fR can be used by the application arbitrarily as opaque values.
.PP
Because poll descriptors are a tagged union structure, they can represent
different kinds of information. New types of poll descriptor may be defined,
including by applications, according to their needs.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The functions \fBBIO_get_rpoll_descriptor()\fR and \fBBIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()\fR return 1
on success and 0 on failure.
.PP
These functions are permitted to succeed and initialise \fI*desc\fR with a poll
descriptor of type \fBBIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE\fR to indicate that the BIO is
not pollable for readability or writeability respectively.
