\&=head1 DESCRIPTION
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBPKCS12_create()\fR creates a PKCS#12 structure.
.PP
\&\fIpass\fR is the passphrase to use. \fIname\fR is the \fBfriendlyName\fR to use for
the supplied certificate and key. \fIpkey\fR is the private key to include in
the structure and \fIcert\fR its corresponding certificates. \fIca\fR, if not \fBNULL\fR
is an optional set of certificates to also include in the structure.
.PP
\&\fInid_key\fR and \fInid_cert\fR are the encryption algorithms that should be used
for the key and certificate respectively. The modes
GCM, CCM, XTS, and OCB are unsupported. \fIiter\fR is the encryption algorithm
iteration count to use and \fImac_iter\fR is the MAC iteration count to use.
\&\fIkeytype\fR is the type of key.
.PP
\&\fBPKCS12_create_ex()\fR is identical to \fBPKCS12_create()\fR but allows for a library context
\&\fIctx\fR and property query \fIpropq\fR to be used to select algorithm implementations.
.PP
\&\fBPKCS12_create_ex2()\fR is identical to \fBPKCS12_create_ex()\fR but allows for a user defined
callback \fIcb\fR of type \fBPKCS12_create_cb\fR to be specified and also allows for an
optional argument \fIcbarg\fR to be passed back to the callback.
.PP
The \fIcb\fR if specified will be called for every safebag added to the
PKCS12 structure and allows for optional application processing on the associated
safebag. For example one such use could be to add attributes to the safebag.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The parameters \fInid_key\fR, \fInid_cert\fR, \fIiter\fR, \fImac_iter\fR and \fIkeytype\fR
can all be set to zero and sensible defaults will be used.
.PP
These defaults are: AES password based encryption (PBES2 with PBKDF2 and
AES\-256\-CBC) for private keys and certificates, the PBKDF2 and MAC key
derivation iteration count of \fBPKCS12_DEFAULT_ITER\fR (currently 2048), and
MAC algorithm HMAC with SHA2\-256. The MAC key derivation algorithm used
for the outer PKCS#12 structure is PKCS12KDF.
.PP
The default MAC iteration count is 1 in order to retain compatibility with
old software which did not interpret MAC iteration counts. If such compatibility
is not required then \fImac_iter\fR should be set to PKCS12_DEFAULT_ITER.
.PP
\&\fIkeytype\fR adds a flag to the store private key. This is a non standard extension
that is only currently interpreted by MSIE. If set to zero the flag is omitted,
if set to \fBKEY_SIG\fR the key can be used for signing only, if set to \fBKEY_EX\fR
it can be used for signing and encryption. This option was useful for old
export grade software which could use signing only keys of arbitrary size but
had restrictions on the permissible sizes of keys which could be used for
encryption.
.PP
If \fIname\fR is \fBNULL\fR and \fIcert\fR contains an \fIalias\fR then this will be
used for the corresponding \fBfriendlyName\fR in the PKCS12 structure instead.
Similarly, if \fIpkey\fR is NULL and \fIcert\fR contains a \fIkeyid\fR then this will be
used for the corresponding \fBlocalKeyID\fR in the PKCS12 structure instead of the
id calculated from the \fIpkey\fR.
.PP
For all certificates in \fIca\fR then if a certificate contains an \fIalias\fR or
\&\fIkeyid\fR then this will be used for the corresponding \fBfriendlyName\fR or
\&\fBlocalKeyID\fR in the PKCS12 structure.
.PP
Either \fIpkey\fR, \fIcert\fR or both can be \fBNULL\fR to indicate that no key or
certificate is required. In previous versions both had to be present or
a fatal error is returned.
.PP
\&\fInid_key\fR or \fInid_cert\fR can be set to \-1 indicating that no encryption
should be used.
.PP
\&\fImac_iter\fR can be set to \-1 and the MAC will then be omitted entirely.
This can be useful when running with the FIPS provider as the PKCS12KDF
is not a FIPS approvable algorithm.
.PP
\&\fBPKCS12_create()\fR makes assumptions regarding the encoding of the given pass
phrase.
See \fBpassphrase\-encoding\fR\|(7) for more information.
.PP
If \fIcb\fR is specified, then it should return 1 for success and \-1 for a fatal error.
A return of 0 is intended to mean to not add the bag after all.

.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
\&\fBPKCS12_create_ex()\fR was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

.PP
The defaults for encryption algorithms, MAC algorithm, and the MAC key
derivation iteration count were changed in OpenSSL 3.0 to more modern
standards.
