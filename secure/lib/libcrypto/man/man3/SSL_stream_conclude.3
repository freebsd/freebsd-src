.SH NAME
SSL_stream_conclude \- conclude the sending part of a QUIC stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& _\|_owur int SSL_stream_conclude(SSL *s, uint64_t flags);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_stream_conclude()\fR signals the normal end-of-stream condition for the send
part of a QUIC stream. If called on a QUIC connection SSL object with an
associated default stream, it signals the end of the single stream to the peer.
.PP
Any data already queued for transmission via a call to \fBSSL_write()\fR will still be
written in a reliable manner before the end-of-stream is signalled, assuming the
connection remains healthy. This function can be thought of as appending a
logical end-of-stream marker after any data which has previously been written to
the stream via calls to \fBSSL_write()\fR. Further attempts to call \fBSSL_write()\fR after
calling this function will fail.
.PP
When calling this on a stream, the receive part of the stream remains
unaffected, and the peer may continue to send data until it also signals the end
of the stream. Thus, \fBSSL_read()\fR can still be used.
.PP
\&\fIflags\fR is reserved and should be set to 0.
.PP
Only the first call to this function has any effect for a given stream;
subsequent calls are no-ops. This is considered a success case.
.PP
This function is not supported on an object other than a QUIC stream SSL object.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
.PP
Returns 0 if called on an SSL object not representing a QUIC stream.
