.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBBIO_ctrl()\fR, \fBBIO_callback_ctrl()\fR, \fBBIO_ptr_ctrl()\fR and \fBBIO_int_ctrl()\fR
are BIO "control" operations taking arguments of various types.
These functions are not normally called directly, various macros
are used instead. The standard macros are described below, macros
specific to a particular type of BIO are described in the specific
BIOs manual page as well as any special features of the standard
calls.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_reset()\fR typically resets a BIO to some initial state, in the case
of file related BIOs for example it rewinds the file pointer to the
start of the file.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_seek()\fR resets a file related BIO's (that is file descriptor and
FILE BIOs) file position pointer to \fBofs\fR bytes from start of file.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_tell()\fR returns the current file position of a file related BIO.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_flush()\fR normally writes out any internally buffered data, in some
cases it is used to signal EOF and that no more data will be written.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_eof()\fR returns 1 if the BIO has read EOF, the precise meaning of
"EOF" varies according to the BIO type.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_close()\fR sets the BIO \fBb\fR close flag to \fBflag\fR. \fBflag\fR can
take the value BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE. Typically BIO_CLOSE is used
in a source/sink BIO to indicate that the underlying I/O stream should
be closed when the BIO is freed.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_close()\fR returns the BIOs close flag.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_pending()\fR, \fBBIO_ctrl_pending()\fR, \fBBIO_wpending()\fR and \fBBIO_ctrl_wpending()\fR
return the number of pending characters in the BIOs read and write buffers.
Not all BIOs support these calls. \fBBIO_ctrl_pending()\fR and \fBBIO_ctrl_wpending()\fR
return a size_t type and are functions, \fBBIO_pending()\fR and \fBBIO_wpending()\fR are
macros which call \fBBIO_ctrl()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_ktls_send()\fR returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
sending. Otherwise, it returns zero.
\&\fBBIO_get_ktls_recv()\fR returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
receiving. Otherwise, it returns zero.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_conn_mode()\fR returns the BIO connection mode. \fBBIO_set_conn_mode()\fR sets
the BIO connection mode.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_tfo()\fR disables TCP Fast Open when \fBonoff\fR is 0, and enables TCP Fast
Open when \fBonoff\fR is nonzero. Setting the value to 1 is equivalent to setting
\&\fBBIO_SOCK_TFO\fR in \fBBIO_set_conn_mode()\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBBIO_reset()\fR normally returns 1 for success and <=0 for failure. File
BIOs are an exception, they return 0 for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_seek()\fR and \fBBIO_tell()\fR both return the current file position on success
and \-1 for failure, except file BIOs which for \fBBIO_seek()\fR always return 0
for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_flush()\fR returns 1 for success and <=0 for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_eof()\fR returns 1 if EOF has been reached, 0 if not, or negative values for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_close()\fR returns 1 on success or <=0 for failure.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_close()\fR returns the close flag value: BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE. It also
returns other negative values if an error occurs.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_pending()\fR, \fBBIO_ctrl_pending()\fR, \fBBIO_wpending()\fR and \fBBIO_ctrl_wpending()\fR
return the amount of pending data. \fBBIO_pending()\fR and \fBBIO_wpending()\fR return
negative value or 0 on error. \fBBIO_ctrl_pending()\fR and \fBBIO_ctrl_wpending()\fR return
0 on error.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_get_ktls_send()\fR returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
sending. Otherwise, it returns zero.
\&\fBBIO_get_ktls_recv()\fR returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
receiving. Otherwise, it returns zero.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_conn_mode()\fR returns 1 for success and 0 for failure. \fBBIO_get_conn_mode()\fR
returns the current connection mode. Which may contain the bitwise-or of the
following flags:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& BIO_SOCK_REUSEADDR
\& BIO_SOCK_V6_ONLY
\& BIO_SOCK_KEEPALIVE
\& BIO_SOCK_NONBLOCK
\& BIO_SOCK_NODELAY
\& BIO_SOCK_TFO
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBBIO_set_tfo()\fR returns 1 for success, and 0 for failure.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
\&\fBBIO_flush()\fR, because it can write data may return 0 or \-1 indicating
that the call should be retried later in a similar manner to \fBBIO_write_ex()\fR.
The \fBBIO_should_retry()\fR call should be used and appropriate action taken
is the call fails.
.PP
The return values of \fBBIO_pending()\fR and \fBBIO_wpending()\fR may not reliably
determine the amount of pending data in all cases. For example in the
case of a file BIO some data may be available in the FILE structures
internal buffers but it is not possible to determine this in a
portably way. For other types of BIO they may not be supported.
.PP
Filter BIOs if they do not internally handle a particular \fBBIO_ctrl()\fR
operation usually pass the operation to the next BIO in the chain.
This often means there is no need to locate the required BIO for
a particular operation, it can be called on a chain and it will
be automatically passed to the relevant BIO. However, this can cause
unexpected results: for example no current filter BIOs implement
\&\fBBIO_seek()\fR, but this may still succeed if the chain ends in a FILE
or file descriptor BIO.
.PP
Source/sink BIOs return an 0 if they do not recognize the \fBBIO_ctrl()\fR
operation.
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
Some of the return values are ambiguous and care should be taken. In
particular a return value of 0 can be returned if an operation is not
supported, if an error occurred, if EOF has not been reached and in
the case of \fBBIO_seek()\fR on a file BIO for a successful operation.
.PP
In older versions of OpenSSL the \fBBIO_ctrl_pending()\fR and
\&\fBBIO_ctrl_wpending()\fR could return values greater than INT_MAX on error.
.SH HISTORY
.IX Header "HISTORY"
The \fBBIO_get_ktls_send()\fR and \fBBIO_get_ktls_recv()\fR macros were added in
OpenSSL 3.0. They were modified to never return \-1 in OpenSSL 3.0.4.
.PP
The \fBBIO_get_conn_mode()\fR, \fBBIO_set_conn_mode()\fR and \fBBIO_set_tfo()\fR functions
were added in OpenSSL 3.2.
