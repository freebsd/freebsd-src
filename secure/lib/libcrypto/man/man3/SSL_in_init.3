.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_in_init()\fR returns 1 if the SSL/TLS state machine is currently processing or
awaiting handshake messages, or 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_in_before()\fR returns 1 if no SSL/TLS handshake has yet been initiated, or 0
otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_is_init_finished()\fR returns 1 if the SSL/TLS connection is in a state where
fully protected application data can be transferred or 0 otherwise.
.PP
Note that in some circumstances (such as when early data is being transferred)
\&\fBSSL_in_init()\fR, \fBSSL_in_before()\fR and \fBSSL_is_init_finished()\fR can all return 0.
.PP
\&\fBs\fR \fBMUST NOT\fR be NULL.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_in_connect_init()\fR returns 1 if \fBs\fR is acting as a client and \fBSSL_in_init()\fR
would return 1, or 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_in_accept_init()\fR returns 1 if \fBs\fR is acting as a server and \fBSSL_in_init()\fR
would return 1, or 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_in_connect_init()\fR and \fBSSL_in_accept_init()\fR are implemented as macros.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_state()\fR returns a value indicating the current state of the handshake
state machine. OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATE is an enumerated type where each value
indicates a discrete state machine state. Note that future versions of OpenSSL
may define more states so applications should expect to receive unrecognised
state values. The naming format is made up of a number of elements as follows:
.PP
\&\fBprotocol\fR_ST_\fBrole\fR_\fBmessage\fR
.PP
\&\fBprotocol\fR is one of TLS or DTLS. DTLS is used where a state is specific to the
DTLS protocol. Otherwise TLS is used.
.PP
\&\fBrole\fR is one of CR, CW, SR or SW to indicate "client reading",
"client writing", "server reading" or "server writing" respectively.
.PP
\&\fBmessage\fR is the name of a handshake message that is being or has been sent, or
is being or has been processed.
.PP
Additionally there are some special states that do not conform to the above
format. These are:
.IP TLS_ST_BEFORE 4
.IX Item "TLS_ST_BEFORE"
No handshake messages have yet been been sent or received.
.IP TLS_ST_OK 4
.IX Item "TLS_ST_OK"
Handshake message sending/processing has completed.
.IP TLS_ST_EARLY_DATA 4
.IX Item "TLS_ST_EARLY_DATA"
Early data is being processed
.IP TLS_ST_PENDING_EARLY_DATA_END 4
.IX Item "TLS_ST_PENDING_EARLY_DATA_END"
Awaiting the end of early data processing
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_in_init()\fR, \fBSSL_in_before()\fR, \fBSSL_is_init_finished()\fR, \fBSSL_in_connect_init()\fR
and \fBSSL_in_accept_init()\fR return values as indicated above.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_state()\fR returns the current handshake state.
