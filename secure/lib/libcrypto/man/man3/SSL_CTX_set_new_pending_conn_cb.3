.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb()\fR sets the new_pending_conn callback function and
associated application data argument \fIarg\fR.  When using the QUIC transport, TLS
handshake processing may occur independently from the thread which accepts the
connection that the handshake is establishing.  As such, \fBSSL\fR objects
representing the connection may be allocated and initialized prior to a call to
\&\fBSSL_accept_connection()\fR.  This registered callback may be used to decorate the 
preallocated \fBSSL\fR object or create other associations with its parent
\&\fBSSL\fR prior to a call to \fBSSL_accept_connection()\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb()\fR returns no value.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_set_new_pending_conn_cb_fn()\fR returns an integer value.  A return value of
0 indicates that the QUIC stack must discard this newly created \fBSSL\fR object,
implying that the associated new connection will not be available for handling
on a subsequent call to \fBSSL_accept_connection()\fR.  A nonzero return
value is treated as success, allowing the new connection to be enqueued to the
accept queue.

\&\fBSSL_set_ex_data\fR\|(3)
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
Callbacks in QUIC connections have some limitations to them that should be taken
into consideration when writing an application.
.Sp
.RS 4
QUIC connections may begin processing prior to when an application calls
\&\fBSSL_accept_connection()\fR on them.  As such, it may occur that callbacks are
delivered to applications' registered TLS callbacks prior to those SSL objects
being returned in \fBSSL_accept_connection()\fR.  Applications should expect this
possibility.
.Sp
In particular no references should be held on SSL objects passed to callbacks
for QUIC connections until such time as they are returned through a call to
SSL_accept_connection.
