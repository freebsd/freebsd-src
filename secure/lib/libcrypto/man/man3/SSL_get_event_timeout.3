.SH NAME
SSL_get_event_timeout \- determine when an SSL object next needs to have events
handled
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_get_event_timeout(SSL *s, struct timeval *tv, int *is_infinite);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR determines when the SSL object next needs to perform
internal processing due to the passage of time.
.PP
All arguments are required; \fItv\fR and \fIis_infinite\fR must be non-NULL.
.PP
Upon the successful return of \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR, one of the following
cases applies:
.IP \(bu 4
The SSL object has events which need to be handled immediately; The fields of
\&\fI*tv\fR are set to 0 and \fI*is_infinite\fR is set to 0.
.IP \(bu 4
The SSL object has events which need to be handled after some amount of time
(relative to the time at which \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR was called). \fI*tv\fR is
set to the amount of time after which \fBSSL_handle_events\fR\|(3) should be called
and \fI*is_infinite\fR is set to 0.
.IP \(bu 4
There are currently no timer events which require handling in the future. The
value of \fI*tv\fR is unspecified and \fI*is_infinite\fR is set to 1.
.PP
This function is currently applicable only to DTLS and QUIC connection SSL
objects. If it is called on any other kind of SSL object, it always outputs
infinity. This is considered a success condition.
.PP
For DTLS, this function can be used instead of the older
\&\fBDTLSv1_get_timeout\fR\|(3) function. Note that this function differs from
\&\fBDTLSv1_get_timeout\fR\|(3) in that the case where no timeout is active is
considered a success condition.
.PP
Note that the value output by a call to \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR may change as a
result of other calls to the SSL object.
.PP
Once the timeout expires, \fBSSL_handle_events\fR\|(3) should be called to handle any
internal processing which is due; for more information, see
\&\fBSSL_handle_events\fR\|(3).
.PP
Note that \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR supersedes the older \fBDTLSv1_get_timeout\fR\|(3)
function for all use cases.
.PP
If the call to \fBSSL_get_event_timeout()\fR fails, the values of \fI*tv\fR and
\&\fI*is_infinite\fR may still be changed and their values become unspecified.
