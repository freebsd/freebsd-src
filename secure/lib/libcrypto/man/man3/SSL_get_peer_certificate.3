SSL_get_peer_certificate,

.SH SYNOPSIS

The following function has been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0,
and can be hidden entirely by defining \fBOPENSSL_API_COMPAT\fR with a suitable
version value, see \fBopenssl_user_macros\fR\|(7):

\& X509 *SSL_get_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These functions return a pointer to the X509 certificate the
peer presented. If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is returned.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a
certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when
explicitly requested to do so by the server (see
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_verify\fR\|(3)). If an anonymous cipher
is used, no certificates are sent.
.PP
That a certificate is returned does not indicate information about the
verification state, use \fBSSL_get_verify_result\fR\|(3)
to check the verification state.
.PP
The reference count of the X509 object returned by \fBSSL_get1_peer_certificate()\fR
is incremented by one, so that it will not be destroyed when the session
containing the peer certificate is freed. The X509 object must be explicitly
freed using \fBX509_free()\fR.
.PP
The reference count of the X509 object returned by \fBSSL_get0_peer_certificate()\fR
is not incremented, and must not be freed.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_peer_certificate()\fR is an alias of \fBSSL_get1_peer_certificate()\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The following return values can occur:
.IP NULL 4
.IX Item "NULL"
No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was established.
.IP "Pointer to an X509 certificate" 4
.IX Item "Pointer to an X509 certificate"
The return value points to the certificate presented by the peer.
