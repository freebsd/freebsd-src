.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These functions can be used to seed the random generator and to check its
seeded state.
In general, manual (re\-)seeding of the default OpenSSL random generator
(\fBRAND_OpenSSL\fR\|(3)) is not necessary (but allowed), since it does (re\-)seed
itself automatically using trusted system entropy sources.
This holds unless the default RAND_METHOD has been replaced or OpenSSL was
built with automatic reseeding disabled, see \fBRAND\fR\|(7) for more details.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_status()\fR indicates whether or not the random generator has been sufficiently
seeded. If not, functions such as \fBRAND_bytes\fR\|(3) will fail.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_poll()\fR uses the system's capabilities to seed the random generator using
random input obtained from polling various trusted entropy sources.
The default choice of the entropy source can be modified at build time,
see \fBRAND\fR\|(7) for more details.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_add()\fR mixes the \fBnum\fR bytes at \fBbuf\fR into the internal state
of the random generator.
This function will not normally be needed, as mentioned above.
The \fBrandomness\fR argument is an estimate of how much randomness is
contained in
\&\fBbuf\fR, in bytes, and should be a number between zero and \fBnum\fR.
Details about sources of randomness and how to estimate their randomness
can be found in the literature; for example [NIST SP 800\-90B].
The content of \fBbuf\fR cannot be recovered from subsequent random generator output.
Applications that intend to save and restore random state in an external file
should consider using \fBRAND_load_file\fR\|(3) instead.
.PP
NOTE: In FIPS mode, random data provided by the application is not considered to
be a trusted entropy source. It is mixed into the internal state of the RNG as
additional data only and this does not count as a full reseed.
For more details, see \fBEVP_RAND\fR\|(7).
.PP
\&\fBRAND_seed()\fR is equivalent to \fBRAND_add()\fR with \fBrandomness\fR set to \fBnum\fR.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_keep_random_devices_open()\fR is used to control file descriptor
usage by the random seed sources. Some seed sources maintain open file
descriptors by default, which allows such sources to operate in a
\&\fBchroot\fR\|(2) jail without the associated device nodes being available. When
the \fBkeep\fR argument is zero, this call disables the retention of file
descriptors. Conversely, a nonzero argument enables the retention of
file descriptors. This function is usually called during initialization
and it takes effect immediately. This capability only applies to the default
provider.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_event()\fR and \fBRAND_screen()\fR are equivalent to \fBRAND_poll()\fR and exist
for compatibility reasons only. See HISTORY section below.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBRAND_status()\fR returns 1 if the random generator has been seeded
with enough data, 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_poll()\fR returns 1 if it generated seed data, 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_event()\fR returns \fBRAND_status()\fR.
.PP
The other functions do not return values.
