.SH NAME
SSL_set1_initial_peer_addr \- set the initial peer address for a QUIC connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_set1_initial_peer_addr(SSL *s, const BIO_ADDR *addr);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_set1_initial_peer_addr()\fR sets the initial destination peer address to be used
for the purposes of establishing a QUIC connection in client mode. This function
can be used only on a QUIC connection SSL object, and can be used only before a
connection attempt is first made. \fIaddr\fR must point to a \fBBIO_ADDR\fR
representing a UDP destination address of the server to connect to.
.PP
Where a QUIC connection object is provided with a write BIO which supports the
\&\fBBIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_PEER\fR control (for example, \fBBIO_s_dgram\fR), the initial
destination peer address can be detected automatically; if
\&\fBBIO_CTRL_DGRAM_GET_PEER\fR returns a valid (non\-\fBAF_UNSPEC\fR) peer address and
no valid peer address has yet been set, this will be set automatically as the
initial peer address. This behaviour can be overridden by calling
\&\fBSSL_set1_initial_peer_addr()\fR with a valid peer address explicitly.
.PP
The destination address used by QUIC may change over time in response to
connection events, such as connection migration (where supported).
\&\fBSSL_set1_initial_peer_addr()\fR configures the destination address used for initial
connection establishment, and does not confer any guarantee about the
destination address being used for communication at any later time in the
connection lifecycle.
.PP
This function makes a copy of the address passed by the caller; the \fBBIO_ADDR\fR
structure pointed to by \fIaddr\fR may be freed by the caller after this function
returns.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
