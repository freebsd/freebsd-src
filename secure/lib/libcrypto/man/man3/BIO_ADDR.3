.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBBIO_ADDR\fR type is a wrapper around all types of socket
addresses that OpenSSL deals with, currently transparently
supporting AF_INET, AF_INET6 and AF_UNIX according to what's
available on the platform at hand.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_new()\fR creates a new unfilled \fBBIO_ADDR\fR, to be used
with routines that will fill it with information, such as
\&\fBBIO_accept_ex()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_copy()\fR copies the contents of \fBsrc\fR into \fBdst\fR. Neither \fBsrc\fR or
\&\fBdst\fR can be NULL.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_dup()\fR creates a new \fBBIO_ADDR\fR, with a copy of the
address data in \fBap\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_free()\fR frees a \fBBIO_ADDR\fR created with \fBBIO_ADDR_new()\fR
or \fBBIO_ADDR_dup()\fR. If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_clear()\fR clears any data held within the provided \fBBIO_ADDR\fR and sets
it back to an uninitialised state.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_rawmake()\fR takes a protocol \fBfamily\fR, a byte array of
size \fBwherelen\fR with an address in network byte order pointed at
by \fBwhere\fR and a port number in network byte order in \fBport\fR (except
for the \fBAF_UNIX\fR protocol family, where \fBport\fR is meaningless and
therefore ignored) and populates the given \fBBIO_ADDR\fR with them.
In case this creates a \fBAF_UNIX\fR \fBBIO_ADDR\fR, \fBwherelen\fR is expected
to be the length of the path string (not including the terminating
NUL, such as the result of a call to \fBstrlen()\fR).
Read on about the addresses in "RAW ADDRESSES" below.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_family()\fR returns the protocol family of the given
\&\fBBIO_ADDR\fR.  The possible non-error results are one of the
constants AF_INET, AF_INET6 and AF_UNIX. It will also return AF_UNSPEC if the
BIO_ADDR has not been initialised.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_rawaddress()\fR will write the raw address of the given
\&\fBBIO_ADDR\fR in the area pointed at by \fBp\fR if \fBp\fR is non-NULL,
and will set \fB*l\fR to be the amount of bytes the raw address
takes up if \fBl\fR is non-NULL.
A technique to only find out the size of the address is a call
with \fBp\fR set to \fBNULL\fR.  The raw address will be in network byte
order, most significant byte first.
In case this is a \fBAF_UNIX\fR \fBBIO_ADDR\fR, \fBl\fR gets the length of the
path string (not including the terminating NUL, such as the result of
a call to \fBstrlen()\fR).
Read on about the addresses in "RAW ADDRESSES" below.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_rawport()\fR returns the raw port of the given \fBBIO_ADDR\fR.
The raw port will be in network byte order.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_hostname_string()\fR returns a character string with the
hostname of the given \fBBIO_ADDR\fR.  If \fBnumeric\fR is 1, the string
will contain the numerical form of the address.  This only works for
\&\fBBIO_ADDR\fR of the protocol families AF_INET and AF_INET6.  The
returned string has been allocated on the heap and must be freed
with \fBOPENSSL_free()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_service_string()\fR returns a character string with the
service name of the port of the given \fBBIO_ADDR\fR.  If \fBnumeric\fR
is 1, the string will contain the port number.  This only works
for \fBBIO_ADDR\fR of the protocol families AF_INET and AF_INET6.  The
returned string has been allocated on the heap and must be freed
with \fBOPENSSL_free()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_path_string()\fR returns a character string with the path
of the given \fBBIO_ADDR\fR.  This only works for \fBBIO_ADDR\fR of the
protocol family AF_UNIX.  The returned string has been allocated
on the heap and must be freed with \fBOPENSSL_free()\fR.
.SH "RAW ADDRESSES"
.IX Header "RAW ADDRESSES"
Both \fBBIO_ADDR_rawmake()\fR and \fBBIO_ADDR_rawaddress()\fR take a pointer to a
network byte order address of a specific site.  Internally, those are
treated as a pointer to \fBstruct in_addr\fR (for \fBAF_INET\fR), \fBstruct
in6_addr\fR (for \fBAF_INET6\fR) or \fBchar *\fR (for \fBAF_UNIX\fR), all
depending on the protocol family the address is for.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The string producing functions \fBBIO_ADDR_hostname_string()\fR,
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_service_string()\fR and \fBBIO_ADDR_path_string()\fR will
return \fBNULL\fR on error and leave an error indication on the
OpenSSL error stack.
.PP
\&\fBBIO_ADDR_copy()\fR returns 1 on success or 0 on error.
.PP
All other functions described here return 0 or \fBNULL\fR when the
information they should return isn't available.
