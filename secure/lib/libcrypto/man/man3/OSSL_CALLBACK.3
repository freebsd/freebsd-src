.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
For certain events or activities, provider functionality may need help from
the application or the calling OpenSSL libraries themselves.  For example,
user input or direct (possibly optional) user output could be implemented
this way.
.PP
Callback functions themselves are always provided by or through the calling
OpenSSL libraries, along with a generic pointer to data \fIarg\fR.  As far as
the function receiving the pointer to the function pointer and \fIarg\fR is
concerned, the data that \fIarg\fR points at is opaque, and the pointer should
simply be passed back to the callback function when it's called.
.IP \fBOSSL_CALLBACK\fR 4
.IX Item "OSSL_CALLBACK"
This is a generic callback function.  When calling this callback function,
the caller is expected to build an \fBOSSL_PARAM\fR\|(3) array of data it wants or
is expected to pass back, and pass that as \fIparams\fR, as well as the opaque
data pointer it received, as \fIarg\fR.
.IP \fBOSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK\fR 4
.IX Item "OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK"
This is a specialised callback function, used specifically to prompt the
user for a passphrase.  When calling this callback function, a buffer to
store the pass phrase needs to be given with \fIpass\fR, and its size with
\&\fIpass_size\fR.  The length of the prompted pass phrase will be given back in
\&\fI*pass_len\fR.
.Sp
Additional parameters can be passed with the \fBOSSL_PARAM\fR\|(3) array \fIparams\fR,
