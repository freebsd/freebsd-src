.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All of the functions described on this page are deprecated.
Applications should instead use the provider APIs.
.PP
These functions create, manipulate, and use cryptographic modules in the
form of \fBENGINE\fR objects. These objects act as containers for
implementations of cryptographic algorithms, and support a
reference-counted mechanism to allow them to be dynamically loaded in and
out of the running application.
.PP
The cryptographic functionality that can be provided by an \fBENGINE\fR
implementation includes the following abstractions;
.PP
.Vb 6
\& RSA_METHOD \- for providing alternative RSA implementations
\& DSA_METHOD, DH_METHOD, RAND_METHOD, ECDH_METHOD, ECDSA_METHOD,
\&       \- similarly for other OpenSSL APIs
\& EVP_CIPHER \- potentially multiple cipher algorithms (indexed by \*(Aqnid\*(Aq)
\& EVP_DIGEST \- potentially multiple hash algorithms (indexed by \*(Aqnid\*(Aq)
\& key\-loading \- loading public and/or private EVP_PKEY keys
.Ve
.SS "Reference counting and handles"
.IX Subsection "Reference counting and handles"
Due to the modular nature of the ENGINE API, pointers to ENGINEs need to be
treated as handles \- i.e. not only as pointers, but also as references to
the underlying ENGINE object. Ie. one should obtain a new reference when
making copies of an ENGINE pointer if the copies will be used (and
released) independently.
.PP
ENGINE objects have two levels of reference-counting to match the way in
which the objects are used. At the most basic level, each ENGINE pointer is
inherently a \fBstructural\fR reference \- a structural reference is required
to use the pointer value at all, as this kind of reference is a guarantee
that the structure can not be deallocated until the reference is released.
.PP
However, a structural reference provides no guarantee that the ENGINE is
initialised and able to use any of its cryptographic
implementations. Indeed it's quite possible that most ENGINEs will not
initialise at all in typical environments, as ENGINEs are typically used to
support specialised hardware. To use an ENGINE's functionality, you need a
\&\fBfunctional\fR reference. This kind of reference can be considered a
specialised form of structural reference, because each functional reference
implicitly contains a structural reference as well \- however to avoid
difficult-to-find programming bugs, it is recommended to treat the two
kinds of reference independently. If you have a functional reference to an
ENGINE, you have a guarantee that the ENGINE has been initialised and
is ready to perform cryptographic operations, and will remain initialised
until after you have released your reference.
.PP
\&\fIStructural references\fR
.PP
This basic type of reference is used for instantiating new ENGINEs,
iterating across OpenSSL's internal linked-list of loaded
ENGINEs, reading information about an ENGINE, etc. Essentially a structural
reference is sufficient if you only need to query or manipulate the data of
an ENGINE implementation rather than use its functionality.
.PP
The \fBENGINE_new()\fR function returns a structural reference to a new (empty)
ENGINE object. There are other ENGINE API functions that return structural
references such as; \fBENGINE_by_id()\fR, \fBENGINE_get_first()\fR, \fBENGINE_get_last()\fR,
\&\fBENGINE_get_next()\fR, \fBENGINE_get_prev()\fR. All structural references should be
released by a corresponding to call to the \fBENGINE_free()\fR function \- the
ENGINE object itself will only actually be cleaned up and deallocated when
the last structural reference is released. If the argument to \fBENGINE_free()\fR
is NULL, nothing is done.
.PP
It should also be noted that many ENGINE API function calls that accept a
structural reference will internally obtain another reference \- typically
this happens whenever the supplied ENGINE will be needed by OpenSSL after
the function has returned. Eg. the function to add a new ENGINE to
OpenSSL's internal list is \fBENGINE_add()\fR \- if this function returns success,
then OpenSSL will have stored a new structural reference internally so the
caller is still responsible for freeing their own reference with
\&\fBENGINE_free()\fR when they are finished with it. In a similar way, some
functions will automatically release the structural reference passed to it
if part of the function's job is to do so. Eg. the \fBENGINE_get_next()\fR and
\&\fBENGINE_get_prev()\fR functions are used for iterating across the internal
ENGINE list \- they will return a new structural reference to the next (or
previous) ENGINE in the list or NULL if at the end (or beginning) of the
list, but in either case the structural reference passed to the function is
released on behalf of the caller.
.PP
To clarify a particular function's handling of references, one should
always consult that function's documentation "man" page, or failing that
the \fI<openssl/engine.h>\fR header file includes some hints.
.PP
\&\fIFunctional references\fR
.PP
As mentioned, functional references exist when the cryptographic
functionality of an ENGINE is required to be available. A functional
reference can be obtained in one of two ways; from an existing structural
reference to the required ENGINE, or by asking OpenSSL for the default
operational ENGINE for a given cryptographic purpose.
.PP
To obtain a functional reference from an existing structural reference,
call the \fBENGINE_init()\fR function. This returns zero if the ENGINE was not
already operational and couldn't be successfully initialised (e.g. lack of
system drivers, no special hardware attached, etc), otherwise it will
return nonzero to indicate that the ENGINE is now operational and will
have allocated a new \fBfunctional\fR reference to the ENGINE. All functional
references are released by calling \fBENGINE_finish()\fR (which removes the
implicit structural reference as well).
.PP
The second way to get a functional reference is by asking OpenSSL for a
default implementation for a given task, e.g. by \fBENGINE_get_default_RSA()\fR,
\&\fBENGINE_get_default_cipher_engine()\fR, etc. These are discussed in the next
section, though they are not usually required by application programmers as
they are used automatically when creating and using the relevant
algorithm-specific types in OpenSSL, such as RSA, DSA, EVP_CIPHER_CTX, etc.
.SS "Default implementations"
.IX Subsection "Default implementations"
For each supported abstraction, the ENGINE code maintains an internal table
of state to control which implementations are available for a given
abstraction and which should be used by default. These implementations are
registered in the tables and indexed by an 'nid' value, because
abstractions like EVP_CIPHER and EVP_DIGEST support many distinct
algorithms and modes, and ENGINEs can support arbitrarily many of them.
In the case of other abstractions like RSA, DSA, etc, there is only one
"algorithm" so all implementations implicitly register using the same 'nid'
index.
.PP
When a default ENGINE is requested for a given abstraction/algorithm/mode, (e.g.
when calling RSA_new_method(NULL)), a "get_default" call will be made to the
ENGINE subsystem to process the corresponding state table and return a
functional reference to an initialised ENGINE whose implementation should be
used. If no ENGINE should (or can) be used, it will return NULL and the caller
will operate with a NULL ENGINE handle \- this usually equates to using the
conventional software implementation. In the latter case, OpenSSL will from
then on behave the way it used to before the ENGINE API existed.
.PP
Each state table has a flag to note whether it has processed this
"get_default" query since the table was last modified, because to process
this question it must iterate across all the registered ENGINEs in the
table trying to initialise each of them in turn, in case one of them is
operational. If it returns a functional reference to an ENGINE, it will
also cache another reference to speed up processing future queries (without
needing to iterate across the table). Likewise, it will cache a NULL
response if no ENGINE was available so that future queries won't repeat the
same iteration unless the state table changes. This behaviour can also be
changed; if the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT flag is set (using
\&\fBENGINE_set_table_flags()\fR), no attempted initialisations will take place,
instead the only way for the state table to return a non-NULL ENGINE to the
"get_default" query will be if one is expressly set in the table. Eg.
\&\fBENGINE_set_default_RSA()\fR does the same job as \fBENGINE_register_RSA()\fR except
that it also sets the state table's cached response for the "get_default"
query. In the case of abstractions like EVP_CIPHER, where implementations are
indexed by 'nid', these flags and cached-responses are distinct for each 'nid'
value.
.SS "Application requirements"
.IX Subsection "Application requirements"
This section will explain the basic things an application programmer should
support to make the most useful elements of the ENGINE functionality
available to the user. The first thing to consider is whether the
programmer wishes to make alternative ENGINE modules available to the
application and user. OpenSSL maintains an internal linked list of
"visible" ENGINEs from which it has to operate \- at start-up, this list is
empty and in fact if an application does not call any ENGINE API calls and
it uses static linking against openssl, then the resulting application
binary will not contain any alternative ENGINE code at all. So the first
consideration is whether any/all available ENGINE implementations should be
made visible to OpenSSL \- this is controlled by calling the various "load"
functions.
.PP
The fact that ENGINEs are made visible to OpenSSL (and thus are linked into
the program and loaded into memory at run-time) does not mean they are
"registered" or called into use by OpenSSL automatically \- that behaviour
is something for the application to control. Some applications
will want to allow the user to specify exactly which ENGINE they want used
if any is to be used at all. Others may prefer to load all support and have
OpenSSL automatically use at run-time any ENGINE that is able to
successfully initialise \- i.e. to assume that this corresponds to
acceleration hardware attached to the machine or some such thing. There are
probably numerous other ways in which applications may prefer to handle
things, so we will simply illustrate the consequences as they apply to a
couple of simple cases and leave developers to consider these and the
source code to openssl's built-in utilities as guides.
.PP
If no ENGINE API functions are called within an application, then OpenSSL
will not allocate any internal resources.  Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.0, however,
if any ENGINEs are loaded, even if not registered or used, it was necessary to
call \fBENGINE_cleanup()\fR before the program exits.
.PP
\&\fIUsing a specific ENGINE implementation\fR
.PP
Here we'll assume an application has been configured by its user or admin
to want to use the "ACME" ENGINE if it is available in the version of
OpenSSL the application was compiled with. If it is available, it should be
used by default for all RSA, DSA, and symmetric cipher operations, otherwise
OpenSSL should use its built-in software as per usual. The following code
illustrates how to approach this;
.PP
.Vb 10
\& ENGINE *e;
\& const char *engine_id = "ACME";
\& ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
\& e = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);
\& if (!e)
\&     /* the engine isn\*(Aqt available */
\&     return;
\& if (!ENGINE_init(e)) {
\&     /* the engine couldn\*(Aqt initialise, release \*(Aqe\*(Aq */
\&     ENGINE_free(e);
\&     return;
\& }
\& if (!ENGINE_set_default_RSA(e))
\&     /*
\&      * This should only happen when \*(Aqe\*(Aq can\*(Aqt initialise, but the previous
\&      * statement suggests it did.
\&      */
\&     abort();
\& ENGINE_set_default_DSA(e);
\& ENGINE_set_default_ciphers(e);
\& /* Release the functional reference from ENGINE_init() */
\& ENGINE_finish(e);
\& /* Release the structural reference from ENGINE_by_id() */
\& ENGINE_free(e);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIAutomatically using built-in ENGINE implementations\fR
.PP
Here we'll assume we want to load and register all ENGINE implementations
bundled with OpenSSL, such that for any cryptographic algorithm required by
OpenSSL \- if there is an ENGINE that implements it and can be initialised,
it should be used. The following code illustrates how this can work;
.PP
.Vb 4
\& /* Load all bundled ENGINEs into memory and make them visible */
\& ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
\& /* Register all of them for every algorithm they collectively implement */
\& ENGINE_register_all_complete();
.Ve
.PP
That's all that's required. Eg. the next time OpenSSL tries to set up an
RSA key, any bundled ENGINEs that implement RSA_METHOD will be passed to
\&\fBENGINE_init()\fR and if any of those succeed, that ENGINE will be set as the
default for RSA use from then on.
.SS "Advanced configuration support"
.IX Subsection "Advanced configuration support"
There is a mechanism supported by the ENGINE framework that allows each
ENGINE implementation to define an arbitrary set of configuration
"commands" and expose them to OpenSSL and any applications based on
OpenSSL. This mechanism is entirely based on the use of name-value pairs
and assumes ASCII input (no unicode or UTF for now!), so it is ideal if
applications want to provide a transparent way for users to provide
arbitrary configuration "directives" directly to such ENGINEs. It is also
possible for the application to dynamically interrogate the loaded ENGINE
implementations for the names, descriptions, and input flags of their
available "control commands", providing a more flexible configuration
scheme. However, if the user is expected to know which ENGINE device he/she
is using (in the case of specialised hardware, this goes without saying)
then applications may not need to concern themselves with discovering the
supported control commands and simply prefer to pass settings into ENGINEs
exactly as they are provided by the user.
.PP
Before illustrating how control commands work, it is worth mentioning what
they are typically used for. Broadly speaking there are two uses for
control commands; the first is to provide the necessary details to the
implementation (which may know nothing at all specific to the host system)
so that it can be initialised for use. This could include the path to any
driver or config files it needs to load, required network addresses,
smart-card identifiers, passwords to initialise protected devices,
logging information, etc etc. This class of commands typically needs to be
passed to an ENGINE \fBbefore\fR attempting to initialise it, i.e. before
calling \fBENGINE_init()\fR. The other class of commands consist of settings or
operations that tweak certain behaviour or cause certain operations to take
place, and these commands may work either before or after \fBENGINE_init()\fR, or
in some cases both. ENGINE implementations should provide indications of
this in the descriptions attached to built-in control commands and/or in
external product documentation.
.PP
\&\fIIssuing control commands to an ENGINE\fR
.PP
Let's illustrate by example; a function for which the caller supplies the
name of the ENGINE it wishes to use, a table of string-pairs for use before
initialisation, and another table for use after initialisation. Note that
the string-pairs used for control commands consist of a command "name"
followed by the command "parameter" \- the parameter could be NULL in some
cases but the name can not. This function should initialise the ENGINE
(issuing the "pre" commands beforehand and the "post" commands afterwards)
and set it as the default for everything except RAND and then return a
boolean success or failure.

Note that \fBENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string()\fR accepts a boolean argument that can
relax the semantics of the function \- if set nonzero it will only return
failure if the ENGINE supported the given command name but failed while
executing it, if the ENGINE doesn't support the command name it will simply
return success without doing anything. In this case we assume the user is
only supplying commands specific to the given ENGINE so we set this to
FALSE.
.PP
\&\fIDiscovering supported control commands\fR
.PP
It is possible to discover at run-time the names, numerical-ids, descriptions
and input parameters of the control commands supported by an ENGINE using a
structural reference. Note that some control commands are defined by OpenSSL
itself and it will intercept and handle these control commands on behalf of the
ENGINE, i.e. the ENGINE's \fBctrl()\fR handler is not used for the control command.
\&\fI<openssl/engine.h>\fR defines an index, ENGINE_CMD_BASE, that all control
commands implemented by ENGINEs should be numbered from. Any command value
lower than this symbol is considered a "generic" command is handled directly
by the OpenSSL core routines.
.PP
It is using these "core" control commands that one can discover the control
commands implemented by a given ENGINE, specifically the commands:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FROM_NAME
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_LEN_FROM_CMD
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_NAME_FROM_CMD
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_LEN_FROM_CMD
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_DESC_FROM_CMD
\& ENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FLAGS
.Ve
.PP
Whilst these commands are automatically processed by the OpenSSL framework code,
they use various properties exposed by each ENGINE to process these
queries. An ENGINE has 3 properties it exposes that can affect how this behaves;
it can supply a \fBctrl()\fR handler, it can specify ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL in
the ENGINE's flags, and it can expose an array of control command descriptions.
If an ENGINE specifies the ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL flag, then it will
simply pass all these "core" control commands directly to the ENGINE's \fBctrl()\fR
handler (and thus, it must have supplied one), so it is up to the ENGINE to
reply to these "discovery" commands itself. If that flag is not set, then the
OpenSSL framework code will work with the following rules:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& if no ctrl() handler supplied;
\&     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns FALSE (zero),
\&     all other commands fail.
\& if a ctrl() handler was supplied but no array of control commands;
\&     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,
\&     all other commands fail.
\& if a ctrl() handler and array of control commands was supplied;
\&     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,
\&     all other commands proceed processing ...
.Ve
.PP
If the ENGINE's array of control commands is empty then all other commands will
fail, otherwise; ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE returns the identifier of
the first command supported by the ENGINE, ENGINE_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE takes the
identifier of a command supported by the ENGINE and returns the next command
identifier or fails if there are no more, ENGINE_CMD_FROM_NAME takes a string
name for a command and returns the corresponding identifier or fails if no such
command name exists, and the remaining commands take a command identifier and
return properties of the corresponding commands. All except
ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS return the string length of a command name or description,
or populate a supplied character buffer with a copy of the command name or
description. ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS returns a bitwise-OR'd mask of the following
possible values:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NUMERIC
\& ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_STRING
\& ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_NO_INPUT
\& ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL
.Ve
.PP
If the ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL flag is set, then any other flags are purely
informational to the caller \- this flag will prevent the command being usable
for any higher-level ENGINE functions such as \fBENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string()\fR.
"INTERNAL" commands are not intended to be exposed to text-based configuration
by applications, administrations, users, etc. These can support arbitrary
operations via \fBENGINE_ctrl()\fR, including passing to and/or from the control
commands data of any arbitrary type. These commands are supported in the
discovery mechanisms simply to allow applications to determine if an ENGINE
supports certain specific commands it might want to use (e.g. application "foo"
might query various ENGINEs to see if they implement "FOO_GET_VENDOR_LOGO_GIF" \-
and ENGINE could therefore decide whether or not to support this "foo"\-specific
extension).
