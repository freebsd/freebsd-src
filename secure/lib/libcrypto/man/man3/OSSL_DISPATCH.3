.SH NAME
OSSL_DISPATCH, OSSL_DISPATCH_END \- OpenSSL Core type to define a dispatchable function table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/core.h>
\&
\& typedef struct ossl_dispatch_st OSSL_DISPATCH;
\& struct ossl_dispatch_st {
\&     int function_id;
\&     void (*function)(void);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This type is a tuple of function identity and function pointer.
Arrays of this type are passed between the OpenSSL libraries and the
providers to describe what functionality one side provides to the other.
.PP
Arrays of this type must be terminated with the OSSL_DISPATCH_END macro.
.SS "\fBOSSL_DISPATCH\fP fields"
.IX Subsection "OSSL_DISPATCH fields"
.IP \fIfunction_id\fR 4
.IX Item "function_id"
OpenSSL defined function identity of the implemented function.
.IP \fIfunction\fR 4
.IX Item "function"
Pointer to the implemented function itself.  Despite the generic definition
of this field, the implemented function it points to must have a function
signature that corresponds to the \fIfunction_id\fR
.PP
Available function identities and corresponding function signatures are
defined in \fBopenssl\-core_dispatch.h\fR\|(7).
Furthermore, the chosen function identities and associated function
signature must be chosen specifically for the operation that it's intended
for, as determined by the intended \fBOSSL_ALGORITHM\fR\|(3) array.
.PP
Any function identity not recognised by the recipient of this type
will be ignored.
This ensures that providers built with one OpenSSL version in mind
will work together with any other OpenSSL version that supports this
mechanism.
