.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These functions help the application to fetch supported objects (see
"SUPPORTED OBJECTS" in \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR\|(3) for information on which those are)
from a given URI.
The general method to do so is to "open" the URI using \fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR,
read each available and supported object using \fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR as long as
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR hasn't been reached, and finish it off with \fBOSSL_STORE_close()\fR.
.PP
The retrieved information is stored in a \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR, which is further
described in \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR\|(3).
.SS Types
.IX Subsection "Types"
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR is a context variable that holds all the internal
information for \fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR, \fBOSSL_STORE_open_ex()\fR,
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR, \fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR and \fBOSSL_STORE_close()\fR to work
together.
.SS Functions
.IX Subsection "Functions"
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_open_ex()\fR takes a uri or path \fIuri\fR, password UI method
\&\fIui_method\fR with associated data \fIui_data\fR, and post processing
callback \fIpost_process\fR with associated data \fIpost_process_data\fR,
a library context \fIlibctx\fR with an associated property query \fIpropq\fR,
and opens a channel to the data located at the URI and returns a
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR with all necessary internal information.
The given \fIui_method\fR and \fIui_data\fR will be reused by all
functions that use \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR when interaction is needed,
for instance to provide a password.
The auxiliary \fBOSSL_PARAM\fR\|(3) parameters in \fIparams\fR can be set to further
modify the store operation.
The given \fIpost_process\fR and \fIpost_process_data\fR will be reused by
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR to manipulate or drop the value to be returned.
The \fIpost_process\fR function drops values by returning NULL, which
will cause \fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR to start its process over with loading
the next object, until \fIpost_process\fR returns something other than
NULL, or the end of data is reached as indicated by \fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR is similar to \fBOSSL_STORE_open_ex()\fR but uses NULL for
the \fIparams\fR, the library context \fIlibctx\fR and property query \fIpropq\fR.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_ctrl()\fR takes a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR, and command number \fIcmd\fR and
more arguments not specified here.
The available loader specific command numbers and arguments they each
take depends on the loader that's used and is documented together with
that loader.
.PP
There are also global controls available:
.IP \fBOSSL_STORE_C_USE_SECMEM\fR 4
.IX Item "OSSL_STORE_C_USE_SECMEM"
Controls if the loader should attempt to use secure memory for any
allocated \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR and its contents.
This control expects one argument, a pointer to an \fIint\fR that is expected to
have the value 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
Any other value is an error.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR takes a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR and tries to load the next
available object and return it wrapped with \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_delete()\fR deletes the object identified by \fIuri\fR.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR takes a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR and checks if we've reached the end
of data.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_error()\fR takes a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR and checks if an error occurred in
the last \fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR call.
Note that it may still be meaningful to try and load more objects, unless
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR shows that the end of data has been reached.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_close()\fR takes a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR, closes the channel that was opened
by \fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR and frees all other information that was stored in the
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR, as well as the \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR itself.
If \fIctx\fR is NULL it does nothing.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
A string without a scheme prefix (that is, a non-URI string) is
implicitly interpreted as using the \fIfile:\fR scheme.
.PP
There are some tools that can be used together with
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR to determine if any failure is caused by an unparsable
URI, or if it's a different error (such as memory allocation
failures); if the URI was parsable but the scheme unregistered, the
top error will have the reason \f(CW\*(C`OSSL_STORE_R_UNREGISTERED_SCHEME\*(C'\fR.
.PP
These functions make no direct assumption regarding the pass phrase received
from the password callback.
The loaders may make assumptions, however.
For example, the \fBfile:\fR scheme loader inherits the assumptions made by
OpenSSL functionality that handles the different file types; this is mostly
relevant for PKCS#12 objects.
See \fBpassphrase\-encoding\fR\|(7) for further information.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_open()\fR returns a pointer to a \fBOSSL_STORE_CTX\fR on success, or
NULL on failure.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR returns a pointer to a \fBOSSL_STORE_INFO\fR on success, or NULL
on error or when end of data is reached.
Use \fBOSSL_STORE_error()\fR and \fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR to determine the meaning of a
returned NULL.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_eof()\fR returns 1 if the end of data has been reached
or an error occurred, 0 otherwise.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_error()\fR returns 1 if an error occurred in an \fBOSSL_STORE_load()\fR call,
otherwise 0.
.PP
\&\fBOSSL_STORE_delete()\fR, \fBOSSL_STORE_ctrl()\fR and \fBOSSL_STORE_close()\fR return 1 on
success, or 0 on failure.
