.SH NAME
SSL_set_session \- set a TLS/SSL session to be used during TLS/SSL connect
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_set_session(SSL *ssl, SSL_SESSION *session);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_set_session()\fR sets \fBsession\fR to be used when the TLS/SSL connection
is to be established. \fBSSL_set_session()\fR is only useful for TLS/SSL clients.
When the session is set, the reference count of \fBsession\fR is incremented
by 1. If the session is not reused, the reference count is decremented
again during \fBSSL_connect()\fR. Whether the session was reused can be queried
with the \fBSSL_session_reused\fR\|(3) call.
.PP
If there is already a session set inside \fBssl\fR (because it was set with
\&\fBSSL_set_session()\fR before or because the same \fBssl\fR was already used for
a connection), \fBSSL_SESSION_free()\fR will be called for that session.
This is also the case when \fBsession\fR is a NULL pointer. If that old
session is still \fBopen\fR, it is considered bad and will be removed from the
session cache (if used). A session is considered open, if \fBSSL_shutdown\fR\|(3) was
not called for the connection (or at least \fBSSL_set_shutdown\fR\|(3) was used to
set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state).
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about the session cache
list, when being inserted into one SSL_CTX object's session cache.
One SSL_SESSION object, regardless of its reference count, must therefore
only be used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects created
from this SSL_CTX object).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
The following return values can occur:
.IP 0 4
The operation failed; check the error stack to find out the reason.
.IP 1 4
.IX Item "1"
The operation succeeded.
