.SH NAME
CMS_final, CMS_final_digest \- finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/cms.h>
\&
\& int CMS_final(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);
\& int CMS_final_digest(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, const unsigned char *md,
\&                      unsigned int mdlen, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBCMS_final()\fR finalises the structure \fBcms\fR. Its purpose is to perform any
operations necessary on \fBcms\fR (digest computation for example) and set the
appropriate fields. The parameter \fBdata\fR contains the content to be
processed. The \fBdcont\fR parameter contains a BIO to write content to after
processing: this is only used with detached data and will usually be set to
NULL.
.PP
\&\fBCMS_final_digest()\fR finalises the structure \fBcms\fR using a pre-computed digest,
rather than computing the digest from the original data.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
These functions will normally be called when the \fBCMS_PARTIAL\fR flag is used. It
should only be used when streaming is not performed because the streaming
I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.
.PP
To sign a pre-computed digest, \fBCMS_sign\fR\|(3) or \fBCMS_sign_ex()\fR is called
with the \fBdata\fR parameter set to NULL before the CMS structure is finalised
with the digest provided to \fBCMS_final_digest()\fR in binary form.
When signing a pre-computed digest, the security relies on the digest and its
computation from the original message being trusted.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBCMS_final()\fR and \fBCMS_final_digest()\fR return 1 for success or 0 for failure.

\&\fBCMS_final_digest()\fR was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
