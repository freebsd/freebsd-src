.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt()\fR, \fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_OBJ()\fR and
\&\fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_NID()\fR add a field whose name is defined
by a string \fBfield\fR, an object \fBobj\fR or a NID \fBnid\fR respectively.
The field value to be added is in \fBbytes\fR of length \fBlen\fR. If
\&\fBlen\fR is \-1 then the field length is calculated internally using
strlen(bytes).
.PP
The type of field is determined by \fBtype\fR which can either be a
definition of the type of \fBbytes\fR (such as \fBMBSTRING_ASC\fR) or a
standard ASN1 type (such as \fBV_ASN1_IA5STRING\fR). The new entry is
added to a position determined by \fBloc\fR and \fBset\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_NAME_add_entry()\fR adds a copy of \fBX509_NAME_ENTRY\fR structure \fBne\fR
to \fBname\fR. The new entry is added to a position determined by \fBloc\fR
and \fBset\fR. Since a copy of \fBne\fR is added \fBne\fR must be freed up after
the call.
.PP
\&\fBX509_NAME_delete_entry()\fR deletes an entry from \fBname\fR at position
\&\fBloc\fR. The deleted entry is returned and must be freed up.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The use of string types such as \fBMBSTRING_ASC\fR or \fBMBSTRING_UTF8\fR
is strongly recommended for the \fBtype\fR parameter. This allows the
internal code to correctly determine the type of the field and to
apply length checks according to the relevant standards. This is
done using \fBASN1_STRING_set_by_NID()\fR.
.PP
If instead an ASN1 type is used no checks are performed and the
supplied data in \fBbytes\fR is used directly.
.PP
In \fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt()\fR the \fBfield\fR string represents
the field name using OBJ_txt2obj(field, 0).
.PP
The \fBloc\fR and \fBset\fR parameters determine where a new entry should
be added. For almost all applications \fBloc\fR can be set to \-1 and \fBset\fR
to 0. This adds a new entry to the end of \fBname\fR as a single valued
RelativeDistinguishedName (RDN).
.PP
\&\fBloc\fR actually determines the index where the new entry is inserted:
if it is \-1 it is appended.
.PP
\&\fBset\fR determines how the new type is added.
If it is zero a new RDN is created.
.PP
If \fBset\fR is \-1 or 1 it is added as a new set member
to the previous or next RDN structure, respectively.
This will then become part of a multi-valued RDN (containing a set of AVAs).
Since multi-valued RDNs are very rarely used \fBset\fR typically will be zero.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt()\fR, \fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_OBJ()\fR,
\&\fBX509_NAME_add_entry_by_NID()\fR and \fBX509_NAME_add_entry()\fR return 1 for
success of 0 if an error occurred.
.PP
\&\fBX509_NAME_delete_entry()\fR returns either the deleted \fBX509_NAME_ENTRY\fR
structure or \fBNULL\fR if an error occurred.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"

\&     /* Error */
\& if (!X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt(nm, "O", MBSTRING_ASC,
\&                                 "Disorganized Organization", \-1, \-1, 0))
\&     /* Error */
\& if (!X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt(nm, "CN", MBSTRING_ASC,
\&                                 "Joe Bloggs", \-1, \-1, 0))
\&     /* Error */
.Ve
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
\&\fBtype\fR can still be set to \fBV_ASN1_APP_CHOOSE\fR to use a
different algorithm to determine field types. Since this form does
not understand multicharacter types, performs no length checks and
can result in invalid field types its use is strongly discouraged.
