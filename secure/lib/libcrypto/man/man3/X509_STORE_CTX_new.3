.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These functions initialise an \fBX509_STORE_CTX\fR structure for subsequent use
by \fBX509_verify_cert\fR\|(3) or \fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify\fR\|(3).
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_new_ex()\fR returns a newly initialised \fBX509_STORE_CTX\fR
structure associated with the specified library context \fIlibctx\fR and property
query string \fIpropq\fR. Any cryptographic algorithms fetched while performing
processing with the X509_STORE_CTX will use that library context and property
query string.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_new()\fR is the same as \fBX509_STORE_CTX_new_ex()\fR except that
the default library context and a NULL property query string are used.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_cleanup()\fR internally cleans up an \fBX509_STORE_CTX\fR structure.
It is used by \fBX509_STORE_CTX_init()\fR and \fBX509_STORE_CTX_free()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_free()\fR completely frees up \fIctx\fR. After this call \fIctx\fR
is no longer valid.
If \fIctx\fR is NULL nothing is done.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_init()\fR sets up \fIctx\fR for a subsequent verification operation.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_init()\fR initializes the internal state and resources of the
given \fIctx\fR. Among others, it sets the verification parameters associated
with the method name \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, which includes the \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR purpose,
and takes over callback function pointers from \fItrust_store\fR (unless NULL).
It must be called before each call to \fBX509_verify_cert\fR\|(3) or
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify\fR\|(3), i.e., a context is only good for one verification.
If you want to verify a further certificate or chain with the same \fIctx\fR
then you must call \fBX509_STORE_CTX_init()\fR again.
The trusted certificate store is set to \fItrust_store\fR of type \fBX509_STORE\fR.
This may be NULL because there are no trusted certificates or because
they are provided simply as a list using \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack()\fR.
The certificate to be verified is set to \fItarget\fR,
and a list of additional certificates may be provided in \fIuntrusted\fR,
which will be untrusted but may be used to build the chain.
The \fItarget\fR certificate is not copied (its reference count is not updated),
and the caller must not free it before verification is complete.
Each of the \fItrust_store\fR, \fItarget\fR and \fIuntrusted\fR parameters can be NULL.
Yet note that \fBX509_verify_cert\fR\|(3) and \fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify\fR\|(3)
will need a verification target.
This can also be set using \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_cert()\fR.
For \fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify\fR\|(3), which takes by default the first element of the
list of untrusted certificates as its verification target,
this can be also set indirectly using \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_untrusted()\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_init_rpk()\fR sets up \fIctx\fR for a subsequent verification
operation for the \fItarget\fR raw public key.
It behaves similarly to \fBX509_STORE_CTX_init()\fR.
The \fItarget\fR raw public key can also be supplied separately, via
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_rpk()\fR.
The \fItarget\fR public key is not copied (its reference count is not updated),
and the caller must not free it before verification is complete.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack()\fR sets the set of trusted certificates of
\&\fIctx\fR to \fIsk\fR. This is an alternative way of specifying trusted certificates
instead of using an \fBX509_STORE\fR where its complexity is not needed
or to make sure that only the given set \fIsk\fR of certificates are trusted.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_cert()\fR sets the target certificate to be verified in \fIctx\fR
to \fItarget\fR.
The target certificate is not copied (its reference count is not updated),
and the caller must not free it before verification is complete.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_rpk()\fR sets the target raw public key to be verified in \fIctx\fR
to \fItarget\fR, a non-NULL raw public key preempts any target certificate, which
is then ignored.
The \fItarget\fR public key is not copied (its reference count is not updated),
and the caller must not free it before verification is complete.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_verified_chain()\fR sets the validated chain to \fIchain\fR.
Ownership of the chain is transferred to \fIctx\fR,
and so it should not be free'd by the caller.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get0_chain()\fR returns the internal pointer used by the
\&\fIctx\fR that contains the constructed (output) chain.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get0_rpk()\fR returns the internal pointer used by the
\&\fIctx\fR that contains the raw public key.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_crls()\fR sets a set of CRLs to use to aid certificate
verification to \fIsk\fR. These CRLs will only be used if CRL verification is
enabled in the associated \fBX509_VERIFY_PARAM\fR structure. This might be
used where additional "useful" CRLs are supplied as part of a protocol,
for example in a PKCS#7 structure.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get0_param()\fR retrieves an internal pointer
to the verification parameters associated with \fIctx\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_param()\fR sets the internal verification parameter pointer
to \fIparam\fR. After this call \fBparam\fR should not be used.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get0_untrusted()\fR retrieves an internal pointer to the
stack of untrusted certificates associated with \fIctx\fR.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_untrusted()\fR sets the internal pointer to the stack
of untrusted certificates associated with \fIctx\fR to \fIsk\fR.
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify()\fR will take the first element, if any,
as its default target if the target certificate is not set explicitly.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get_num_untrusted()\fR returns the number of untrusted certificates
that were used in building the chain.
This is can be used after calling \fBX509_verify_cert\fR\|(3) and similar functions.
With \fBX509_STORE_CTX_verify\fR\|(3), this does not count the first chain element.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_get0_chain()\fR returns the internal pointer used by the
\&\fIctx\fR that contains the validated chain.
.PP
Details of the chain building and checking process are described in
"Certification Path Building" in \fBopenssl\-verification\-options\fR\|(1) and
"Certification Path Validation" in \fBopenssl\-verification\-options\fR\|(1).
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set0_verified_chain()\fR sets the validated chain used
by \fIctx\fR to be \fIchain\fR.
Ownership of the chain is transferred to \fIctx\fR,
and so it should not be free'd by the caller.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_default()\fR looks up and sets the default verification method.
This uses the function \fBX509_VERIFY_PARAM_lookup()\fR to find
the set of parameters associated with the given verification method \fIname\fR.
Among others, the parameters determine the trust model and verification purpose.
More detail, including the list of currently predefined methods,
is described for the \fB\-verify_name\fR command-line option
in "Verification Options" in \fBopenssl\-verification\-options\fR\|(1).
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_verify()\fR provides the capability for overriding the default
verify function. This function is responsible for verifying chain signatures and
expiration times.
.PP
A verify function is defined as an X509_STORE_CTX_verify type which has the
following signature:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& int (*verify)(X509_STORE_CTX *);
.Ve
.PP
This function should receive the current X509_STORE_CTX as a parameter and
return 1 on success or 0 on failure.
.PP
X509 certificates may contain information about what purposes keys contained
within them can be used for. For example "TLS WWW Server Authentication" or
"Email Protection". This "key usage" information is held internally to the
certificate itself. In addition the trust store containing trusted certificates
can declare what purposes we trust different certificates for. This "trust"
information is not held within the certificate itself but is "meta" information
held alongside it. This "meta" information is associated with the certificate
after it is issued and could be determined by a system administrator. For
example a certificate might declare that it is suitable for use for both
"TLS WWW Server Authentication" and "TLS Client Authentication", but a system
administrator might only trust it for the former. An X.509 certificate extension
exists that can record extended key usage information to supplement the purpose
information described above. This extended mechanism is arbitrarily extensible
and not well suited for a generic library API; applications that need to
validate extended key usage information in certificates will need to define a
custom "purpose" (see below) or supply a nondefault verification callback
(\fBX509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func\fR\|(3)).
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose()\fR sets the purpose for the target certificate being
verified in the \fIctx\fR. Built-in available values for the \fIpurpose\fR argument
are \fBX509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT\fR, \fBX509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER\fR,
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER\fR, \fBX509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN\fR,
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT\fR, \fBX509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN\fR, \fBX509_PURPOSE_ANY\fR,
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER\fR, \fBX509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN\fR and
\&\fBX509_PURPOSE_CODE_SIGN\fR.  It is also
possible to create a custom purpose value. Setting a purpose requests that
the key usage and extended key usage (EKU) extensions optionally declared within
the certificate and its chain are verified to be consistent with that purpose.
For SSL client, SSL server, and S/MIME purposes, the EKU is checked also for the
CA certificates along the chain, including any given trust anchor certificate.
Potentially also further checks are done (depending on the purpose given).
Every purpose also has an associated default trust value, which will also be set
at the same time. During verification, this trust setting will be verified
to check whether it is consistent with the trust set by the system administrator
for certificates in the chain.
.PP
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_trust()\fR sets the trust value for the target certificate
being verified in the \fIctx\fR. Built-in available values for the \fItrust\fR
argument are \fBX509_TRUST_COMPAT\fR, \fBX509_TRUST_SSL_CLIENT\fR,
\&\fBX509_TRUST_SSL_SERVER\fR, \fBX509_TRUST_EMAIL\fR, \fBX509_TRUST_OBJECT_SIGN\fR,
\&\fBX509_TRUST_OCSP_SIGN\fR, \fBX509_TRUST_OCSP_REQUEST\fR and \fBX509_TRUST_TSA\fR. It is
also possible to create a custom trust value. Since \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose()\fR
also sets the trust value it is normally sufficient to only call that function.
If both are called then \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_trust()\fR should be called after
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose()\fR since the trust setting of the last call will be
used.
.PP
It should not normally be necessary for end user applications to call
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit()\fR directly. Typically applications should call
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose()\fR or \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_trust()\fR instead. Using this
function it is possible to set the purpose and trust values for the \fIctx\fR at
the same time.
Both \fIctx\fR and its internal verification parameter pointer must not be NULL.
The \fIdef_purpose\fR and \fIpurpose\fR arguments can have the same
purpose values as described for \fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose()\fR above. The \fItrust\fR
argument can have the same trust values as described in
\&\fBX509_STORE_CTX_set_trust()\fR above. Any of the \fIdef_purpose\fR, \fIpurpose\fR or
\&\fItrust\fR values may also have the value 0 to indicate that the supplied
parameter should be ignored. After calling this function the purpose to be used
for verification is set from the \fIpurpose\fR argument unless the purpose was
already set in \fIctx\fR before, and the trust is set from the \fItrust\fR argument
unless the trust was already set in \fIctx\fR before.
If \fItrust\fR is 0 then the trust value will be set from
the default trust value for \fIpurpose\fR. If the default trust value for the
purpose is \fIX509_TRUST_DEFAULT\fR and \fItrust\fR is 0 then the default trust value
associated with the \fIdef_purpose\fR value is used for the trust setting instead.
