.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
SRTP is the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol. OpenSSL implements support for
the "use_srtp" DTLS extension defined in RFC5764. This provides a mechanism for
establishing SRTP keying material, algorithms and parameters using DTLS. This
capability may be used as part of an implementation that conforms to RFC5763.
OpenSSL does not implement SRTP itself or RFC5763. Note that OpenSSL does not
support the use of SRTP Master Key Identifiers (MKIs). Also note that this
extension is only supported in DTLS. Any SRTP configuration will be ignored if a
TLS connection is attempted.
.PP
An OpenSSL client wishing to send the "use_srtp" extension should call
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR to set its use for all SSL objects subsequently
created from an SSL_CTX. Alternatively a client may call
\&\fBSSL_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR to set its use for an individual SSL object. The
\&\fBprofiles\fR parameters should point to a NUL-terminated, colon delimited list of
SRTP protection profile names.
.PP
The currently supported protection profile names are:
.IP SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_80 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_80"
This corresponds to SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_80 defined in RFC5764.
.IP SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_32 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_32"
This corresponds to SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_32 defined in RFC5764.
.IP SRTP_AEAD_AES_128_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AEAD_AES_128_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC7714.
.IP SRTP_AEAD_AES_256_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AEAD_AES_256_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC7714.
.IP SRTP_DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8723.
.IP SRTP_DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8723.
.IP SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80 4
.IX Item "SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.IP SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32 4
.IX Item "SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.IP SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80 4
.IX Item "SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.IP SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32 4
.IX Item "SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.IP SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.IP SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM 4
.IX Item "SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM"
This corresponds to the profile of the same name defined in RFC8269.
.PP
Supplying an unrecognised protection profile name will result in an error.
.PP
An OpenSSL server wishing to support the "use_srtp" extension should also call
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR or \fBSSL_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR to indicate the
protection profiles that it is willing to negotiate.
.PP
The currently configured list of protection profiles for either a client or a
server can be obtained by calling \fBSSL_get_srtp_profiles()\fR. This returns a stack
of SRTP_PROTECTION_PROFILE objects. The memory pointed to in the return value of
this function should not be freed by the caller.
.PP
After a handshake has been completed the negotiated SRTP protection profile (if
any) can be obtained (on the client or the server) by calling
\&\fBSSL_get_selected_srtp_profile()\fR. This function will return NULL if no SRTP
protection profile was negotiated. The memory returned from this function should
not be freed by the caller.
.PP
If an SRTP protection profile has been successfully negotiated then the SRTP
keying material (on both the client and server) should be obtained via a call to
\&\fBSSL_export_keying_material\fR\|(3). This call should provide a label value of
"EXTRACTOR\-dtls_srtp" and a NULL context value (use_context is 0). The total
length of keying material obtained should be equal to two times the sum of the
master key length and the salt length as defined for the protection profile in
use. This provides the client write master key, the server write master key, the
client write master salt and the server write master salt in that order.
.PP
These functions cannot be used with QUIC SSL objects.
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR fails if called on a QUIC SSL context.
\&\fBSSL_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR fails if called on a QUIC SSL object.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_CTX_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR and \fBSSL_set_tlsext_use_srtp()\fR return 0 on success
or 1 on error.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_srtp_profiles()\fR returns a stack of SRTP_PROTECTION_PROFILE objects on
success or NULL on error or if no protection profiles have been configured.
.PP
\&\fBSSL_get_selected_srtp_profile()\fR returns a pointer to an SRTP_PROTECTION_PROFILE
object if one has been negotiated or NULL otherwise.
