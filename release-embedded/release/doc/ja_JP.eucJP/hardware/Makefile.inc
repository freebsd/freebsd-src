# Force include of the autogenerated catalog.  It has to be set
# directly in the CATALOG variable since doc.docbook.mk check if each
# catalog file exist for the other *CATALOG variables, and
# catalog-auto does not exist yet when that check is performed,
# causing catalog-auto not to be added to CATALOGS which breaks the
# build.
