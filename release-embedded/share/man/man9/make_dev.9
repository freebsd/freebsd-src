.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn make_dev_credf
function creates a
.Fa cdev
structure for a new device.
It also notifies
.Xr devfs 5
of the presence of the new device, that causes corresponding nodes
to be created.
Besides this, a
.Xr devctl 4
notification is sent.
The device will be owned by
.Va uid ,
with the group ownership as
.Va gid .
The name is the expansion of
.Va fmt
and following arguments as
.Xr printf 9
would print it.
The name determines its path under
.Pa /dev
or other
.Xr devfs 5
mount point and may contain slash
.Ql /
characters to denote subdirectories.
The permissions of the file specified in
.Va perms
are defined in
.In sys/stat.h :
.Pp

#define S_IRUSR 0000400    /* R for owner */

.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va cr
argument specifies credentials that will be stored in the
.Fa si_cred
member of the initialized
.Fa struct cdev .
The
.Va flags
argument alters the operation of
.Fn make_dev_credf
or
.Fn make_dev_p .
The following values are currently accepted:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME" -compact -offset indent
.It MAKEDEV_REF
reference the created device
.It MAKEDEV_NOWAIT
do not sleep, the call may fail
.It MAKEDEV_WAITOK
allow the function to sleep to satisfy malloc
.It MAKEDEV_ETERNAL
created device will be never destroyed
.It MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
return an error if the device name is invalid or already exists
.El
.Pp
Only
.Dv MAKEDEV_NOWAIT ,
.Dv MAKEDEV_WAITOK
and
.Dv MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
values are accepted for the
.Fn make_dev_alias_p
function.
.Pp
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_WAITOK
flag is assumed if none of
.Dv MAKEDEV_WAITOK ,
.Dv MAKEDEV_NOWAIT
is specified.
.Pp
The
.Xr dev_clone 9
event handler shall specify
.Dv MAKEDEV_REF
flag when creating a device in response to lookup, to avoid race where
the device created is destroyed immediately after
.Xr devfs_lookup 9
drops his reference to cdev.
.Pp
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_ETERNAL
flag allows the kernel to not acquire some locks when translating system
calls into the cdevsw methods calls.
It is responsibility of the driver author to make sure that
.Fn destroy_dev
is never called on the returned cdev.
For the convenience, use the
.Dv MAKEDEV_ETERNAL_KLD
flag for the code that can be compiled into kernel or loaded
(and unloaded) as loadable module.
.Pp
A panic will occur if the MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME flag is not specified
and the device name is invalid or already exists.
.Pp
The
.Fn make_dev_cred
function is equivalent to the call
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make_dev_credf(0, cdevsw, unit, cr, uid, gid, perms, fmt, ...);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn make_dev
function call is the same as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make_dev_credf(0, cdevsw, unit, NULL, uid, gid, perms, fmt, ...);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn make_dev_p
function is similar to
.Fn make_dev_credf
but it may return an error number and takes a pointer to the resulting
.Ft *cdev
as an argument.
.Pp
The
.Fn make_dev_alias
function takes the returned
.Ft cdev
from
.Fn make_dev
and makes another (aliased) name for this device.
It is an error to call
.Fn make_dev_alias
prior to calling
.Fn make_dev .
.Pp
.Fn make_dev_alias_p
function is similar to
.Fn make_dev_alias
but it takes a pointer to the resulting
.Ft *cdev
as an argument and may return an error.
.Pp
The
.Fa cdev
returned by
.Fn make_dev
and
.Fn make_dev_alias
has two fields,
.Fa si_drv1
and
.Fa si_drv2 ,
that are available to store state.
Both fields are of type
.Ft void * .
These are designed to replace the
.Fa unit
argument to
.Fn make_dev ,
which can be obtained with
.Fn dev2unit .
.Pp
The
.Fn destroy_dev
function takes the returned
.Fa cdev
from
.Fn make_dev
and destroys the registration for that device.
The notification is sent to
.Xr devctl 4
about the destruction event.
Do not call
.Fn destroy_dev
on devices that were created with
.Fn make_dev_alias .
.Pp
The
.Fn dev_depends
function establishes a parent-child relationship between two devices.
The net effect is that a
.Fn destroy_dev
of the parent device will also result in the destruction of the
child device(s),
if any exist.
A device may simultaneously be a parent and a child,
so it is possible to build a complete hierarchy.
.Pp
The
.Fn destroy_dev_sched_cb
function schedules execution of the
.Fn destroy_dev
for the specified
.Fa cdev
in the safe context.
After
.Fn destroy_dev
is finished, and if the supplied
.Fa cb
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the callback
.Fa cb
is called, with argument
.Fa arg .
The
.Fn destroy_dev_sched
function is the same as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
destroy_dev_sched_cb(cdev, NULL, NULL);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn d_close
driver method cannot call
.Fn destroy_dev
directly.
Doing so causes deadlock when
.Fn destroy_dev
waits for all threads to leave the driver methods.
Also, because
.Fn destroy_dev
sleeps, no non-sleepable locks may be held over the call.
The
.Fn destroy_dev_sched
family of functions overcome these issues.
.Pp
The device driver may call the
.Fn destroy_dev_drain
function to wait until all devices that have supplied
.Fa csw
as cdevsw, are destroyed.
This is useful when driver knows that
.Fn destroy_dev_sched
is called for all instantiated devices, but need to postpone module
unload until
.Fn destroy_dev
is actually finished for all of them.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn make_dev_p
will return 0, otherwise it will return an error.
If successful,
.Fn make_dev_credf
will return a valid
.Fa cdev
pointer, otherwise it will return
.Dv NULL .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn make_dev_p
and
.Fn make_dev_alias_p
call will fail and the device will be not registered if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_NOWAIT
flag was specified and a memory allocation request could not be satisfied.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
flag was specified and the provided device name is longer than
.Dv SPECNAMELEN .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
flag was specified and the provided device name is empty, contains a
.Qq \&.
or
.Qq ..
path component or ends with
.Ql / .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
flag was specified and the provided device name contains invalid characters.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The
.Dv MAKEDEV_CHECKNAME
flag was specified and the provided device name already exists.
