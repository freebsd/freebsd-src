** The I/O sapic driver manages the Interrupt Redirection Table which is
** the control logic to convert PCI line based interrupts into a Message
** Signaled Interrupt (aka Transaction Based Interrupt, TBI).
**
** Acronyms
** --------
** HPA  Hard Physical Address (aka MMIO address)
** IRQ  Interrupt ReQuest. Implies Line based interrupt.
** IRT	Interrupt Routing Table (provided by PAT firmware)
** IRdT Interrupt Redirection Table. IRQ line to TXN ADDR/DATA
**      table which is implemented in I/O SAPIC.
** ISR  Interrupt Service Routine. aka Interrupt handler.
** MSI	Message Signaled Interrupt. PCI 2.2 functionality.
**      aka Transaction Based Interrupt (or TBI).
** PA   Precision Architecture. HP's RISC architecture.
** RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
**
**
** What's a Message Signalled Interrupt?
** -------------------------------------
** MSI is a write transaction which targets a processor and is similar
** to a processor write to memory or MMIO. MSIs can be generated by I/O
** devices as well as processors and require *architecture* to work.
**
** PA only supports MSI. So I/O subsystems must either natively generate
** MSIs (e.g. GSC or HP-PB) or convert line based interrupts into MSIs
** (e.g. PCI and EISA).  IA64 supports MSIs via a "local SAPIC" which
** acts on behalf of a processor.
**
** MSI allows any I/O device to interrupt any processor. This makes
** load balancing of the interrupt processing possible on an SMP platform.
** Interrupts are also ordered WRT to DMA data.  It's possible on I/O
** coherent systems to completely eliminate PIO reads from the interrupt
** path. The device and driver must be designed and implemented to
** guarantee all DMA has been issued (issues about atomicity here)
** before the MSI is issued. I/O status can then safely be read from
** DMA'd data by the ISR.
**
**
** PA Firmware
** -----------
** PA-RISC platforms have two fundementally different types of firmware.
** For PCI devices, "Legacy" PDC initializes the "INTERRUPT_LINE" register
** and BARs similar to a traditional PC BIOS.
** The newer "PAT" firmware supports PDC calls which return tables.
** PAT firmware only initializes PCI Console and Boot interface.
** With these tables, the OS can progam all other PCI devices.
**
** One such PAT PDC call returns the "Interrupt Routing Table" (IRT).
** The IRT maps each PCI slot's INTA-D "output" line to an I/O SAPIC
** input line.  If the IRT is not available, this driver assumes
** INTERRUPT_LINE register has been programmed by firmware. The latter
** case also means online addition of PCI cards can NOT be supported
** even if HW support is present.
**
** All platforms with PAT firmware to date (Oct 1999) use one Interrupt
** Routing Table for the entire platform.
**
** Where's the iosapic?
** --------------------
** I/O sapic is part of the "Core Electronics Complex". And on HP platforms
** it's integrated as part of the PCI bus adapter, "lba".  So no bus walk
** will discover I/O Sapic. I/O Sapic driver learns about each device
** when lba driver advertises the presence of the I/O sapic by calling
** iosapic_register().
**
**
** IRQ region notes
** ----------------
** The data passed to iosapic_interrupt() is per IRQ line.
** Each IRQ line will get one txn_addr/data pair. Thus each IRQ region,
** will have several txn_addr/data pairs (up to 7 for current I/O SAPIC
** implementations).  The IRQ region "sysdata" will NOT be directly passed
** to the interrupt handler like GSCtoPCI (dino.c).
**
** iosapic interrupt handler will NOT call do_irq_mask().
** It doesn't need to read a bit mask to determine which IRQ line was pulled
** since it already knows based on vector_info passed to iosapic_interrupt().
**
** One IRQ number represents both an IRQ line and a driver ISR.
** The I/O sapic driver can't manage shared IRQ lines because
** additional data besides the IRQ number must be passed via
** irq_region_ops. do_irq() and request_irq() must manage
** a sharing a bit in the mask.
**
** iosapic_interrupt() replaces do_irq_mask() and calls do_irq().
** Which IRQ line was asserted is already known since each
** line has unique data associated with it. We could omit
** iosapic_interrupt() from the calling path if it did NOT need
** to write EOI. For unshared lines, it really doesn't.
**
** Unfortunately, can't optimize out EOI if IRQ line isn't "shared".
** N-class console "device" and some sort of heartbeat actually share
** one line though only one driver is registered...<sigh>...this was
** true for HP-UX at least. May not be true for parisc-linux.
**
**
** Overview of exported iosapic functions
** --------------------------------------
** (caveat: code isn't finished yet - this is just the plan)
**
** iosapic_init:
**   o initialize globals (lock, etc)
**   o try to read IRT. Presence of IRT determines if this is
**     a PAT platform or not.
**
** iosapic_register():
**   o create iosapic_info instance data structure
**   o allocate vector_info array for this iosapic
**   o initialize vector_info - read corresponding IRdT?
**
** iosapic_xlate_pin: (only called by fixup_irq for PAT platform)
**   o intr_pin = read cfg (INTERRUPT_PIN);
**   o if (device under PCI-PCI bridge)
**               translate slot/pin
**
** iosapic_fixup_irq:
**   o if PAT platform (IRT present)
**	   intr_pin = iosapic_xlate_pin(isi,pcidev):
**         intr_line = find IRT entry(isi, PCI_SLOT(pcidev), intr_pin)
**         save IRT entry into vector_info later
**         write cfg INTERRUPT_LINE (with intr_line)?
**     else
**         intr_line = pcidev->irq
**         IRT pointer = NULL
**     endif
**   o locate vector_info (needs: isi, intr_line)
**   o allocate processor "irq" and get txn_addr/data
**   o request_irq(processor_irq,  iosapic_interrupt, vector_info,...)
**   o pcidev->irq = isi->isi_region...base + intr_line;
**
** iosapic_interrupt:
**   o call do_irq(vector->isi->irq_region, vector->irq_line, regs)
**   o assume level triggered and write EOI
**
** iosapic_enable_irq:
**   o clear any pending IRQ on that line
**   o enable IRdT - call enable_irq(vector[line]->processor_irq)
**   o write EOI in case line is already asserted.
**
** iosapic_disable_irq:
**   o disable IRdT - call disable_irq(vector[line]->processor_irq)

** XXX/FIXME

disable_irq()/enable_irq(): drawback of using IRQ as a "handle"

Current disable_irq interface only allows the irq_region support routines
to manage sharing of "irq" objects.  The problem is the disable_irq()
interface specifies which IRQ line needs to be disabled but does not
identify the particular ISR which needs to be disabled.  IO sapic
(and similar code in Dino) can only support one handler per IRQ
since they don't further encode the meaning of the IRQ number.
irq_region support has to hide it's implementation of "shared IRQ"
behind a function call.

Encoding the IRQ would be possible by I/O SAPIC but makes life really
complicated for the IRQ handler and not help performance.

Need more info on how Linux supports shared IRQ lines on a PC.
