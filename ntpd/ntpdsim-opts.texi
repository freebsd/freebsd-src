multicast client and symmetric passive associations.
This is almost never a good idea.

@cindex ntpdsim-phasenoise

This is the ``phase noise level'' option.


@node ntpdsim debug-level
@subsection debug-level option (-d)
@cindex ntpdsim-debug-level

This is the ``increase output debug message level'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{DEBUG} during the compilation.
@end itemize

Increase the debugging message output level.

@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{DEBUG} during the compilation.
@end itemize

but each overrides the previous value(s).

@node ntpdsim driftfile
@subsection driftfile option (-f)
@cindex ntpdsim-driftfile

This is the ``frequency drift file name'' option.
The name and path of the frequency file,
/etc/ntp.drift
by default.
This is the same operation as the
driftfile driftfile
configuration specification in the 
/etc/ntp.conf
file.

@node ntpdsim panicgate
@subsection panicgate option (-g)
@cindex ntpdsim-panicgate

This is the ``allow the first adjustment to be big'' option.
Normally,
ntpd
exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded after that,
ntpd
will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the
-q
and
-x
options.
See the
tinker
configuration file directive for other options.

@node ntpdsim simslew
@subsection simslew option (-H)
@cindex ntpdsim-simslew

This is the ``simuator slew'' option.


@node ntpdsim jaildir
@subsection jaildir option (-i)
@cindex ntpdsim-jaildir

This is the ``jail directory'' option.
Chroot the server to the directory
jaildir
.
This option also implies that the server attempts to drop root privileges at startup (otherwise, chroot gives very little additional security), and it is only available if the OS supports to run the server without full root privileges.
You may need to also specify a
-u
option.

@node ntpdsim interface
@subsection interface option (-I)
@cindex ntpdsim-interface

This is the ``listen on interface'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize



@node ntpdsim keyfile
@subsection keyfile option (-k)
@cindex ntpdsim-keyfile

This is the ``path to symmetric keys'' option.
Specify the name and path of the symmetric key file.
/etc/ntp.keys
is the default.
This is the same operation as the
keys keyfile
configuration file directive.

@node ntpdsim logfile
@subsection logfile option (-l)
@cindex ntpdsim-logfile

This is the ``path to the log file'' option.
Specify the name and path of the log file.
The default is the system log file.
This is the same operation as the
logfile logfile
configuration file directive.

@node ntpdsim novirtualips
@subsection novirtualips option (-L)
@cindex ntpdsim-novirtualips

This is the ``do not listen to virtual ips'' option.
Do not listen to virtual IPs. The default is to listen.

@node ntpdsim modifymmtimer
@subsection modifymmtimer option (-M)
@cindex ntpdsim-modifymmtimer

This is the ``modify multimedia timer (windows only)'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must be compiled in by defining @code{SYS_WINNT} during the compilation.
@end itemize

Set the Windows Multimedia Timer to highest resolution.

@node ntpdsim nofork
@subsection nofork option (-n)
@cindex ntpdsim-nofork

This is the ``do not fork'' option.


@node ntpdsim nice
@subsection nice option (-N)
@cindex ntpdsim-nice

This is the ``run at high priority'' option.
To the extent permitted by the operating system, run
ntpd
at the highest priority.

@node ntpdsim servertime
@subsection servertime option (-O)
@cindex ntpdsim-servertime

This is the ``server time'' option.


@node ntpdsim pidfile
@subsection pidfile option (-p)
@cindex ntpdsim-pidfile

This is the ``path to the pid file'' option.
Specify the name and path of the file used to record
ntpd's
process ID.
This is the same operation as the
pidfile pidfile
configuration file directive.

@node ntpdsim priority
@subsection priority option (-P)
@cindex ntpdsim-priority

This is the ``process priority'' option.
To the extent permitted by the operating system, run
ntpd
at the specified
sched_setscheduler(SCHED_FIFO)
priority.

@node ntpdsim quit
@subsection quit option (-q)
@cindex ntpdsim-quit

This is the ``set the time and quit'' option.
ntpd
will exit just after the first time the clock is set. This behavior mimics that of the
ntpdate
program, which is to be retired.
The
-g
and
-x
options can be used with this option.
Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.

@node ntpdsim propagationdelay
@subsection propagationdelay option (-r)
@cindex ntpdsim-propagationdelay

This is the ``broadcast/propagation delay'' option.
Specify the default propagation delay from the broadcast/multicast server to this client. This is necessary only if the delay cannot be computed automatically by the protocol.

@node ntpdsim updateinterval
@subsection updateinterval option (-U)
@cindex ntpdsim-updateinterval

This is the ``interval in seconds between scans for new or dropped interfaces'' option.
Give the time in seconds between two scans for new or dropped interfaces.
For systems with routing socket support the scans will be performed shortly after the interface change
has been detected by the system.
Use 0 to disable scanning.

@node ntpdsim statsdir
@subsection statsdir option (-s)
@cindex ntpdsim-statsdir

This is the ``statistics file location'' option.
Specify the directory path for files created by the statistics facility.
This is the same operation as the
statsdir statsdir
configuration file directive.

@node ntpdsim endsimtime
@subsection endsimtime option (-S)
@cindex ntpdsim-endsimtime

This is the ``simulation end time'' option.


@node ntpdsim trustedkey
@subsection trustedkey option (-t)
@cindex ntpdsim-trustedkey

This is the ``trusted key number'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

Add a key number to the trusted key list.

@node ntpdsim freqerr
@subsection freqerr option (-T)
@cindex ntpdsim-freqerr

This is the ``simulation frequency error'' option.


@node ntpdsim walknoise
@subsection walknoise option (-W)
@cindex ntpdsim-walknoise

This is the ``simulation random walk noise'' option.


@node ntpdsim user
@subsection user option (-u)
@cindex ntpdsim-user

This is the ``run as userid (or userid:groupid)'' option.
Specify a user, and optionally a group, to switch to.
This option is only available if the OS supports to run the server without full root privileges.
Currently, this option is supported under NetBSD (configure with
--enable-clockctl
) and Linux (configure with
--enable-linuxcaps
).

@node ntpdsim var
@subsection var option (-v)
@cindex ntpdsim-var

This is the ``make arg an ntp variable (rw)'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize



@node ntpdsim dvar
@subsection dvar option (-V)
@cindex ntpdsim-dvar

This is the ``make arg an ntp variable (rw|def)'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize



@node ntpdsim slew
@subsection slew option (-x)
@cindex ntpdsim-slew

This is the ``slew up to 600 seconds'' option.
Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less than the step threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and stepped if above the threshold.
This option sets the threshold to 600 s, which is well within the accuracy window to set the clock manually.
Note: Since the slew rate of typical Unix kernels is limited to 0.5 ms/s, each second of adjustment requires an amortization interval of 2000 s.
Thus, an adjustment as much as 600 s will take almost 14 days to complete.
This option can be used with the
-g
and
-q
options.
See the
tinker
configuration file directive for other options.
Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.

@node ntpdsim ndelay
@subsection ndelay option (-Y)
@cindex ntpdsim-ndelay

This is the ``simulation network delay'' option.


@node ntpdsim pdelay
@subsection pdelay option (-Z)
@cindex ntpdsim-pdelay

This is the ``simulation processing delay'' option.
