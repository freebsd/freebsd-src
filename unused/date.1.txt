NAME

     date - show and set date and time

SYNOPSIS
     date [ -u ] [ -c ] [ -n ] [ -d dsttype ] [ -t minutes-west ]
     [ -a [+|-]sss.fff ] [ +format ] [ [yyyy]mmddhhmm[yy][.ss] ]

DESCRIPTION
     Date without arguments writes the date and time to the
     standard output in the form
                     Wed Mar  8 14:54:40 EST 1989
     with EST replaced by the local time zone's abbreviation (or
     by the abbreviation for the time zone specified in the TZ
     environment variable if set).  The exact output format
     depends on the locale.

     If a command-line argument starts with a plus sign (`+'),
     the rest of the argument is used as a format that controls
     what appears in the output.  In the format, when a percent
     sign (`%') appears, it and the character after it are not
     output, but rather identify part of the date or time to be
     output in a particular way (or identify a special character
     to output):

       %x  03/08/89                      Date*
       %X  14:54:40                      Time*

       %Z  EST                           Time zone abbreviation
       %+  Wed Mar  8 14:54:40 EST 1989  Default output format*
     * The exact output depends on the locale.

     If a character other than one of those shown above appears
     after a percent sign in the format, that following character
     is output.  All other characters in the format are copied
     unchanged to the output; a newline character is always added
     at the end of the output.
     In Sunday-based week numbering, the first Sunday of the year
     begins week 1; days preceding it are part of ``week 0.''  In
     Monday-based week numbering, the first Monday of the year
     begins week 1.

     To set the date, use a command line argument with one of the
     following forms:
       1454         24-hour-clock hours (first two digits) and minutes
       081454       Month day (first two digits), hours, and minutes
       03081454     Month (two digits, January is 01), month day, hours, minutes
       8903081454   Year, month, month day, hours, minutes
       0308145489   Month, month day, hours, minutes, year
                    (on System V-compatible systems)
       030814541989 Month, month day, hours, minutes, four-digit year
       198903081454 Four-digit year, month, month day, hours, minutes
     If the century, year, month, or month day is not given, the
     current value is used.  Any of the above forms may be
     followed by a period and two digits that give the seconds
     part of the new time; if no seconds are given, zero is
     assumed.

     These options are available:

     -u or -c
          Use UTC when setting and showing the date and time.

     -n   Do not notify other networked systems of the time
          change.

     -d dsttype
          Set the kernel-stored Daylight Saving Time type to the
          given value.  (The kernel-stored DST type is used
          mostly by ``old'' binaries.)

     -t minutes-west
          Set the kernel-stored ``minutes west of UTC'' value to
          the one given on the command line.  (The kernel-stored
          DST type is used mostly by ``old'' binaries.)

     -a adjustment
          Change the time forward (or backward) by the number of
          seconds (and fractions thereof) specified in the
          adjustment argument.  Either the seconds part or the
          fractions part of the argument (but not both) may be
          omitted.  On BSD-based systems, the adjustment is made
          by changing the rate at which time advances; on System-
          V-based systems, the adjustment is made by changing the
          time.
