An episode of "The Adventures of Superman" entitled "The Mysterious
Cube," first aired 1958-02-24, had Superman convincing the controllers
of WWV to broadcast time signals five minutes ahead of actual time;
doing so got a crook trying to beat the statute of limitations to
emerge a bit too early from the titular enclosure.
</li>
<li>
The 1960s ITC television series "The Prisoner" included an episode
entitled "The Chimes of Big Ben" in which our protagonist tumbled to
the fraudulent nature of a Poland-to-England escape upon hearing "Big
Ben" chiming on Polish local time.
</li>
<li>
The series "Seinfeld" included an episode entitled "The Susie," first
broadcast 1997-02-13, in which Kramer decides that daylight saving time
isn't coming fast enough, so he sets his watch ahead an hour.

The syndicated comic strip "Dilbert" featured an all-too-rare example of
time zone humor on 1998-03-14.

"Gloom, Gloom, Go Away" by Walter Kirn appeared on page 106 of Time
Magazine's 2002-11-11 issue; among other things, it proposed
year-round DST as a way of lessening wintertime despair.
</li>
<li>
The "20 Hours in America" episode of "The West Wing," first aired 2002-09-25,
saw White House staffers stranded in Indiana; they thought they had time to
catch Air Force One but were done in by intra-Indiana local time changes.

<li>
"In what time zone would you find New York City?" was a $200 question on
the 1999-11-13 United States airing of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
"In 1883, what industry led the movement to divide the U.S. into four time
zones?" was a $32,000 question on the 2001-05-23 United States airing of

question should have been asked 2002-06-04.

In the 1946 movie "A Matter of Life and Death"
(U.S. title "Stairway to Heaven")
there is a reference to British Double Summer Time.
The time does not play a large part in the plot;
it's just a passing reference to the time when one of the
characters was supposed to have died (but didn't).

The 1953 railway comedy movie "The Titfield Thunderbolt" includes a
play on words on British Double Summer Time. Valentine's wife wants
him to leave the pub and asks him, "Do you know what time it is?"
And he, happy where he is, replies: "Yes, my love. Summer double time."

The premise of the 1999 caper movie "Entrapment" involves computers
in an international banking network being shut down briefly at
midnight in each time zone to avoid any problems at the transition
from the year 1999 to 2000 in that zone. (Hmmmm.) If this shutdown
is extended by 10 seconds, it will create a one-time opportunity for
a gigantic computerized theft. To achieve this, at one location the
crooks interfere with the microwave system supplying time signals to
the computer, advancing the time by 0.1 second each minute over the
last hour of 1999. (So this movie teaches us that 0.1 x 60 = 10.)

"A fundamental belief held by Americans is that if you are on land, you
cannot be killed by a fish...So most Americans remain on land, believing
they're safe. Unfortunately, this belief&mdash;like so many myths, such as that
there's a reason for 'Daylight Saving Time'&mdash;is false."
