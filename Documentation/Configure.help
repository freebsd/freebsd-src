Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

Prompt for drivers for obsolete features and hardware
CONFIG_OBSOLETE
  Obsolete drivers have usually been replaced by more recent software
  that can talk to the same hardware.  Obsolete hardware is things
  like MGA monitors that you are very unlikely to see on today's
  systems.

Prompt for advanced kernel configuration options
CONFIG_ADVANCED_OPTIONS
  This option will enable prompting for a variety of advanced kernel
  configuration options.  These options can cause the kernel to not
  work if they are set incorrectly, but can be used to optimize certain
  aspects of kernel memory management.

  Unless you know what you are doing you *should not* enable this option.

Symmetric Multi-Processing support
CONFIG_SMP
  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
  single machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
  will run faster if you say N here.

  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

Maximum number of CPUs
CONFIG_NR_CPUS
  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 32 and the
  mimimum value which makes sense is 2.

  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
  approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel image.

Intel or compatible 80x86 processor
CONFIG_X86
  This is Linux's home port.  Linux was originally native to the Intel
  386, and runs on all the later x86 processors including the Intel
  486, 586, Pentiums, and various instruction-set-compatible chips by
  AMD, Cyrix, and others.

Alpha processor
CONFIG_ALPHA
  The Alpha is a 64-bit general-purpose processor designed and
  marketed by the Digital Equipment Corporation of blessed memory, now
  Compaq.  Alpha Linux dates from 1995-1996 and was the first non-x86
  port. The Alpha Linux project has a home page at
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/>.

32-bit Sun Sparc
CONFIG_SPARC32
  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  They are very widely found in Sun
  workstations and clones. This port covers the original 32-bit SPARC;
  it is old and stable and usually considered one of the "big three"
  along with the Intel and Alpha ports.  The UltraLinux project
  maintains both the SPARC32 and SPARC64 ports; its web page is
  available at <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

64-bit Sun Sparc
CONFIG_SPARC64
  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  This port covers the newer 64-bit
  UltraSPARC.  The UltraLinux project maintains both the SPARC32 and
  SPARC64 ports; its web page is available at
  <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

Power PC processor
CONFIG_PPC
  The PowerPC is a very capable 32-bit RISC processor from Motorola,
  the successor to their 68000 and 88000 series.  It powers recent
  Macintoshes and also a widely-used series of single-board computers
  from Motorola.  The Linux PowerPC port has a home page at
  <http://penguinppc.org/>.

Motorola 68K processors
CONFIG_M68K
  The Motorola 68K microprocessors are now obsolete, having been
  superseded by the PowerPC line also from Motorola.  But they powered
  the first wave of workstation hardware in the 1980s, including Sun
  workstations; they were also the basis of the original Amiga and
  later Atari personal computers.  A lot of this hardware is still
  around.  The m68k project has a home page at
  <http://www.linux-m68k.org/>.

ARM processors
CONFIG_ARM
  The ARM series is a line of low-power-consumption RISC chip designs
  licensed by ARM ltd and targeted at embedded applications and
  handhelds such as the Compaq IPAQ.  ARM-based PCs are no longer
  manufactured, but  legacy ARM-based PC hardware remains popular in
  Europe.  There is an ARM Linux project with a web page at
  <http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/>.

SuperH processors
CONFIG_SUPERH
  The SuperH is a RISC processor targeted for use in embedded systems
  and consumer electronics; it was also used in the Sega Dreamcast
  gaming console.  The SuperH port has a home page at
  <http://www.sh-linux.org/>.

IA64 processors, including Intel Itanium
CONFIG_IA64
  The Itanium is Intel's 64-bit successor to the 32-bit X86 line.  As
  of early 2001 it is not yet in widespread production use.  The Linux
  IA-64 project has a home page at <http://www.linuxia64.org/>.

HP PA-RISC processor
CONFIG_PARISC
  The PA-RISC microprocessor is a RISC chip designed by
  Hewlett-Packard and used in their line of workstations.  The PA-RISC
  Linux project has a home page at <www.parisc-linux.org>.

IBM System/390
CONFIG_S390
  Linux now runs on the venerable System/390 mainframe from IBM, in a
  guest partition under VM.  In fact, over 40,000 simultaneous Linux
  images have been run on a single mainframe!  The S390 Linux project
  has a home page at <http://linux.s390.org/>.

Axis Communications ETRAX 100LX embedded network CPU
CONFIG_CRIS
  Linux has been ported to run on the Axis Communications ETRAX 100LX
  CPU and the single-board computers built around it, targeted for
  network and embedded applications.  For more information see the
  Axis Communication site, <http://developer.axis.com/>.

Unsynced TSC support
CONFIG_X86_TSC_DISABLE
  This option is used for getting Linux to run on a NUMA multi-node 
  boxes, laptops and other systems suffering from unsynced TSCs or 
  TSC drift, which can cause gettimeofday to return non-monotonic values. 
  Choosing this option will disable the CONFIG_X86_TSC optimization,
  and allows you to then specify "notsc" as a boot option regardless of 
  which processor you have compiled for. 
  
  NOTE: If your system hangs when init should run, you are probably
  using a i686 compiled glibc which reads the TSC without checking for 
  availability. Boot without "notsc" and install a i386 compiled glibc 
  to solve the problem.

  If unsure, say N.

Multiquad support for NUMAQ systems
CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ
  This option is used for getting Linux to run on a (IBM/Sequent) NUMA 
  multiquad box. This changes the way that processors are bootstrapped,
  and uses Clustered Logical APIC addressing mode instead of Flat Logical.
  You will need a new lynxer.elf file to flash your firmware with - send
  email to Martin.Bligh@us.ibm.com

Support for IBM Summit (EXA) systems
CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT
  This option is needed for IBM systems that use the Summit/EXA chipset.
  (EXA: Extendable Xseries Architecture)In particular, it is needed for 
  the x440 (even for the 4-CPU model).

  If you don't have this computer, you may safely say N.

IO-APIC support on uniprocessors
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC
  An IO-APIC (I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
  SMP-capable replacement for PC-style interrupt controllers. Most
  SMP systems and a small number of uniprocessor systems have one.
  If you have a single-CPU system with an IO-APIC, you can say Y here
  to use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't have
  an IO-APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at all.

  If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
  here: the IO-APIC will be used automatically.

Local APIC Support on Uniprocessors
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC
  A local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
  integrated interrupt controller in the CPU. If you have a single-CPU
  system which has a processor with a local APIC, you can say Y here to
  enable and use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't
  have a local APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at
  all. The local APIC supports CPU-generated self-interrupts (timer,
  performance counters), and the NMI watchdog which detects hard lockups.

  If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
  here: the local APIC will be used automatically.

Kernel math emulation
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
  operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
  coprocessor or this emulation.

  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
  be used nevertheless. (This behaviour can be changed with the kernel
  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
  emulation can be found in <file:arch/i386/math-emu/README>.

  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
  kernel, it won't hurt.

Timer and CPU usage LEDs
CONFIG_LEDS
  If you say Y here, the LEDs on your machine will be used
  to provide useful information about your current system status.

  If you are compiling a kernel for a NetWinder or EBSA-285, you will
  be able to select which LEDs are active using the options below. If
  you are compiling a kernel for the EBSA-110 or the LART however, the
  red LED will simply flash regularly to indicate that the system is
  still functional. It is safe to say Y here if you have a CATS
  system, but the driver will do nothing.

Timer LED
CONFIG_LEDS_TIMER
  If you say Y here, one of the system LEDs (the green one on the
  NetWinder, the amber one on the EBSA285, or the red one on the LART)
  will flash regularly to indicate that the system is still
  operational. This is mainly useful to kernel hackers who are
  debugging unstable kernels.

  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function
  will overrule the CPU usage LED.

CPU usage LED
CONFIG_LEDS_CPU
  If you say Y here, the red LED will be used to give a good real
  time indication of CPU usage, by lighting whenever the idle task
  is not currently executing.

  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function
  will overrule the CPU usage LED.

Kernel FP software completion
CONFIG_MATHEMU
  This option is required for IEEE compliant floating point arithmetic
  on the Alpha. The only time you would ever not say Y is to say M in
  order to debug the code. Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

# Choice: himem
High Memory support
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM
  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
  "high memory".

  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
  more than 960 megabytes of total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
  possible.

  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
  answer "4GB" here.

  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully
  supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel
  processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say "64GB" here,
  then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!

  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be auto
  detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option such
  as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your
  boot loader (grub, lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

  If unsure, say "off".

4GB
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
  Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and between 1 and 4
  gigabytes of physical RAM.

64GB
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G
  Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and more than 4
  gigabytes of physical RAM.

HIGHMEM I/O support
CONFIG_HIGHIO
  If you want to be able to do I/O to high memory pages, say Y.
  Otherwise low memory pages are used as bounce buffers causing a
  degrade in performance.

OOM killer support
CONFIG_OOM_KILLER
   This option selects the kernel behaviour during total out of memory
   condition. 

   The default behaviour is to, as soon as no freeable memory and no swap
   space are available, kill the task which tries to allocate memory. 
   The default behaviour is very reliable.

   If you select this option, as soon as no freeable memory is available, 
   the kernel will try to select the "best" task to be killed.

   If unsure, say N.

Normal floppy disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD
  If you want to use the floppy disk drive(s) of your PC under Linux,
  say Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
  Thinkpad users, is contained in <file:Documentation/floppy.txt>.
  That file also contains the location of the Floppy driver FAQ as
  well as location of the fdutils package used to configure additional
  parameters of the driver at run time.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called floppy.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

iSeries Virtual I/O Disk Support
CONFIG_VIODASD
  If you are running on an iSeries system and you want to use
  virtual disks created and managed by OS/400, say Y.

iSeries Virtual I/O Disk IDE Emulation
CONFIG_VIODASD_IDE
  This causes the iSeries virtual disks to look like IDE disks.
  If you have programs or utilities that only support certain
  kinds of disks, this option will cause iSeries virtual disks
  to pretend to be IDE disks, which may satisfy the program.

Support for PowerMac floppy
CONFIG_MAC_FLOPPY
  If you have a SWIM-3 (Super Woz Integrated Machine 3; from Apple)
  floppy controller, say Y here. Most commonly found in PowerMacs.

RAM disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM
  Saying Y here will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory as
  a block device, so that you can make file systems on it, read and
  write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal
  block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and
  store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM
  during the initial install of Linux.

  Note that the kernel command line option "ramdisk=XX" is now
  obsolete. For details, read <file:Documentation/ramdisk.txt>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be
  called rd.o.

  Most normal users won't need the RAM disk functionality, and can
  thus say N here.

Default RAM disk size
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE
  The default value is 4096. Only change this if you know what are
  you doing. If you are using IBM S/390, then set this to 8192.

Initial RAM disk (initrd) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
  The initial RAM disk is a RAM disk that is loaded by the boot loader
  (loadlin or lilo) and that is mounted as root before the normal boot
  procedure. It is typically used to load modules needed to mount the
  "real" root file system, etc. See <file:Documentation/initrd.txt>
  for details.

Embed root filesystem ramdisk into the kernel
CONFIG_EMBEDDED_RAMDISK
  Select this option if you want to build the ramdisk image into the
  the final kernel binary.

Filename of gziped ramdisk image
CONFIG_EMBEDDED_RAMDISK_IMAGE
  This is the filename of the ramdisk image to be built into the
  kernel.  Relative pathnames are relative to arch/mips/ramdisk/.
  The ramdisk image is not part of the kernel distribution; you must
  provide one yourself.

Loopback device support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP
  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
  driver.

  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in a
  disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
  on a remote file server. If you want to do this, you will first have
  to acquire and install a kernel patch from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/>, and then you need to
  say Y to this option.

  Note that alternative ways to use encrypted file systems are
  provided by the cfs package, which can be gotten from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>, and the newer tcfs
  package, available at <http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/>. You do not need
  to say Y here if you want to use one of these. However, using cfs
  requires saying Y to "NFS file system support" below while using
  tcfs requires applying a kernel patch. An alternative steganography
  solution is provided by StegFS, also available from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>.

  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility and a recent
  version of the mount program, both contained in the util-linux
  package. The location and current version number of util-linux is
  contained in the file <file:Documentation/Changes>.

  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called loop.o.

  Most users will answer N here.

Micro Memory MM5415 Battery Backed RAM support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UMEM
  Saying Y here will include support for the MM5415 family of
  battery backed (Non-volatile) RAM cards.
  <http://www.umem.com/>

  The cards appear as block devices that can be partitioned into
  as many as 15 partitions.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be
  called umem.o.

  The umem driver has been allocated block major number 116.
  See Documentation/devices.txt for recommended device naming.

Network block device support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NBD
  Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network
  block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by
  servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between
  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client
  program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to
  a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.

  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in
  userland (making server and client physically the same computer,
  communicating using the loopback network device).

  Read <file:Documentation/nbd.txt> for more information, especially
  about where to find the server code, which runs in user space and
  does not need special kernel support.

  Note that this has nothing to do with the network file systems NFS
  or Coda; you can say N here even if you intend to use NFS or Coda.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called nbd.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Per partition statistics in /proc/partitions
CONFIG_BLK_STATS
  If you say yes here, your kernel will keep statistical information
  for every partition. The information includes things as numbers of
  read and write accesses, the number of merged requests etc.

  This is required for the full functionality of sar(8) and interesting
  if you want to do performance tuning, by tweaking the elevator, e.g.

  If unsure, say N.

ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
CONFIG_IDE
  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
  can say N here.

  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
  SMART parameters disk.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called ide.o.

  For further information, please read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
  If you say Y here, you will use the full-featured IDE driver to
  control up to ten ATA/IDE interfaces, each being able to serve a
  "master" and a "slave" device, for a total of up to twenty ATA/IDE
  disk/cdrom/tape/floppy drives.

  Useful information about large (>540 MB) IDE disks, multiple
  interfaces, what to do if ATA/IDE devices are not automatically
  detected, sound card ATA/IDE ports, module support, and other
  topics, is contained in <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. For detailed
  information about hard drives, consult the Disk-HOWTO and the
  Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  To fine-tune ATA/IDE drive/interface parameters for improved
  performance, look for the hdparm package at
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. The module will be called ide-mod.o.
  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) is located on an IDE device.

  If you have one or more IDE drives, say Y or M here. If your system
  has no IDE drives, or if memory requirements are really tight, you
  could say N here, and select the "Old hard disk driver" below
  instead to save about 13 KB of memory in the kernel.

Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY
  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks. Most people use
  the newer enhanced driver, but this old one is still around for two
  reasons. Some older systems have strange timing problems and seem to
  work only with the old driver (which itself does not work with some
  newer systems). The other reason is that the old driver is smaller,
  since it lacks the enhanced functionality of the new one. This makes
  it a good choice for systems with very tight memory restrictions, or
  for systems with only older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives. Choosing the old
  driver can save 13 KB or so of kernel memory.

  If you are unsure, then just choose the Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL driver
  instead of this one. For more detailed information, read the
  Disk-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Use old disk-only driver on primary interface
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE
  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE disks.  Most people use just
  the new enhanced driver by itself.  This option however installs the
  old hard disk driver to control the primary IDE/disk interface in
  the system, leaving the new enhanced IDE driver to take care of only
  the 2nd/3rd/4th IDE interfaces.  Doing this will prevent you from
  having an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM or tape drive connected to the primary
  IDE interface.  Choosing this option may be useful for older systems
  which have MFM/RLL/ESDI controller+drives at the primary port
  address (0x1f0), along with IDE drives at the secondary/3rd/4th port
  addresses.

  Normally, just say N here; you will then use the new driver for all
  4 interfaces.

Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK
  This will include enhanced support for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks.  If
  you have a MFM/RLL/IDE disk, and there is no special reason to use
  the old hard disk driver instead, say Y.  If you have an SCSI-only
  system, you can say N here.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-disk.o.  Do not compile this driver as a module
  if your root file system (the one containing the directory /) is
  located on the IDE disk. If unsure, say Y.

Use multi-mode by default
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE
  If you get this error, try to say Y here:

  hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
  hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }

  If in doubt, say N.

PCMCIA IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECS
  Support for outboard IDE disks, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives
  connected through a  PCMCIA card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ide-cs.o

Include IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD
  If you have a CD-ROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. ATAPI is
  a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM and TAPE drives, similar to the
  SCSI protocol. Most new CD-ROM drives use ATAPI, including the
  NEC-260, Mitsumi FX400, Sony 55E, and just about all non-SCSI
  double(2X) or better speed drives.

  If you say Y here, the CD-ROM drive will be identified at boot time
  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
  similar (check the boot messages with dmesg). If this is your only
  CD-ROM drive, you can say N to all other CD-ROM options, but be sure
  to say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support".

  Note that older versions of LILO (LInux LOader) cannot properly deal
  with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROMs, so install LILO 16 or higher, available from
  <ftp://brun.dyndns.org/pub/linux/lilo/>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-cd.o.

Include IDE/ATAPI TAPE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDETAPE
  If you have an IDE tape drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y.
  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE tape and CD-ROM drives,
  similar to the SCSI protocol.  If you have an SCSI tape drive
  however, you can say N here.

  You should also say Y if you have an OnStream DI-30 tape drive; this
  will not work with the SCSI protocol, until there is support for the
  SC-30 and SC-50 versions.

  If you say Y here, the tape drive will be identified at boot time
  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
  similar, and will be mapped to a character device such as "ht0"
  (check the boot messages with dmesg).  Be sure to consult the
  <file:drivers/ide/ide-tape.c> and <file:Documentation/ide.txt> files
  for usage information.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-tape.o.

Include IDE/ATAPI FLOPPY support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY
  If you have an IDE floppy drive which uses the ATAPI protocol,
  answer Y.  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM/tape/floppy
  drives, similar to the SCSI protocol.

  The LS-120 and the IDE/ATAPI Iomega ZIP drive are also supported by
  this driver. For information about jumper settings and the question
  of when a ZIP drive uses a partition table, see
  <http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/zip/zip-1.html>.
  (ATAPI PD-CD/CDR drives are not supported by this driver; support
  for PD-CD/CDR drives is available if you answer Y to
  "SCSI emulation support", below).

  If you say Y here, the FLOPPY drive will be identified along with
  other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something similar (check
  the boot messages with dmesg).

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-floppy.o.

AWARD Bios Work-Around
CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE
  Should you have a system w/ an AWARD Bios and your drives are larger
  than 32GB and it will not boot, one is required to perform a few OEM
  operations first.  The option is called "STROKE" because it allows
  one to "soft clip" the drive to work around a barrier limit.  For
  Maxtor drives it is called "jumpon.exe".  Please search Maxtor's
  web-site for "JUMPON.EXE".  IBM has a similar tool at:
  <http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/support/download.htm>.

  If you are unsure, say N here.

Raw Access to Media
CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL
  This is a direct raw access to the media.  It is a complex but
  elegant solution to test and validate the domain of the hardware and
  perform below the driver data recover if needed.  This is the most
  basic form of media-forensics.

  If you are unsure, say N here.

Use Taskfile I/O
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO
  This is the "Jewel" of the patch.  It will go away and become the new
  driver core.  Since all the chipsets/host side hardware deal w/ their
  exceptions in "their local code" currently, adoption of a
  standardized data-transport is the only logical solution.
  Additionally we packetize the requests and gain rapid performance and
  a reduction in system latency.  Additionally by using a memory struct
  for the commands we can redirect to a MMIO host hardware in the next
  generation of controllers, specifically second generation Ultra133
  and Serial ATA.

  Since this is a major transition, it was deemed necessary to make the
  driver paths buildable in separate models.  Therefore if using this
  option fails for your arch then we need to address the needs for that
  arch.

  If you want to test this functionality, say Y here.

Force DMA
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED
  This is an old piece of lost code from Linux 2.0 Kernels.

  Generally say N here.

DMA Only on Disks
CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK
  This is used if you know your ATAPI Devices are going to fail DMA
  Transfers.

  Generally say N here.

SCSI emulation support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI
  This will provide SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices,
  and will allow you to use a SCSI device driver instead of a native
  ATAPI driver.

  This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
  driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD or CDR drive);
  you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
  device driver. In order to do this, say Y here and to "SCSI support"
  and "SCSI generic support", below. You must then provide the kernel
  command line "hdx=scsi" (try "man bootparam" or see the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel at boot time) for devices if you want the
  native EIDE sub-drivers to skip over the native support, so that
  this SCSI emulation can be used instead. This is required for use of
  CD-RW's.

  Note that this option does NOT allow you to attach SCSI devices to a
  box that doesn't have a SCSI host adapter installed.

  If both this SCSI emulation and native ATAPI support are compiled
  into the kernel, the native support will be used.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ide-scsi.o

Use the NOOP Elevator (WARNING)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ELEVATOR_NOOP
  If you are using a raid class top-level driver above the ATA/IDE core,
  one may find a performance boost by preventing a merging and re-sorting
  of the new requests.

  If unsure, say N.

ISA-PNP EIDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ISAPNP
  If you have an ISA EIDE card that is PnP (Plug and Play) and
  requires setup first before scanning for devices, say Y here.

  If unsure, say N.

CMD640 chipset bugfix/support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640
  The CMD-Technologies CMD640 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
  Pentium motherboards, usually in combination with a "Neptune" or
  "SiS" chipset. Unfortunately, it has a number of rather nasty
  design flaws that can cause severe data corruption under many common
  conditions. Say Y here to include code which tries to automatically
  detect and correct the problems under Linux. This option also
  enables access to the secondary IDE ports in some CMD640 based
  systems.

  This driver will work automatically in PCI based systems (most new
  systems have PCI slots). But if your system uses VESA local bus
  (VLB) instead of PCI, you must also supply a kernel boot parameter
  to enable the CMD640 bugfix/support: "ide0=cmd640_vlb". (Try "man
  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about how to
  pass options to the kernel.)

  The CMD640 chip is also used on add-in cards by Acculogic, and on
  the "CSA-6400E PCI to IDE controller" that some people have. For
  details, read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

CMD640 enhanced support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640_ENHANCED
  This option includes support for setting/autotuning PIO modes and
  prefetch on CMD640 IDE interfaces.  For details, read
  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. If you have a CMD640 IDE interface
  and your BIOS does not already do this for you, then say Y here.
  Otherwise say N.

RZ1000 chipset bugfix/support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000
  The PC-Technologies RZ1000 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
  Pentium motherboards, usually along with the "Neptune" chipset.
  Unfortunately, it has a rather nasty design flaw that can cause
  severe data corruption under many conditions. Say Y here to include
  code which automatically detects and corrects the problem under
  Linux. This may slow disk throughput by a few percent, but at least
  things will operate 100% reliably.

Generic PCI IDE chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
  Say Y here for PCI systems which use IDE drive(s).
  This option helps the IDE driver to automatically detect and
  configure all PCI-based IDE interfaces in your system.

Support for sharing PCI IDE interrupts
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ
  Some ATA/IDE chipsets have hardware support which allows for
  sharing a single IRQ with other cards. To enable support for
  this in the ATA/IDE driver, say Y here.

  It is safe to say Y to this question, in most cases.
  If unsure, say N.

Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI
  If your PCI system uses IDE drive(s) (as opposed to SCSI, say) and
  is capable of bus-master DMA operation (most Pentium PCI systems),
  you will want to say Y here to reduce CPU overhead. You can then use
  the "hdparm" utility to enable DMA for drives for which it was not
  enabled automatically. By default, DMA is not enabled automatically
  for these drives, but you can change that by saying Y to the
  following question "Use DMA by default when available". You can get
  the latest version of the hdparm utility from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

  Read the comments at the beginning of <file:drivers/ide/ide-dma.c>
  and the file <file:Documentation/ide.txt> for more information.

  It is safe to say Y to this question.

Good-Bad DMA Model-Firmware (WIP)
CONFIG_IDEDMA_NEW_DRIVE_LISTINGS
  If you say Y here, the model and firmware revision of your drive
  will be compared against a blacklist of buggy drives that claim to
  be (U)DMA capable but aren't. This is a blanket on/off test with no
  speed limit options.

  Straight GNU GCC 2.7.3/2.8.X compilers are known to be safe;
  whereas, many versions of EGCS have a problem and miscompile if you
  say Y here.

  If in doubt, say N.

Attempt to HACK around Chipsets that TIMEOUT (WIP)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_TIMEOUT
  If you say Y here, this is a NASTY UGLY HACK!

  We have to issue an abort and requeue the request DMA engine got
  turned off by a goofy ASIC, and we have to clean up the mess, and
  here is as good as any.  Do it globally for all chipsets.

  If in doubt, say N.

Boot off-board chipsets first support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD
  Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board
  controllers) are assigned to ide0 and ide1 while those on add-in PCI
  cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3.
  Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with
  off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3.
  This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo
  when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.

  If you say Y here, and you actually want to reverse the device scan
  order as explained above, you also need to issue the kernel command
  line option "ide=reverse". (Try "man bootparam" or see the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

  Note that, if you do this, the order of the hd* devices will be
  rearranged which may require modification of fstab and other files.

  If in doubt, say N.

Use PCI DMA by default when available
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO
  Prior to kernel version 2.1.112, Linux used to automatically use
  DMA for IDE drives and chipsets which support it. Due to concerns
  about a couple of cases where buggy hardware may have caused damage,
  the default is now to NOT use DMA automatically. To revert to the
  previous behaviour, say Y to this question.

  If you suspect your hardware is at all flakey, say N here.
  Do NOT email the IDE kernel people regarding this issue!

  It is normally safe to answer Y to this question unless your
  motherboard uses a VIA VP2 chipset, in which case you should say N.

IGNORE word93 Validation BITS
CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB
  There are unclear terms in ATA-4 and ATA-5 standards how certain
  hardware (an 80c ribbon) should be detected. Different interpretations
  of the standards have been released in hardware. This causes problems:
  for example, a host with Ultra Mode 4 (or higher) will not run
  in that mode with an 80c ribbon.

  If you are experiencing compatibility or performance problems, you
  MAY try to answering Y here. However, it does not necessarily solve
  any of your problems, it could even cause more of them.

  It is normally safe to answer Y; however, the default is N.

ATA Work(s) In Progress (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_WIP
  If you enable this you will be able to use and test highly
  developmental projects. If you say N, the configurator will
  simply skip those options.

  It is SAFEST to say N to this question.

Asynchronous DMA support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA
  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/ide-adma.c>.

Pacific Digital A-DMA support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC_ADMA
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/setup-pci.c>.

3ware Hardware ATA-RAID support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID
  3ware is the only hardware ATA-Raid product in Linux to date.
  This card is 2,4, or 8 channel master mode support only.
  SCSI support required!!!

  <http://www.3ware.com/>

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/scsi/3w-xxxx.c>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called 3w-xxxx.o.

AEC62XX chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AEC62XX
  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. In
  order to get this card to initialize correctly in some cases, you
  should say Y here, and preferably also to "Use DMA by default when
  available".

  The ATP850U/UF is an UltraDMA 33 chipset base.
  The ATP860 is an UltraDMA 66 chipset base.
  The ATP860M(acintosh) version is an UltraDMA 66 chipset base.

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/aec62xx.c>.
  If you say Y here, then say Y to "Use DMA by default when available"
  as well.

AEC62XX Tuning support
CONFIG_AEC62XX_TUNING
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/aec62xx.c>.
  If unsure, say N.

ALI M15x3 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3
  This driver ensures (U)DMA support for ALI 1533, 1543 and 1543C
  onboard chipsets.  It also tests for Simplex mode and enables
  normal dual channel support.

  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available", above.  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

ALI M15x3 WDC support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_WDC_ALI15X3
  This allows for UltraDMA support for WDC drives that ignore CRC
  checking. You are a fool for enabling this option, but there have
  been requests. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF YOUR DRIVE HAS FS CORRUPTION, IF
  YOU ENABLE THIS! No one will listen, just laugh for ignoring this
  SERIOUS WARNING.

  Using this option can allow WDC drives to run at ATA-4/5 transfer
  rates with only an ATA-2 support structure.

  SAY N!

AMD and nVidia IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD74XX
  This driver adds explicit support for AMD-7xx and AMD-8111 chips
  and also for the nVidia nForce chip.  This allows the kernel to
  change PIO, DMA and UDMA speeds and to configure the chip to
  optimum performance.

  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available", above.
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/amd74xx.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

AMD Viper ATA-66 Override support (WIP)
CONFIG_AMD74XX_OVERRIDE
  This option auto-forces the ata66 flag.
  This effect can be also invoked by calling "idex=ata66"
  If unsure, say N.

ATI IXP chipset IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATIIXP
  This driver adds explicit support for ATI IXP chipset.
  This allows the kernel to change PIO, DMA and UDMA speeds
  and to configure the chip to optimum performance.

  Say Y here if you have an ATI IXP chipset IDE controller.

CMD64X/CMD680 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD64X
  Say Y here if you have an IDE controller which uses any of these
  chipsets: CMD643, CMD646 and CMD648.

Compaq Triflex IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TRIFLEX
  Say Y here if you have a Compaq Triflex IDE controller, such
  as those commonly found on Compaq Pentium-Pro systems

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  triflex.o.

CY82C693 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CY82C693
  This driver adds detection and support for the CY82C693 chipset
  used on Digital's PC-Alpha 164SX boards.

  If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available" as well.

Cyrix CS5530 MediaGX chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CS5530
  Include support for UDMA on the Cyrix MediaGX 5530 chipset. This
  will automatically be detected and configured if found.

  It is safe to say Y to this question.

  People with SCSI-only systems should say N here. If unsure, say Y.

HPT34X chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT34X
  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. The HPT343 chipset in its current form is a non-bootable
  controller; the HPT345/HPT363 chipset is a bootable (needs BIOS FIX)
  PCI UDMA controllers. This driver requires dynamic tuning of the
  chipset during the ide-probe at boot time. It is reported to support
  DVD II drives, by the manufacturer.

HPT34X AUTODMA support (WIP)
CONFIG_HPT34X_AUTODMA
  This is a dangerous thing to attempt currently! Please read the
  comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/hpt34x.c>.  If you say Y
  here, then say Y to "Use DMA by default when available" as well.

  If unsure, say N.

HPT36X/37X chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366
  HPT366 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-66.
  HPT368 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-66 RAID Based.
  HPT370 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-100.
  HPT372 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-133.
  HPT374 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-133.

  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt.

  The HPT366 chipset in its current form is bootable. One solution
  for this problem are special LILO commands for redirecting the
  reference to device 0x80. The other solution is to say Y to "Boot
  off-board chipsets first support" (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD) unless
  your mother board has the chipset natively mounted. Regardless one
  should use the fore mentioned option and call at LILO or include
  "ide=reverse" in LILO's append-line.

  This driver requires dynamic tuning of the chipset during the
  ide-probe at boot. It is reported to support DVD II drives, by the
  manufacturer.

NS87415 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NS87415
  This driver adds detection and support for the NS87415 chip
  (used in SPARC64, among others).

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/ns87415.c>.

OPTi 82C621 chipset enhanced support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OPTI621
  This is a driver for the OPTi 82C621 EIDE controller.
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/opti621.c>.

National SCx200 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SC1200
  This driver adds support for the built in IDE on the National
  SCx200 series of embedded x86 "Geode" systems

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  sc1200.o.

ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SVWKS
  This driver adds PIO/(U)DMA support for the ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5
  chipsets.

SGI IOC4 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SGIIOC4
  This driver adds PIO & MultiMode DMA-2 support for the SGI IOC4
  chipset.  Please say Y here, if you have an Altix System from
  Silicon Graphics Inc.

Intel PIIXn chipsets support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX
  This driver adds PIO mode setting and tuning for all PIIX IDE
  controllers by Intel.  Since the BIOS can sometimes improperly tune
  PIO 0-4 mode settings, this allows dynamic tuning of the chipset
  via the standard end-user tool 'hdparm'.

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/pci/piix.c>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y to "PIIXn Tuning support",
  below.

  If unsure, say N.

PIIXn Tuning support
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING
  This driver extension adds DMA mode setting and tuning for all PIIX
  IDE controllers by Intel. Since the BIOS can sometimes improperly
  set up the device/adapter combination and speed limits, it has
  become a necessity to back/forward speed devices as needed.

  Promise Ultra33 or PDC20246
  Promise Ultra66 or PDC20262
  Promise Ultra100 or PDC20265/PDC20267/PDC20268

  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
  multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
  happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
  not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
  at boot-time for max-speed.  Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
  for more than one card. This card may require that you say Y to
  "Special UDMA Feature".

  If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default when
  available" as well.

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

Special UDMA Feature
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST
  This option causes the pdc202xx driver to enable UDMA modes on the
  PDC202xx even when the PDC202xx BIOS has not done so.

  It was originally designed for the PDC20246/Ultra33, whose BIOS will
  only setup UDMA on the first two PDC20246 cards.  It has also been
  used successfully on a PDC20265/Ultra100, allowing use of UDMA modes
  when the PDC20265 BIOS has been disabled (for faster boot up).

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c>.

  interface chipsets used on motherboards and add-on cards. You can
  then pick your particular IDE chip from among the following options.
  This enhanced support may be necessary for Linux to be able to
  access the 3rd/4th drives in some systems. It may also enable
  setting of higher speed I/O rates to improve system performance with
  these chipsets. Most of these also require special kernel boot
  parameters to actually turn on the support at runtime; you can find
  a list of these in the file <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

  People with SCSI-only systems can say N here.

Generic 4 drives/port support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_4DRIVES
  Certain older chipsets, including the Tekram 690CD, use a single set

  from OnSpec Electronics (often marketed under the ValuStore brand
  name). If you chose to build PARIDE support into your kernel, you
  may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you
  should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be
  called on26.o. You must also have a high-level driver for the type
  of device that you want to support.

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM
  This driver lets you combine several hard disks, hard disk
  partitions, multiple devices or even loop devices (for evaluation
  purposes) into a volume group.  Imagine a volume group as a kind of
  virtual disk. Logical volumes, which can be thought of as virtual
  partitions, can be created in the volume group.  You can resize
  volume groups and logical volumes after creation time, corresponding
  to new capacity needs.  Logical volumes are accessed as block
  devices named /dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName.

  For details see <file:Documentation/LVM-HOWTO>.  You will need
  supporting user space software; location is in
  <file:Documentation/Changes>.

  If you want to compile this support as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called lvm-mod.o.

Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM)
CONFIG_MD
  Support multiple physical spindles through a single logical device.
  Required for RAID and logical volume management (LVM).

Multiple devices driver support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD
  This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
  logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
  partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
  into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
  disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of
  the partitions is done by the kernel. "Hardware RAID" means that the
  combining is done by a dedicated controller; if you have such a
  controller, you do not need to say Y here.

  More information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also learn
  where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  md.o

  If unsure, say N.

Linear (append) mode
CONFIG_MD_LINEAR
  If you say Y here, then your multiple devices driver will be able to
  use the so-called linear mode, i.e. it will combine the hard disk
  partitions by simply appending one to the other.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called linear.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-0 (striping) mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID0
  If you say Y here, then your multiple devices driver will be able to
  use the so-called raid0 mode, i.e. it will combine the hard disk
  partitions into one logical device in such a fashion as to fill them
  up evenly, one chunk here and one chunk there. This will increase
  the throughput rate if the partitions reside on distinct disks.

  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called raid0.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-1 (mirroring) mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID1
  A RAID-1 set consists of several disk drives which are exact copies
  of each other.  In the event of a mirror failure, the RAID driver
  will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing
  an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the
  kernel.  In a set with N drives, the available space is the capacity
  of a single drive, and the set protects against a failure of (N - 1)
  drives.

  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  There you will also

  If you want to use such a RAID-1 set, say Y. This code is also
  available as a module called raid1.o ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).  If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-4/RAID-5 mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID5
  A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive provides
  the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
  of a single drive. For a given sector (row) number, (N - 1) drives
  contain data sectors, and one drive contains the parity protection.
  For a RAID-4 set, the parity blocks are present on a single drive,
  while a RAID-5 set distributes the parity across the drives in one
  of the available parity distribution methods.

  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also
  learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  If you want to use such a RAID-4/RAID-5 set, say Y. This code is
  also available as a module called raid5.o ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

Multipath I/O support
CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH
  Multipath-IO is the ability of certain devices to address the same
  physical disk over multiple 'IO paths'. The code ensures that such
  paths can be defined and handled at runtime, and ensures that a
  transparent failover to the backup path(s) happens if a IO errors
  arrives on the primary path.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  multipath.o

  If unsure, say N.

Support for IDE Raid controllers
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID
  Say Y or M if you have an IDE Raid controller and want linux
  to use its softwareraid feature.  You must also select an
  appropriate for your board low-level driver below.

  Note, that Linux does not use the Raid implementation in BIOS, and
  the main purpose for this feature is to retain compatibility and
  data integrity with other OS-es, using the same disk array. Linux
  has its own Raid drivers, which you should use if you need better
  performance.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ataraid.o

Support Promise software RAID (Fasttrak(tm))
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC
  Say Y or M if you have a Promise Fasttrak (tm) Raid controller
  and want linux to use the softwareraid feature of this card.
  This driver uses /dev/ataraid/dXpY (X and Y numbers) as device
  names.

  If you choose to compile this as a module, the module will be called
  pdcraid.o.

Highpoint 370 software RAID
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_HPT
  Say Y or M if you have a Highpoint HPT 370 Raid controller
  and want linux to use the softwareraid feature of this card.
  This driver uses /dev/ataraid/dXpY (X and Y numbers) as device

  hptraid.o.

CMD/Silicon Image Medley Software RAID
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_MEDLEY
  Say Y or M if you have a Silicon Image 3112 SATA RAID controller,
  a CMD680 based controller, or another IDE RAID controller that uses
  CMD's Medley software RAID, and want Linux to use the software RAID
  feature of this card.  This driver uses /dev/ataraid/dXpY (X and Y
  numbers) as device names.

  This driver currently only supports RAID0 (striped) mode, so if you
  are using RAID1 (mirroring) this will not work for you. In that
  case, you may want to try the Silicon Image Medley Software RAID
  driver (below).

  Support for mirroring is planned in the future.

  If you choose to compile this as a module, the module will be called
  medley.o.

Silicon Image Medley Software RAID (old driver)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_SII
  Say Y or M if you have a Silicon Image SATARaid controller
  and want Linux to use the softwareraid feature of this card.
  This driver uses /dev/ataraid/dXpY (X and Y numbers) as device
  names.

  This driver does not reliably detect all Medley RAID sets, and could
  be dangerous if you have a striped set with disks of different size.

  You should use the new Medley RAID driver (above), unless you use
  RAID1 (mirroring), which the new driver does not yet support.

  If you choose to compile this as a module, the module will be called
  silraid.o.

  The options selects support for the NEC VR41xx series of processors.
  Only choose this option if you have one of these processors as a
  kernel built with this option will not run on any other type of
  processor or vice versa.

CPU feature configuration
CONFIG_CPU_ADVANCED
  Saying yes here allows you to select support for various features
  your CPU may or may not have.  Most people should say N here.

ll and sc instructions available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_LLSC
  MIPS R4000 series and later provide the Load Linked (ll)
  and Store Conditional (sc) instructions. More information is
  available at <http://www.go-ecs.com/mips/miptek1.htm>.

  Say Y here if your CPU has the ll and sc instructions.  Say Y here
  for better performance, N if you don't know.  You must say Y here
  for multiprocessor machines.

lld and scd instructions available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_LLDSCD
  Say Y here if your CPU has the lld and scd instructions, the 64-bit
  equivalents of ll and sc.  Say Y here for better performance, N if
  you don't know.  You must say Y here for multiprocessor machines.

Writeback Buffer available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_WB
  Say N here for slightly better performance.  You must say Y here for
  machines which require flushing of write buffers in software.  Saying
  Y is the safe option; N may result in kernel malfunction and crashes.

Support for large 64-bit configurations
CONFIG_MIPS_INSANE_LARGE
  MIPS R10000 does support a 44 bit / 16TB address space as opposed to
  previous 64-bit processors which only supported 40 bit / 1TB. If you
  need processes of more than 1TB virtual address space, say Y here.
  This will result in additional memory usage, so it is not
  recommended for normal users.

Generate little endian code
CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
  Some MIPS machines can be configured for either little or big endian
  byte order. These modes require different kernels. Say Y if your
  machine is little endian, N if it's a big endian machine.

Use power LED as a heartbeat
CONFIG_HEARTBEAT
  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
  behaviour is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.

Networking support
CONFIG_NET
  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
  other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Socket filtering
CONFIG_FILTER
  The Linux Socket Filter is derived from the Berkeley Packet Filter.
  If you say Y here, user-space programs can attach a filter to any
  socket and thereby tell the kernel that it should allow or disallow
  certain types of data to get through the socket.  Linux Socket
  Filtering works on all socket types except TCP for now.  See the
  text file <file:Documentation/networking/filter.txt> for more
  information.

  You need to say Y here if you want to use PPP packet filtering
  (see the CONFIG_PPP_FILTER option below).

  If unsure, say N.

Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)
CONFIG_NETFILTER
  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
  that pass through your Linux box.

  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
  you say Y here.

  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
  typically a caching proxy server.

  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
  these packages.

  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.

  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.

Network packet filtering debugging
CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG
  You can say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
  debugging the netfilter code.

Connection tracking (required for masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
  into connections.

  This is required to do Masquerading or other kinds of Network
  Address Translation (except for Fast NAT).  It can also be used to
  enhance packet filtering (see `Connection state match support'
  below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Amanda protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_AMANDA
  If you are running the Amanda backup package (http://www.amanda.org/)
  on this machine or machines that will be MASQUERADED through this
  machine, then you may want to enable this feature.  This allows the
  connection tracking and natting code to allow the sub-channels that
  Amanda requires for communication of the backup data, messages and
  index.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.


IRC Send/Chat protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_IRC
  There is a commonly-used extension to IRC called
  Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC).  This enables users to send
  files to each other, and also chat to each other without the need
  of a server.  DCC Sending is used anywhere you send files over IRC,
  and DCC Chat is most commonly used by Eggdrop bots.  If you are
  using NAT, this extension will enable you to send files and initiate
  chats.  Note that you do NOT need this extension to get files or
  have others initiate chats, or everything else in IRC.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say 'M' here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say 'N'.

TFTP protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TFTP
  TFTP connection tracking helper, this is required depending
  on how restrictive your ruleset is.
  If you are using a tftp client behind -j SNAT or -j MASQUERADING
  you will need this.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `Y'.

FTP protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP
  Tracking FTP connections is problematic: special helpers are
  required for tracking them, and doing masquerading and other forms
  of Network Address Translation on them.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `Y'.

User space queueing via NETLINK
CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE
  Netfilter has the ability to queue packets to user space: the
  netlink device can be used to access them using this driver.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES
  iptables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
  The packet filtering and full NAT (masquerading, port forwarding,
  etc) subsystems now use this: say `Y' or `M' here if you want to use
  either of those.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

recent match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_RECENT
  This match is used for creating one or many lists of recently
  used addresses and then matching against that/those list(s).

  Short options are available by using 'iptables -m recent -h'
  Official Website: <http://snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/>

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

limit match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LIMIT
  limit matching allows you to control the rate at which a rule can be
  matched: mainly useful in combination with the LOG target ("LOG
  target support", below) and to avoid some Denial of Service attacks.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

skb->pkt_type packet match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_PKTTYPE
  This patch allows you to match packet in accrodance
  to its "class", eg. BROADCAST, MULTICAST, ...
  
  Typical usage:
  iptables -A INPUT -m pkttype --pkt-type broadcast -j LOG
  
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

MAC address match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC
  MAC matching allows you to match packets based on the source
  Ethernet address of the packet.

  Netfilter mark matching allows you to match packets based on the
  `nfmark' value in the packet.  This can be set by the MARK target
  (see below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Multiple port match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT
  Multiport matching allows you to match TCP or UDP packets based on
  a series of source or destination ports: normally a rule can only
  match a single range of ports.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

TTL match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TTL
  This adds CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TTL option, which enabled the user
  to match packets by their TTL value.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

LENGTH match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LENGTH
  This option allows you to match the length of a packet against a
  specific value or range of values.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

AH/ESP match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_AH_ESP
  These two match extensions (`ah' and `esp') allow you to match a
  range of SPIs inside AH or ESP headers of IPSec packets.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

DSCP match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_DSCP

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

TOS match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
  TOS matching allows you to match packets based on the Type Of
  Service fields of the IP packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

conntrack match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_CONNTRACK
  This is a general conntrack match module, a superset of the state match.

  It allows matching on additional conntrack information, which is
  useful in complex configurations, such as NAT gateways with multiple
  internet links or tunnels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.


Connection state match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE
  Connection state matching allows you to match packets based on their
  relationship to a tracked connection (ie. previous packets).  This
  is a powerful tool for packet classification.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Unclean match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_UNCLEAN
  Unclean packet matching matches any strange or invalid packets, by
  looking at a series of fields in the IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP headers.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Owner match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER
  Packet owner matching allows you to match locally-generated packets
  based on who created them: the user, group, process or session.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet filtering
CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER
  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

REJECT target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT
  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP
  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
  than silently being dropped.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MIRROR target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MIRROR
  The MIRROR target allows a filtering rule to specify that an
  incoming packet should be bounced back to the sender.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Local NAT support
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL
  This option enables support for NAT of locally originated connections. 
  Enable this if you need to use destination NAT on connections
  originating from local processes on the nat box itself.

  Please note that you will need a recent version (>= 1.2.6a)
  of the iptables userspace program in order to use this feature.
  See <http://www.iptables.org/> for download instructions.

  If unsure, say 'N'.


Full NAT (Network Address Translation)
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT
  The Full NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
  forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  It is controlled by
  the `nat' table in iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MASQUERADE target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
  address will be different on next dialup).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Basic SNMP-ALG support
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC

  This module implements an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for
  SNMP payloads.  In conjunction with NAT, it allows a network
  management system to access multiple private networks with
  conflicting addresses.  It works by modifying IP addresses
  inside SNMP payloads to match IP-layer NAT mapping.

  This is the "basic" form of SNMP-ALG, as described in RFC 2962

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

REDIRECT target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are
  mapped onto the incoming interface's address, causing the packets to
  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
  useful for transparent proxies.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet mangling
CONFIG_IP_NF_MANGLE
  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
  which can effect how the packet is routed.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

DSCP target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_DSCP
  This option adds a `DSCP' target, which allows you to create rules in
  the iptables mangle table. The selected packet has the DSCP field set
  to the hex value provided on the command line; unlike the TOS target
  which will only set the legal values within ip.h.

  The DSCP field can be set to any value between 0x0 and 0x4f. It does
  take into account that bits 6 and 7 are used by ECN.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

ECN target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_ECN
  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
  table.  

  You can use this target to remove the ECN bits from the IPv4 header of
  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
  ECN support in general.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

TOS target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TOS
  This option adds a `TOS' target, which allows you to create rules in
  the `mangle' table which alter the Type Of Service field of an IP
  packet prior to routing.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MARK target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MARK
  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
  behaviour.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

TCPMSS target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
  minus 40).

  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
  packets:
	1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
  configuration like:

        iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
		 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Helper match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_HELPER
  Helper matching allows you to match packets in dynamic connections
  tracked by a conntrack-helper, ie. ip_conntrack_ftp

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `Y'.

TCPMSS match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS
  This option adds a `tcpmss' match, which allows you to examine the
  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, which control the maximum packet size
  for that connection.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ULOG target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
  which can only be viewed through syslog.

  The appropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
  <http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd>

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

LOG target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG
  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ipchains (2.2-style) support
CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS
  This option places ipchains (with masquerading and redirection
  support) back into the kernel, using the new netfilter
  infrastructure.  It is not recommended for new installations (see
  `Packet filtering').  With this enabled, you should be able to use
  the ipchains tool exactly as in 2.2 kernels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ipfwadm (2.0-style) support
CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPFWADM
  This option places ipfwadm (with masquerading and redirection
  support) back into the kernel, using the new netfilter
  infrastructure.  It is not recommended for new installations (see
  `Packet filtering').  With this enabled, you should be able to use
  the ipfwadm tool exactly as in 2.0 kernels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

EUI64 address check (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_EUI64
  This module performs checking on the IPv6 source address
  Compares the last 64 bits with the EUI64 (delivered
  from the MAC address) address

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

  `nfmark' value in the packet.  This can be set by the MARK target
  (see below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Multiple port match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT
  Multiport matching allows you to match TCP or UDP packets based on
  a series of source or destination ports: normally a rule can only
  match a single range of ports.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IPV6 queue handler (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_QUEUE

  This option adds a queue handler to the kernel for IPv6
  packets which lets us to receive the filtered packets
  with QUEUE target using libiptc as we can do with
  the IPv4 now.

MARK target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_MARK
  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
  associated with the packet packet prior to routing. This can change
  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
  behaviour.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ARP tables support
CONFIG_IP_NF_ARPTABLES
  arptables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
  The ARP packet filtering and mangling (manipulation)subsystems
  use this: say Y or M here if you want to use either of those.

TCP Explicit Congestion Notification support
CONFIG_INET_ECN
  Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers to notify
  clients about network congestion, resulting in fewer dropped packets
  and increased network performance.  This option adds ECN support to
  the Linux kernel, as well as a sysctl (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn)
  which allows ECN support to be disabled at runtime.

  Note that, on the Internet, there are many broken firewalls which
  refuse connections from ECN-enabled machines, and it may be a while
  before these firewalls are fixed.  Until then, to access a site
  behind such a firewall (some of which are major sites, at the time
  of this writing) you will have to disable this option, either by
  saying N now or by using the sysctl.

  If in doubt, say N.

IPv6 tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES
  ip6tables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
  Currently only the packet filtering and packet mangling subsystem
  for IPv6 use this, but connection tracking is going to follow.
  Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use either of those.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IPv6 limit match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_LIMIT
  limit matching allows you to control the rate at which a rule can be
  matched: mainly useful in combination with the LOG target ("LOG
  target support", below) and to avoid some Denial of Service attacks.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

LOG target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_LOG
  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IP: virtual server support
CONFIG_IP_VS
  IP Virtual Server support will let you build a high-performance
  virtual server based on cluster of two or more real servers. This
  option must be enabled for at least one of the clustered computers
  that will take care of intercepting incomming connections to a
  single IP address and scheduling them to real servers.

  Three request dispatching techniques are implemented, they are
  virtual server via NAT, virtual server via tunneling and virtual
  server via direct routing. The several scheduling algorithms can
  be used to choose which server the connection is directed to,
  thus load balancing can be achieved among the servers.  For more
  information and its administration program, please visit the
  following URL:
	http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IP virtual server debugging
CONFIG_IP_VS_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
  debugging the IP virtual server code. You can change the debug
  level in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/debug_level

IPVS connection hash table size (the Nth power of 2)
CONFIG_IP_VS_TAB_BITS
  The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle
  hash collisions. Using a big IPVS connection hash table will greatly
  reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
  in the hash table.

  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
  from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
  is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
  performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
  to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
  not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
  average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
  virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
  for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
  should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
  size 32768 (2**15).

  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
  needed for your box.

IPVS: round-robin scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_RR
  The robin-robin scheduling algorithm simply directs network
  connections to different real servers in a round-robin manner.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: weighted round-robin scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_WRR
  The weighted robin-robin scheduling algorithm directs network
  connections to different real servers based on server weights
  in a round-robin manner. Servers with higher weights receive
  new connections first than those with less weights, and servers
  with higher weights get more connections than those with less
  weights and servers with equal weights get equal connections.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: least-connection scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_LC
  The least-connection scheduling algorithm directs network
  connections to the server with the least number of active 
  connections.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: weighted least-connection scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_WLC
  The weighted least-connection scheduling algorithm directs network
  connections to the server with the least active connections
  normalized by the server weight.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: locality-based least-connection scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_LBLC
  The locality-based least-connection scheduling algorithm is for
  destination IP load balancing. It is usually used in cache cluster.
  This algorithm usually directs packet destined for an IP address to
  its server if the server is alive and under load. If the server is
  overloaded (its active connection numbers is larger than its weight)
  and there is a server in its half load, then allocate the weighted
  least-connection server to this IP address.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_LBLCR
  The locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling
  algorithm is also for destination IP load balancing. It is 
  usually used in cache cluster. It differs from the LBLC scheduling
  as follows: the load balancer maintains mappings from a target
  to a set of server nodes that can serve the target. Requests for
  a target are assigned to the least-connection node in the target's
  server set. If all the node in the server set are over loaded,
  it picks up a least-connection node in the cluster and adds it
  in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not been
  modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed
  from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: destination hashing scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_DH
  The destination hashing scheduling algorithm assigns network
  connections to the servers through looking up a statically assigned
  hash table by their destination IP addresses.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: source hashing scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_SH
  The source hashing scheduling algorithm assigns network
  connections to the servers through looking up a statically assigned
  hash table by their source IP addresses.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: shortest expected delay scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_SED
  The shortest expected delay scheduling algorithm assigns network
  connections to the server with the shortest expected delay. The 
  expected delay that the job will experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if 
  sent to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of connections
  on the the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight)
  of the ith server.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: never queue scheduling
CONFIG_IP_VS_NQ
  The never queue scheduling algorithm adopts a two-speed model.
  When there is an idle server available, the job will be sent to
  the idle server, instead of waiting for a fast one. When there
  is no idle server available, the job will be sent to the server
  that minimize its expected delay (The Shortest Expected Delay
  scheduling algorithm).

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

IPVS: FTP protocol helper
CONFIG_IP_VS_FTP
  FTP is a protocol that transfers IP address and/or port number in
  the payload. In the virtual server via Network Address Translation,
  the IP address and port number of real servers cannot be sent to
  clients in ftp connections directly, so FTP protocol helper is
  required for tracking the connection and mangling it back to that of
  virtual service.

  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If
  unsure, say N.

AH/ESP match support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_AHESP
  This module allows one to match AH and ESP packets.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The modules will be called
  ip6t_ah.o and ip6t_esp.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

Routing header match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_RT
  rt matching allows you to match packets based on the routing
  header of the packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  ip6t_rt.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

Hop-by-hop and Dst opts header match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_OPTS
  This allows one to match packets based on the hop-by-hop
  and destination options headers of a packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The modules will be called
  ip6t_hbh.o and ip6t_dst.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

Fragmentation header match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_FRAG
  frag matching allows you to match packets based on the fragmentation
  header of the packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  ip6t_frag.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

HL match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_HL
  HL matching allows you to match packets based on the hop
  limit of the packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  ip6t_hl.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

IPv6 Extension Headers Match (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_IPV6HEADER
  This module allows one to match packets based upon
  the ipv6 extension headers.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  ip6t_ipv6header.o.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

SYN flood protection
CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES
  Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as "SYN
  flooding". This denial-of-service attack prevents legitimate remote
  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
  be taken as absolute truth.

  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
  them off.

  If you say Y here, note that SYN cookies aren't enabled by default;
  you can enable them by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

    echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

  If unsure, say N.

  AlphaServer GS 40/80/160/320 SMP based on the EV67 core.

EV5 CPU daughtercard (model 5/xxx)
CONFIG_ALPHA_PRIMO
  Say Y if you have an AS 1000 5/xxx or an AS 1000A 5/xxx.

EV5 CPU(s) (model 5/xxx)
CONFIG_ALPHA_GAMMA
  Say Y if you have an AS 2000 5/xxx or an AS 2100 5/xxx.

EV67 (or later) CPU (speed > 600MHz)?
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV67
  Is this a machine based on the EV67 core?  If in doubt, select N here
  and the machine will be treated as an EV6.

Use SRM as bootloader
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM
  There are two different types of booting firmware on Alphas: SRM,
  which is command line driven, and ARC, which uses menus and arrow
  keys. Details about the Linux/Alpha booting process are contained in
  the Linux/Alpha FAQ, accessible on the WWW from
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/>.

  The usual way to load Linux on an Alpha machine is to use MILO
  (a bootloader that lets you pass command line parameters to the
  kernel just like lilo does for the x86 architecture) which can be
  loaded either from ARC or can be installed directly as a permanent
  firmware replacement from floppy (which requires changing a certain
  jumper on the motherboard). If you want to do either of these, say N
  here. If MILO doesn't work on your system (true for Jensen
  motherboards), you can bypass it altogether and boot Linux directly
  from an SRM console; say Y here in order to do that. Note that you
  won't be able to boot from an IDE disk using old versions of SRM.

  If unsure, say N.

Legacy kernel start address
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS
  The 2.4 kernel changed the kernel start address from 0x310000
  to 0x810000 to make room for the Wildfire's larger SRM console.

  If you're using aboot 0.7 or later, the bootloader will examine the
  ELF headers to determine where to transfer control. Unfortunately,
  most older bootloaders -- APB or MILO -- hardcoded the kernel start
  address rather than examining the ELF headers, and the result is a
  hard lockup.

  Say Y if you have a broken bootloader.  Say N if you do not, or if
  you wish to run on Wildfire.

Large VMALLOC support
CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC
  Process creation and other aspects of virtual memory management can
  be streamlined if we restrict the kernel to one PGD for all vmalloc
  allocations.  This equates to about 8GB.

  Under normal circumstances, this is so far and above what is needed
  as to be laughable.  However, there are certain applications (such
  as benchmark-grade in-kernel web serving) that can make use of as
  much vmalloc space as is available.

  Say N unless you know you need gobs and gobs of vmalloc space.

Non-standard serial port support
CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD
  Say Y here if you have any non-standard serial boards -- boards
  which aren't supported using the standard "dumb" serial driver.
  This includes intelligent serial boards such as Cyclades,
  Digiboards, etc. These are usually used for systems that need many
  serial ports because they serve many terminals or dial-in
  connections.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about non-standard serial boards.

  Most people can say N here.

Extended dumb serial driver options
CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED
  If you wish to use any non-standard features of the standard "dumb"
  driver, say Y here. This includes HUB6 support, shared serial
  interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the
  four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.

Support more than 4 serial ports
CONFIG_SERIAL_MANY_PORTS
  Say Y here if you have dumb serial boards other than the four
  standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports. This may happen if you have an AST
  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port
  hardware. If you only use the standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports, you can
  say N here to save some memory. You can also say Y if you have an
  "intelligent" multiport card such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc.

Support for sharing serial interrupts
CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ
  Some serial boards have hardware support which allows multiple dumb
  serial ports on the same board to share a single IRQ. To enable
  support for this in the serial driver, say Y here.

Auto-detect IRQ on standard ports (unsafe)
CONFIG_SERIAL_DETECT_IRQ
  Say Y here if you want the kernel to try to guess which IRQ
  to use for your serial port.

  This is considered unsafe; it is far better to configure the IRQ in
  a boot script using the setserial command.

  If unsure, say N.

Support special multiport boards
CONFIG_SERIAL_MULTIPORT
  Some multiport serial ports have special ports which are used to
  signal when there are any serial ports on the board which need
  servicing. Say Y here to enable the serial driver to take advantage
  of those special I/O ports.

SGI IP22 Zilog85C30 serial support
CONFIG_IP22_SERIAL
  If you want to use your IP22's built-in serial ports under Linux,
  answer Y.

SGI Newport Console support
CONFIG_SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you want the console on the Newport aka XL graphics
  card of your Indy.  Most people say Y here.

SGI DS1286 RTC support
CONFIG_SGI_DS1286
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock built into your computer.
  Every SGI has such a clock built in. It reports status information
  via the file /proc/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
  /dev/rtc.

Dallas DS1742 RTC Support
CONFIG_DS1742
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock present on various Toshiba
  MIPS-based boards. It reports status information via the file
  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
  /dev/rtc or /dev/misc/rtc if using devfs.

  For technical information and application notes, please see the
  Dallas Semiconductor website:
  <http://www.dalsemi.com/quick_view2.cfm?qv_pk=2768>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called ds1742.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Indy/I2 Hardware Watchdog
CONFIG_INDYDOG
  Hardwaredriver for the Indy's/I2's watchdog. This is a
  watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after a 60 second 
  timer expired and no process has written to /dev/watchdog during
  that time.

Support the Bell Technologies HUB6 card
CONFIG_HUB6
  Say Y here to enable support in the dumb serial driver to support
  the HUB6 card.

PCMCIA serial device support
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CS
  Say Y here to enable support for 16-bit PCMCIA serial devices,
  including serial port cards, modems, and the modem functions of
  multi-function Ethernet/modem cards. (PCMCIA- or PC-cards are
  credit-card size devices often used with laptops.)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called serial_cs.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SYNCLINK_CS
  Enable support for the SyncLink PC Card serial adapter, running
  asynchronous and HDLC communications up to 512Kbps. The port is
  selectable for RS-232, V.35, RS-449, RS-530, and X.21

  This driver may be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called synclinkmp.o.  If you want to do that, say M
  here.

ACP Modem (Mwave) support
CONFIG_MWAVE
  The ACP modem (Mwave) for Linux is a WinModem. It is composed of a
  kernel driver and a user level application. Together these components
  support direct attachment to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
  and support selected world wide countries.

  This version of the ACP Modem driver supports the IBM Thinkpad 600E,
  600, and 770 that include on board ACP modem hardware.

  The modem also supports the standard communications port interface
  (ttySx) and is compatible with the Hayes AT Command Set.

  The user level application needed to use this driver can be found at
  the IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) web site:
  <http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/>.

  If you own one of the above IBM Thinkpads which has the Mwave chipset
  in it, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mwave.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

/dev/agpgart (AGP Support)
CONFIG_AGP
  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

  Note that this is the only means to have XFree4/GLX use
  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

  This driver is available as a module.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called agpgart.o.

Intel 440LX/BX/GX/815/820/830/840/845/850/860 support
CONFIG_AGP_INTEL
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on Intel 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850 and 860 chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Intel 460GX support
CONFIG_AGP_I460
  This option gives you AGP support for the Intel 460GX chipset.  This
  chipset, the first to support Intel Itanium processors, is new and
  this option is correspondingly a little experimental.

  If you don't have a 460GX based machine (such as BigSur) with an AGP 
  slot then this option isn't going to do you much good.  If you're
  dying to do Direct Rendering on IA-64, this is what you're looking for.

Intel I810/I815 DC100/I810e support
CONFIG_AGP_I810
  This option gives you AGP support for the Xserver on the Intel 810
  815 and 830m chipset boards for their on-board integrated graphics. This
  is required to do any useful video modes with these boards.

VIA chipset support
CONFIG_AGP_VIA
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on VIA MPV3/Apollo Pro chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 support
CONFIG_AGP_AMD
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_AGP_AMD_K8
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of
  XFree86 on an AMD Opteron/Athlon64 using the on-CPU GART.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Generic SiS support
CONFIG_AGP_SIS
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of
  XFree86 4.x on Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] chipsets.

  Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT specifically supported;
  However, the driver works well on these, too.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Serverworks LE/HE support
CONFIG_AGP_SWORKS
  Say Y here to support the Serverworks AGP card.  See
  <http://www.serverworks.com/> for product descriptions and images.

NVIDIA chipset support
CONFIG_AGP_NVIDIA
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on NVIDIA nForce/nForce2 chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

ALI chipset support
CONFIG_AGP_ALI
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on the following ALi chipsets.  The supported chipsets
  include M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.
  For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to
  <http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/index.shtml>.

  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an
  acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to
  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.
  This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_AGP_HP_ZX1
  This option gives you AGP GART support for the HP ZX1 chipset
  for IA64 processors.

CONFIG_AGP_ATI
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of
  XFree86 4.x on the ATI RadeonIGP family of chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Support for ISA-bus hardware
CONFIG_ISA
  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

Support for PCI bus hardware
CONFIG_PCI
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

PCI support
CONFIG_PCI_INTEGRATOR
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

QSpan PCI
CONFIG_PCI_QSPAN
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

# Choice: pci_access
PCI access mode
CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS
  On PCI systems, the BIOS can be used to detect the PCI devices and
  determine their configuration. However, some old PCI motherboards
  have BIOS bugs and may crash if this is done. Also, some embedded
  PCI-based systems don't have any BIOS at all. Linux can also try to
  detect the PCI hardware directly without using the BIOS.

  With this option, you can specify how Linux should detect the PCI
  devices. If you choose "BIOS", the BIOS will be used, if you choose
  "Direct", the BIOS won't be used, and if you choose "Any", the
  kernel will try the direct access method and falls back to the BIOS
  if that doesn't work. If unsure, go with the default, which is
  "Any".

PCI device name database
CONFIG_PCI_NAMES
  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known PCI device
  names to make the information in /proc/pci, /proc/ioports and
  similar files comprehensible to the user. This database increases
  size of the kernel image by about 80KB, but it gets freed after the
  system boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you
  are building an installation floppy or kernel for an embedded system
  where kernel image size really matters, you can disable this feature
  and you'll get device ID numbers instead of names.

  When in doubt, say Y.

Generic PCI hotplug support
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI
  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
  powered up and running.  The file system pcihpfs must be mounted
  in order to interact with any PCI Hotplug controllers.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called pci_hotplug.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  When in doubt, say N.

Compaq PCI Hotplug driver
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a Compaq PCI Hotplug
  controller.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpqphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  When in doubt, say N.

PCI Compaq Hotplug controller NVRAM support
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_NVRAM
  Say Y here if you have a Compaq server that has a PCI Hotplug
  controller.  This will allow the PCI Hotplug driver to store the PCI
  system configuration options in NVRAM.

  When in doubt, say N.

ACPI PCI Hotplug driver
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI
  Say Y here if you have a system that supports PCI Hotplug using
  ACPI.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called acpiphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

MCA support
CONFIG_MCA
  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

Support for EISA-bus hardware
CONFIG_EISA
  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

  Otherwise, say N.

SGI Visual Workstation support
CONFIG_VISWS
  The SGI Visual Workstation series is an IA32-based workstation
  based on SGI systems chips with some legacy PC hardware attached.
  Say Y here to create a kernel to run on the SGI 320 or 540.
  A kernel compiled for the Visual Workstation will not run on other
  PC boards and vice versa.
  See <file:Documentation/sgi-visws.txt> for more.

SGI Visual Workstation framebuffer support
CONFIG_FB_SGIVW
  SGI Visual Workstation support for framebuffer graphics.

I2O support
CONFIG_I2O
  The Intelligent Input/Output (I2O) architecture allows hardware
  drivers to be split into two parts: an operating system specific
  module called the OSM and an hardware specific module called the
  HDM. The OSM can talk to a whole range of HDM's, and ideally the
  HDM's are not OS dependent. This allows for the same HDM driver to
  be used under different operating systems if the relevant OSM is in
  place. In order for this to work, you need to have an I2O interface
  adapter card in your computer. This card contains a special I/O
  processor (IOP), thus allowing high speeds since the CPU does not
  have to deal with I/O.

  If you say Y here, you will get a choice of interface adapter
  drivers and OSM's with the following questions.

  This support is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  You will get modules called
  i2o_core.o and i2o_config.o.

  If unsure, say N.

I2O PCI support
CONFIG_I2O_PCI
  Say Y for support of PCI bus I2O interface adapters. Currently this
  is the only variety supported, so you should say Y.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_pci.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O Block OSM
CONFIG_I2O_BLOCK
  Include support for the I2O Block OSM. The Block OSM presents disk
  and other structured block devices to the operating system.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_block.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O LAN OSM
CONFIG_I2O_LAN
  Include support for the LAN OSM. You will also need to include
  support for token ring or FDDI if you wish to use token ring or FDDI
  I2O cards with this driver.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_lan.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O SCSI OSM
CONFIG_I2O_SCSI
  Allows direct SCSI access to SCSI devices on a SCSI or FibreChannel
  I2O controller. You can use both the SCSI and Block OSM together if
  you wish.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_scsi.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O /proc support
CONFIG_I2O_PROC
  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system support", you will be
  able to read I2O related information from the virtual directory
  /proc/i2o.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_proc.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Plug and Play support
CONFIG_PNP
  Plug and Play (PnP) is a standard for peripherals which allows those
  peripherals to be configured by software, e.g. assign IRQ's or other
  parameters. No jumpers on the cards are needed, instead the values
  are provided to the cards from the BIOS, from the operating system,
  or using a user-space utility.

  Say Y here if you would like Linux to configure your Plug and Play
  devices. You should then also say Y to "ISA Plug and Play support",
  below. Alternatively, you can say N here and configure your PnP
  devices using the user space utilities contained in the isapnptools
  package.

  This support is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

ISA Plug and Play support
CONFIG_ISAPNP
  Say Y here if you would like support for ISA Plug and Play devices.
  Some information is in <file:Documentation/isapnp.txt>.

  This support is also available as a module called isapnp.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

PNPBIOS support
CONFIG_PNPBIOS
  Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in "Plug and Play BIOS
  Specification Version 1.0A May 5, 1994" to autodetect built-in
  mainboard resources (e.g. parallel port resources).

  Other features (e.g. change resources, ESCD, event notification,
  Docking station information, ISAPNP services) are not used.

  Note: ACPI is expected to supersede PNPBIOS some day, currently it
  co-exists nicely.

  See latest pcmcia-cs (stand-alone package) for a nice "lspnp" tools,
  or have a look at /proc/bus/pnp.

  If unsure, say Y.

Support for hot-pluggable devices
CONFIG_HOTPLUG
  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
  to use devices as you hotplug them.

PCMCIA/CardBus support
CONFIG_PCMCIA
  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  When compiled this way, there will be modules called pcmcia_core.o
  and ds.o.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CardBus card and (Yenta) bridge support
CONFIG_CARDBUS
  CardBus is a bus mastering architecture for PC-cards, which allows
  for 32 bit PC-cards (the original PCMCIA standard specifies only
  a 16 bit wide bus). Many newer PC-cards are actually CardBus cards.

  This option enables support for CardBus PC Cards, as well as support
  for CardBus host bridges.  Virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges are
  CardBus compatible.  A "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer
  that PCMCIA cards are plugged into.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).

  If unsure, say Y.

i82092 compatible bridge support
CONFIG_I82092
  This provides support for the Intel I82092AA PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge device,
  found in some older laptops and more commonly in evaluation boards for the
  chip.

i82365 compatible host bridge support
CONFIG_I82365
  Say Y here to include support for ISA-bus PCMCIA host bridges that
  are register compatible with the Intel i82365.  These are found on
  older laptops and ISA-bus card readers for desktop systems.  A
  "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer that PCMCIA cards are
  plugged into. If unsure, say N.

Databook TCIC host bridge support
CONFIG_TCIC
  Say Y here to include support for the Databook TCIC family of PCMCIA
  host bridges. These are only found on a handful of old systems.
  "Bridge" is the name used for the hardware inside your computer that
  PCMCIA cards are plugged into. If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_PCMCIA_SIBYTE
  Say Y here to include support for the SiByte SOC's built-in PCMCIA
  interface.  Only ATA cards and CompactFlash are currently
  supported.

System V IPC
CONFIG_SYSVIPC
  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), you'll need to say Y
  here.

  You can find documentation about IPC with "info ipc" and also in
  section 6.4 of the Linux Programmer's Guide, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

BSD Process Accounting
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the
  kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting
  information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about
  that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The
  information includes things such as creation time, owning user,
  command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete
  list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is
  up to the user level program to do useful things with this
  information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

Sysctl support
CONFIG_SYSCTL
  The sysctl interface provides a means of dynamically changing
  certain kernel parameters and variables on the fly without requiring
  a recompile of the kernel or reboot of the system.  The primary
  interface consists of a system call, but if you say Y to "/proc
  file system support", a tree of modifiable sysctl entries will be
  generated beneath the /proc/sys directory. They are explained in the
  files in <file:Documentation/sysctl/>.  Note that enabling this
  option will enlarge the kernel by at least 8 KB.

  As it is generally a good thing, you should say Y here unless
  building a kernel for install/rescue disks or your system is very
  limited in memory.

# Choice: kcore
Kernel core (/proc/kcore) format
CONFIG_KCORE_ELF
  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
  in gdb:

  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
  of binutils or on some architectures.

  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
  don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
  leave it at its default value ELF.

Select a.out format for /proc/kcore
CONFIG_KCORE_AOUT
  Not necessary unless you're using a very out-of-date binutils
  version.  You probably want KCORE_ELF.

Kernel support for ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF
  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
  executables used across different architectures and operating
  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
  want to say Y here.

  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
  latest version).

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called binfmt_elf.o. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

Kernel support for a.out binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT
  A.out (Assembler.OUTput) is a set of formats for libraries and
  executables used in the earliest versions of UNIX. Linux used the
  a.out formats QMAGIC and ZMAGIC until they were replaced with the
  ELF format.

  As more and more programs are converted to ELF, the use for a.out
  will gradually diminish. If you disable this option it will reduce
  your kernel by one page. This is not much and by itself does not
  warrant removing support. However its removal is a good idea if you
  wish to ensure that absolutely none of your programs will use this
  older executable format. If you don't know what to answer at this
  point then answer Y. If someone told you "You need a kernel with
  QMAGIC support" then you'll have to say Y here. You may answer M to
  compile a.out support as a module and later load the module when you
  want to use a program or library in a.out format. The module will be
  called binfmt_aout.o. Saying M or N here is dangerous though,
  because some crucial programs on your system might still be in A.OUT
  format.

OSF/1 v4 readv/writev compatibility
CONFIG_OSF4_COMPAT
  Say Y if you are using OSF/1 binaries (like Netscape and Acrobat)
  with v4 shared libraries freely available from Compaq. If you're
  going to use shared libraries from Tru64 version 5.0 or later, say N.

Kernel support for Linux/Intel ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_EM86
  Say Y here if you want to be able to execute Linux/Intel ELF
  binaries just like native Alpha binaries on your Alpha machine. For
  this to work, you need to have the emulator /usr/bin/em86 in place.

  You can get the same functionality by saying N here and saying Y to
  "Kernel support for MISC binaries".

  You may answer M to compile the emulation support as a module and
  later load the module when you want to use a Linux/Intel binary. The
  module will be called binfmt_em86.o. If unsure, say Y.

Kernel support for SOM binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_SOM
  SOM is a binary executable format inherited from HP/UX.  Say Y here
  to be able to load and execute SOM binaries directly.

Kernel support for MISC binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
  to include Java support.

  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
  use this part of the kernel.

  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc.o. If you
  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

Kernel support for JAVA binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA
  If you say Y here, the kernel will load and execute Java J-code
  binaries directly.  Note: this option is obsolete and scheduled for
  removal, use CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC instead.

Solaris binary emulation
CONFIG_SOLARIS_EMUL
  This is experimental code which will enable you to run (many)
  Solaris binaries on your SPARC Linux machine.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called solaris.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

SUN SME environment monitoring
CONFIG_ENVCTRL
  Kernel support for temperature and fan monitoring on Sun SME
  machines.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called envctrl.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

# Choice: x86type
Processor family
CONFIG_M386
  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
  "386" here.

  The kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures than
  the one you have chosen, e.g. a Pentium optimized kernel will run on
  a PPro, but not necessarily on a i486.

  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
   - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
     486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S and NexGen Nx586.  Only "386" kernels
     will run on a 386 class machine.
   - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
     SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or U5S.
   - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking the TSC
     (time stamp counter) register.
   - "Pentium-Classic" for the Intel Pentium.
   - "Pentium-MMX" for the Intel Pentium MMX.
   - "Pentium-Pro" for the Intel Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II.
   - "Pentium-III" for the Intel Pentium III
     and Celerons based on the Coppermine core.
   - "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4.
   - "K6" for the AMD K6, K6-II and K6-III (aka K6-3D).
   - "Athlon" for the AMD K7 family (Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird).
   - "Elan" for the AMD Elan family (Elan SC400/SC410).
   - "Crusoe" for the Transmeta Crusoe series.
   - "Winchip-C6" for original IDT Winchip.
   - "Winchip-2" for IDT Winchip 2.
   - "Winchip-2A" for IDT Winchips with 3dNow! capabilities.
   - "CyrixIII" for VIA Cyrix III or VIA C3.
   - "VIA C3-2 for VIA C3-2 "Nehemiah" (model 9 and above).

  If you don't know what to do, choose "386".

486
CONFIG_M486
  Select this for a x486 processor, ether Intel or one of the
  compatible processors from AMD, Cyrix, IBM, or Intel.  Includes DX,
  DX2, and DX4 variants; also SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or
  U5S.

586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX
CONFIG_M586
  Select this for an x586 or x686 processor such as the AMD K5, the
  Intel 5x86 or 6x86, or the Intel 6x86MX.  This choice does not
  assume the RDTSC instruction.

Pentium Classic
CONFIG_M586TSC
  Select this for a Pentium Classic processor with the RDTSC (Read
  Time Stamp Counter) instruction for benchmarking.

VIA C3-2 (Nehemiah)
CONFIG_MVIAC3_2
  Select this for a VIA C3 "Nehemiah". Selecting this enables usage of SSE
  and tells gcc to treat the CPU as a 686.

  Note, this kernel will not boot on older (pre model 9) C3s.

32-bit PDC
CONFIG_PDC_NARROW
  Saying Y here will allow developers with a C180, C200, C240, C360,
  J200, J210, and/or a J2240 to test 64-bit kernels by providing a
  wrapper for the 32-bit PDC calls.  Since the machines which require
  this option do not support over 4G of RAM, this option is targeted
  for developers of these machines wishing to test changes on both
  32-bit and 64-bit configurations.

  If unsure, say N.

VGA text console
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE
  Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
  display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
  everyone wants that.

  The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
  their full potential in text mode. Download it from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

  Say Y.

Distribute interrupts on all CPUs by default
CONFIG_IRQ_ALL_CPUS
  This option gives the kernel permission to distribute IRQs across
  multiple CPUs.  Saying N here will route all IRQs to the first
  CPU. Generally SMP PowerMacs can answer Y. SMP IBM CHRP boxes or
  Power3 boxes should say N for now.

Video mode selection support
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT
  This enables support for text mode selection on kernel startup. If
  you want to take advantage of some high-resolution text mode your
  card's BIOS offers, but the traditional Linux utilities like
  SVGATextMode don't, you can say Y here and set the mode using the
  "vga=" option from your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) or set
  "vga=ask" which brings up a video mode menu on kernel startup. (Try
  "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about
  how to pass options to the kernel.)

  Read the file <file:Documentation/svga.txt> for more information
  about the Video mode selection support. If unsure, say N.

Support for frame buffer devices
CONFIG_FB
  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
  only way to use the graphics hardware.

  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
  information.

  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

Acorn VIDC support
CONFIG_FB_ACORN
  This is the frame buffer device driver for the Acorn VIDC graphics
  hardware found in Acorn RISC PCs and other ARM-based machines.  If
  unsure, say N.

  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  vga16fb.o.

Generic STI frame buffer device support
CONFIG_FB_STI
  STI refers to the HP "Standard Text Interface" which is a set of
  BIOS routines contained in a ROM chip in HP PA-RISC based machines.
  Enabling this option will implement the linux framebuffer device and
  an fbcon color text console using calls to the STI BIOS routines.
  The HP framebuffer device is sometimes planar, using a strange memory
  layout, and changing the plane mask to create colored pixels
  can require a call to the STI routines, so /dev/fb may not actually 
  be useful.  However, on some systems packed pixel formats are supported.  
  It is sufficient for basic text console functions, including fonts.

  You should probably enable this option, unless you are having
  trouble getting video when booting the kernel (make sure it isn't
  just that you are running the console on the serial port, though).
  Really old HP boxes may not have STI, and must use the PDC BIOS
  console or the IODC BIOS.

Select other compiled-in fonts
CONFIG_FBCON_FONTS
  Say Y here if you would like to use fonts other than the default
  your frame buffer console usually use.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about foreign fonts.

  If unsure, say N (the default choices are safe).

VGA 8x16 font
CONFIG_FONT_8x16
  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
  provided by the VGA text console 80x25 mode.

  If unsure, say Y.

Support only 8 pixels wide fonts
CONFIG_FBCON_FONTWIDTH8_ONLY
  Answer Y here will make the kernel provide only the 8x8 fonts (these
  are the less readable).

  If unsure, say N.

Sparc console 8x16 font
CONFIG_FONT_SUN8x16
  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines. Say Y.

Sparc console 12x22 font (not supported by all drivers)
CONFIG_FONT_SUN12x22
  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines with very
  big letters (like the letters used in the SPARC PROM). If the
  standard font is unreadable for you, say Y, otherwise say N.

VGA 8x8 font
CONFIG_FONT_8x8
  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
  provided by the text console 80x50 (and higher) modes).

  Note that this is a poor quality font. The VGA 8x16 font is quite a
  lot more readable.

  Given the resolution provided by the frame buffer device, answer N
  here is safe.

Mac console 6x11 font (not supported by all drivers)
CONFIG_FONT_6x11
  Small console font with Macintosh-style high-half glyphs.  Some Mac
  framebuffer drivers don't support this one at all.

  glyphs.

Backward compatibility mode for Xpmac
CONFIG_FB_COMPAT_XPMAC
  If you use the Xpmac X server (common with mklinux), you'll need to

  includes a server that supports the frame buffer device directly
  (XF68_FBDev).

Hercules (HGA) mono graphics support
CONFIG_FB_HGA
  Say Y here if you have a Hercules mono graphics card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called hgafb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  As this card technology is 15 years old, most people will answer N
  here.

CONFIG_FB_PVR2
  Say Y here if you have a PowerVR 2 card in your box.  If you plan to
  run linux on your Dreamcast, you will have to say Y here.
  This driver may or may not work on other PowerVR 2 cards, but is
  totally untested.  Use at your own risk.  If unsure, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called pvr2fb.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  You can pass several parameters to the driver at boot time or at
  module load time.  The parameters look like "video=pvr2:XXX", where
  the meaning of XXX can be found at the end of the main source file
  (<file:drivers/video/pvr2fb.c>). Please see the file
  <file:Documentation/fb/pvr2fb.txt>.

Debug pvr2fb
CONFIG_FB_PVR2_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you wish for the pvr2fb driver to print out debugging
  messages. Most people will want to say N here. If unsure, you will
  also want to say N.

Matrox unified accelerated driver
CONFIG_FB_MATROX
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox Millennium, Millennium II, Mystique,
  Mystique 220, Productiva G100, Mystique G200, Millennium G200,
  Matrox G400, G450 or G550 card in your box. At this time, support for 
  the G-series digital output is almost non-existant.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called matroxfb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  You can pass several parameters to the driver at boot time or at
  module load time. The parameters look like "video=matrox:XXX", and
  are described in <file:Documentation/fb/matroxfb.txt>.

Matrox Millennium I/II support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MILLENIUM
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox Millennium or Matrox Millennium II
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options" below,
  you should check 4 bpp packed pixel, 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp
  packed pixel, 24 bpp packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can
  also use font widths different from 8.

Matrox Mystique support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MYSTIQUE
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox Mystique or Matrox Mystique 220
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options" below,
  you should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp
  packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths
  different from 8.

CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox G100, G200, G400, G450 or G550 based
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options", you
  should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp packed
  pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths
  different from 8.

  If you need support for G400 secondary head, you must first say Y to
  "I2C support" and "I2C bit-banging support" in the character devices
  section, and then to "Matrox I2C support" and "G400 second head
  support" here in the framebuffer section. G450/G550 secondary head
  and digital output are supported without additional modules.
  
  The driver starts in monitor mode. You must use the matroxset tool 
  (available at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to 
  swap primary and secondary head outputs, or to change output mode.  
  Secondary head driver always start in 640x480 resolution and you 
  must use fbset to change it.

  Do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
  too. You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
  engine).
  
  G450/G550 hardware can display TV picture only from secondary CRTC,
  and it performs no scaling, so picture must have 525 or 625 lines.

CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100A
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox G100, G200 or G400 based
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options", you
  should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp packed
  pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths
  different from 8.

  If you need support for G400 secondary head, you must first say Y to
  "I2C support" and "I2C bit-banging support" in the character devices
  section, and then to "Matrox I2C support" and "G400 second head
  support" here in the framebuffer section.

CONFIG_FB_MATROX_I2C
  This drivers creates I2C buses which are needed for accessing the
  DDC (I2C) bus present on all Matroxes, an I2C bus which
  interconnects Matrox optional devices, like MGA-TVO on G200 and
  G400, and the secondary head DDC bus, present on G400 only.

  You can say Y or M here if you want to experiment with monitor
  detection code. You must say Y or M here if you want to use either
  second head of G400 or MGA-TVO on G200 or G400.

  If you compile it as module, it will create a module named
  i2c-matroxfb.o.

Matrox G400 second head support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MAVEN
  WARNING !!! This support does not work with G450 !!!

  Say Y or M here if you want to use a secondary head (meaning two
  monitors in parallel) on G400 or MGA-TVO add-on on G200. Secondary
  head is not compatible with accelerated XFree 3.3.x SVGA servers -
  secondary head output is blanked while you are in X. With XFree
  3.9.17 preview you can use both heads if you use SVGA over fbdev or
  the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.

  If you compile it as module, two modules are created,
  matroxfb_crtc2.o and matroxfb_maven.o. Matroxfb_maven is needed for
  both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must
  also load i2c-matroxfb to get it to run.

  The driver starts in monitor mode and you must use the matroxset
  tool (available at
  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to switch it to
  PAL or NTSC or to swap primary and secondary head outputs.
  Secondary head driver also always start in 640x480 resolution, you
  must use fbset to change it.

  Also do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
  too.  You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
  engine).

CONFIG_FB_MATROX_PROC
  Say Y or M here if you want to access some informations about driver
  state through /proc interface.
  
  You should download matrox_pins tool (available at
  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to get human
  readable output.
  
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MULTIHEAD
  Say Y here if you have more than one (supported) Matrox device in
  your computer and you want to use all of them for different monitors
  ("multihead"). If you have only one device, you should say N because
  the driver compiled with Y is larger and a bit slower, especially on
  ia32 (ix86).

  If you said M to "Matrox unified accelerated driver" and N here, you
  will still be able to use several Matrox devices simultaneously:
  insert several instances of the module matroxfb.o into the kernel
  with insmod, supplying the parameter "dev=N" where N is 0, 1, etc.
  for the different Matrox devices. This method is slightly faster but
  uses 40 KB of kernel memory per Matrox card.

  There is no need for enabling 'Matrox multihead support' if you have
  only one Matrox card in the box.

3Dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2 frame buffer support
CONFIG_FB_VOODOO1
  Say Y here if you have a 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics (Voodoo1/sst1) or 
  Voodoo2 (cvg) based graphics card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be 
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sstfb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  WARNING: Do not use any application that uses the 3D engine
  (namely glide) while using this driver.
  Please read the file Documentation/fb/README-sstfb.txt for supported
  options and other important info  support.

MDA text console (dual-headed)
CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you have an old MDA or monochrome Hercules graphics
  adapter in your system acting as a second head ( = video card). You
  will then be able to use two monitors with your Linux system. Do not
  say Y here if your MDA card is the primary card in your system; the
  normal VGA driver will handle it.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mdacon.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

  The TX3912 is a Toshiba RISC processor based on the MIPS 3900 core;
  see <http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/Generic/risc/tx3912.htm>.

  Say Y here to enable kernel support for the on-board framebuffer.

Virtual Frame Buffer support (ONLY FOR TESTING!)
CONFIG_FB_VIRTUAL
  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of
  unswappable kernel memory instead of on the memory of a graphics
  board. This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame
  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The
  module will be called vfb.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

Mach64 CT/VT/GT/LT (incl. 3D RAGE) support
CONFIG_FB_ATY_CT
  Say Y here to support use of ATI's 64-bit Rage boards (or other
  boards based on the Mach64 CT, VT, GT, and LT chipsets) as a
  framebuffer device.  The ATI product support page for these boards
  is at <http://support.ati.com/products/pc/mach64/>.

Sony Vaio Picturebook laptop LCD panel support
CONFIG_FB_ATY_CT_VAIO_LCD
  Say Y here if you want to use the full width of the Sony Vaio 
  Picturebook laptops LCD panels (you will get a 128x30 console).

  Note that you need to activate this mode using the 'vga=0x301'
  option from your boot loader (lilo or loadlin).  See the
  documentation of your boot loader about how to pass options to the
  kernel.
  
Mach64 GX support
CONFIG_FB_ATY_GX
  Say Y here to support use of the ATI Mach64 Graphics Expression
  board (or other boards based on the Mach64 GX chipset) as a
  framebuffer device.  The ATI product support page for these boards
  is at
  <http://support.ati.com/products/pc/mach64/graphics_xpression.html>.

Mach64 Generic LCD support
CONFIG_FB_ATY_GENERIC_LCD
  Enabling this option enables the Atyfb driver to drive LCD panels. It
  will autodetect the resulution and format of your display and emulate
  other resolutions using the hardware stretcher on the chip.
  Say Y here if you have computer with a Rage LT Pro, Rage Mobility M1,
  Rage XC or Rage XL chip and a laptop LCD display or any other LCD display
  that needs to be digitally driven. It is not necessary to enable this
  option if you are using an LCD display with a normal VGA connector,
  but it won't hurt if you do.

ATI Radeon display support
CONFIG_FB_RADEON
  Choose this option if you want to use an ATI Radeon graphics card as
  a framebuffer device.  There are both PCI and AGP versions.  You
  don't need to choose this to run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.
  There is a product page at
  <http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon32/index.html>.

SA-1100 LCD support
CONFIG_FB_SA1100
  This is a framebuffer device for the SA-1100 LCD Controller.
  See <http://www.linux-fbdev.org/> for information on framebuffer
  devices.

  If you plan to use the LCD display with your SA-1100 system, say
  Y here.

Advanced low level driver options
CONFIG_FBCON_ADVANCED
  The frame buffer console uses character drawing routines that are
  tailored to the specific organization of pixels in the memory of
  your graphics hardware. These are called the low level frame buffer
  console drivers. Note that they are used for text console output
  only; they are NOT needed for graphical applications.

  If you say N here, the needed low level drivers are automatically
  enabled, depending on what frame buffer devices you selected above.
  This is recommended for most users.

  If you say Y here, you have more fine-grained control over which low
  level drivers are enabled. You can e.g. leave out low level drivers
  for color depths you do not intend to use for text consoles.

  Low level frame buffer console drivers can be modules ( = code which
  can be inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The modules will be called fbcon-*.o. If you want to compile
  (some of) them as modules, read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

Monochrome support
CONFIG_FBCON_MFB
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for monochrome
  (2 colors) packed pixels.

  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for 8 bits per
  pixel (256 colors) packed pixels.

16 bpp packed pixels support
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB16
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for 15 or 16 bits
  per pixel (32K or 64K colors, also known as `hicolor') packed
  pixels.

24 bpp packed pixels support
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB24
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for 24 bits per
  pixel (16M colors, also known as `truecolor') packed pixels. It is
  NOT for `sparse' 32 bits per pixel mode.

32 bpp packed pixels support
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB32
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for 32 bits per
  pixel (16M colors, also known as `truecolor') sparse packed pixels.

  This is the frame buffer device driver for the 3DLabs Permedia3
  chipset, used in Formac ProFormance III, 3DLabs Oxygen VX1 &
  similar boards, 3DLabs Permedia3 Create!, Appian Jeronimo 2000
  and maybe other boards.

HGA monochrome support
CONFIG_FBCON_HGA
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for Hercules mono
  graphics cards.

VGA characters/attributes support
CONFIG_FBCON_VGA
  This is the low level frame buffer console driver for VGA text mode;
  it is used by frame buffer device drivers that support VGA text
  mode.

Parallel-port support
CONFIG_PARPORT
  If you want to use devices connected to your machine's parallel port
  (the connector at the computer with 25 holes), e.g. printer, ZIP
  drive, PLIP link (Parallel Line Internet Protocol is mainly used to
  create a mini network by connecting the parallel ports of two local
  machines) etc., then you need to say Y here; please read
  <file:Documentation/parport.txt> and
  <file:drivers/parport/BUGS-parport>.

  For extensive information about drivers for many devices attaching
  to the parallel port see <http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html> on
  the WWW.

  It is possible to share a single parallel port among several devices
  and it is safe to compile all the corresponding drivers into the
  kernel.  If you want to compile parallel port support as a module
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  parport.o.  If you have more than one parallel port and want to
  specify which port and IRQ to be used by this driver at module load
  time, take a look at <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

PC-style hardware
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC
  You should say Y here if you have a PC-style parallel port. All IBM
  PC compatible computers and some Alphas have PC-style parallel
  ports.

  This code is also available as a module.  If you want to compile it
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  parport_pc.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

Parallel+serial PCI multi-IO card support
CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL
  This adds support for multi-IO PCI cards that have parallel and
  serial ports.  You should say Y or M here.  If you say M, the module
  will be called parport_serial.o.

Use FIFO/DMA if available
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO
  Many parallel port chipsets provide hardware that can speed up
  printing. Say Y here if you want to take advantage of that.

  As well as actually having a FIFO, or DMA capability, the kernel
  will need to know which IRQ the parallel port has.  By default,
  parallel port interrupts will not be used, and so neither will the
  FIFO.  See <file:Documentation/parport.txt> to find out how to
  specify which IRQ/DMA to use.

SuperIO chipset support
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO
  Saying Y here enables some probes for Super-IO chipsets in order to
  find out things like base addresses, IRQ lines and DMA channels.  It
  is safe to say N.

Support for PCMCIA management for PC-style ports
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA
  Say Y here if you need PCMCIA support for your PC-style parallel
  ports. If unsure, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  parport_cs.o

Support foreign hardware
CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER
  Say Y here if you want to be able to load driver modules to support
  other non-standard types of parallel ports. This causes a
  performance loss, so most people say N.

Amiga built-in parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_AMIGA
  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
  Amiga machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
  called parport_amiga.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Atari built-in parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_ATARI
  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
  Atari machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
  called parport_atari.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Multiface III parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_MFC3
  Say Y here if you need parallel port support for the MFC3 card.
  This code is also available as a module (say M), called
  parport_mfc3.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Support IEEE 1284 status readback
CONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK
  If you have a device on your parallel port that support this
  protocol, this option will allow the device to report its status. It
  is safe to say Y.

IEEE 1284 transfer modes
CONFIG_PARPORT_1284
  If you have a printer that supports status readback or device ID, or
  want to use a device that uses enhanced parallel port transfer modes
  such as EPP and ECP, say Y here to enable advanced IEEE 1284
  transfer modes. Also say Y if you want device ID information to
  appear in /proc/sys/dev/parport/*/autoprobe*. It is safe to say N.

Enable loadable module support
CONFIG_MODULES
  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can be
  inserted in or removed from the running kernel, using the programs
  insmod and rmmod. This is described in the file
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>, including the fact that you have
  to say "make modules" in order to compile the modules that you chose
  during kernel configuration.  Modules can be device drivers, file
  systems, binary executable formats, and so on. If you think that you
  may want to make use of modules with this kernel in the future, then
  say Y here.  If unsure, say Y.

Set version information on all symbols for modules
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
  Usually, modules have to be recompiled whenever you switch to a new
  kernel.  Saying Y here makes it possible, and safe, to use the
  same modules even after compiling a new kernel; this requires the
  program modprobe. All the software needed for module support is in
  the modutils package (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location and latest version).  NOTE: if you say Y here but don't
  have the program genksyms (which is also contained in the above
  mentioned modutils package), then the building of your kernel will
  fail.  If you are going to use modules that are generated from
  non-kernel sources, you would benefit from this option.  Otherwise
  it's not that important.  So, N ought to be a safe bet.

Kernel module loader support
CONFIG_KMOD
  Normally when you have selected some drivers and/or file systems to
  be created as loadable modules, you also have the responsibility to
  load the corresponding modules (using the programs insmod or
  modprobe) before you can use them. If you say Y here however, the
  kernel will be able to load modules for itself: when a part of the
  kernel needs a module, it runs modprobe with the appropriate
  arguments, thereby loading the module if it is available. (This is a
  replacement for kerneld.) Say Y here and read about configuring it
  in <file:Documentation/kmod.txt>.

ARP daemon support
CONFIG_ARPD
  Normally, the kernel maintains an internal cache which maps IP
  addresses to hardware addresses on the local network, so that
  Ethernet/Token Ring/ etc. frames are sent to the proper address on
  the physical networking layer. For small networks having a few
  hundred directly connected hosts or less, keeping this address
  resolution (ARP) cache inside the kernel works well. However,
  maintaining an internal ARP cache does not work well for very large
  switched networks, and will use a lot of kernel memory if TCP/IP
  connections are made to many machines on the network.

  If you say Y here, the kernel's internal ARP cache will never grow
  to more than 256 entries (the oldest entries are expired in a LIFO
  manner) and communication will be attempted with the user space ARP
  daemon arpd. Arpd then answers the address resolution request either
  from its own cache or by asking the net.

  This code is experimental and also obsolete. If you want to use it,
  you need to find a version of the daemon arpd on the net somewhere,
  and you should also say Y to "Kernel/User network link driver",
  below. If unsure, say N.

TCP/IP networking
CONFIG_INET
  These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
  Ethernets. It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge
  your kernel by about 144 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window
  system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any
  other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
  allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!).

  For an excellent introduction to Linux networking, please read the
  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This option is also necessary if you want to use the full power of
  term (term is a program which gives you almost full Internet
  connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on some
  Internet connected Unix computer; for more information, read
  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>).

  If you say Y here and also to "/proc file system support" and
  "Sysctl support" below, you can change various aspects of the
  behaviour of the TCP/IP code by writing to the (virtual) files in
  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/*; the options are explained in the file
  <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt>.

  Short answer: say Y.

IP multicasting
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
  This is code for addressing several networked computers at once,
  enlarging your kernel by about 2 KB. You need multicasting if you
  intend to participate in the MBONE, a high bandwidth network on top
  of the Internet which carries audio and video broadcasts. More
  information about the MBONE is on the WWW at
  <http://www-itg.lbl.gov/mbone/>. Information about the multicast
  capabilities of the various network cards is contained in
  <file:Documentation/networking/multicast.txt>. For most people, it's
  safe to say N.

Advanced router
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER
  If you intend to run your Linux box mostly as a router, i.e. as a
  computer that forwards and redistributes network packets, say Y; you
  will then be presented with several options that allow more precise
  control about the routing process.

  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel:
  answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
  questions about advanced routing.

  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP
  forwarding in your kernel; you can do that by saying Y to "/proc
  file system support" and "Sysctl support" below and executing the
  line

    echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

  If you turn on IP forwarding, you will also get the rp_filter, which
  automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry
  for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're
  arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the
  so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use
  asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path
  than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing
  host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn
  rp_filter off use:

        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter
  or
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

  If unsure, say N here.

Policy routing
CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES
  Normally, a router decides what to do with a received packet based
  solely on the packet's final destination address. If you say Y here,
  the Linux router will also be able to take the packet's source
  address into account. Furthermore, if you also say Y to "Use TOS
  value as routing key" below, the TOS (Type-Of-Service) field of the
  packet can be used for routing decisions as well. In addition, if
  you say Y here and to "Fast network address translation" below,
  the router will also be able to modify source and destination
  addresses of forwarded packets.

  If you are interested in this, please see the preliminary
  documentation at <http://www.compendium.com.ar/policy-routing.txt>
  and <ftp://post.tepkom.ru/pub/vol2/Linux/docs/advanced-routing.tex>.
  You will need supporting software from
  <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/>.

  If unsure, say N.

Equal cost multipath
CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH
  Normally, the routing tables specify a single action to be taken in
  a deterministic manner for a given packet. If you say Y here
  however, it becomes possible to attach several actions to a packet
  pattern, in effect specifying several alternative paths to travel
  for those packets. The router considers all these paths to be of
  equal "cost" and chooses one of them in a non-deterministic fashion
  if a matching packet arrives.

Use TOS value as routing key
CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_TOS
  The header of every IP packet carries a TOS (Type Of Service) value
  with which the packet requests a certain treatment, e.g. low
  latency (for interactive traffic), high throughput, or high
  reliability.  If you say Y here, you will be able to specify
  different routes for packets with different TOS values.

Use netfilter MARK value as routing key
CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_FWMARK
  If you say Y here, you will be able to specify different routes for
  packets with different mark values (see iptables(8), MARK target).

Verbose route monitoring
CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_VERBOSE
  If you say Y here, which is recommended, then the kernel will print
  verbose messages regarding the routing, for example warnings about
  received packets which look strange and could be evidence of an
  attack or a misconfigured system somewhere. The information is
  handled by the klogd daemon which is responsible for kernel messages
  ("man klogd").

Fast network address translation
CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_NAT
  If you say Y here, your router will be able to modify source and
  destination addresses of packets that pass through it, in a manner
  you specify.  General information about Network Address Translation
  can be gotten from the document
  <http://www.csn.tu-chemnitz.de/~mha/linux-ip-nat/diplom/nat.html>.

Kernel level IP autoconfiguration
CONFIG_IP_PNP
  This enables automatic configuration of IP addresses of devices and
  of the routing table during kernel boot, based on either information
  supplied on the kernel command line or by BOOTP or RARP protocols.
  You need to say Y only for diskless machines requiring network
  access to boot (in which case you want to say Y to "Root file system
  on NFS" as well), because all other machines configure the network
  in their startup scripts.

BOOTP support
CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP
  If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) from some other computer over the
  net via NFS and you want the IP address of your computer to be
  discovered automatically at boot time using the BOOTP protocol (a
  special protocol designed for doing this job), say Y here. In case
  the boot ROM of your network card was designed for booting Linux and
  does BOOTP itself, providing all necessary information on the kernel
  command line, you can say N here. If unsure, say Y. Note that if you
  want to use BOOTP, a BOOTP server must be operating on your network.
  Read <file:Documentation/nfsroot.txt> for details.

DHCP support
CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP
  If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) from some other computer over the
  net via NFS and you want the IP address of your computer to be
  discovered automatically at boot time using the DHCP protocol (a
  special protocol designed for doing this job), say Y here. In case
  the boot ROM of your network card was designed for booting Linux and
  does DHCP itself, providing all necessary information on the kernel
  command line, you can say N here.

  If unsure, say Y. Note that if you want to use DHCP, a DHCP server
  must be operating on your network.  Read
  <file:Documentation/nfsroot.txt> for details.

RARP support
CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP
  If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) from some other computer over the
  net via NFS and you want the IP address of your computer to be
  discovered automatically at boot time using the RARP protocol (an
  older protocol which is being obsoleted by BOOTP and DHCP), say Y
  here. Note that if you want to use RARP, a RARP server must be
  operating on your network. Read <file:Documentation/nfsroot.txt> for
  details.

IP tunneling
CONFIG_NET_IPIP
  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within
  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
  encapsulation of IP within IP, which sounds kind of pointless, but
  can be useful if you want to make your (or some other) machine
  appear on a different network than it physically is, or to use
  mobile-IP facilities (allowing laptops to seamlessly move between
  networks without changing their IP addresses; check out
  <http://anchor.cs.binghamton.edu/~mobileip/LJ/index.html>).

  Saying Y to this option will produce two modules ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). Most people won't need this and can say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ipip.o

GRE tunnels over IP
CONFIG_NET_IPGRE
  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within
  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
  GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows
  encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv4 infrastructure.
  This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco
  likes GRE much better than the other Linux tunneling driver ("IP
  tunneling" above). In addition, GRE allows multicast redistribution
  through the tunnel.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ip_gre.o

Broadcast GRE over IP
CONFIG_NET_IPGRE_BROADCAST
  One application of GRE/IP is to construct a broadcast WAN (Wide Area
  Network), which looks like a normal Ethernet LAN (Local Area
  Network), but can be distributed all over the Internet. If you want
  to do that, say Y here and to "IP multicast routing" below.

IP multicast routing
CONFIG_IP_MROUTE
  This is used if you want your machine to act as a router for IP
  packets that have several destination addresses. It is needed on the
  MBONE, a high bandwidth network on top of the Internet which carries
  audio and video broadcasts. In order to do that, you would most
  likely run the program mrouted. Information about the multicast
  capabilities of the various network cards is contained in
  <file:Documentation/networking/multicast.txt>. If you haven't heard
  about it, you don't need it.

PIM-SM version 1 support
CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V1
  Kernel side support for Sparse Mode PIM (Protocol Independent
  Multicast) version 1. This multicast routing protocol is used widely
  because Cisco supports it. You need special software to use it
  (pimd-v1). Please see <http://netweb.usc.edu/pim/> for more
  information about PIM.

  Say Y if you want to use PIM-SM v1. Note that you can say N here if
  you just want to use Dense Mode PIM.

PIM-SM version 2 support
CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V2
  Kernel side support for Sparse Mode PIM version 2. In order to use
  this, you need an experimental routing daemon supporting it (pimd or
  gated-5). This routing protocol is not used widely, so say N unless
  you want to play with it.

Unix domain sockets
CONFIG_UNIX
  If you say Y here, you will include support for Unix domain sockets;
  sockets are the standard Unix mechanism for establishing and
  accessing network connections.  Many commonly used programs such as
  the X Window system and syslog use these sockets even if your
  machine is not connected to any network.  Unless you are working on
  an embedded system or something similar, you therefore definitely
  want to say Y here.

  However, the socket support is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be
  called unix.o.  If you try building this as a module and you have
  said Y to "Kernel module loader support" above, be sure to add
  'alias net-pf-1 unix' to your /etc/modules.conf file. Note that
  several important services won't work correctly if you say M here
  and then neglect to load the module.

  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

The IPv6 protocol
CONFIG_IPV6
  This is experimental support for the next version of the Internet
  Protocol: IP version 6 (also called IPng "IP next generation").
  Features of this new protocol include: expanded address space,
  authentication and privacy, and seamless interoperability with the
  current version of IP (IP version 4). For general information about
  IPv6, see <http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html>;
  for specific information about IPv6 under Linux read the HOWTO at
  <http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/> and the file net/ipv6/README
  in the kernel source.

  If you want to use IPv6, please upgrade to the newest net-tools as
  given in <file:Documentation/Changes>. You will still be able to do
  regular IPv4 networking as well.

  This protocol support is also available as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module will be called ipv6.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  It is safe to say N here for now.

The SCTP Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP_SCTP
  Stream Control Transmission Protocol

  From RFC 2960 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2960.txt)

  "SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a
  connectionless packet network such as IP.  It offers the following
  services to its users:

  -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,
  -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,
  -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams,
  with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user
  messages,
  -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP
  packet, and
  -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-
  homing at either or both ends of an association."

  This protocol support is also available as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module will be called sctp. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If in doubt, say N.

SCTP: Debug messages
CONFIG_SCTP_DBG_MSG
  If you say Y, this will enable verbose debugging messages. 

  If unsure, say N.  However, if you are running into problems, use 
  this option to gather detailed trace information

SCTP: Debug object counts
CONFIG_SCTP_DBG_OBJCNT
  If you say Y, this will enable debugging support for counting the 
  type of objects that are currently allocated.  This is useful for 
  identifying memory leaks.   If the /proc filesystem is enabled this 
  debug information can be viewed by 
  'cat /proc/net/sctp/sctp_dbg_objcnt'

  If unsure, say N

#choice
SCTP: HMAC algorithm
CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_NONE
  Choose an HMAC algorithm to be used during association establishment.
  It can be one of SHA1, MD5 or NONE. It is advised to use either HMAC-MD5
  or HMAC-SHA1.
  See configuration for Cryptographic API and enable these algorithms
  to make usable by SCTP.

SCTP: SHA1 HMAC algorithm
CONFIG_SCTP_HMAC_SHA1
  Enable the use of HMAC-SHA1 during association establishment.  It 
  is advised to use either HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1.
  See configuration for Cryptographic API and enable these algorithms
  to make usable by SCTP.

SCTP: MD5 HMAC algorithm
config SCTP_HMAC_MD5
  Enable the use of HMAC-MD5 during association establishment.  It is 
  advised to use either HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1.
  See configuration for Cryptographic API and enable these algorithms
  to make usable by SCTP.

Kernel httpd acceleration
CONFIG_KHTTPD
  The kernel httpd acceleration daemon (kHTTPd) is a (limited) web
  server built into the kernel. It is limited since it can only serve
  files from the file system and cannot deal with executable content
  such as CGI scripts. Serving files is sped up if you use kHTTPd.
  If kHTTPd is not able to fulfill a request, it can transparently
  pass it through to a user space web server such as apache.

  Saying "M" here builds the kHTTPd module; this is NOT enough to have
  a working kHTTPd. For safety reasons, the module has to be activated
  by doing a "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/khttpd/start" after inserting the
  module.

  Before using this, read the README in net/khttpd !

  The kHTTPd is experimental. Be careful when using it on a production
  machine. Also note that kHTTPd doesn't support virtual servers yet.

The IPX protocol
CONFIG_IPX
  This is support for the Novell networking protocol, IPX, commonly
  used for local networks of Windows machines.  You need it if you
  want to access Novell NetWare file or print servers using the Linux
  Novell client ncpfs (available from
  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/>) or from
  within the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>).  In order
  to do the former, you'll also have to say Y to "NCP file system
  support", below.

  IPX is similar in scope to IP, while SPX, which runs on top of IPX,
  is similar to TCP. There is also experimental support for SPX in
  Linux (see "SPX networking", below).

  To turn your Linux box into a fully featured NetWare file server and
  IPX router, say Y here and fetch either lwared from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/> or
  mars_nwe from <ftp://www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe/>. For more
  information, read the IPX-HOWTO available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.

  The IPX driver would enlarge your kernel by about 16 KB. This driver
  is also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want).  The module will
  be called ipx.o.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  Unless you want to
  integrate your Linux box with a local Novell network, say N.

Full internal IPX network
CONFIG_IPX_INTERN
  Every IPX network has an address that identifies it. Sometimes it is
  useful to give an IPX "network" address to your Linux box as well
  (for example if your box is acting as a file server for different
  IPX networks: it will then be accessible from everywhere using the
  same address). The way this is done is to create a virtual internal
  "network" inside your box and to assign an IPX address to this
  network. Say Y here if you want to do this; read the IPX-HOWTO at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.

  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on
  different virtual nodes of the internal network. This is done by
  evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the
  bind call. So applications should always initialize the node field
  to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the
  socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the
  kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full
  internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at
  'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is
  disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP
  daemons. A RIP/SAP daemon that works well with the full internal net
  can be found on <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/>.

  If you don't know what you are doing, say N.

#(We're told this will come back someday)

SPX networking
CONFIG_SPX
  * Orphaned entry retained 20 April 2001 by Petr Vandrovec     *
  * If you read this note from the configurator, please contact *
  * the Configure.help maintainers.                             *
  The Sequenced Packet eXchange protocol is a transport layer protocol
  built on top of IPX. It is used in Novell NetWare systems for
  client-server applications and is similar to TCP (which runs on top
  of IP).

  Note that Novell NetWare file sharing does not use SPX; it uses a
  protocol called NCP, for which separate Linux support is available
  ("NCP file system support" below for the client side, and the user
  space programs lwared or mars_nwe for the server side).

  Say Y here if you have use for SPX; read the IPX-HOWTO at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called af_spx.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

DECnet networking
CONFIG_DECNET
  The DECnet networking protocol was used in many products made by
  Digital (now Compaq).  It provides reliable stream and sequenced
  packet communications over which run a variety of services similar
  to those which run over TCP/IP.

  To find some tools to use with the kernel layer support, please
  look at Patrick Caulfield's web site:
  <http://linux.dreamtime.org/decnet/>.

  More detailed documentation is available in
  <file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt>.

  Be sure to say Y to "/proc file system support" and "Sysctl support"
  below when using DECnet, since you will need sysctl support to aid
  in configuration at run time.

  The DECnet code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called decnet.o.

DECnet SIOCFIGCONF support
CONFIG_DECNET_SIOCGIFCONF
  This option should only be turned on if you are really sure that
  you know what you are doing. It can break other applications which
  use this system call and the proper way to get the information
  provided by this call is to use rtnetlink.

  If unsure, say N.

DECnet router support
CONFIG_DECNET_ROUTER
  Add support for turning your DECnet Endnode into a level 1 or 2
  router.  This is an unfinished option for developers only.  If you
  do say Y here, then make sure that you also say Y to "Kernel/User
  network link driver", "Routing messages" and "Network packet
  filtering".  The first two are required to allow configuration via
  rtnetlink (currently you need Alexey Kuznetsov's iproute2 package
  from <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/>). The "Network packet filtering" option
  will be required for the forthcoming routing daemon to work.

  See <file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt> for more information.

Use FWMARK value as DECnet routing key
CONFIG_DECNET_ROUTE_FWMARK
  If you say Y here, you will be able to specify different routes for
  packets with different FWMARK ("firewalling mark") values
  (see ipchains(8), "-m" argument).

AppleTalk interfaces support
CONFIG_DEV_APPLETALK
  AppleTalk is the protocol that Apple computers can use to communicate
  on a network.  If your Linux box is connected to such a network, and wish
  to do IP over it, or you have a LocalTalk card and wish to use it to
  connect to the AppleTalk network, say Y.

AppleTalk protocol support
CONFIG_ATALK
  AppleTalk is the protocol that Apple computers can use to communicate
  on a network.  If your Linux box is connected to such a network and you
  wish to connect to it, say Y.  You will need to use the netatalk package
  so that your Linux box can act as a print and file server for Macs as
  well as access AppleTalk printers.  Check out
  <http://www.zettabyte.net/netatalk/> on the WWW for details.
  EtherTalk is the name used for AppleTalk over Ethernet and the
  cheaper and slower LocalTalk is AppleTalk over a proprietary Apple
  network using serial links.  EtherTalk and LocalTalk are fully
  supported by Linux.

  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.  The
  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information as well.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called appletalk.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  You
  almost certainly want to compile it as a module so you can restart
  your AppleTalk stack without rebooting your machine.  I hear that
  the GNU boycott of Apple is over, so even politically correct people
  are allowed to say Y here.

AppleTalk-IP driver support
CONFIG_IPDDP
  This allows IP networking for users who only have AppleTalk
  networking available. This feature is experimental. With this
  driver, you can encapsulate IP inside AppleTalk (e.g. if your Linux
  box is stuck on an AppleTalk only network) or decapsulate (e.g. if
  you want your Linux box to act as an Internet gateway for a zoo of
  AppleTalk connected Macs). Please see the file
  <file:Documentation/networking/ipddp.txt> for more information.

  If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP support will be compiled into
  the kernel. In this case, you can either use encapsulation or
  decapsulation, but not both. With the following two questions, you
  decide which one you want.

  If you say M here, the AppleTalk-IP support will be compiled as a
  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want, read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>).  The module is called ipddp.o.
  In this case, you will be able to use both encapsulation and
  decapsulation simultaneously, by loading two copies of the module
  and specifying different values for the module option ipddp_mode.

IP to AppleTalk-IP Encapsulation support
CONFIG_IPDDP_ENCAP
  If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP code will be able to encapsulate
  IP packets inside AppleTalk frames; this is useful if your Linux box
  is stuck on an AppleTalk network (which hopefully contains a
  decapsulator somewhere). Please see
  <file:Documentation/networking/ipddp.txt> for more information. If
  you said Y to "AppleTalk-IP driver support" above and you say Y
  here, then you cannot say Y to "AppleTalk-IP to IP Decapsulation
  support", below.

AppleTalk-IP to IP Decapsulation support
CONFIG_IPDDP_DECAP
  If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP code will be able to decapsulate
  AppleTalk-IP frames to IP packets; this is useful if you want your
  Linux box to act as an Internet gateway for an AppleTalk network.
  Please see <file:Documentation/networking/ipddp.txt> for more
  information.  If you said Y to "AppleTalk-IP driver support" above
  and you say Y here, then you cannot say Y to "IP to AppleTalk-IP
  Encapsulation support", above.

Apple/Farallon LocalTalk PC card support
CONFIG_LTPC
  This allows you to use the AppleTalk PC card to connect to LocalTalk
  networks. The card is also known as the Farallon PhoneNet PC card.
  If you are in doubt, this card is the one with the 65C02 chip on it.
  You also need version 1.3.3 or later of the netatalk package.
  This driver is experimental, which means that it may not work.
  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/ltpc.txt>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ltpc.o

COPS LocalTalk PC card support
CONFIG_COPS
  This allows you to use COPS AppleTalk cards to connect to LocalTalk
  networks. You also need version 1.3.3 or later of the netatalk
  package. This driver is experimental, which means that it may not
  work. This driver will only work if you choose "AppleTalk DDP"
  networking support, above.
  Please read the file <file:Documentation/networking/cops.txt>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cops.o

Dayna firmware support
CONFIG_COPS_DAYNA
  Support COPS compatible cards with Dayna style firmware (Dayna
  DL2000/ Daynatalk/PC (half length), COPS LT-95, Farallon PhoneNET PC
  III, Farallon PhoneNET PC II).

Tangent firmware support
CONFIG_COPS_TANGENT
  Support COPS compatible cards with Tangent style firmware (Tangent
  ATB_II, Novell NL-1000, Daystar Digital LT-200.

Amateur Radio support
CONFIG_HAMRADIO
  If you want to connect your Linux box to an amateur radio, answer Y
  here. You want to read <http://www.tapr.org/tapr/html/pkthome.html> and
  the AX25-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about amateur radio.

Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 protocol
CONFIG_AX25
  This is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
  radio. It is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to
  carry other protocols such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device
  that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio. You can either
  use a low speed TNC (a Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
  microphone input and speaker output) supporting the KISS protocol or
  one of the various SCC cards that are supported by the generic Z8530
  or the DMA SCC driver. Another option are the Baycom modem serial
  and parallel port hacks or the sound card modem (supported by their
  own drivers). If you say Y here, you also have to say Y to one of
  those drivers.

  Information about where to get supporting software for Linux amateur
  radio as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is
  contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You might also want to
  check out the file <file:Documentation/networking/ax25.txt> in the
  kernel source. More information about digital amateur radio in
  general is on the WWW at
  <http://www.tapr.org/tapr/html/pkthome.html>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called ax25.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

AX.25 DAMA Slave support
CONFIG_AX25_DAMA_SLAVE
  DAMA is a mechanism to prevent collisions when doing AX.25
  networking. A DAMA server (called "master") accepts incoming traffic
  from clients (called "slaves") and redistributes it to other slaves.
  If you say Y here, your Linux box will act as a DAMA slave; this is
  transparent in that you don't have to do any special DAMA
  configuration. (Linux cannot yet act as a DAMA server.) If unsure,
  say N.

AX.25 DAMA Master support
CONFIG_AX25_DAMA_MASTER
  DAMA is a mechanism to prevent collisions when doing AX.25
  networking. A DAMA server (called "master") accepts incoming traffic
  from clients (called "slaves") and redistributes it to other
  slaves. If you say Y here, your Linux box will act as a DAMA server.
  If unsure, say N.

Amateur Radio NET/ROM support
CONFIG_NETROM
  NET/ROM is a network layer protocol on top of AX.25 useful for
  routing.

  A comprehensive listing of all the software for Linux amateur radio
  users as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is
  contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You also might want to
  check out the file <file:Documentation/networking/ax25.txt>. More
  information about digital amateur radio in general is on the WWW at
  <http://www.tapr.org/tapr/html/pkthome.html>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called netrom.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose)
CONFIG_ROSE
  The Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) is a way to route packets over X.25
  connections in general and amateur radio AX.25 connections in
  particular, essentially an alternative to NET/ROM.

  A comprehensive listing of all the software for Linux amateur radio
  users as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is
  contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  You also might want to
  check out the file <file:Documentation/networking/ax25.txt>. More
  information about digital amateur radio in general is on the WWW at
  <http://www.tapr.org/tapr/html/pkthome.html>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called rose.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Serial port KISS driver for AX.25
CONFIG_MKISS
  KISS is a protocol used for the exchange of data between a computer
  and a Terminal Node Controller (a small embedded system commonly
  used for networking over AX.25 amateur radio connections; it
  connects the computer's serial port with the radio's microphone
  input and speaker output).

  Although KISS is less advanced than the 6pack protocol, it has
  the advantage that it is already supported by most modern TNCs
  without the need for a firmware upgrade.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called mkiss.o.

Serial port 6PACK driver for AX.25
CONFIG_6PACK
  6pack is a transmission protocol for the data exchange between your
  PC and your TNC (the Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
  microphone input and speaker output). This protocol can be used as
  an alternative to KISS for networking over AX.25 amateur radio
  connections, but it has some extended functionality.

  Note that this driver is still experimental and might cause
  problems. For details about the features and the usage of the
  driver, read <file:Documentation/networking/6pack.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called 6pack.o.

BPQ Ethernet driver
CONFIG_BPQETHER
  AX.25 is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
  radio. If you say Y here, you will be able to send and receive AX.25
  traffic over Ethernet (also called "BPQ AX.25"), which could be
  useful if some other computer on your local network has a direct
  amateur radio connection.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called bpqether.o.

High-speed (DMA) SCC driver for AX.25
CONFIG_DMASCC
  This is a driver for high-speed SCC boards, i.e. those supporting
  DMA on one port. You usually use those boards to connect your
  computer to an amateur radio modem (such as the WA4DSY 56kbps
  modem), in order to send and receive AX.25 packet radio network
  traffic.

  Currently, this driver supports Ottawa PI/PI2, Paccomm/Gracilis
  PackeTwin, and S5SCC/DMA boards. They are detected automatically.
  If you have one of these cards, say Y here and read the AX25-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver can operate multiple boards simultaneously. If you
  compile it as a module (by saying M instead of Y), it will be called
  dmascc.o. If you don't pass any parameter to the driver, all
  possible I/O addresses are probed. This could irritate other devices
  that are currently not in use. You may specify the list of addresses
  to be probed by "dmascc=addr1,addr2,..." (when compiled into the
  kernel image) or "io=addr1,addr2,..." (when loaded as a module). The
  network interfaces will be called dmascc0 and dmascc1 for the board
  detected first, dmascc2 and dmascc3 for the second one, and so on.

  Before you configure each interface with ifconfig, you MUST set
  certain parameters, such as channel access timing, clock mode, and
  DMA channel. This is accomplished with a small utility program,
  dmascc_cfg, available at
  <http://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/~kkudielk/Linux/>. Please be sure to get
  at least version 1.27 of dmascc_cfg, as older versions will not
  work with the current driver.

Z8530 SCC driver for AX.25
CONFIG_SCC
  These cards are used to connect your Linux box to an amateur radio
  in order to communicate with other computers. If you want to use
  this, read <file:Documentation/networking/z8530drv.txt> and the
  AX25-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Also make sure to say Y
  to "Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2" support.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called scc.o.

Support for TRX that feedback the tx signal to rx
CONFIG_SCC_TRXECHO
  Some transmitters feed the transmitted signal back to the receive
  line.  Say Y here to foil this by explicitly disabling the receiver
  during data transmission.  If in doubt, say Y.

Additional delay for PA0HZP OptoSCC compatible boards
CONFIG_SCC_DELAY
  Say Y here if you experience problems with the SCC driver not
  working properly; please read
  <file:Documentation/networking/z8530drv.txt> for details. If unsure,
  say N.

YAM driver for AX.25
CONFIG_YAM
  The YAM is a modem for packet radio which connects to the serial
  port and includes some of the functions of a Terminal Node
  Controller. If you have one of those, say Y here.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called yam.o.

BAYCOM picpar and par96 driver for AX.25
CONFIG_BAYCOM_PAR
  This is a driver for Baycom style simple amateur radio modems that
  connect to a parallel interface. The driver supports the picpar and
  par96 designs. To configure the driver, use the sethdlc utility
  available in the standard ax25 utilities package. For information on
  the modems, see <http://www.baycom.de/> and the file
  <file:Documentation/networking/baycom.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called baycom_par.o.

BAYCOM EPP driver for AX.25
CONFIG_BAYCOM_EPP
  This is a driver for Baycom style simple amateur radio modems that
  connect to a parallel interface. The driver supports the EPP
  designs. To configure the driver, use the sethdlc utility available
  in the standard ax25 utilities package. For information on the
  modems, see <http://www.baycom.de/> and the file
  <file:Documentation/networking/baycom.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called baycom_par.o.

BAYCOM ser12 full-duplex driver for AX.25
CONFIG_BAYCOM_SER_FDX
  This is one of two drivers for Baycom style simple amateur radio
  modems that connect to a serial interface. The driver supports the
  ser12 design in full-duplex mode. In addition, it allows the
  baudrate to be set between 300 and 4800 baud (however not all modems
  support all baudrates). This is the preferred driver. The next
  driver, "BAYCOM ser12 half-duplex driver for AX.25" is the old
  driver and still provided in case this driver does not work with
  your serial interface chip. To configure the driver, use the sethdlc
  utility available in the standard ax25 utilities package. For
  information on the modems, see <http://www.baycom.de/> and
  <file:Documentation/networking/baycom.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called baycom_ser_fdx.o.

BAYCOM ser12 half-duplex driver for AX.25
CONFIG_BAYCOM_SER_HDX
  This is one of two drivers for Baycom style simple amateur radio
  modems that connect to a serial interface. The driver supports the
  ser12 design in full-duplex mode. This is the old driver.  It is
  still provided in case your serial interface chip does not work with
  the full-duplex driver. This driver is depreciated.  To configure
  the driver, use the sethdlc utility available in the standard ax25
  utilities package. For information on the modems, see
  <http://www.baycom.de/> and
  <file:Documentation/networking/baycom.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called baycom_ser_hdx.o.

Sound card modem driver for AX.25
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM
  This experimental driver allows a standard Sound Blaster or
  WindowsSoundSystem compatible sound card to be used as a packet
  radio modem (NOT as a telephone modem!), to send digital traffic
  over amateur radio.

  To configure the driver, use the sethdlc, smdiag and smmixer
  utilities available in the standard ax25 utilities package. For
  information on how to key the transmitter, see
  <http://www.ife.ee.ethz.ch/~sailer/pcf/ptt_circ/ptt.html> and
  <file:Documentation/networking/soundmodem.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called soundmodem.o.

Sound card modem support for Sound Blaster and compatible cards
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_SBC
  This option enables the soundmodem driver to use Sound Blaster and
  compatible cards. If you have a dual mode card (i.e. a WSS cards
  with a Sound Blaster emulation) you should say N here and Y to
  "Sound card modem support for WSS and Crystal cards", below, because
  this usually results in better performance. This option also
  supports SB16/32/64 in full-duplex mode.

Sound card modem support for WSS and Crystal cards
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_WSS
  This option enables the soundmodem driver to use WindowsSoundSystem
  compatible cards. These cards feature a codec chip from either
  Analog Devices (such as AD1848, AD1845, AD1812) or Crystal
  Semiconductors (such as CS4248, CS423x). This option also supports
  the WSS full-duplex operation which currently works with Crystal
  CS423x chips. If you don't need full-duplex operation, do not enable
  it to save performance.

Sound card modem support for 1200 baud AFSK modulation
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_AFSK1200
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 1200 baud AFSK modem,
  compatible to popular modems using TCM3105 or AM7911. The
  demodulator requires about 12% of the CPU power of a Pentium 75 CPU
  per channel.

Sound card modem support for 2400 baud AFSK modulation (7.3728MHz crystal)
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_AFSK2400_7
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 2400 baud AFSK modem,
  compatible to TCM3105 modems (over-)clocked with a 7.3728MHz
  crystal. Note that the availability of this driver does _not_ imply
  that I recommend building such links. It is only here since users
  especially in eastern Europe have asked me to do so. In fact this
  modulation scheme has many disadvantages, mainly its incompatibility
  with many transceiver designs and the fact that the TCM3105 (if
  used) is operated widely outside its specifications.

Sound card modem support for 2400 baud AFSK modulation (8MHz crystal)
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_AFSK2400_8
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 2400 baud AFSK modem,
  compatible to TCM3105 modems (over-)clocked with an 8MHz crystal.
  Note that the availability of this driver does _not_ imply that I
  recommend building such links. It is only here since users
  especially in eastern Europe have asked me to do so. In fact this
  modulation scheme has many disadvantages, mainly its incompatibility
  with many transceiver designs and the fact that the TCM3105 (if
  used) is operated widely outside its specifications.

Sound card modem support for 2666 baud AFSK modulation
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_AFSK2666
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 2666 baud AFSK modem.
  This modem is experimental, and not compatible to anything
  else I know of.

Sound card modem support for 4800 baud 8PSK modulation
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_PSK4800
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 4800 baud 8PSK modem.
  This modem is experimental, and not compatible to anything
  else I know of.

Sound card modem support for 4800 baud HAPN-1 modulation
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_HAPN4800
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 4800 baud HAPN-1
  compatible modem. This modulation seems to be widely used 'down
  under' and in the Netherlands. Here, nobody uses it, so I could not
  test if it works. It is compatible to itself, however :-)

Sound card modem support for 9600 baud FSK G3RUH modulation
CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM_FSK9600
  This option enables the soundmodem driver 9600 baud FSK modem,
  compatible to the G3RUH standard. The demodulator requires about 4%
  of the CPU power of a Pentium 75 CPU per channel. You can say Y to
  both 1200 baud AFSK and 9600 baud FSK if you want (but obviously you
  can only use one protocol at a time, depending on what the other end
  can understand).

CCITT X.25 Packet Layer
CONFIG_X25
  X.25 is a set of standardized network protocols, similar in scope to
  frame relay; the one physical line from your box to the X.25 network
  entry point can carry several logical point-to-point connections
  (called "virtual circuits") to other computers connected to the X.25
  network. Governments, banks, and other organizations tend to use it
  to connect to each other or to form Wide Area Networks (WANs). Many
  countries have public X.25 networks. X.25 consists of two
  protocols: the higher level Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) (say Y here
  if you want that) and the lower level data link layer protocol LAPB
  (say Y to "LAPB Data Link Driver" below if you want that).

  You can read more about X.25 at <http://www.sangoma.com/x25.htm> and
  <http://www.cisco.com/univercd/data/doc/software/11_0/rpcg/cx25.htm>.
  Information about X.25 for Linux is contained in the files
  <file:Documentation/networking/x25.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/networking/x25-iface.txt>.

  One connects to an X.25 network either with a dedicated network card
  using the X.21 protocol (not yet supported by Linux) or one can do
  X.25 over a standard telephone line using an ordinary modem (say Y
  to "X.25 async driver" below) or over Ethernet using an ordinary
  Ethernet card and either the 802.2 LLC protocol (say Y to "802.2
  LLC" below) or LAPB over Ethernet (say Y to "LAPB Data Link Driver"
  and "LAPB over Ethernet driver" below).

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called x25.o. If unsure, say N.

LAPB Data Link Driver
CONFIG_LAPB
  Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) is the data link layer (i.e.
  the lower) part of the X.25 protocol. It offers a reliable
  connection service to exchange data frames with one other host, and
  it is used to transport higher level protocols (mostly X.25 Packet
  Layer, the higher part of X.25, but others are possible as well).
  Usually, LAPB is used with specialized X.21 network cards, but Linux
  currently supports LAPB only over Ethernet connections. If you want
  to use LAPB connections over Ethernet, say Y here and to "LAPB over
  Ethernet driver" below. Read
  <file:Documentation/networking/lapb-module.txt> for technical
  details.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module though ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called lapb.o.  If unsure, say N.

802.2 LLC
CONFIG_LLC
  This is a Logical Link Layer protocol used for X.25 connections over
  Ethernet, using ordinary Ethernet cards.

Frame Diverter
CONFIG_NET_DIVERT
  The Frame Diverter allows you to divert packets from the
  network, that are not aimed at the interface receiving it (in
  promisc. mode). Typically, a Linux box setup as an Ethernet bridge
  with the Frames Diverter on, can do some *really* transparent www
  caching using a Squid proxy for example.

  This is very useful when you don't want to change your router's
  config (or if you simply don't have access to it).

  The other possible usages of diverting Ethernet Frames are
  numberous:
   - reroute smtp traffic to another interface
   - traffic-shape certain network streams
   - transparently proxy smtp connections
   - etc...

  For more informations, please refer to:
    <http://diverter.sourceforge.net/>
    <http://perso.wanadoo.fr/magpie/EtherDivert.html>

  If unsure, say N.

802.1d Ethernet Bridging
CONFIG_BRIDGE
  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an
  Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it
  is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants.
  Several such bridges can work together to create even larger
  networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm.
  As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with
  other third party bridge products.

  In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge
  configuration tools; see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt>
  for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more
  information.

  Note that if your box acts as a bridge, it probably contains several
  Ethernet devices, but the kernel is not able to recognize more than
  one at boot time without help; for details read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available from in <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this code as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called bridge.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Packet socket
CONFIG_PACKET
  The Packet protocol is used by applications which communicate
  directly with network devices without an intermediate network
  protocol implemented in the kernel, e.g. tcpdump.  If you want them
  to work, choose Y.

  This driver is also available as a module called af_packet.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>; if you use modprobe
  or kmod, you may also want to add "alias net-pf-17 af_packet" to
  /etc/modules.conf.

  If unsure, say Y.

Packet socket: mmapped IO
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP
  If you say Y here, the Packet protocol driver can use a faster and 
  more efficient capture method. This feature also allows bigger 
  receive buffers. To take advantage of this method who have to use 
  a libpcap library that supports it. For more info see
  <file:Documentation/networking/packet_mmap.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

Netlink device emulation
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV
  This option will be removed soon. Any programs that want to use
  character special nodes like /dev/tap0 or /dev/route (all with major
  number 36) need this option, and need to be rewritten soon to use
  the real netlink socket.
  This is a backward compatibility option, choose Y for now.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  netlink_dev.o

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
CONFIG_ATM
  ATM is a high-speed networking technology for Local Area Networks
  and Wide Area Networks.  It uses a fixed packet size and is
  connection oriented, allowing for the negotiation of minimum
  bandwidth requirements.

  In order to participate in an ATM network, your Linux box needs an
  ATM networking card. If you have that, say Y here and to the driver
  of your ATM card below.

  Note that you need a set of user-space programs to actually make use
  of ATM.  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/atm.txt> for
  further details.

Classical IP over ATM
CONFIG_ATM_CLIP
  Classical IP over ATM for PVCs and SVCs, supporting InARP and
  ATMARP. If you want to communication with other IP hosts on your ATM
  network, you will typically either say Y here or to "LAN Emulation
  (LANE)" below.

Do NOT send ICMP if no neighbour
CONFIG_ATM_CLIP_NO_ICMP
  Normally, an "ICMP host unreachable" message is sent if a neighbour
  cannot be reached because there is no VC to it in the kernel's
  ATMARP table. This may cause problems when ATMARP table entries are
  briefly removed during revalidation. If you say Y here, packets to
  such neighbours are silently discarded instead.

RFC1483/2684 Bridged protocols
CONFIG_ATM_BR2684
  ATM PVCs can carry ethernet PDUs according to rfc2684 (formerly 1483)
  This device will act like an ethernet from the kernels point of view,
  with the traffic being carried by ATM PVCs (currently 1 PVC/device).
  This is sometimes used over DSL lines.  If in doubt, say N.

Per-VC IP filter kludge
CONFIG_ATM_BR2684_IPFILTER
  This is an experimental mechanism for users who need to terminating a
  large number of IP-only vcc's.  Do not enable this unless you are sure
  you know what you are doing.

LAN Emulation (LANE) support
CONFIG_ATM_LANE
  LAN Emulation emulates services of existing LANs across an ATM
  network. Besides operating as a normal ATM end station client, Linux
  LANE client can also act as an proxy client bridging packets between
  ELAN and Ethernet segments. You need LANE if you want to try MPOA.

Multi-Protocol Over ATM (MPOA) support
CONFIG_ATM_MPOA
  Multi-Protocol Over ATM allows ATM edge devices such as routers,
  bridges and ATM attached hosts establish direct ATM VCs across
  subnetwork boundaries. These shortcut connections bypass routers
  enhancing overall network performance.

ATM over TCP
CONFIG_ATM_TCP
  ATM over TCP driver. Useful mainly for development and for
  experiments. If unsure, say N.

Efficient Networks ENI155P
CONFIG_ATM_ENI
  Driver for the Efficient Networks ENI155p series and SMC ATM
  Power155 155 Mbps ATM adapters. Both, the versions with 512KB and
  2MB on-board RAM (Efficient calls them "C" and "S", respectively),
  and the FPGA and the ASIC Tonga versions of the board are supported.
  The driver works with MMF (-MF or ...F) and UTP-5 (-U5 or ...D)
  adapters.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called eni.o.

Enable extended debugging
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_DEBUG
  Extended debugging records various events and displays that list
  when an inconsistency is detected. This mechanism is faster than
  generally using printks, but still has some impact on performance.
  Note that extended debugging may create certain race conditions
  itself. Enable this ONLY if you suspect problems with the driver.

Fine-tune burst settings
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST
  In order to obtain good throughput, the ENI NIC can transfer
  multiple words of data per PCI bus access cycle. Such a multi-word
  transfer is called a burst.

  The default settings for the burst sizes are suitable for most PCI
  chipsets. However, in some cases, large bursts may overrun buffers
  in the PCI chipset and cause data corruption. In such cases, large
  bursts must be disabled and only (slower) small bursts can be used.
  The burst sizes can be set independently in the send (TX) and
  receive (RX) direction.

  Note that enabling many different burst sizes in the same direction
  may increase the cost of setting up a transfer such that the
  resulting throughput is lower than when using only the largest
  available burst size.

  Also, sometimes larger bursts lead to lower throughput, e.g. on an
  Intel 440FX board, a drop from 135 Mbps to 103 Mbps was observed
  when going from 8W to 16W bursts.

Enable 16W TX bursts (discouraged)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_16W
  Burst sixteen words at once in the send direction. This may work
  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets.

Enable 8W TX bursts (recommended)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_8W
  Burst eight words at once in the send direction. This is the default
  setting.

Enable 4W TX bursts (optional)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_4W
  Burst four words at once in the send direction. You may want to try
  this if you have disabled 8W bursts. Enabling 4W if 8W is also set
  may or may not improve throughput.

Enable 2W TX bursts (optional)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_2W
  Burst two words at once in the send direction. You may want to try
  this if you have disabled 4W and 8W bursts. Enabling 2W if 4W or 8W
  are also set may or may not improve throughput.

Enable 16W RX bursts (discouraged)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_16W
  Burst sixteen words at once in the receive direction. This may work
  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets.

Enable 8W RX bursts (discouraged)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_8W
  Burst eight words at once in the receive direction. This may work
  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets,
  such as the Intel Neptune series.

Enable 4W RX bursts (recommended)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_4W
  Burst four words at once in the receive direction. This is the
  default setting. Enabling 4W if 8W is also set may or may not
  improve throughput.

Enable 2W RX bursts (optional)
CONFIG_ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_2W
  Burst two words at once in the receive direction. You may want to
  try this if you have disabled 4W and 8W bursts. Enabling 2W if 4W or
  8W are also set may or may not improve throughput.

ZeitNet ZN1221/ZN1225
CONFIG_ATM_ZATM
  Driver for the ZeitNet ZN1221 (MMF) and ZN1225 (UTP-5) 155 Mbps ATM
  adapters.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called zatm.o.

Enable extended debugging
CONFIG_ATM_ZATM_DEBUG
  Extended debugging records various events and displays that list
  when an inconsistency is detected. This mechanism is faster than
  generally using printks, but still has some impact on performance.
  Note that extended debugging may create certain race conditions
  itself. Enable this ONLY if you suspect problems with the driver.

Fujitsu FireStream (FS50/FS155)
CONFIG_ATM_FIRESTREAM
  Driver for the Fujitsu FireStream 155 (MB86697) and
  FireStream 50 (MB86695) ATM PCI chips.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  firestream.o.

Enable usec resolution timestamps
CONFIG_ATM_ZATM_EXACT_TS
  The uPD98401 SAR chip supports a high-resolution timer (approx. 30
  MHz) that is used for very accurate reception timestamps. Because
  that timer overflows after 140 seconds, and also to avoid timer
  drift, time measurements need to be periodically synchronized with
  the normal system time. Enabling this feature will add some general
  overhead for timer synchronization and also per-packet overhead for
  time conversion.

IDT 77201/11 (NICStAR) (ForeRunnerLE)
CONFIG_ATM_NICSTAR
  The NICStAR chipset family is used in a large number of ATM NICs for
  25 and for 155 Mbps, including IDT cards and the Fore ForeRunnerLE
  series. Say Y if you have one of those.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  nicstar.o.

Use suni PHY driver (155Mbps)
CONFIG_ATM_NICSTAR_USE_SUNI
  Support for the S-UNI and compatible PHYsical layer chips. These are
  found in most 155Mbps NICStAR based ATM cards, namely in the
  ForeRunner LE155 cards. This driver provides detection of cable~
  removal and reinsertion and provides some statistics. This driver
  doesn't have removal capability when compiled as a module, so if you
  need that capability don't include S-UNI support (it's not needed to
  make the card work).

Use IDT77015 PHY driver (25Mbps)
CONFIG_ATM_NICSTAR_USE_IDT77105
  Support for the PHYsical layer chip in ForeRunner LE25 cards. In
  addition to cable removal/reinsertion detection, this driver allows
  you to control the loopback mode of the chip via a dedicated IOCTL.
  This driver is required for proper handling of temporary carrier
  loss, so if you have a 25Mbps NICStAR based ATM card you must say Y.

IDT 77252 (NICStAR II)
CONFIG_ATM_IDT77252
  Driver for the IDT 77252 ATM PCI chips.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called idt77252.o

Enable debugging messages
CONFIG_ATM_IDT77252_DEBUG
  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of
  messages is controlled by a bitmap.  This may be specified as a
  module argument.  See the file <file:drivers/atm/idt77252.h> for
  the meanings of the bits in the mask.

  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the
  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When
  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.

Receive ALL cells in raw queue
CONFIG_ATM_IDT77252_RCV_ALL
  Enable receiving of all cells on the ATM link, that do not match
  an open connection in the raw cell queue of the driver.  Useful
  for debugging or special applications only, so the safe answer is N.

Madge Ambassador (Collage PCI 155 Server)
CONFIG_ATM_AMBASSADOR
  This is a driver for ATMizer based ATM card produced by Madge
  Networks Ltd. Say Y (or M to compile as a module named ambassador.o)
  here if you have one of these cards.

Enable debugging messages
CONFIG_ATM_AMBASSADOR_DEBUG
  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of
  messages is controlled by a bitmap.  This may be specified as a
  module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed
  dynamically using an ioctl (not yet) or changed by sending the
  string "Dxxxx" to VCI 1023 (where x is a hex digit).  See the file
  <file:drivers/atm/ambassador.h> for the meanings of the bits in the
  mask.

  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the
  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When
  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.

Madge Horizon [Ultra] (Collage PCI 25 and Collage PCI 155 Client)
CONFIG_ATM_HORIZON
  This is a driver for the Horizon chipset ATM adapter cards once
  produced by Madge Networks Ltd. Say Y (or M to compile as a module
  named horizon.o) here if you have one of these cards.

Enable debugging messages
CONFIG_ATM_HORIZON_DEBUG
  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of
  messages is controlled by a bitmap.  This may be specified as a
  module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed
  dynamically using an ioctl (not yet) or changed by sending the
  string "Dxxxx" to VCI 1023 (where x is a hex digit).  See the file
  <file:drivers/atm/horizon.h> for the meanings of the bits in the
  mask.

  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the
  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When
  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.

Interphase ATM PCI x575/x525/x531
CONFIG_ATM_IA
  This is a driver for the Interphase (i)ChipSAR adapter cards
  which include a variety of variants in term of the size of the
  control memory (128K-1KVC, 512K-4KVC), the size of the packet
  memory (128K, 512K, 1M), and the PHY type (Single/Multi mode OC3,
  UTP155, UTP25, DS3 and E3). Go to:
  	<http://www.iphase.com/products/ClassSheet.cfm?ClassID=ATM>
  for more info about the cards. Say Y (or M to compile as a module
  named iphase.o) here if you have one of these cards.

  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/iphase.txt> for further
  details.

Enable debugging messages
CONFIG_ATM_IA_DEBUG
  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of
  messages is controlled by a bitmap. This may be specified as a
  module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed
  dynamically using an ioctl (Get the debug utility, iadbg, from
  <ftp://ftp.iphase.com/pub/atm/pci/>).

  See the file <file:drivers/atm/iphase.h> for the meanings of the
  bits in the mask.

  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the
  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When
  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.

Efficient Networks Speedstream 3010
CONFIG_ATM_LANAI
  Supports ATM cards based on the Efficient Networks "Lanai"
  chipset such as the Speedstream 3010 and the ENI-25p.  The
  Speedstream 3060 is currently not supported since we don't
  have the code to drive the on-board Alcatel DSL chipset (yet).

Linux telephony support
CONFIG_PHONE
  Say Y here if you have a telephony card, which for example allows
  you to use a regular phone for voice-over-IP applications.

  Note: this has nothing to do with modems.  You do not need to say Y
  here in order to be able to use a modem under Linux.

  This support is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  phonedev.o.

Compaq Smart Array support
CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA
  This is the driver for Compaq Smart Array 5xxx controllers.
  Everyone using these boards should say Y here.
  See <file:Documentation/cciss.txt> for the current list of
  boards supported by this driver, and for further information
  on the use of this driver.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cciss.o

SCSI tape drive support for Smart Array 5xxx
CONFIG_CISS_SCSI_TAPE
  When enabled (Y), this option allows SCSI tape drives and SCSI medium
  changers (tape robots) to be accessed via a Compaq 5xxx array
  controller.  (See <file:Documentation/cciss.txt> for more details.)

  "SCSI support" and "SCSI tape support" must also be enabled for this
  option to work.

  When this option is disabled (N), the SCSI portion of the driver
  is not compiled.

Enable monitor thread
CONFIG_CISS_MONITOR_THREAD
  Intended for use with multipath configurations (see the md driver).
  This option allows a per-adapter monitoring thread to periodically
  poll the adapter to detect failure modes in which the processor
  is unable to receive interrupts from the adapter, thus enabling 
  fail-over to an alternate adapter in such situations.  See 
  <file:Documentation/cciss.txt> for more details.

QuickNet Internet LineJack/PhoneJack support
CONFIG_PHONE_IXJ
  Say M if you have a telephony card manufactured by Quicknet
  Technologies, Inc.  These include the Internet PhoneJACK and
  Internet LineJACK Telephony Cards. You will get a module called
  ixj.o.

  For the ISA versions of these products, you can configure the
  cards using the isapnp tools (pnpdump/isapnp) or you can use the
  isapnp support.  Please read <file:Documentation/telephony/ixj.txt>.

  For more information on these cards, see Quicknet's web site at:
  <http://www.quicknet.net/>.

  If you do not have any Quicknet telephony cards, you can safely
  say N here.

QuickNet Internet LineJack/PhoneJack PCMCIA support
CONFIG_PHONE_IXJ_PCMCIA
  Say Y here to configure in PCMCIA service support for the Quicknet
  cards manufactured by Quicknet Technologies, Inc.  This builds an
  additional support module for the PCMCIA version of the card.

FORE Systems 200E-series
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_MAYBE
  This is a driver for the FORE Systems 200E-series ATM adapter
  cards. It simultaneously supports PCA-200E and SBA-200E models
  on PCI and SBUS hosts. Say Y (or M to compile as a module
  named fore_200e.o) here if you have one of these ATM adapters.

  Note that the driver will actually be compiled only if you
  additionally enable the support for PCA-200E and/or SBA-200E
  cards.

  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/fore200e.txt> for
  further details.

Enable PCA-200E card support on PCI-based hosts
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_PCA
  Say Y here if you want your PCA-200E cards to be probed.

Use default PCA-200E firmware
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_PCA_DEFAULT_FW
  Use the default PCA-200E firmware data shipped with the driver.

  Normal users do not have to deal with the firmware stuff, so
  they should say Y here.

Pathname of user-supplied binary firmware
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_PCA_FW
  This defines the pathname of an alternative PCA-200E binary
  firmware image supplied by the user. This pathname may be
  absolute or relative to the drivers/atm directory.

  The driver comes with an adequate firmware image, so normal users do
  not have to supply an alternative one. They just say Y to "Use
  default PCA-200E firmware" instead.

Enable SBA-200E card support on SBUS-based hosts
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_SBA
  Say Y here if you want your SBA-200E cards to be probed.

Use default SBA-200E firmware
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_SBA_DEFAULT_FW
  Use the default SBA-200E firmware data shipped with the driver.

  Normal users do not have to deal with the firmware stuff, so
  they should say Y here.

Pathname of user-supplied binary firmware
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_SBA_FW
  This defines the pathname of an alternative SBA-200E binary
  firmware image supplied by the user. This pathname may be
  absolute or relative to the drivers/atm directory.

  The driver comes with an adequate firmware image, so normal users do
  not have to supply an alternative one. They just say Y to "Use
  default SBA-200E firmware", above.

Maximum number of tx retries
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_TX_RETRY
  Specifies the number of times the driver attempts to transmit
  a message before giving up, if the transmit queue of the ATM card
  is transiently saturated.

  Saturation of the transmit queue may occur only under extreme
  conditions, e.g. when a fast host continuously submits very small
  frames (<64 bytes) or raw AAL0 cells (48 bytes) to the ATM adapter.

  Note that under common conditions, it is unlikely that you encounter
  a saturation of the transmit queue, so the retry mechanism never
  comes into play.

Debugging level (0-3)
CONFIG_ATM_FORE200E_DEBUG
  Specifies the level of debugging messages issued by the driver.
  The verbosity of the driver increases with the value of this
  parameter.

  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on
  the performances of the driver, and the size of your syslog files!
  Keep the debugging level to 0 during normal operations.

ForeRunner HE Series
CONFIG_ATM_HE
  This is a driver for the Marconi ForeRunner HE-series ATM adapter
  cards. It simultaneously supports the 155 and 622 versions.

Use S/UNI PHY driver
  Support for the S/UNI-Ultra and S/UNI-622 found in the ForeRunner
  HE cards.  This driver provides carrier detection some statistics.

PPP over ATM
CONFIG_PPPOATM
  Support PPP (Point to Point Protocol) encapsulated in ATM frames.
  This implementation does not yet comply with section 8 of RFC2364,
  which can lead to bad results idf the ATM peer loses state and 
  changes its encapsulation unilaterally.

Fusion MPT device support
CONFIG_FUSION
  LSI Logic Fusion(TM) Message Passing Technology (MPT) device support
  provides high performance SCSI host initiator, and LAN [1] interface
  services to a host system.  The Fusion architecture is capable of
  duplexing these protocols on high-speed Fibre Channel
  (up to 2 GHz x 2 ports = 4 GHz) and parallel SCSI (up to Ultra-320)
  physical medium.

          [1] LAN is not supported on parallel SCSI medium.

  These drivers require a Fusion MPT compatible PCI adapter installed
  in the host system.  MPT adapters contain specialized I/O processors
  to handle I/O workload, and more importantly to offload this work
  from the host CPU(s).

  If you have Fusion MPT hardware and want to use it, you can say
  Y or M here to add MPT (base + ScsiHost) drivers.
    <Y> = build lib (fusion.o), and link [static] into the kernel [2]
          proper
    <M> = compiled as [dynamic] modules [3] named: (mptbase.o,
          mptscsih.o)

          [2] In order enable capability to boot the linux kernel
              natively from a Fusion MPT target device, you MUST
               answer Y here! (currently requires CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD)
          [3] This support is also available as a module ( = code
              which can be inserted in and removed from the running
              kernel whenever you want).  If you want to compile as
              modules, say M here and read
              <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

  If you say Y or M here you will get a choice of these
  additional protocol and support module options:         Module Name:
    <M>   Enhanced SCSI error reporting                     (isense.o)
    <M>   Fusion MPT misc device (ioctl) driver             (mptctl.o)
    <M>   Fusion MPT LAN driver                             (mptlan.o)

  ---
  Fusion MPT is trademark of LSI Logic Corporation, and its
  architecture is based on LSI Logic's Message Passing Interface (MPI)
  specification.

Maximum number of scatter gather entries
CONFIG_FUSION_MAX_SGE
  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of scatter-
  gather entries per I/O. The driver defaults to 40, a reasonable number
  for most systems. However, the user may increase this up to 128.
  Increasing this parameter will require significantly more memory
  on a per controller instance. Increasing the parameter is not
  necessary (or recommended) unless the user will be running
  large I/O's via the raw interface.

Fusion MPT enhanced SCSI error reporting [optional] module
CONFIG_FUSION_ISENSE
  The isense module (roughly stands for Interpret SENSE data) is
  completely optional.  It simply provides extra English readable
  strings in SCSI Error Report(s) that might be generated from the
  Fusion MPT SCSI Host driver, for example when a target device
  returns a SCSI check condition on a I/O.  Without this module
  loaded you might see:

    SCSI Error Report =-=-= (ioc0,scsi5:0)
      SCSI_Status=02h (CHECK_CONDITION)
      Original_CDB[]: 2A 00 00 00 00 41 00 00 02 00
      SenseData[12h]: 70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 04 02 02 00 00 00
      SenseKey=2h (NOT READY); FRU=02h
      ASC/ASCQ=29h/00h

  Where otherwise, if this module had been loaded, you would see:

    SCSI Error Report =-=-= (ioc0,scsi5:0)
      SCSI_Status=02h (CHECK_CONDITION)
      Original_CDB[]: 2A 00 00 00 00 41 00 00 02 00 - "WRITE(10)"
      SenseData[12h]: 70 00 02 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 04 02 02 00 00 00
      SenseKey=2h (NOT READY); FRU=02h
      ASC/ASCQ=29h/00h "LOGICAL UNIT NOT READY, INITIALIZING CMD. REQUIRED"

  Say M for "Enhanced SCSI error reporting" to compile this optional module,
  creating a driver named: isense.o.

  NOTE: Support for building this feature into the kernel is not
  available, due to kernel size considerations.

Fusion MPT misc device (ioctl) driver [optional] module
CONFIG_FUSION_CTL
  The Fusion MPT misc device driver provides specialized control
  of MPT adapters via system ioctl calls.  Use of ioctl calls to
  the MPT driver requires that you create and use a misc device
  node ala:
    mknod /dev/mptctl c 10 240

  One use of this ioctl interface is to perform an upgrade (reflash)
  of the MPT adapter firmware.  Refer to readme file(s) distributed
  with the Fusion MPT linux driver for additional details.

  If enabled by saying M to this, a driver named: mptctl.o
  will be compiled.

  If unsure whether you really want or need this, say N.

Fusion MPT LAN driver [optional]
CONFIG_FUSION_LAN
  This module supports LAN IP traffic over Fibre Channel port(s)
  on Fusion MPT compatible hardware (LSIFC9xx chips).
  The physical interface used is defined in RFC 2625.
  Please refer to that document for details.

  Installing this driver requires the knowledge to configure and
  activate a new network interface, "fc0", using standard Linux tools.

  If enabled by saying M to this, a driver named: mptlan.o
  will be compiled.

  If unsure whether you really want or need this, say N.

  NOTES: This feature is NOT available nor supported for linux-2.2.x
  kernels.  You must be building a linux-2.3.x or linux-2.4.x kernel
  in order to configure this option.
  Support for building this feature into the linux kernel is not
  yet available.

SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI
  If you want to use a SCSI hard disk, SCSI tape drive, SCSI CD-ROM or
  any other SCSI device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know
  the name of your SCSI host adapter (the card inside your computer
  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol, also called SCSI controller),
  because you will be asked for it.

  You also need to say Y here if you want support for the parallel
  port version of the 100 MB IOMEGA ZIP drive.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called scsi_mod.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>.  However, do not compile this as a
  module if your root file system (the one containing the directory /)
  is located on a SCSI device.

SCSI disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
  If you want to use a SCSI hard disk or the SCSI or parallel port
  version of the IOMEGA ZIP drive under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, the Disk-HOWTO and the Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. This is NOT for SCSI
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sd_mod.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>.  Do not compile this driver as a
  module if your root file system (the one containing the directory /)
  is located on a SCSI disk. In this case, do not compile the driver
  for your SCSI host adapter (below) as a module either.

Maximum number of SCSI disks that can be loaded as modules
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS
  This controls the amount of additional space allocated in tables for
  drivers that are loaded as modules after the kernel is booted.  In
  the event that the SCSI core itself was loaded as a module, this
  value is the number of additional disks that can be loaded after the
  first host driver is loaded.

  Admittedly this isn't pretty, but there are tons of race conditions
  involved with resizing the internal arrays on the fly.  Someday this
  flag will go away, and everything will work automatically.

  If you don't understand what's going on, go with the default.

Maximum number of SCSI tapes that can be loaded as modules
CONFIG_ST_EXTRA_DEVS
  This controls the amount of additional space allocated in tables for
  drivers that are loaded as modules after the kernel is booted.  In
  the event that the SCSI core itself was loaded as a module, this
  value is the number of additional tapes that can be loaded after the
  first host driver is loaded.

  Admittedly this isn't pretty, but there are tons of race conditions
  involved with resizing the internal arrays on the fly.  Someday this
  flag will go away, and everything will work automatically.

  If you don't understand what's going on, go with the default.

SCSI tape support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST
  If you want to use a SCSI tape drive under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, and
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.st> in the kernel source.  This is NOT for
  SCSI CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called st.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>.

OnStream SC-x0 SCSI tape support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_OSST
  The OnStream SC-x0 SCSI tape drives can not be driven by the
  standard st driver, but instead need this special osst driver and
  use the  /dev/osstX char device nodes (major 206).  Via usb-storage
  and ide-scsi, you may be able to drive the USB-x0 and DI-x0 drives
  as well.  Note that there is also a second generation of OnStream
  tape drives (ADR-x0) that supports the standard SCSI-2 commands for
  tapes (QIC-157) and can be driven by the standard driver st.
  For more information, you may have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>  and
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.osst>  in the kernel source.
  More info on the OnStream driver may be found on
  <http://linux1.onstream.nl/test/>
  Please also have a look at the standard st docu, as most of it
  applies to osst as well.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called osst.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>.

SCSI CD-ROM support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR
  If you want to use a SCSI CD-ROM under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO and the CD-ROM-HOWTO at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Also make sure to say Y
  or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support" later.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sr_mod.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>.

Maximum number of CD-ROM devices that can be loaded as modules
CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS
  This controls the amount of additional space allocated in tables for
  drivers that are loaded as modules after the kernel is booted. In
  the event that the SCSI core itself was loaded as a module, this
  value is the number of additional CD-ROMs that can be loaded after
  the first host driver is loaded.

  Admittedly this isn't pretty, but there are tons of race conditions
  involved with resizing the internal arrays on the fly.  Someday this
  flag will go away, and everything will work automatically.

  If you don't understand what's going on, go with the default.

Enable vendor-specific extensions (for SCSI CD-ROM)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR_VENDOR
  This enables the usage of vendor specific SCSI commands. This is
  required to support multisession CDs with old NEC/TOSHIBA cdrom
  drives (and HP Writers). If you have such a drive and get the first
  session only, try saying Y here; everybody else says N.

SCSI generic support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG
  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
  about anything having "SCSI" in its name other than hard disks,
  CD-ROMs or tapes, say Y here. These won't be supported by the kernel
  directly, so you need some additional software which knows how to
  talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

  For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.mostang.com/sane/>). For CD
  writer software look at Cdrtools
  (<http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html>)
  and for burning a "disk at once": CDRDAO
  (<http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>). Cdparanoia is a high
  quality digital reader of audio CDs (<http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/>).
  For other devices, it's possible that you'll have to write the
  driver software yourself. Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/scsi-generic.txt> for more information.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/scsi.txt>. The module will be called sg.o. If unsure,
  say N.

Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have a SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, and only one LUN is detected, you
  can say Y here to force the SCSI driver to probe for multiple LUNs.
  A SCSI device with multiple LUNs acts logically like multiple SCSI
  devices. The vast majority of SCSI devices have only one LUN, and
  so most people can say N here and should in fact do so, because it
  is safer.

Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS
  The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will be easier to
  understand if you say Y here; it will enlarge your kernel by about
  12 KB. If in doubt, say Y.

SCSI logging facility
CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING
  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
  of SCSI related problems.

  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

     echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi

  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

  There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
  find them in the source: <file:drivers/scsi/scsi.c>), and this
  allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
  level allows you to select the level of verbosity.

  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
  logging turned off.

QDIO base support for IBM S/390 and zSeries
CONFIG_QDIO
  This driver provides the Queued Direct I/O base support for the
  IBM S/390 (G5 and G6) and eServer zSeries (z800 and z900).

  For details please refer to the documentation provided by IBM at
  <http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390>

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called qdio.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

Performance statistics for QDIO base support
CONFIG_QDIO_PERF_STATS
  Say Y here to get performance statistics in /proc/qdio_perf

  If unsure, say N.

SGI WD93C93 SCSI Driver
CONFIG_SCSI_SGIWD93
  Say Y here to support the on-board WD93C93 SCSI controller found (a)
  on the Indigo2 and other MIPS-based SGI machines, and (b) on ARCS
  ARM-based machines.

DEC NCR53C94 SCSI Driver
CONFIG_SCSI_DECNCR
  Say Y here to support the NCR53C94 SCSI controller chips on IOASIC
  based TURBOchannel DECstations and TURBOchannel PMAZ-A cards.

AdvanSys SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_ADVANSYS
  This is a driver for all SCSI host adapters manufactured by
  AdvanSys. It is documented in the kernel source in
  <file:drivers/scsi/advansys.c>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  advansys.o.

Adaptec AHA152X/2825 support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA152X
  This is a driver for the AHA-1510, AHA-1520, AHA-1522, and AHA-2825
  SCSI host adapters. It also works for the AVA-1505, but the IRQ etc.
  must be manually specified in this case.

  It is explained in section 3.3 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You might also want to
  read the file <file:drivers/scsi/README.aha152x>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aha152x.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Adaptec AHA1542 support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1542
  This is support for a SCSI host adapter.  It is explained in section
  3.4 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that Trantor was
  purchased by Adaptec, and some former Trantor products are being
  sold under the Adaptec name.  If it doesn't work out of the box, you
  may have to change some settings in <file:drivers/scsi/aha1542.h>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called aha1542.o.

Adaptec AHA1740 support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1740
  This is support for a SCSI host adapter.  It is explained in section
  3.5 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If it doesn't work out
  of the box, you may have to change some settings in
  <file:drivers/scsi/aha1740.h>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aha1740.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Adaptec AIC7xxx support
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX
  This driver supports all of Adaptec's Fast through Ultra 160 PCI
  based SCSI controllers as well as the aic7770 based EISA and VLB
  SCSI controllers (the 274x and 284x series).  For AAA and ARO based
  configurations, only SCSI functionality is provided.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called aic7xxx.o.

Maximum number of TCQ commands per device
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE
  Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
  device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

  This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
  to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
  vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
  fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
  and display a console message indicating this value.

  Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using
  a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation
  failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,
  the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higer performance
  on some devices.  The upper bound is 253. 0 disables tagged queueing.

  Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line
  "tag_info" option.  See drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/README.aic7xxx
  for details.

  Default: 32

Initial bus reset delay in milli-seconds
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS
  The number of milliseconds to delay after an initial bus reset.
  The bus settle delay following all error recovery actions is
  dictated by the SCSI layer and is not affected by this value.

  Default: 15000 (15 seconds)

Probe for EISA and VL AIC7XXX Adapters
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_PROBE_EISA_VL
   Probe for EISA and VLB Aic7xxx controllers.  In many newer systems,
   the invasive probes necessary to detect these controllers can cause
   other devices to fail.  For this reason, the non-PCI probe code is
   disabled by default.  The current value of this option can be "toggled"
   via the no_probe kernel command line option.

CONFIG_AIC7XXX_BUILD_FIRMWARE
  This option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware
  source to the aic7xxx driver and wish to have the generated firmware
  include files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler
  for the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well
  as the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages
  or modify the assembler Makefile or the files it includes if your
  build environment is different than that of the author.

Compile in Debugging Code
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE
  Compile in aic7xxx debugging code that can be useful in diagnosing
  driver errors.

Debug code enable mask (2048 for all debugging)
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_MASK
  Bit mask of debug options that is only valid if the
  CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENBLE option is enabled.  The bits in this mask
  are defined in the drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.h - search for the
  variable ahc_debug in that file to find them.

  Default: 0

Decode registers during diagnostics
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT
  Compile in register value tables for the output of expanded register
  contents in diagnostics.  This make it much easier to understand debug
  output without having to refer to a data book and/or the aic7xxx.reg file.

Old Adaptec AIC7xxx support
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD
  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer
  under active development.  Adaptec, Inc. is writing a new driver to
  take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI
  controllers. These include the 274x EISA cards; 284x VLB cards;
  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
  motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
  the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
  need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically
  not supported (that's the RAID controller chip on the AAA-13x
  cards).

  Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this
  driver; choose "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" instead if you have
  one of those.

  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be
  found by checking the help file for each of the available
  configuration options. You should read
  <file:drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old/README.aic7xxx> at a minimum before
  contacting the maintainer with any questions.  The SCSI-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, can also
  be of great help.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called aic7xxx_old.o.

Enable tagged command queueing (TCQ) by default
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_OLD_TCQ_ON_BY_DEFAULT
  This option causes the aic7xxx driver to attempt to use Tagged
  Command Queueing (TCQ) on all devices that claim to support it.

  TCQ is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host
  adapter can send several SCSI commands to a device's queue even if
  previous commands haven't finished yet.  Because the device is
  intelligent, it can optimize its operations (like head positioning)
  based on its own request queue.  Not all devices implement this
  correctly.

  If you say Y here, you can still turn off TCQ on troublesome devices
  with the use of the tag_info boot parameter.  See the file
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.aic7xxx> for more information on that and
  other aic7xxx setup commands.  If this option is turned off, you may
  still enable TCQ on known good devices by use of the tag_info boot
  parameter.

  If you are unsure about your devices then it is safest to say N
  here.

  However, TCQ can increase performance on some hard drives by as much
  as 50% or more, so it is recommended that if you say N here, you
  should at least read the <file:drivers/scsi/README.aic7xxx> file so
  you will know how to enable this option manually should your drives
  prove to be safe in regards to TCQ.

  Conversely, certain drives are known to lock up or cause bus resets
  when TCQ is enabled on them.  If you have a Western Digital
  Enterprise SCSI drive for instance, then don't even bother to enable
  TCQ on it as the drive will become unreliable, and it will actually
  reduce performance.

Default number of TCQ commands per device
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_OLD_CMDS_PER_DEVICE
  Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
  device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

  Reasonable figures are in the range of 8 to 24 commands per device,
  but depending on hardware could be increased or decreased from that
  figure. If the number is too high for any particular device, the
  driver will automatically compensate usually after only 10 minutes
  of uptime. It will not hinder performance if some of your devices
  eventually have their command depth reduced, but is a waste of
  memory if all of your devices end up reducing this number down to a
  more reasonable figure.

  NOTE: Certain very broken drives are known to lock up when given
  more commands than they like to deal with. Quantum Fireball drives
  are the most common in this category. For the Quantum Fireball
  drives it is suggested to use no more than 8 commands per device.

  Default: 8

Collect statistics to report in /proc
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_OLD_PROC_STATS
  This option tells the driver to keep track of how many commands have
  been sent to each particular device and report that information to
  the user via the /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/n file, where n is the number of
  the aic7xxx controller you want the information on. This adds a
  small amount of overhead to each and every SCSI command the aic7xxx
  driver handles, so if you aren't really interested in this
  information, it is best to leave it disabled. This will only work if
  you also say Y to "/proc file system support", below.

  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SCSI_AIC79XX
  This driver supports all of Adaptec's Ultra 320 PCI-X based SCSI controllers.

CONFIG_AIC79XX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE 32
  Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
  device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

  This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
  to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
  vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
  fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
  and display a console message indicating this value.

  Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using
  a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation
  failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,
  the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higer performance
  on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.

  Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line
  "tag_info" option.  See drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/README.aic79xx
  for details.

  Default: 32

CONFIG_AIC79XX_RESET_DELAY_MS 15000
  The number of milliseconds to delay after an initial bus reset.
  The bus settle delay following all error recovery actions is
  dictated by the SCSI layer and is not affected by this value.

  Default: 15000 (15 seconds)

CONFIG_AIC79XX_BUILD_FIRMWARE
  This option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware
  source to the aic7xxx driver and wish to have the generated firmware
  include files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler
  for the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well
  as the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages
  or modify the assembler Makefile or the files it includes if your
  build environment is different than that of the author.

CONFIG_AIC79XX_ENABLE_RD_STRM
  Read Streaming is a U320 protocol option that should enhance performance.
  Early U320 drive firmware actually performs slower with read streaming
  enabled so it is disabled by default.  Read Streaming can be configured
  in much the same way as tagged queueing using the "rd_strm" command line
  option.  See drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/README.aic79xx for details.

CONFIG_AIC79XX_DEBUG_ENABLE
  Compile in aic79xx debugging code that can be useful in diagnosing
  driver errors.

CONFIG_AIC79XX_DEBUG_MASK
  Bit mask of debug options that is only valid if the
  CONFIG_AIC79XX_DEBUG_ENBLE option is enabled.  The bits in this mask
  are defined in the drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx.h - search for the
  variable ahd_debug in that file to find them.

  Default: 0

CONFIG_AIC79XX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT
  Compile in register value tables for the output of expanded register
  contents in diagnostics.  This make it much easier to understand debug
  output without having to refer to a data book and/or the aic7xxx.reg file.

Adaptec I2O RAID support
CONFIG_SCSI_DPT_I2O
  This driver supports all of Adaptec's I2O based RAID controllers as 
  well as the DPT SmartRaid V cards.  This is an Adaptec maintained
  driver by Deanna Bonds.  See <file:drivers/scsi/README.dpti>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  dpt_i2o.o.

IBM ServeRAID support
CONFIG_SCSI_IPS
  This is support for the IBM ServeRAID hardware RAID controllers.
  See <http://www.developer.ibm.com/welcome/netfinity/serveraid.html>
  for more information.  If this driver does not work correctly
  without modification please contact the author by email at
  ipslinux@us.ibm.com.

  You can build this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  but only a single instance may be loaded. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called ips.o.

BusLogic SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_BUSLOGIC
  This is support for BusLogic MultiMaster and FlashPoint SCSI Host
  Adapters. Consult the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, and the files
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.BusLogic> and
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.FlashPoint> for more information. If this
  driver does not work correctly without modification, please contact
  the author, Leonard N. Zubkoff, by email to lnz@dandelion.com.

  You can also build this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  but only a single instance may be loaded. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called BusLogic.o.

Omit BusLogic SCSI FlashPoint support
CONFIG_SCSI_OMIT_FLASHPOINT
  This option allows you to omit the FlashPoint support from the
  BusLogic SCSI driver. The FlashPoint SCCB Manager code is
  substantial, so users of MultiMaster Host Adapters may wish to omit
  it.

Compaq Fibre Channel 64-bit/66Mhz HBA support
CONFIG_SCSI_CPQFCTS
  Say Y here to compile in support for the Compaq StorageWorks Fibre
  Channel 64-bit/66Mhz Host Bus Adapter.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called cpqfc.o.

DMX3191D SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_DMX3191D
  This is support for Domex DMX3191D SCSI Host Adapters.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called dmx3191d.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

DTC3180/3280 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_DTC3280
  This is support for DTC 3180/3280 SCSI Host Adapters.  Please read
  the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, and the file
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.dtc3x80>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called dtc.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

EATA-DMA [Obsolete] (DPT, NEC, AT&T, SNI, AST, Olivetti, Alphatronix) support
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_DMA
  This is support for the EATA-DMA protocol compliant SCSI Host
  Adapters like the SmartCache III/IV, SmartRAID controller families
  and the DPT PM2011B and PM2012B controllers.

  Note that this driver is obsolete; if you have one of the above
  SCSI Host Adapters, you should normally say N here and Y to "EATA
  ISA/EISA/PCI support", below.  Please read the SCSI-HOWTO, available
  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called eata_dma.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

EATA-PIO (old DPT PM2001, PM2012A) support
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_PIO
  This driver supports all EATA-PIO protocol compliant SCSI Host
  Adapters like the DPT PM2001 and the PM2012A.  EATA-DMA compliant
  host adapters could also use this driver but are discouraged from
  doing so, since this driver only supports hard disks and lacks
  numerous features.  You might want to have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called eata_pio.o.

UltraStor 14F/34F support
CONFIG_SCSI_U14_34F
  This is support for the UltraStor 14F and 34F SCSI-2 host adapters.
  The source at <file:drivers/scsi/u14-34f.c> contains some
  information about this hardware.  If the driver doesn't work out of
  the box, you may have to change some settings in
  <file: drivers/scsi/u14-34f.c>.  Read the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that there is also
  another driver for the same hardware: "UltraStor SCSI support",
  below.  You should say Y to both only if you want 24F support as
  well.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called u14-34f.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

enable elevator sorting
CONFIG_SCSI_U14_34F_LINKED_COMMANDS
  This option enables elevator sorting for all probed SCSI disks and
  CD-ROMs. It definitely reduces the average seek distance when doing
  random seeks, but this does not necessarily result in a noticeable
  performance improvement: your mileage may vary...

  The safe answer is N.

maximum number of queued commands
CONFIG_SCSI_U14_34F_MAX_TAGS
  This specifies how many SCSI commands can be maximally queued for
  each probed SCSI device. You should reduce the default value of 8
  only if you have disks with buggy or limited tagged command support.
  Minimum is 2 and maximum is 14. This value is also the window size
  used by the elevator sorting option above. The effective value used
  by the driver for each probed SCSI device is reported at boot time.

Future Domain 16xx SCSI/AHA-2920A support
CONFIG_SCSI_FUTURE_DOMAIN
  This is support for Future Domain's 16-bit SCSI host adapters
  (TMC-1660/1680, TMC-1650/1670, TMC-3260, TMC-1610M/MER/MEX) and
  other adapters based on the Future Domain chipsets (Quantum
  ISA-200S, ISA-250MG; Adaptec AHA-2920A; and at least one IBM board).
  It is explained in section 3.7 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  NOTE: Newer Adaptec AHA-2920C boards use the Adaptec AIC-7850 chip
  and should use the aic7xxx driver ("Adaptec AIC7xxx chipset SCSI
  controller support"). This Future Domain driver works with the older
  Adaptec AHA-2920A boards with a Future Domain chip on them.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called fdomain.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Future Domain MCS-600/700 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_FD_MCS
  This is support for Future Domain MCS 600/700 MCA SCSI adapters.
  Some PS/2 computers are equipped with IBM Fast SCSI Adapter/A which
  is identical to the MCS 700 and hence also supported by this driver.
  This driver also supports the Reply SB16/SCSI card (the SCSI part).
  It supports multiple adapters in the same system.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called fd_mcs.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Generic NCR5380/53c400 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR5380
  This is the generic NCR family of SCSI controllers, not to be
  confused with the NCR 53c7 or 8xx controllers.  It is explained in
  section 3.8 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If it doesn't work out
  of the box, you may have to change some settings in
  <file:drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.h>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called g_NCR5380.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Enable NCR53c400 extensions
CONFIG_SCSI_GENERIC_NCR53C400
  This enables certain optimizations for the NCR53c400 SCSI cards.
  You might as well try it out.  Note that this driver will only probe
  for the Trantor T130B in its default configuration; you might have
  to pass a command line option to the kernel at boot time if it does
  not detect your card.  See the file
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.g_NCR5380> for details.

# Choice: ncr5380
NCR5380/53c400 mapping method (use Port for T130B)
CONFIG_SCSI_G_NCR5380_PORT
  The NCR5380 and NCR53c400 SCSI controllers come in two varieties:
  port or memory mapped. You should know what you have. The most
  common card, Trantor T130B, uses port mapped mode.

NCR Dual 700 MCA SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR_D700
  This is a driver for the MicroChannel Dual 700 card produced by
  NCR and commonly used in 345x/35xx/4100 class machines.  It always
  tries to negotiate sync and uses tag command queueing.

  Unless you have an NCR manufactured machine, the chances are that
  you do not have this SCSI card, so say N.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called NCR_D700.o.

HP LASI SCSI support for 53c700/710
CONFIG_SCSI_LASI700
  This is a driver for the lasi baseboard in some parisc machines
  which is based on the 53c700 chip.  Will also support LASI subsystems
  based on the 710 chip using 700 emulation mode.

  Unless you know you have a 53c700 or 53c710 based lasi, say N here

NCR53c7,8xx SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx
  This is a driver for the 53c7 and 8xx NCR family of SCSI
  controllers, not to be confused with the NCR 5380 controllers.  It
  is explained in section 3.8 of the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If it doesn't work out
  of the box, you may have to change some settings in
  <file:drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.h>.  Please read
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.ncr53c7xx> for the available boot time
  command line options.

  Note: there is another driver for the 53c8xx family of controllers
  ("NCR53C8XX SCSI support" below).  If you want to use them both, you
  need to say M to both and build them as modules, but only one may be
  active at a time. If you have a 53c8xx board, it's better to use the
  other driver.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called 53c7,8xx.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Always negotiate synchronous transfers
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_sync
  In general, this is good; however, it is a bit dangerous since there
  are some broken SCSI devices out there. Take your chances. Safe bet
  is N.

Allow FAST-SCSI [10MHz]
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_FAST
  This will enable 10MHz FAST-SCSI transfers with your host
  adapter. Some systems have problems with that speed, so it's safest
  to say N here.

Allow DISCONNECT
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_DISCONNECT
  This enables the disconnect/reconnect feature of the NCR SCSI
  controller. When you say Y here, a slow SCSI device will not lock
  the SCSI bus while processing a request, allowing simultaneous use
  of e.g. a SCSI hard disk and SCSI tape or CD-ROM drive, and
  providing much better performance when using slow and fast SCSI
  devices at the same time. Some devices, however, do not operate
  properly with this option enabled, and will cause your SCSI system
  to hang, which might cause a system crash. The safe answer
  therefore is to say N.

SYM53C8XX Version 2 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2
  This driver supports the whole NCR53C8XX/SYM53C8XX family of 
  PCI-SCSI controllers. It also supports the subset of LSI53C10XX 
  Ultra-160 controllers that are based on the SYM53C8XX SCRIPTS 
  language. It does not support LSI53C10XX Ultra-320 PCI-X SCSI 
  controllers.

  If your system has problems using this new major version of the
  SYM53C8XX driver, you may switch back to driver version 1.

  Please read <file:drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/Documentation.txt> for more
  information.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called sym53c8xx_2.o.

PCI DMA addressing mode
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_DMA_ADDRESSING_MODE
  This option only applies to PCI-SCSI chip that are PCI DAC capable 
  (875A, 895A, 896, 1010-33, 1010-66, 1000).

  When set to 0, only PCI 32 bit DMA addressing (SAC) will be performed.
  When set to 1, 40 bit DMA addressing (with upper 24 bits of address 
  set to zero) is supported. The addressable range is here 1 TB.
  When set to 2, full 64 bits of address for DMA are supported, but only
  16 segments of 4 GB can be addressed. The addressable range is so 
  limited to 64 GB.

  The safest value is 0 (32 bit DMA addressing) that is guessed to still 
  fit most of real machines.

  The preferred value 1 (40 bit DMA addressing) should make happy 
  properly engineered PCI DAC capable host bridges. You may configure
  this option for Intel platforms with more than 4 GB of memory.

  The still experimental value 2 (64 bit DMA addressing with 16 x 4GB 
  segments limitation) can be used on systems that require PCI address 
  bits past bit 39 to be set for the addressing of memory using PCI 
  DAC cycles.

use normal IO
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_IOMAPPED
  If you say Y here, the driver will preferently use normal IO rather than 
  memory mapped IO.

maximum number of queued commands
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
  possible. The driver supports up to 256 queued commands per device.
  This value is used as a compiled-in hard limit.

default tagged command queue depth
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
  This is the default value of the command queue depth the driver will 
  announce to the generic SCSI layer for devices that support tagged 
  command queueing. This value can be changed from the boot command line.
  This is a soft limit that cannot exceed CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_MAX_TAGS.

NCR53C8XX SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX
  This is the BSD ncr driver adapted to Linux for the NCR53C8XX family
  of PCI-SCSI controllers.  This driver supports parity checking,
  tagged command queuing and fast synchronous data transfers up to 80
  MB/s with wide FAST-40 LVD devices and controllers.

  Recent versions of the 53C8XX chips are better supported by the
  option "SYM53C8XX SCSI support", below.

  Note: there is yet another driver for the 53c8xx family of
  controllers ("NCR53c7,8xx SCSI support" above).  If you want to use
  them both, you need to say M to both and build them as modules, but
  only one may be active at a time.  If you have a 53c8xx board, you
  probably do not want to use the "NCR53c7,8xx SCSI support".

  Please read <file:drivers/scsi/README.ncr53c8xx> for more
  information.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ncr53c8xx.o.

SYM53C8XX Version 1 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX
  This driver supports all the features of recent 53C8XX chips (used
  in PCI SCSI controllers), notably the hardware phase mismatch
  feature of the SYM53C896.

  Older versions of the 53C8XX chips are not supported by this
  driver.  If your system uses either a 810 rev. < 16, a 815, or a 825
  rev. < 16 PCI SCSI processor, you must use the generic NCR53C8XX
  driver ("NCR53C8XX SCSI support" above) or configure both the
  NCR53C8XX and this SYM53C8XX drivers either as module or linked to
  the kernel image.

  When both drivers are linked into the kernel, the SYM53C8XX driver
  is called first at initialization and you can use the 'excl=ioaddr'
  driver boot option to exclude attachment of adapters by the
  SYM53C8XX driver.  For example, entering
  'sym53c8xx=excl:0xb400,excl=0xc000' at the lilo prompt prevents
  adapters at io address 0xb400 and 0xc000 from being attached by the
  SYM53C8XX driver, thus allowing the NCR53C8XX driver to attach them.
  The 'excl' option is also supported by the NCR53C8XX driver.

  Please read <file:drivers/scsi/README.ncr53c8xx> for more
  information.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called sym53c8xx.o.

Synchronous transfer frequency in MHz
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
  total rate of 40 MB/s.

  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
  second).

  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

Use normal IO
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_IOMAPPED
  If you say Y here, the driver will use normal IO, as opposed to
  memory mapped IO. Memory mapped IO has less latency than normal IO
  and works for most Intel-based hardware. Under Linux/Alpha only
  normal IO is currently supported by the driver and so, this option
  has no effect on those systems.

  The normal answer therefore is N; try Y only if you encounter SCSI
  related problems.

Not allow targets to disconnect
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_NO_DISCONNECT
  This option is only provided for safety if you suspect some SCSI
  device of yours to not support properly the target-disconnect
  feature. In that case, you would say Y here. In general however, to
  not allow targets to disconnect is not reasonable if there is more
  than 1 device on a SCSI bus. The normal answer therefore is N.

Default tagged command queue depth
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
  'tags' option as follows (example):
  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
  command queue depth.

  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

Maximum number of queued commands
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

Assume boards are SYMBIOS compatible
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYMBIOS_COMPAT
  This option allows you to enable some features depending on GPIO
  wiring. These General Purpose Input/Output pins can be used for
  vendor specific features or implementation of the standard SYMBIOS
  features. Genuine SYMBIOS controllers use GPIO0 in output for
  controller LED and GPIO3 bit as a flag indicating
  singled-ended/differential interface. The Tekram DC-390U/F boards
  uses a different GPIO wiring.

  Your answer to this question is ignored if all your controllers have
  NVRAM, since the driver is able to detect the board type from the
  NVRAM format.

  If all the controllers in your system are genuine SYMBIOS boards or
  use BIOS and drivers from SYMBIOS, you would want to say Y here,
  otherwise N. N is the safe answer.

Enable traffic profiling
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PROFILE
  This option allows you to enable profiling information gathering.
  These statistics are not very accurate due to the low frequency
  of the kernel clock (100 Hz on i386) and have performance impact
  on systems that use very fast devices.

  The normal answer therefore is N.

Include support for the NCR PQS/PDS SCSI card
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PQS_PDS
  Say Y here if you have a special SCSI adapter produced by NCR
  corporation called a PCI Quad SCSI or PCI Dual SCSI. You do not need
  this if you do not have one of these adapters. However, since this
  device is detected as a specific PCI device, this option is quite
  safe.

  The common answer here is N, but answering Y is safe.

Workbit NinjaSCSI-32Bi/UDE support
CONFIG_SCSI_NSP32
  This is support for the Workbit NinjaSCSI-32Bi/UDE PCI/Cardbus
  SCSI host adapter. Please read the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called nsp32.o.

IBMMCA SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_IBMMCA
  This is support for the IBM SCSI adapter found in many of the PS/2
  series computers.  These machines have an MCA bus, so you need to
  answer Y to "MCA support" as well and read
  <file:Documentation/mca.txt>.

  If the adapter isn't found during boot (a common problem for models
  56, 57, 76, and 77) you'll need to use the 'ibmmcascsi=<pun>' kernel
  option, where <pun> is the id of the SCSI subsystem (usually 7, but
  if that doesn't work check your reference diskette).  Owners of
  model 95 with a LED-matrix-display can in addition activate some
  activity info like under OS/2, but more informative, by setting
  'ibmmcascsi=display' as an additional kernel parameter.  Try "man
  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about how to
  pass options to the kernel.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ibmmca.o.

Standard SCSI-order
CONFIG_IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD
  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
  June 1997).

  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
  here. If unsure, say Y.

Reset SCSI-devices at boot time
CONFIG_IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET
  By default, SCSI-devices are reset when the machine is powered on.
  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these
  reset commands, and can cause your system to hang. So say Y only if
  you know that one of your older devices needs it; N is the safe
  answer.

NCR MCA 53C9x SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_MCA_53C9X
  Some MicroChannel machines, notably the NCR 35xx line, use a SCSI
  controller based on the NCR 53C94.  This driver will allow use of
  the controller on the 3550, and very possibly others.

  If you want to compile this as a module (= code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say
  M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will

  FastSCSI! cards as well as any other card based on the FASXX chip
  (including the Control Concepts SCSI/IDE/SIO/PIO/FDC cards).

  This driver does NOT support the PCI versions of these cards. The
  PCI versions are supported by the Qlogic ISP driver ("Qlogic ISP
  SCSI support"), below.

  If you say Y here, make sure to choose "BIOS" at the question "PCI
  access mode".

  Please read the file <file:drivers/scsi/README.qlogicisp>.  You

  The module will be called t128.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

UltraStor SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_ULTRASTOR
  This is support for the UltraStor 14F, 24F and 34F SCSI-2 host
  adapter family.  This driver is explained in section 3.12 of the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If it doesn't work out
  of the box, you may have to change some settings in
  <file:drivers/scsi/ultrastor.h>.

  Note that there is also another driver for the same hardware:
  "UltraStor 14F/34F support", above.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ultrastor.o.

7000FASST SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_7000FASST
  This driver supports the Western Digital 7000 SCSI host adapter
  family.  Some information is in the source:
  <file:drivers/scsi/wd7000.c>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called wd7000.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

ACARD SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_ACARD
  This driver supports the ACARD 870U/W SCSI host adapter.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called atp870u.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

EATA ISA/EISA/PCI (DPT and generic EATA/DMA-compliant boards) support
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA
  This driver supports all EATA/DMA-compliant SCSI host adapters.  DPT
  ISA and all EISA I/O addresses are probed looking for the "EATA"
  signature.  If you chose "BIOS" at the question "PCI access mode",
  the addresses of all the PCI SCSI controllers reported by the PCI
  subsystem are probed as well.

  You want to read the start of <file:drivers/scsi/eata.c> and the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  Note that there is also another driver for the same hardware
  available: "EATA-DMA [Obsolete] (DPT, NEC, AT&T, SNI, AST, Olivetti,
  Alphatronix) support". You should say Y to only one of them.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called eata.o.

enable tagged command queueing
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_TAGGED_QUEUE
  This is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host
  adapter can send several SCSI commands to a device's queue even if
  previous commands haven't finished yet. Most EATA adapters negotiate
  this feature automatically with the device, even if your answer is
  N. The safe answer is N.

enable elevator sorting
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_LINKED_COMMANDS
  This option enables elevator sorting for all probed SCSI disks and
  CD-ROMs. It definitely reduces the average seek distance when doing
  random seeks, but this does not necessarily result in a noticeable
  performance improvement: your mileage may vary...
  The safe answer is N.

maximum number of queued commands
CONFIG_SCSI_EATA_MAX_TAGS
  This specifies how many SCSI commands can be maximally queued for
  each probed SCSI device. You should reduce the default value of 16
  only if you have disks with buggy or limited tagged command support.
  Minimum is 2 and maximum is 62. This value is also the window size
  used by the elevator sorting option above. The effective value used
  by the driver for each probed SCSI device is reported at boot time.

NCR53c406a SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C406A
  This is support for the NCR53c406a SCSI host adapter.  For user
  configurable parameters, check out <file:drivers/scsi/NCR53c406a.c>
  in the kernel source.  Also read the SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called NCR53c406.o.

Symbios 53c416 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C416
  This is support for the sym53c416 SCSI host adapter, the SCSI
  adapter that comes with some HP scanners. This driver requires that
  the sym53c416 is configured first using some sort of PnP
  configuration program (e.g. isapnp) or by a PnP aware BIOS. If you
  are using isapnp then you need to compile this driver as a module
  and then load it using insmod after isapnp has run. The parameters
  of the configured card(s) should be passed to the driver. The format
  is:

    insmod sym53c416 sym53c416=<base>,<irq> [sym53c416_1=<base>,<irq>]

  There is support for up to four adapters. If you want to compile
  this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  sym53c416.o.

Simple 53c710 SCSI support (Compaq, NCR machines)
CONFIG_SCSI_SIM710
  This is a simple driver for NCR53c710 based SCSI host adapters.

  More complex drivers for this chip are available ("NCR53c7,8xx SCSI
  support", above), but they require that the scsi chip be able to do
  DMA block moves between memory and on-chip registers, which can
  cause problems under certain conditions.  This driver is designed to
  avoid these problems and is intended to work with any Intel machines
  using 53c710 chips, including various Compaq and NCR machines.

  Please read the comments at the top of the file
  <file:drivers/scsi/sim710.c> for more information.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called sim710.o.

Tekram DC390(T) and Am53/79C974 SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_DC390T
  This driver supports PCI SCSI host adapters based on the Am53C974A
  chip, e.g. Tekram DC390(T), DawiControl 2974 and some onboard
  PCscsi/PCnet (Am53/79C974) solutions.

  Documentation can be found in <file:drivers/scsi/README.tmscsim>.

  Note that this driver does NOT support Tekram DC390W/U/F, which are
  based on NCR/Symbios chips. Use "NCR53C8XX SCSI support" for those.
  Also note that there is another generic Am53C974 driver,
  "AM53/79C974 PCI SCSI support" below.  You can pick either one.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called tmscsim.o.

Omit support for other Am53/79C974 based SCSI adapters
CONFIG_SCSI_DC390T_NOGENSUPP
  If you say N here, the DC390(T) SCSI driver relies on the DC390
  EEPROM to get initial values for its settings, such as speed,
  termination, etc.  If it can't find this EEPROM, it will use
  defaults or the user supplied boot/module parameters.  For details
  on driver configuration see <file:drivers/scsi/README.tmscsim>.

  If you say Y here and if no EEPROM is found, the driver gives up and
  thus only supports Tekram DC390(T) adapters.  This can be useful if
  you have a DC390(T) and another Am53C974 based adapter, which, for
  some reason, you want to drive with the other AM53C974 driver.

  If unsure, say N.

AM53/79C974 PCI SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_AM53C974
  This is support for the AM53/79C974 SCSI host adapters.  Please read
  <file:drivers/scsi/README.AM53C974> for details.  Also, the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, is for you.

  Note that there is another driver for AM53C974 based adapters:
  "Tekram DC390(T) and Am53/79C974 (PCscsi) SCSI support", above.  You
  can pick either one.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called AM53C974.o.

AMI MegaRAID support (old driver)
CONFIG_SCSI_MEGARAID
  This driver supports the AMI MegaRAID 418, 428, 438, 466, 762, 490,
  467, 471 and 493 SCSI host adapters. 

  This is the old and very heavily tested driver but lacks features
  like clustering.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called megaraid.o.

AMI MegaRAID support (new driver)
CONFIG_SCSI_MEGARAID2
  This driver supports the AMI MegaRAID 418, 428, 438, 466, 762, 490,
  467, 471, 493 and new Ultra320(518, 520, 531, 532) SCSI host adapters.

  This is the newer less tested but more featureful driver.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called megaraid2.o.

Intel/ICP (former GDT SCSI Disk Array) RAID Controller support
CONFIG_SCSI_GDTH
  Formerly called GDT SCSI Disk Array Controller Support.
 
  This is a driver for RAID/SCSI Disk Array Controllers (EISA/ISA/PCI) 
  manufactured by Intel/ICP vortex (an Intel Company). It is documented
  in the kernel source in <file:drivers/scsi/gdth.c> and
  <file:drivers/scsi/gdth.h.>

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called gdth.o.

IOMEGA parallel port (ppa - older drives)
CONFIG_SCSI_PPA
  This driver supports older versions of IOMEGA's parallel port ZIP
  drive (a 100 MB removable media device).

  Note that you can say N here if you have the SCSI version of the ZIP
  drive: it will be supported automatically if you said Y to the
  generic "SCSI disk support", above.

  If you have the ZIP Plus drive or a more recent parallel port ZIP
  drive (if the supplied cable with the drive is labeled "AutoDetect")
  then you should say N here and Y to "IOMEGA parallel port (imm -
  newer drives)", below.

  For more information about this driver and how to use it you should
  read the file <file:drivers/scsi/README.ppa>.  You should also read
  the SCSI-HOWTO, which is available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If you use this driver,
  you will still be able to use the parallel port for other tasks,
  such as a printer; it is safe to compile both drivers into the
  kernel.

  This driver is also available as a module which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want.  To compile
  this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called ppa.o.

IOMEGA parallel port (imm - newer drives)
CONFIG_SCSI_IMM
  This driver supports newer versions of IOMEGA's parallel port ZIP
  drive (a 100 MB removable media device).

  Note that you can say N here if you have the SCSI version of the ZIP
  drive: it will be supported automatically if you said Y to the
  generic "SCSI disk support", above.

  If you have the ZIP Plus drive or a more recent parallel port ZIP
  drive (if the supplied cable with the drive is labeled "AutoDetect")
  then you should say Y here; if you have an older ZIP drive, say N
  here and Y to "IOMEGA Parallel Port (ppa - older drives)", above.

  For more information about this driver and how to use it you should
  read the file <file:drivers/scsi/README.ppa>.  You should also read
  the SCSI-HOWTO, which is available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  If you use this driver,
  you will still be able to use the parallel port for other tasks,
  such as a printer; it is safe to compile both drivers into the
  kernel.

  This driver is also available as a module which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want.  To compile
  this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called imm.o.

Force the Iomega ZIP drivers to use EPP-16
CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16
  EPP (Enhanced Parallel Port) is a standard for parallel ports which
  allows them to act as expansion buses that can handle up to 64
  peripheral devices.

  Some parallel port chipsets are slower than their motherboard, and
  so we have to control the state of the chipset's FIFO queue every
  now and then to avoid data loss. This will be done if you say Y
  here.

  Generally, saying Y is the safe option and slows things down a bit.

Assume slow parallel port control register
CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_SLOW_CTR
  Some parallel ports are known to have excessive delays between
  changing the parallel port control register and good data being
  available on the parallel port data/status register. This option
  forces a small delay (1.0 usec to be exact) after changing the
  control register to let things settle out. Enabling this option may
  result in a big drop in performance but some very old parallel ports
  (found in 386 vintage machines) will not work properly.

  Generally, saying N is fine.

SCSI debugging host simulator
CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG
  This is a host adapter simulator that can be programmed to simulate
  a large number of conditions that could occur on a real bus. The
  advantage is that many hard to reproduce problems can be tested in a
  controlled environment where there is reduced risk of losing
  important data. This is primarily of use to people trying to debug
  the middle and upper layers of the SCSI subsystem. If unsure, say N.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called scsi_debug.o.

Fibre Channel and FC4 SCSI support
CONFIG_FC4
  Fibre Channel is a high speed serial protocol mainly used to
  connect large storage devices to the computer; it is compatible with
  and intended to replace SCSI.

  This is an experimental support for storage arrays connected to your
  computer using optical fibre cables and the "X3.269-199X Fibre
  Channel Protocol for SCSI" specification. If you want to use this,
  you need to say Y here and to "SCSI support" as well as to the
  drivers for the storage array itself and for the interface adapter
  such as SOC or SOC+. This subsystem could even serve for IP
  networking, with some code extensions.

  If unsure, say N.

Sun SOC/Sbus
CONFIG_FC4_SOC
  Serial Optical Channel is an interface card with one or two Fibre
  Optic ports, each of which can be connected to a disk array. Note
  that if you have older firmware in the card, you'll need the
  microcode from the Solaris driver to make it work.

  This support is also available as a module called soc.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sun SOC+ (aka SOCAL)
CONFIG_FC4_SOCAL
  Serial Optical Channel Plus is an interface card with up to two
  Fibre Optic ports. This card supports FC Arbitrated Loop (usually
  A5000 or internal FC disks in E[3-6]000 machines through the
  Interface Board). You'll probably need the microcode from the
  Solaris driver to make it work.

  This support is also available as a module called socal.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

SparcSTORAGE Array 100 and 200 series
CONFIG_SCSI_PLUTO
  If you never bought a disk array made by Sun, go with N.

  This support is also available as a module called pluto.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sun Enterprise Network Array (A5000 and EX500)
CONFIG_SCSI_FCAL
  This driver drives FC-AL disks connected through a Fibre Channel
  card using the drivers/fc4 layer (currently only SOCAL). The most
  common is either A5000 array or internal disks in E[3-6]000
  machines.

  This support is also available as a module called fcal.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. If unsure, say N.

Acorn SCSI card (aka30) support
CONFIG_SCSI_ACORNSCSI_3
  This enables support for the Acorn SCSI card (aka30). If you have an
  Acorn system with one of these, say Y. If unsure, say N.

Support SCSI 2 Tagged queueing
CONFIG_SCSI_ACORNSCSI_TAGGED_QUEUE
  Say Y here to enable tagged queuing support on the Acorn SCSI card.

  This is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host
  adapter can send several SCSI commands to a device's queue even if
  previous commands haven't finished yet. Some SCSI devices don't
  implement this properly, so the safe answer is N.

Support SCSI 2 Synchronous Transfers
CONFIG_SCSI_ACORNSCSI_SYNC
  Say Y here to enable synchronous transfer negotiation with all
  targets on the Acorn SCSI card.

  In general, this improves performance; however some SCSI devices
  don't implement it properly, so the safe answer is N.

ARXE SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_ARXESCSI
  Around 1991, Arxe Systems Limited released a high density floppy
  disc interface for the Acorn Archimedes range, to allow the use of
  HD discs from the then new A5000 on earlier models. This interface
  was either sold on its own or with an integral SCSI controller.
  Technical details on this NCR53c94-based device are available at
  <http://www.cryton.demon.co.uk/acornbits/scsi_arxe.html>
  Say Y here to compile in support for the SCSI controller.

Oak SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_OAK1
  This enables support for the Oak SCSI card. If you have an Acorn
  system with one of these, say Y. If unsure, say N.

Cumana SCSI I support
CONFIG_SCSI_CUMANA_1
  This enables support for the Cumana SCSI I card. If you have an
  Acorn system with one of these, say Y. If unsure, say N.

Cumana SCSI II support
CONFIG_SCSI_CUMANA_2
  This enables support for the Cumana SCSI II card. If you have an
  Acorn system with one of these, say Y. If unsure, say N.

EcoSCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_ECOSCSI
  This enables support for the EcoSCSI card -- a small card that sits
  in the Econet socket. If you have an Acorn system with one of these,
  say Y. If unsure, say N.

EESOX SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_EESOXSCSI
  This enables support for the EESOX SCSI card. If you have an Acorn
  system with one of these, say Y, otherwise say N.

PowerTec SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_POWERTECSCSI
  This enables support for the Powertec SCSI card on Acorn systems. If
  you have one of these, say Y. If unsure, say N.

IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support
CONFIG_IEEE1394
  IEEE 1394 describes a high performance serial bus, which is also
  known as FireWire(tm) or i.Link(tm) and is used for connecting all
  sorts of devices (most notably digital video cameras) to your
  computer.

  If you have FireWire hardware and want to use it, say Y here.  This
  is the core support only, you will also need to select a driver for
  your IEEE 1394 adapter.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ieee1394.o.

Texas Instruments PCILynx support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX
  Say Y here if you have an IEEE-1394 controller with the Texas
  Instruments PCILynx chip.  Note: this driver is written for revision
  2 of this chip and may not work with revision 0.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called pcilynx.o.

Use local RAM on PCILynx board
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX_LOCALRAM
  This option makes the PCILynx driver use local RAM available on some
  PCILynx setups for Packet Control Lists. Local RAM is random access
  memory which resides on the PCILynx board as opposed to on your
  computer's motherboard. Local RAM may speed up command processing
  because no PCI transfers are necessary during use of the Packet
  Control Lists.

  Note that there are no known PCILynx systems providing local RAM
  except for the evaluation boards by Texas Instruments and that the
  PCILynx does not reliably report missing RAM. This means that it is
  dangerous to say Y here if you are not absolutely sure that your
  board provides 64KB of local RAM.

  If unsure, say N.

Support for non-IEEE1394 local ports
CONFIG_IEEE1394_PCILYNX_PORTS
  This option enables driver code to access the RAM, ROM and AUX ports
  of the PCILynx through character devices in /dev.  If you don't know
  what this is about then you won't need it.

  If unsure, say N.

#Adaptec AIC-5800 IEEE 1394 support
#CONFIG_IEEE1394_AIC5800
#  Say Y here if you have a IEEE 1394 controller using the Adaptec
#  AIC-5800 chip.  All Adaptec host adapters (89xx series) use this
#  chip, as well as miro's DV boards.
#
#  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
#  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
#  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
#  will be called aic5800.o.
#
OHCI-1394 (Open Host Controller Interface) support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_OHCI1394
  Enable this driver if you have an IEEE 1394 controller based on the
  OHCI-1394 specification. The current driver is only tested with OHCI
  chipsets made by Texas Instruments and NEC. Most third-party vendors
  use one of these chipsets.  It should work with any OHCI-1394
  compliant card, however.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ohci1394.o.

OHCI-1394 Video support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_VIDEO1394
  This option enables video device usage for OHCI-1394 cards.  Enable
  this option only if you have an IEEE 1394 video device connected to
  an OHCI-1394 card.

SBP-2 support (Harddisks etc.)
CONFIG_IEEE1394_SBP2
  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to your IEEE
  1394 bus.  SBP-2 devices include harddrives and DVD devices.

Raw IEEE 1394 I/O support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_RAWIO
  Say Y here if you want support for the raw device. This is generally
  a good idea, so you should say Y here. The raw device enables
  direct communication of user programs with the IEEE 1394 bus and
  thus with the attached peripherals.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called raw1394.o.

Excessive debugging output
CONFIG_IEEE1394_VERBOSEDEBUG
  If you say Y here, you will get very verbose debugging logs from the
  subsystem which includes a dump of the header of every sent and
  received packet.  This can amount to a high amount of data collected
  in a very short time which is usually also saved to disk by the
  system logging daemons.

  Say Y if you really want or need the debugging output, everyone else
  says N.

CONFIG_IEEE1394_OUI_DB
  If you say Y here, then an OUI list (vendor unique ID's) will be
  compiled into the ieee1394 module. This doesn't really do much
  except being able to display the vendor of a hardware node. The
  downside is that it adds about 300k to the size of the module,
  or kernel (depending on whether you compile ieee1394 as a
  module, or static in the kernel).

  This option is not needed for userspace programs like gscanbus
  to show this information.

Network device support
CONFIG_NETDEVICES
  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
  any other computer at all or if all your connections will be over a
  telephone line with a modem either via UUCP (UUCP is a protocol to
  forward mail and news between unix hosts over telephone lines; read
  the UUCP-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>) or dialing up a shell
  account or a BBS, even using term (term is a program which gives you
  almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up
  shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>).

  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
  you want to use under Linux (make sure you know its name because you
  will be asked for it and read the Ethernet-HOWTO (especially if you
  plan to use more than one network card under Linux)) or if you want
  to use SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to
  send Internet traffic over telephone lines or null modem cables) or
  CSLIP (compressed SLIP) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol, a better
  and newer replacement for SLIP) or PLIP (Parallel Line Internet
  Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by connecting the
  parallel ports of two local machines) or AX.25/KISS (protocol for
  sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links).

  Make sure to read the NET-3-HOWTO. Eventually, you will have to read
  Olaf Kirch's excellent and free book "Network Administrator's
  Guide", to be found in <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>. If
  unsure, say Y.

Dummy net driver support
CONFIG_DUMMY
  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
  Administrator's Guide, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called dummy.o.  If you want to use more than one dummy
  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
  Instead of 'dummy', the devices will then be called 'dummy0',
  'dummy1' etc.

Bonding driver support
CONFIG_BONDING
  Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
  'Trunking' by Sun, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

  If you have two Ethernet connections to some other computer, you can
  make them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
  Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well, either
  with a similar Bonding Linux driver, a Cisco 5500 switch or a
  SunTrunking SunSoft driver.

  This is similar to the EQL driver, but it merges Ethernet segments
  instead of serial lines.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called bonding.o.

SLIP (serial line) support
CONFIG_SLIP
  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
  purpose.

  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
  around (available from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>. The module will be
  called slip.o.

CSLIP compressed headers
CONFIG_SLIP_COMPRESSED
  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you
  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure
  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

Keepalive and linefill
CONFIG_SLIP_SMART
  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
  analogue lines.

Six bit SLIP encapsulation
CONFIG_SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.

PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
CONFIG_PPP
  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
  synchronous PPP", below.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
  compile it as a module.  The module will be called ppp_generic.o.
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

PPP multilink support
CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK
  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you
  to combine several (logical or physical) lines into one logical PPP
  connection, so that you can utilize your full bandwidth.

  This has to be supported at the other end as well and you need a
  version of the pppd daemon which understands the multilink protocol.

  If unsure, say N.

PPP filtering
CONFIG_PPP_FILTER
  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over
  PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as
  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up
  a demand-dialled link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.
  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and
  active-filter options to pppd.

  If unsure, say N.

PPP support for async serial ports
CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC
  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over standard
  asynchronous serial ports, such as COM1 or COM2 on a PC.  If you use
  a modem (not a synchronous or ISDN modem) to contact your ISP, you
  need this option.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ppp_async.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

PPP support for sync tty ports
CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY
  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over synchronous
  (HDLC) tty devices, such as the SyncLink adapter. These devices
  are often used for high-speed leased lines like T1/E1.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ppp_synctty.o.

PPP Deflate compression
CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE
  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the
  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress
  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the
  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the
  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if
  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ppp_deflate.o.

PPP BSD-Compress compression
CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP
  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
  it is safe to say Y here.

  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
  and is patent-free.

  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a
  module; it is called bsd_comp.o and will show up in the directory
  modules once you have said "make modules". If unsure, say N.

PPP over Ethernet
CONFIG_PPPOE
  Support for PPP over Ethernet.

  This driver requires the current pppd from the "ppp" CVS repository
  on cvs.samba.org.  The required support will be present in the next
  ppp release (2.4.2).

Wireless LAN (non-hamradio)
CONFIG_NET_RADIO
  Support for wireless LANs and everything having to do with radio,
  but not with amateur radio or FM broadcasting.

  Saying Y here also enables the Wireless Extensions (creates
  /proc/net/wireless and enables ifconfig access). The Wireless
  Extension is a generic API allowing a driver to expose to the user
  space configuration and statistics specific to common Wireless LANs.
  The beauty of it is that a single set of tool can support all the
  variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their type (as long as
  the driver supports Wireless Extension). Another advantage is that
  these parameters may be changed on the fly without restarting the
  driver (or Linux). If you wish to use Wireless Extensions with
  wireless PCMCIA (PC-) cards, you need to say Y here; you can fetch
  the tools from
  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

  Some user-level drivers for scarab devices which don't require
  special kernel support are available from
  <ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/>.

STRIP (Metricom Starmode radio IP)
CONFIG_STRIP
  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
  (on the WWW at <http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/>) to send Internet
  traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are small, battery
  powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about the size and
  weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard them called
  "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because it misleads
  many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom modem into a
  phone line and use it as a modem.)

  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
  bigger.

  You can also compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called strip.o.

AT&T WaveLAN & DEC RoamAbout DS support
CONFIG_WAVELAN
  The Lucent WaveLAN (formerly NCR and AT&T; or DEC RoamAbout DS) is
  a Radio LAN (wireless Ethernet-like Local Area Network) using the
  radio frequencies 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.

  This driver support the ISA version of the WaveLAN card.  A separate
  driver for the PCMCIA (PC-card) hardware is available in David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).

  If you want to use an ISA WaveLAN card under Linux, say Y and read
  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Some more specific
  information is contained in
  <file:Documentation/networking/wavelan.txt> and in the source code
  <file:drivers/net/wavelan.p.h>.

  You will also need the wireless tools package available from
  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.
  Please read the man pages contained therein.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called wavelan.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

Aironet Arlan 655 & IC2200 DS support
CONFIG_ARLAN
  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.

Aironet 4500/4800 series adapters
CONFIG_AIRONET4500
  www.aironet.com (recently bought by Cisco) makes these 802.11 DS
  adapters.  Driver by Elmer Joandi (elmer@ylenurme.ee).

  Say Y here if you have such an adapter, and then say Y below to
  the option that applies to your particular type of card (PCI, ISA,
  or PCMCIA).

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aironet4500_core.o. If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

  quick config parameters:
	SSID=tsunami - "The Password"
	adhoc=1  	there are no Access Points around
	master=1 	Adhoc master (the one who creates network
                        sync)
	slave=1		Adhoc slave (btw, it is still forming own net
			sometimes, and has problems with firmware...
			change IbssJoinNetTimeout from /proc...)
	channel=1..? 	meaningful in adhoc mode

  If you have problems with screwing up card, both_bap_lock=1 is a
  conservative value (performance hit 15%).

  All other parameters can be set via the proc interface.

Aironet 4500/4800 ISA/PCI/PNP/365 support
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_NONCS

  for ISA cards. Remember however to enable the PnP jumper on the
  board if you say Y here.

Aironet 4500/4800 PCI support
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_PCI
  If you have an PCI Aironet 4500/4800 card, say Y here.

Aironet 4500/4800 ISA broken support
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_ISA
  If you have an ISA Aironet 4500/4800 card which you want to run in
  non-PnP mode, say Y here. This is not recommended and does not work
  correctly at this point. Say N.

Aironet 4500/4800 I365 broken support
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_I365
  If you have a PCMCIA Aironet 4500/4800 card which you want to use
  without the standard PCMCIA cardservices provided by the pcmcia-cs
  package, say Y here. This is not recommended, so say N.

Aironet 4500/4800 PCMCIA support
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_CS
  Say Y here if you have a PCMCIA Aironet 4500/4800 card which you
  want to use with the standard PCMCIA cardservices provided by the
  pcmcia-cs package.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aironet4500_cs.o. If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Aironet 4500/4800 PROC interface
CONFIG_AIRONET4500_PROC
  If you say Y here (and to the "/proc file system" below), you will
  be able to configure your Aironet card via the
  /proc/sys/aironet4500 interface.

  Additional info: look in <file:drivers/net/aironet4500_rid.c>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aironet4500_proc.o. If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  NOTE: the proc interface uses a lot of memory, so it is recommended
        to compile it as a module and remove the module after
        configuration.

LAPB over Ethernet driver
CONFIG_LAPBETHER
  This is a driver for a pseudo device (typically called /dev/lapb0)
  which allows you to open an LAPB point-to-point connection to some
  other computer on your Ethernet network.  In order to do this, you
  need to say Y or M to the driver for your Ethernet card as well as
  to "LAPB Data Link Driver".

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called lapbether.o.  If unsure, say N.

X.25 async driver
CONFIG_X25_ASY
  This is a driver for sending and receiving X.25 frames over regular
  asynchronous serial lines such as telephone lines equipped with
  ordinary modems.  Experts should note that this driver doesn't
  currently comply with the asynchronous HDLS framing protocols in
  CCITT recommendation X.25.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called x25_asy.o.  If unsure, say N.

PCMCIA network device support
CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA
  Say Y if you would like to include support for any PCMCIA or CardBus
  network adapters, then say Y to the driver for your particular card
  below.  PCMCIA- or PC-cards are credit-card size devices often used
  with laptops computers; CardBus is the newer and faster version of
  PCMCIA.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).  You also want to check out the PCMCIA-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If unsure, say N.

3Com 3c589 PCMCIA support

  for your particular card below.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location). You also want to check out the PCMCIA-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Hermes chipset 802.11b support (Orinoco/Prism2/Symbol cards)
CONFIG_HERMES
  A driver for 802.11b wireless cards based based on the "Hermes" or
  Intersil HFA384x (Prism 2) MAC controller.  This includes the vast
  majority of the PCMCIA 802.11b cards (which are nearly all rebadges)
  - except for the Cisco/Aironet cards.  Cards supported include the
  Apple Airport (not a PCMCIA card), WavelanIEEE/Orinoco,
  Cabletron/EnteraSys Roamabout, ELSA AirLancer, MELCO Buffalo, Avaya,
  IBM High Rate Wireless, Farralon Syyline, Samsung MagicLAN, Netgear
  MA401, LinkSys WPC-11, D-Link DWL-650, 3Com AirConnect, Intel
  PRO/Wireless, and Symbol Spectrum24 High Rate amongst others.

  This option includes the guts of the driver, but in order to
  actually use a card you will also need to enable support for PCMCIA
  Hermes cards, PLX9052 based PCI adaptors or the Apple Airport below.

  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works :
  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called hermes.o.

Hermes 802.11b in PLX9052 based PCI adaptor support
CONFIG_PLX_HERMES
  Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the "Hermes" (aka
  orinoco_cs) driver when used in PLX9052 based PCI adaptors.  These
  adaptors are not a full PCMCIA controller but act as a more limited
  PCI <-> PCMCIA bridge.  Several vendors sell such adaptors so that
  802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.  The Netgear
  MA301 is such an adaptor.

  Support for these adaptors is so far still incomplete and buggy.

Hermes 802.11b in TMD7160/NCP130 based PCI adaptor support
CONFIG_TMD_HERMES
  Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the "Hermes" (aka
  orinoco) driver when used in TMD7160 based PCI adaptors.  These
  adaptors are not a full PCMCIA controller but act as a more limited
  PCI <-> PCMCIA bridge.  Several vendors sell such adaptors so that
  802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.

  Support for these adaptors is so far still incomplete and buggy.
  You have been warned.

Prism 2.5 PCI 802.11b adaptor support
CONFIG_PCI_HERMES
  Enable support for PCI and mini-PCI 802.11b wireless NICs based on
  the Prism 2.5 chipset.  These are true PCI cards, not the 802.11b
  PCMCIA cards bundled with PCI<->PCMCIA adaptors which are also
  common.  Some of the built-in wireless adaptors in laptops are of
  this variety.

Hermes support (Orinoco/WavelanIEEE/PrismII/Symbol 802.11b cards)
CONFIG_PCMCIA_HERMES
  A driver for "Hermes" chipset based PCMCIA wireless adaptors, such
  as the Lucent WavelanIEEE/Orinoco cards and their OEM (Cabletron/
  EnteraSys RoamAbout 802.11, ELSA Airlancer, Melco Buffalo and
  others).  It should also be usable on various Prism II based cards
  such as the Linksys, D-Link and Farallon Skyline.  It should also
  work on Symbol cards such as the 3Com AirConnect and Ericsson WLAN.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).  You also want to check out the PCMCIA-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works:
  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called orinoco_cs.o.

  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet ISA and
  PCI 802.11 wireless cards.
  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
  acquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B).

  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
  Cisco Linux utilities can be used to configure the card.

  The driver can be compiled as a module and will be named "airo.o".

Cisco/Aironet 34X/35X/4500/4800 PCMCIA cards
CONFIG_AIRO_CS
  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet PCMCIA
  802.11 wireless cards.  This driver is the same as the Aironet
  driver part of the Linux Pcmcia package.
  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
  acquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B). It also
  supports OEM of Cisco such as the DELL TrueMobile 4800 and Xircom
  802.11b cards.

  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
  Cisco Linux utilities can be used to configure the card.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).  You also want to check out the PCMCIA-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be

  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called airo_cs.o.

Atmel at76c502/at76c504 PCMCIA cards
CONFIG_PCMCIA_ATMEL
  A driver for PCMCIA 802.11 wireless cards based on the 
  Atmel fast-vnet chips. This driver supports standard
  Linux wireless extensions. 

  Many  cards based on this chipset do not have flash memory
  and need their firmware loaded at start-up. If yours is 
  one of these, you will need to provide a firmware image
  to be loaded into the card by the driver. The Atmel
  firmware package can be downloaded from
  http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel/atmel_firmware.tar.gz

Aviator/Raytheon 2.4MHz wireless support

  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.
  Please read the file <file:Documentation/networking/ray_cs.txt> for
  details.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).

  The module will be called wavelan_cs.o.  If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  If unsure, say N.

PLIP (parallel port) support
CONFIG_PLIP
  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a
  reasonably fast mini network consisting of two (or, rarely, more)
  local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to
  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
  enabled for this to work.

  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP
  protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together
  with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges
  your kernel by about 8 KB.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called plip.o.  If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy a laptop
  later.

EQL (serial line load balancing) support
CONFIG_EQUALIZER
  If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
  usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
  SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
  lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
  one double speed connection using this driver.  Naturally, this has
  to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
  Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.

  Say Y if you want this and read
  <file:Documentation/networking/eql.txt>.  You may also want to read
  section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called eql.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If
  unsure, say N.

Universal TUN/TAP device driver support
CONFIG_TUN
  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space
  programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet
  device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media,
  receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets
  via physical media writes them to the user space program.

  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers
  corresponding net device tunX or tapX.  After a program closed above
  devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and
  all routes corresponding to it.

  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more
  information.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called tun.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

Ethertap network tap (OBSOLETE)
CONFIG_ETHERTAP
  If you say Y here (and have said Y to "Kernel/User network link
  driver", above) and create a character special file /dev/tap0 with
  major number 36 and minor number 16 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will be able to have a user space program read and write raw
  Ethernet frames from/to that special file.  tap0 can be configured
  with ifconfig and route like any other Ethernet device but it is not
  connected to any physical LAN; everything written by the user to
  /dev/tap0 is treated by the kernel as if it had come in from a LAN
  to the device tap0; everything the kernel wants to send out over the
  device tap0 can instead be read by the user from /dev/tap0: the user
  mode program replaces the LAN that would be attached to an ordinary
  Ethernet device. Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt> for more information.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called ethertap.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

Sealevel Systems 4021 support
CONFIG_SEALEVEL_4021
  This is a driver for the Sealevel Systems ACB 56 serial I/O adapter.

  This driver can only be compiled as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to do that, say M here. The module will be called
  sealevel.o.

TMPTX3912/PR31700 serial port support
CONFIG_SERIAL_TX3912
  The TX3912 is a Toshiba RISC processor based o the MIPS 3900 core;
  see <http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/Generic/risc/tx3912.htm>.
  Say Y here to enable kernel support for the on-board serial port.

Console on TMPTX3912/PR31700 serial port
CONFIG_SERIAL_TX3912_CONSOLE

  see <http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/Generic/risc/tx3912.htm>.
  Say Y here to direct console I/O to the on-board serial port.

Enable Au1000 serial console
CONFIG_AU1000_SERIAL_CONSOLE
  If you have an Alchemy AU1000 processor (MIPS based) and you want
  to use a console on a serial port, say Y.  Otherwise, say N.

Enable Au1000 UART Support
CONFIG_AU1000_UART
  If you have an Alchemy AU1000 processor (MIPS based) and you want
  to use serial ports, say Y.  Otherwise, say N.

SyncLink HDLC/SYNCPPP support
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_SYNCPPP
  Enables HDLC/SYNCPPP support for the SyncLink WAN driver.
  Normally the SyncLink WAN driver works with the main PPP
  driver (ppp.c) and pppd program. HDLC/SYNCPPP support allows use
  of the Cisco HDLC/PPP driver (syncppp.c).
  The SyncLink WAN driver (in character devices) must also be enabled.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called syncppp.o.

FarSync T-Series X.21 (and V.35/V.24) cards
CONFIG_FARSYNC
  This driver supports the FarSync T-Series X.21 (and V.35/V.24) cards
  from FarSite Communications Ltd.
  Synchronous communication is supported on all ports at speeds up to
  8Mb/s (128K on V.24) using synchronous PPP, Cisco HDLC, raw HDLC,
  Frame Relay or X.25/LAPB.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called farsync.o and if you want the module to be
  automatically loaded when the interface is referenced then you
  should add "alias hdlcX farsync" to /etc/modules.conf for each
  interface, where X is 0, 1, 2, ...

Frame Relay (DLCI) support
CONFIG_DLCI
  This is support for the frame relay protocol; frame relay is a fast
  low-cost way to connect to a remote Internet access provider or to
  form a private wide area network. The one physical line from your
  box to the local "switch" (i.e. the entry point to the frame relay
  network, usually at the phone company) can carry several logical
  point-to-point connections to other computers connected to the frame
  relay network. For a general explanation of the protocol, check out
  <http://www.frforum.com/> on the WWW. To use frame relay, you need
  supporting hardware (called FRAD) and certain programs from the
  net-tools package as explained in
  <file:Documentation/networking/framerelay.txt>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called dlci.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Max open DLCI
CONFIG_DLCI_COUNT
  This is the maximal number of logical point-to-point frame relay
  connections (the identifiers of which are called DCLIs) that
  the driver can handle. The default is probably fine.

Max DLCI per device
CONFIG_DLCI_MAX
  You can specify here how many logical point-to-point frame relay
  connections (the identifiers of which are called DCLIs) should be
  handled by each of your hardware frame relay access devices. Go with
  the default.

SDLA (Sangoma S502/S508) support
CONFIG_SDLA
  Say Y here if you need a driver for the Sangoma S502A, S502E, and
  S508 Frame Relay Access Devices. These are multi-protocol cards, but
  only frame relay is supported by the driver at this time. Please
  read <file:Documentation/framerelay.txt>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sdla.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Acorn Econet/AUN protocols
CONFIG_ECONET
  Econet is a fairly old and slow networking protocol mainly used by
  Acorn computers to access file and print servers. It uses native
  Econet network cards. AUN is an implementation of the higher level
  parts of Econet that runs over ordinary Ethernet connections, on
  top of the UDP packet protocol, which in turn runs on top of the
  Internet protocol IP.

  If you say Y here, you can choose with the next two options whether
  to send Econet/AUN traffic over a UDP Ethernet connection or over
  a native Econet network card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called econet.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

AUN over UDP
CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP
  Say Y here if you want to send Econet/AUN traffic over a UDP
  connection (UDP is a packet based protocol that runs on top of the
  Internet protocol IP) using an ordinary Ethernet network card.

Native Econet
CONFIG_ECONET_NATIVE
  Say Y here if you have a native Econet network card installed in
  your computer.

WAN router
CONFIG_WAN_ROUTER
  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, frame relay and leased
  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.
  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
  needed to connect to a WAN.

  As an alternative, WAN routing can be built into the Linux kernel.
  With relatively inexpensive WAN interface cards available on the
  market, a perfectly usable router can be built for less than half
  the price of an external router.  If you have one of those cards and
  wish to use your Linux box as a WAN router, say Y here and also to
  the WAN driver for your card, below.  You will then need the
  wan-tools package which is available from <ftp://ftp.sangoma.com/>.
  Read <file:Documentation/networking/wan-router.txt> for more
  information.

  The WAN routing support is also available as a module called
  wanrouter.o ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

Fast switching (read help!)
CONFIG_NET_FASTROUTE
  Saying Y here enables direct NIC-to-NIC (NIC = Network Interface
  Card) data transfers on the local network, which is fast.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: This option is NOT COMPATIBLE with "Network packet
  filtering" (CONFIG_NETFILTER). Say N here if you say Y there.

  However, it will work with all options in the "Advanced router"
  section (except for "Use TOS value as routing key" and
  "Use FWMARK value as routing key").

  At the moment, few devices support fast switching (tulip is one of
  them, a modified 8390 driver can be found at
  <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/fastroute/fastroute-8390.tar.gz>).

  If unsure, say N.

Forwarding between high speed interfaces
CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL
  This option enables NIC (Network Interface Card) hardware throttling
  during periods of extremal congestion. At the moment only a couple
  of device drivers support it (really only one -- tulip, a modified
  8390 driver can be found at
  <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/fastroute/fastroute-8390.tar.gz>).

  Really, this option is applicable to any machine attached to a fast
  enough network, and even a 10 Mb NIC is able to kill a not very slow
  box, such as a 120MHz Pentium.

  However, do not say Y here if you did not experience any serious
  problems.

QoS and/or fair queueing
CONFIG_NET_SCHED
  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the packet
  scheduler, and several different algorithms for how to do this
  "fairly" have been proposed.

  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
  This code is considered to be experimental.

  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/>.
  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
  <http://snafu.freedom.org/linux2.2/iproute-notes.html>.

  This Quality of Service (QoS) support will enable you to use
  Differentiated Services (diffserv) and Resource Reservation Protocol
  (RSVP) on your Linux router if you also say Y to "QoS support",
  "Packet classifier API" and to some classifiers below. Documentation
  and software is at <http://icawww1.epfl.ch/linux-diffserv/>.

  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system" below, you will be able
  to read status information about packet schedulers from the file
  /proc/net/psched.

  The available schedulers are listed in the following questions; you
  can say Y to as many as you like. If unsure, say N now.

CBQ packet scheduler
CONFIG_NET_SCH_CBQ
  Say Y here if you want to use the Class-Based Queueing (CBQ) packet
  scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices.  This
  algorithm classifies the waiting packets into a tree-like hierarchy
  of classes; the leaves of this tree are in turn scheduled by
  separate algorithms (called "disciplines" in this context).

  See the top of <file:net/sched/sch_cbq.c> for references about the
  CBQ algorithm.

  CBQ is a commonly used scheduler, so if you're unsure, you should
  say Y here. Then say Y to all the queueing algorithms below that you
  want to use as CBQ disciplines.  Then say Y to "Packet classifier
  API" and say Y to all the classifiers you want to use; a classifier
  is a routine that allows you to sort your outgoing traffic into
  classes based on a certain criterion.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_cbq.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CONFIG_NET_SCH_HTB
  Say Y here if you want to use the Hierarchical Token Buckets (HTB)
  packet scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices. See
  URL <http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/> for complete manual and
  in-depth articles.

  HTB is very similar to the CBQ regarding its goals however is has 
  different properties and different algorithm.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_htb.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CONFIG_NET_SCH_HFSC
  Say Y here if you want to use the Hierarchical Fair Service Curve
  (HFSC) packet scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_hfsc.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CSZ packet scheduler
CONFIG_NET_SCH_CSZ
  Say Y here if you want to use the Clark-Shenker-Zhang (CSZ) packet
  scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices.  At the
  moment, this is the only algorithm that can guarantee service for
  real-time applications (see the top of <file:net/sched/sch_csz.c>
  for details and references about the algorithm).

  Note: this scheduler is currently broken.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_csz.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

ATM pseudo-scheduler
CONFIG_NET_SCH_ATM
  Say Y here if you want to use the ATM pseudo-scheduler.  This
  provides a framework for invoking classifiers (aka "filters"), which
  in turn select classes of this queuing discipline.  Each class maps
  the flow(s) it is handling to a given virtual circuit (see the top of
  <file:net/sched/sch_atm.c>).

  This code is also available as a module called sch_atm.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

The simplest PRIO pseudo-scheduler
CONFIG_NET_SCH_PRIO
  Say Y here if you want to use an n-band priority queue packet
  "scheduler" for some of your network devices or as a leaf discipline
  for the CBQ scheduling algorithm. If unsure, say Y.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_prio.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Diffserv field marker
CONFIG_NET_SCH_DSMARK
  Say Y if you want to schedule packets according to the
  Differentiated Services architecture proposed in RFC 2475.
  Technical information on this method, with pointers to associated
  RFCs, is available at <http://www.gta.ufrj.br/diffserv/>.

  This code is also available as a module called sch_dsmark.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

GRED queue
CONFIG_NET_SCH_GRED
  Say Y here if you want to use the Generic Random Early Detection
  (RED) packet scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices
  (see the top of <file:net/sched/sch_red.c> for details and
  references about the algorithm).

  This code is also available as a module called sch_gred.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

RED queue
CONFIG_NET_SCH_RED
  Say Y here if you want to use the Random Early Detection (RED)
  packet scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices (see
  the top of <file:net/sched/sch_red.c> for details and references
  about the algorithm).

  This code is also available as a module called sch_red.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

SFQ queue
CONFIG_NET_SCH_SFQ
  Say Y here if you want to use the Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ)
  packet scheduling algorithm for some of your network devices or as a
  leaf discipline for the CBQ scheduling algorithm (see the top of
  <file:net/sched/sch_sfq.c> for details and references about the SFQ
  algorithm).

  This code is also available as a module called sch_sfq.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

TEQL queue

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about QoS support.

Rate estimator
CONFIG_NET_ESTIMATOR
  In order for Quality of Service scheduling to work, the current
  rate-of-flow for a network device has to be estimated; if you say Y
  here, the kernel will do just that.

Packet classifier API
CONFIG_NET_CLS
  The CBQ scheduling algorithm requires that network packets which are
  scheduled to be sent out over a network device be classified
  according to some criterion. If you say Y here, you will get a
  choice of several different packet classifiers with the following
  questions.

  This will enable you to use Differentiated Services (diffserv) and

  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, frame relay and leased
  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.
  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
  needed to connect to a WAN.

  As an alternative, a relatively inexpensive WAN interface card can
  allow your Linux box to directly connect to a WAN. If you have one
  of those cards and wish to use it under Linux, say Y here and also
  to the WAN driver for your card, below.

  watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after its second
  expiration. The expiration time can be configured by command
  argument "i810_margin=<n>" where <n> is the counter initial value.
  It is decremented every 0.6 secs, the default is 50 which gives a
  timeout of 30 seconds and one minute until reset.

  On some motherboards the driver may fail to reset the chipset's
  NO_REBOOT flag which prevents the watchdog from rebooting the
  machine. If this is the case you will get a kernel message like

Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)
CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
  type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.

  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
  hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
  100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).

  If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
  an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your computer,
  say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You will then also have
  to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.

  in case your mainboard has memory consistency issues.  If unsure,
  say N.

Support for uncommon RTL-8139 rev. K (automatic channel equalization)
CONFIG_8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER
  This implements a function which might come in handy in case you
  are using low quality on long cabling. It is required for RealTek
  RTL-8139 revision K boards, and totally unused otherwise.  It tries
  to match the transceiver to the cable characteristics. This is
  experimental since hardly documented by the manufacturer.
  If unsure, say Y.

Support for older RTL-8129/8130 boards
CONFIG_8139TOO_8129
  This enables support for the older and uncommon RTL-8129 and
  RTL-8130 chips, which support MII via an external transceiver,
  instead of an internal one.  Disabling this option will save some
  memory by making the code size smaller.  If unsure, say Y.

Use older RX-reset method
CONFIG_8139_OLD_RX_RESET
  The 8139too driver was recently updated to contain a more rapid
  reset sequence, in the face of severe receive errors.  This "new"
  RX-reset method should be adequate for all boards.  But if you
  experience problems, you can enable this option to restore the
  old RX-reset behavior.  If unsure, say N.

SiS 900/7016 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support
CONFIG_SIS900

General Instruments Surfboard 1000
CONFIG_NET_SB1000
  This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
  NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
  cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
  TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
  downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
  provided by your regular phone modem.

  At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
  you have this card. The module will be called sb1000.o. Then read
  <file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
  to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
  a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
  found at:

  <http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/>
  <http://home.adelphia.net/~siglercm/sb1000.html>

  GA620, SGI Gigabit or Farallon PN9000-SX PCI Gigabit Ethernet
  adapter. The driver allows for using the Jumbo Frame option (9000
  bytes/frame) however it requires that your switches can handle this
  as well. To enable Jumbo Frames, add `mtu 9000' to your ifconfig
  line.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called acenic.o.

Omit support for old Tigon I based AceNICs
CONFIG_ACENIC_OMIT_TIGON_I
  Say Y here if you only have Tigon II based AceNICs and want to leave
  out support for the older Tigon I based cards which are no longer
  being sold (ie. the original Alteon AceNIC and 3Com 3C985 (non B
  version)).  This will reduce the size of the driver object by
  app. 100KB.  If you are not sure whether your card is a Tigon I or a
  Tigon II, say N here.

  The safe and default value for this is N.

  of your computer) is ISA (as opposed to EISA, VLB or PCI), say Y.
  Make sure you know the name of your card. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If unsure, say Y.

  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the remaining ISA network card questions. If you say Y, you will be
  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

Generic ARCnet support
CONFIG_ARCNET
  If you have a network card of this type, say Y and check out the
  (arguably) beautiful poetry in
  <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.txt>.

  You need both this driver, and the driver for the particular ARCnet
  chipset of your card. If you don't know, then it's probably a
  COM90xx type card, so say Y (or M) to "ARCnet COM90xx chipset
  support" below.

  You might also want to have a look at the Ethernet-HOWTO, available
  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>(even though ARCnet
  is not really Ethernet).

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called arcnet.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

Enable old ARCNet packet format (RFC 1051)
CONFIG_ARCNET_1051
  This allows you to use RFC1051 with your ARCnet card via the virtual
  arc0s device. You only need arc0s if you want to talk to ARCnet
  software complying with the "old" standard, specifically, the DOS
  arcnet.com packet driver, Amigas running AmiTCP, and some variants
  of NetBSD. You do not need to say Y here to communicate with
  industry-standard RFC1201 implementations, like the arcether.com
  packet driver or most DOS/Windows ODI drivers. RFC1201 is included
  automatically as the arc0 device. Please read the ARCnet
  documentation in <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.txt> for more
  information about using arc0e and arc0s.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called rfc1051.o.

Enable standard ARCNet packet format (RFC 1201)
CONFIG_ARCNET_1201
  This allows you to use RFC1201 with your ARCnet card via the virtual
  arc0 device.  You need to say Y here to communicate with
  industry-standard RFC1201 implementations, like the arcether.com
  packet driver or most DOS/Windows ODI drivers.  Please read the
  ARCnet documentation in <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.txt>
  for more information about using arc0.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called rfc1201.o.

Enable raw mode packet interface
CONFIG_ARCNET_RAW
  ARCnet "raw mode" packet encapsulation, no soft headers.  Unlikely
  to work unless talking to a copy of the same Linux arcnet driver,
  but perhaps marginally faster in that case.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called arc-rawmode.o.

ARCnet COM90xx (normal) chipset driver
CONFIG_ARCNET_COM90xx
  This is the chipset driver for the standard COM90xx cards. If you
  have always used the old ARCnet driver without knowing what type of
  card you had, this is probably the one for you.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called com90xx.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

ARCnet COM90xx (IO mapped) chipset driver
CONFIG_ARCNET_COM90xxIO
  This is the chipset driver for the COM90xx cards, using them in
  IO-mapped mode instead of memory-mapped mode. This is slower than
  the normal driver. Only use it if your card doesn't support shared
  memory.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called com90io.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

ARCnet COM90xx (RIM I) chipset driver
CONFIG_ARCNET_RIM_I
  This is yet another chipset driver for the COM90xx cards, but this
  time only using memory-mapped mode, and no IO ports at all. This
  driver is completely untested, so if you have one of these cards,
  please mail dwmw2@infradead.org, especially if it works!

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module will be called arc-rimi.o.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>
  as  well as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

ARCnet COM20020 chipset driver
CONFIG_ARCNET_COM20020
  This is the driver for the new COM20020 chipset. It supports such
  things as promiscuous mode, so packet sniffing is possible, and
  extra diagnostic information.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called com20020.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as
  well as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

Cabletron E21xx support
CONFIG_E2100
  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called e2100.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

Broadcom 4400 ethernet support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_B44
  If you have a network (Ethernet) controller of this type, say Y and
  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called b44.

nForce Ethernet support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_FORCEDETH
  If you have a network (Ethernet) controller of this type, say Y and
  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called forcedeth.o.

CS89x0 support (Daynaport CS and LC cards)
CONFIG_CS89x0
  Support for CS89x0 chipset based Ethernet cards. If you have a
  network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read the
  Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/cs89x0.txt>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be

  If you want to plug a network (or some other) card into the PCMCIA
  (or PC-card) slot of your laptop instead (PCMCIA is the standard for
  credit card size extension cards used by all modern laptops), you
  need the pcmcia-cs package (location contained in the file
  <file:Documentation/Changes>) and you can say N here.

  Laptop users should read the Linux Laptop home page at
  <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/>.

  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about this class of network devices. If you say Y, you
  will be asked for your specific device in the following questions.

AT-LAN-TEC/RealTek pocket adapter support
CONFIG_ATP
  This is a network (Ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read <file:drivers/net/atp.c> as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, if you
  want to use this.  If you intend to use this driver, you should have
  said N to the "Parallel printer support", because the two drivers
  don't like each other.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module however ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called atp.o.

Traffic Shaper
CONFIG_SHAPER
  The traffic shaper is a virtual network device that allows you to
  limit the rate of outgoing data flow over some other network device.
  The traffic that you want to slow down can then be routed through
  these virtual devices. See
  <file:Documentation/networking/shaper.txt> for more information.

  An alternative to this traffic shaper is the experimental
  Class-Based Queueing (CBQ) scheduling support which you get if you
  say Y to "QoS and/or fair queueing" above.

  To set up and configure shaper devices, you need the shapecfg
  program, available from <ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/> in the
  shaper package.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called shaper.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If
  unsure, say N.

FDDI driver support
CONFIG_FDDI
  Fiber Distributed Data Interface is a high speed local area network
  design; essentially a replacement for high speed Ethernet. FDDI can
  run over copper or fiber. If you are connected to such a network and
  want a driver for the FDDI card in your computer, say Y here (and
  then also Y to the driver for your FDDI card, below). Most people
  will say N.

Digital DEFEA and DEFPA adapter support
CONFIG_DEFXX
  This is support for the DIGITAL series of EISA (DEFEA) and PCI
  (DEFPA) controllers which can connect you to a local FDDI network.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called defxx.o.

  Read <file:Documentation/networking/skfp.txt> for information about
  the driver.

  Questions concerning this driver can be addressed to:
    linux@syskonnect.de

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This is
  recommended.  The module will be called skfp.o.

HIgh Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) support
CONFIG_HIPPI
  HIgh Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) is a 800Mbit/sec and
  1600Mbit/sec dual-simplex switched or point-to-point network. HIPPI
  can run over copper (25m) or fiber (300m on multi-mode or 10km on
  single-mode). HIPPI networks are commonly used for clusters and to
  connect to super computers. If you are connected to a HIPPI network
  and have a HIPPI network card in your computer that you want to use
  under Linux, say Y here (you must also remember to enable the driver
  for your HIPPI card below). Most people will say N here.

Essential RoadRunner HIPPI PCI adapter support
CONFIG_ROADRUNNER
  Say Y here if this is your PCI HIPPI network card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called rrunner.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If
  unsure, say N.

Use large TX/RX rings
CONFIG_ROADRUNNER_LARGE_RINGS
  If you say Y here, the RoadRunner driver will preallocate up to 2 MB
  of additional memory to allow for fastest operation, both for
  transmitting and receiving. This memory cannot be used by any other
  kernel code or by user space programs. Say Y here only if you have
  the memory.

Acorn Ether1 support
CONFIG_ARM_ETHER1
  If you have an Acorn system with one of these (AKA25) network cards,
  you should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

Acorn/ANT Ether3 support
CONFIG_ARM_ETHER3
  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

I-Cubed EtherH support
CONFIG_ARM_ETHERH
  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

EBSA-110 Ethernet interface (AM79C961A)
CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A
  If you wish to compile a kernel for the EBSA-110, then you should
  always answer Y to this.

Support Thumb instructions
CONFIG_ARM_THUMB
  Say Y if you want to have kernel support for ARM Thumb instructions,
  fault handlers, and system calls.

  The Thumb instruction set is a compressed form of the standard ARM
  instruction set resulting in smaller binaries at the expense of
  slightly less efficient code.

  If you don't know what this all is, saying Y is a safe choice.

Support CD-ROM drives that are not SCSI or IDE/ATAPI
CONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI
  If you have a CD-ROM drive that is neither SCSI nor IDE/ATAPI, say Y
  here, otherwise N. Read the CD-ROM-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about these CD-ROM drives. If you are unsure what you
  have, say Y and find out whether you have one of the following
  drives.

  For each of these drivers, a file Documentation/cdrom/{driver_name}
  exists. Especially in cases where you do not know exactly which kind
  of drive you have you should read there. Most of these drivers use a
  file drivers/cdrom/{driver_name}.h where you can define your
  interface parameters and switch some internal goodies.

  All these CD-ROM drivers are also usable as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile them as module, say M instead of Y and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you want to use any of these CD-ROM drivers, you also have to
  answer Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support" below (this
  answer will get "defaulted" for you if you enable any of the Linux
  CD-ROM drivers).

Sony CDU31A/CDU33A CD-ROM support
CONFIG_CDU31A
  These CD-ROM drives have a spring-pop-out caddyless drawer, and a
  rectangular green LED centered beneath it.  NOTE: these CD-ROM
  drives will not be auto detected by the kernel at boot time; you
  have to provide the interface address as an option to the kernel at
  boot time as described in <file:Documentation/cdrom/cdu31a> or fill
  in your parameters into <file:drivers/cdrom/cdu31a.c>.  Try "man
  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cdu31a.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Standard Mitsumi [no XA/Multisession] CD-ROM support
CONFIG_MCD
  This is the older of the two drivers for the older Mitsumi models
  LU-005, FX-001 and FX-001D. This is not the right driver for the
  FX-001DE and the triple or quad speed models (all these are
  IDE/ATAPI models). Please also the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/mcd>.

  With the old LU-005 model, the whole drive chassis slides out for cd
  insertion. The FX-xxx models use a motorized tray type mechanism.
  Note that this driver does not support XA or MultiSession CDs
  (PhotoCDs). There is a new driver (next question) which can do
  this. If you want that one, say N here.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mcd.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

IRQ channel for Mitsumi CD-ROM
CONFIG_MCD_IRQ
  This allows you to specify the default value of the IRQ used by the
  driver. This setting can be overridden by passing the "mcd="
  parameter to the kernel at boot time (or at module load time if you
  said M to "Standard Mitsumi CD-ROM support").

I/O base address for Mitsumi CD-ROM
CONFIG_MCD_BASE
  This allows you to specify the default value of the I/O base address
  used by the driver. This setting can be overridden by passing the
  "mcd=" parameter to the kernel at boot time (or at module load time
  if you said M to "Standard Mitsumi CD-ROM support").

Mitsumi [XA/MultiSession] CD-ROM support
CONFIG_MCDX
  Use this driver if you want to be able to read XA or MultiSession
  CDs (PhotoCDs) as well as ordinary CDs with your Mitsumi LU-005,
  FX-001 or FX-001D CD-ROM drive. In addition, this driver uses much
  less kernel memory than the old one, if that is a concern. This
  driver is able to support more than one drive, but each drive needs
  a separate interface card. Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/mcdx>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mcdx.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Matsushita/Panasonic/Creative, Longshine, TEAC CD-ROM support
CONFIG_SBPCD
  This driver supports most of the drives which use the Panasonic or
  Sound Blaster interface.  Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd>.

  The Matsushita CR-521, CR-522, CR-523, CR-562, CR-563 drives
  (sometimes labeled "Creative"), the Creative Labs CD200, the
  Longshine LCS-7260, the "IBM External ISA CD-ROM" (in fact a CR-56x
  model), the TEAC CD-55A fall under this category.  Some other
  "electrically compatible" drives (Vertos, Genoa, some Funai models)
  are currently not supported; for the Sanyo H94A drive currently a
  separate driver (asked later) is responsible.  Most drives have a
  uniquely shaped faceplate, with a caddyless motorized drawer, but
  without external brand markings.  The older CR-52x drives have a
  caddy and manual loading/eject, but still no external markings.  The
  driver is able to do an extended auto-probing for interface
  addresses and drive types; this can help to find facts in cases you
  are not sure, but can consume some time during the boot process if
  none of the supported drives gets found.  Once your drive got found,
  you should enter the reported parameters into
  <file:drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.h> and set "DISTRIBUTION 0" there.

  This driver can support up to four CD-ROM controller cards, and each
  card can support up to four CD-ROM drives; if you say Y here, you
  will be asked how many controller cards you have.  If compiled as a
  module, only one controller card (but with up to four drives) is
  usable.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sbpcd.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Matsushita/Panasonic, ... second CD-ROM controller support
CONFIG_SBPCD2
  Say Y here only if you have two CD-ROM controller cards of this type
  (usually only if you have more than four drives).  You should enter
  the parameters for the second, third and fourth interface card into
  <file:drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.h> before compiling the new kernel.  Read
  the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd>.

Matsushita/Panasonic, ... third CD-ROM controller support
CONFIG_SBPCD3
  Say Y here only if you have three CD-ROM controller cards of this
  type (usually only if you have more than six drives).  You should
  enter the parameters for the second, third and fourth interface card
  into <file:include/linux/sbpcd.h> before compiling the new kernel.
  Read the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd>.

Matsushita/Panasonic, ... fourth CD-ROM controller support
CONFIG_SBPCD4
  Say Y here only if you have four CD-ROM controller cards of this
  type (usually only if you have more than eight drives).  You should
  enter the parameters for the second, third and fourth interface card
  into <file:include/linux/sbpcd.h> before compiling the new kernel.
  Read the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd>.

Aztech/Orchid/Okano/Wearnes/TXC/CyDROM CD-ROM support
CONFIG_AZTCD
  This is your driver if you have an Aztech CDA268-01A, Orchid
  CD-3110, Okano or Wearnes CDD110, Conrad TXC, or CyCD-ROM CR520 or
  CR540 CD-ROM drive.  This driver -- just like all these CD-ROM
  drivers -- is NOT for CD-ROM drives with IDE/ATAPI interfaces, such
  as Aztech CDA269-031SE. Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/aztcd>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called aztcd.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sony CDU535 CD-ROM support
CONFIG_CDU535
  This is the driver for the older Sony CDU-535 and CDU-531 CD-ROM
  drives. Please read the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/sonycd535>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sonycd535.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Goldstar R420 CD-ROM support
CONFIG_GSCD
  If this is your CD-ROM drive, say Y here.  As described in the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/gscd>, you might have to change a setting

  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called gscd.o.  If you want to compile it as a

  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cm206.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Optics Storage DOLPHIN 8000AT CD-ROM support
CONFIG_OPTCD
  This is the driver for the 'DOLPHIN' drive with a 34-pin Sony
  compatible interface. It also works with the Lasermate CR328A. If
  you have one of those, say Y. This driver does not work for the
  Optics Storage 8001 drive; use the IDE-ATAPI CD-ROM driver for that
  one. Please read the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/optcd>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
  CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called optcd.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sanyo CDR-H94A CD-ROM support
CONFIG_SJCD
  If this is your CD-ROM drive, say Y here and read the file
  <file:Documentation/cdrom/sjcd>. You should then also say Y or M to
  "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support" below, because that's the
  file system used on CD-ROMs.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sjcd.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

ISP16/MAD16/Mozart soft configurable cdrom interface support
CONFIG_ISP16_CDI
  These are sound cards with built-in cdrom interfaces using the OPTi
  82C928 or 82C929 chips. Say Y here to have them detected and
  possibly configured at boot time. In addition, You'll have to say Y
  to a driver for the particular cdrom drive you have attached to the
  card. Read <file:Documentation/cdrom/isp16> for details.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called isp16.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

iSeries Virtual I/O CD Support
CONFIG_VIOCD
  If you are running Linux on an IBM iSeries system and you want to
  read a CD drive owned by OS/400, say Y here.

Quota support
CONFIG_QUOTA
  If you say Y here, you will be able to set per user limits for disk
  usage (also called disk quotas). Currently, it works only for the
  ext2 file system. You need additional software in order to use quota
  support (you can download sources from
  <http://www.sf.net/projects/linuxquota/>). For further details, read
  the Quota mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Probably the quota
  support is only useful for multi user systems. If unsure, say N.

VFS v0 quota format support
CONFIG_QFMT_V2
  This quota format allows using quotas with 32-bit UIDs/GIDs. If you
  need this functionality say Y here. Note that you will need latest
  quota utilities for new quota format with this kernel.

Memory Technology Device (MTD) support
CONFIG_MTD
  Memory Technology Devices are flash, RAM and similar chips, often
  used for solid state file systems on embedded devices. This option
  will provide the generic support for MTD drivers to register
  themselves with the kernel and for potential users of MTD devices
  to enumerate the devices which are present and obtain a handle on
  them. It will also allow you to select individual drivers for 
  particular hardware and users of MTD devices. If unsure, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdcore.o

MTD debugging support
CONFIG_MTD_DEBUG
  This turns on low-level debugging for the entire MTD sub-system.
  Normally, you should say 'N'.

MTD partitioning support
CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONS
  If you have a device which needs to divide its flash chip(s) up
  into multiple 'partitions', each of which appears to the user as
  a separate MTD device, you require this option to be enabled. If
  unsure, say 'Y'.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdpart.o

  Note, however, that you don't need this option for the DiskOnChip
  devices. Partitioning on NFTL 'devices' is a different - that's the
  'normal' form of partitioning used on a block device.

RedBoot partition table parsing
CONFIG_MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS
  RedBoot is a ROM monitor and bootloader which deals with multiple
  'images' in flash devices by putting a table in the last erase block
  of the device, similar to a partition table, which gives the
  offsets, lengths and names of all the images stored in the flash.

  If you need code which can detect and parse this table, and register
  MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image in the table, enable
  this option.

  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The
  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for
  example.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  redboot.o

CONFIG_MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS
  Allow generic configuration of the MTD paritition tables via the kernel
  command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where
  different kinds of flash memory are available. 

  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The 
  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for 
  example.

  The format for the command line is as follows:

  mtdparts=<mtddef>[;<mtddef]
  <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>]
  <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro]
  <mtd-id>  := unique id used in mapping driver/device
  <size>    := standard linux memsize OR "-" to denote all 
  remaining space
  <name>    := (NAME)

  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are 
  allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition 
  names.

  Examples:

  1 flash resource (mtd-id "sa1100"), with 1 single writable partition:
  mtdparts=sa1100:-

  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only:
  mtdparts=sa1100:256k(ARMboot)ro,-(root)

  If unsure, say 'N'.

MTD concatenating support
CONFIG_MTD_CONCAT
  Support for concatenating several MTD devices into a single
  (virtual) one. This allows you to have -for example- a JFFS(2)
  file system spanning multiple physical flash chips. If unsure,
  say 'Y'.

  If compiled as a module, it will be called mtdconcat.o.

ARM Firmware Suite flash layout / partition parsing
CONFIG_MTD_AFS_PARTS
  The ARM Firmware Suite allows the user to divide flash devices into
  multiple 'images'. Each such image has a header containing its name
  and offset/size etc.

  If you need code which can detect and parse these tables, and
  register MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image detected,
  enable this option.

  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
  for your particular device.  It won't happen automatically.  The 
  'armflash' map driver (CONFIG_MTD_ARMFLASH) does this, for example.

MTD debugging verbosity (0 = quiet, 3 = noisy)
CONFIG_MTD_DEBUG_VERBOSE
  Determines the verbosity level of the MTD debugging messages.

Direct chardevice access to MTD devices
CONFIG_MTD_CHAR
  This provides a character device for each MTD device present in
  the system, allowing the user to read and write directly to the
  memory chips, and also use ioctl() to obtain information about
  the device, or to erase parts of it.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdchar.o

Caching block device access to MTD devices
CONFIG_MTD_BLOCK
  Although most flash chips have an erase size too large to be useful
  as block devices, it is possible to use MTD devices which are based
  on RAM chips in this manner. This block device is a user of MTD
  devices performing that function.

  At the moment, it is also required for the Journalling Flash File
  System(s) to obtain a handle on the MTD device when it's mounted
  (although JFFS and JFFS2 don't actually use any of the functionality
  of the mtdblock device).

  Later, it may be extended to perform read/erase/modify/write cycles
  on flash chips to emulate a smaller block size. Needless to say,
  this is very unsafe, but could be useful for file systems which are
  almost never written to.

  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For
  those, enable NFTL support (CONFIG_NFTL) instead.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdblock.o

Readonly block device access to MTD devices
CONFIG_MTD_BLOCK_RO
  This allows you to mount read-only file systems (such as cramfs)
  from an MTD device, without the overhead (and danger) of the caching
  driver.

  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For
  those, enable NFTL support (CONFIG_NFTL) instead.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdblock_ro.o

FTL (Flash Translation Layer) support
CONFIG_FTL
  This provides support for the original Flash Translation Layer which
  is part of the PCMCIA specification. It uses a kind of pseudo-
  file system on a flash device to emulate a block device with
  512-byte sectors, on top of which you put a 'normal' file system.

  You may find that the algorithms used in this code are patented
  unless you live in the Free World where software patents aren't
  legal - in the USA you are only permitted to use this on PCMCIA
  hardware, although under the terms of the GPL you're obviously
  permitted to copy, modify and distribute the code as you wish. Just
  not use it.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ftl.o

NFTL (NAND Flash Translation Layer) support
CONFIG_NFTL
  This provides support for the NAND Flash Translation Layer which is
  used on M-Systems' DiskOnChip devices. It uses a kind of pseudo-
  file system on a flash device to emulate a block device with
  512-byte sectors, on top of which you put a 'normal' file system.

  You may find that the algorithms used in this code are patented
  unless you live in the Free World where software patents aren't
  legal - in the USA you are only permitted to use this on DiskOnChip
  hardware, although under the terms of the GPL you're obviously
  permitted to copy, modify and distribute the code as you wish. Just
  not use it.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  nftl.o

Write support for NFTL (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_NFTL_RW
  If you're lucky, this will actually work. Don't whinge if it
  doesn't.  Send mail to the MTD mailing list
  <linux-mtd@lists.infradead.org> if you want to help to make it more
  reliable.

Detect flash chips by Common Flash Interface (CFI) probe
CONFIG_MTD_CFI
  The Common Flash Interface specification was developed by Intel,
  AMD and other flash manufactures that provides a universal method
  for probing the capabilities of flash devices. If you wish to
  support any device that is CFI-compliant, you need to enable this
  option. Visit <http://www.amd.com/products/nvd/overview/cfi.html>
  for more information on CFI.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cfi_probe.o

CFI Advanced configuration options
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_ADV_OPTIONS
  If you need to specify a specific endianness for access to flash
  chips, or if you wish to reduce the size of the kernel by including
  support for only specific arrangements of flash chips, say 'Y'. This
  option does not directly affect the code, but will enable other 
  configuration options which allow you to do so.

  If unsure, say 'N'.

Specific CFI Flash geometry selection
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_GEOMETRY
  This option does not affect the code directly, but will enable 
  some other configuration options which would allow you to reduce
  the size of the kernel by including support for only certain 
  arrangements of CFI chips. If unsure, say 'N' and all options 
  which are supported by the current code will be enabled.

Support 8-bit buswidth
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_B1
  If you wish to support CFI devices on a physical bus which is
  8 bits wide, say 'Y'.

Support 16-bit buswidth
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_B2
  If you wish to support CFI devices on a physical bus which is
  16 bits wide, say 'Y'.

Support 32-bit buswidth
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_B4
  If you wish to support CFI devices on a physical bus which is
  32 bits wide, say 'Y'.

CONFIG_MTD_CFI_B8
  If you wish to support CFI devices on a physical bus which is
  64 bits wide, say 'Y'.

Support 1-chip flash interleave
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I1
  If your flash chips are not interleaved - i.e. you only have one
  flash chip addressed by each bus cycle, then say 'Y'.

Support 2-chip flash interleave
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I2
  If your flash chips are interleaved in pairs - i.e. you have two
  flash chips addressed by each bus cycle, then say 'Y'.

Support 4-chip flash interleave
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I4
  If your flash chips are interleaved in fours - i.e. you have four
  flash chips addressed by each bus cycle, then say 'Y'.

CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I8
  If your flash chips are interleaved in eights - i.e. you have eight
  flash chips addressed by each bus cycle, then say 'Y'.

# Choice: mtd_data_swap
Flash cmd/query data swapping
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_NOSWAP
  This option defines the way in which the CPU attempts to arrange
  data bits when writing the 'magic' commands to the chips. Saying
  'NO', which is the default when CONFIG_MTD_CFI_ADV_OPTIONS isn't
  enabled, means that the CPU will not do any swapping; the chips
  are expected to be wired to the CPU in 'host-endian' form. 
  Specific arrangements are possible with the BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE and
  LITTLE_ENDIAN_BYTE, if the bytes are reversed.

  If you have a LART, on which the data (and address) lines were
  connected in a fashion which ensured that the nets were as short
  as possible, resulting in a bit-shuffling which seems utterly
  random to the untrained eye, you need the LART_ENDIAN_BYTE option.

  Yes, there really exists something sicker than PDP-endian :)

CFI support for Intel/Sharp Extended Command Set chips
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_INTELEXT

  <http://www.jedec.org/> distributes the identification codes for the
  chips. WARNING!!!! This code does not compile and is incomplete as
  are the specific JEDEC devices drivers.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read

  bootldr partition table on the flash chips detected.  If you are
  using the Compaq bootldr on your SA11x0-based board and want Linux 
  to present 'partitions' matching the images which the bootldr has
  listed, say 'Y'.

Flash chip mapping in physical memory
CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP
  This provides a 'mapping' driver which allows the CFI probe and
  command set driver code to communicate with flash chips which
  are mapped physically into the CPU's memory. You will need to
  configure the physical address and size of the flash chips on
  your particular board as well as the bus width.

  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  physmap.o

Physical start location of flash chip mapping
CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_START
  This is the physical memory location at which the flash chips
  are mapped on your particular target board. Refer to the
  memory map which should hopefully be in the documentation for
  your board.

Physical length of flash chip mapping
CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_LEN
  This is the total length of the mapping of the flash chips on
  your particular board. If there is space, or aliases, in the
  physical memory map between the chips, this could be larger
  than the total amount of flash present. Refer to the memory
  map which should hopefully be in the documentation for your
  board.

Buswidth of flash in bytes
CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP_BUSWIDTH
  This is the total width of the data bus of the flash devices
  in octets. For example, if you have a data bus width of 32
  bits, you would set the bus width octet value to 4. This is
  used internally by the CFI drivers.

Flash chip mapping on Sun Microsystems boardsets
CONFIG_MTD_SUN_UFLASH
  This provides a 'mapping' driver which supports the way in 
  which user-programmable flash chips are connected on various 
  Sun Microsystems boardsets.  This driver will require CFI support

  allow a window into the flash.  Both CFI and JEDEC probes are
  called.

Physical start location of flash chip mapping
CONFIG_MTD_CSTM_MIPS_IXX_START
  This is the physical memory location that the MTD driver will
  use for the flash chips on your particular target board. 
  Refer to the memory map which should hopefully be in the 
  documentation for your board.

Physical length of flash chip mapping
CONFIG_MTD_CSTM_MIPS_IXX_LEN
  This is the total length that the MTD driver will use for the 
  flash chips on your particular board.  Refer to the memory
  map which should hopefully be in the documentation for your
  board.

Physical bus width of flash mapping in bytes
CONFIG_MTD_CSTM_MIPS_IXX_BUSWIDTH
  This is the total bus width of the mapping of the flash chips
  on your particular board.

JEDEC Flash device mapped on Mixcom piggyback card
CONFIG_MTD_MIXMEM
  This supports the paging arrangement for access to flash chips
  on the MixCOM piggyback card, allowing the flash chip drivers
  to get on with their job of driving the flash chips without
  having to know about the paging. If you have one of these boards,
  you probably want to enable this mapping driver. More info is at
  <http://www.itc.hu/>.

JEDEC Flash device mapped on Octagon 5066 SBC
CONFIG_MTD_OCTAGON
  This provides a 'mapping' driver which supports the way in which
  the flash chips are connected in the Octagon-5066 Single Board
  Computer. More information on the board is available at
  <http://www.octagonsystems.com/Products/5066/5066.html>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  octagon-5066.o

JEDEC Flash device mapped on Tempustech VMAX SBC301
CONFIG_MTD_VMAX
  This provides a 'mapping' driver which supports the way in which
  the flash chips are connected in the Tempustech VMAX SBC301 Single
  Board Computer. More information on the board is available at
  <http://www.tempustech.com/tt301.htm>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  vmax301.o

Support for NAND flash devices
CONFIG_MTD_NAND
  This enables support for accessing all type of NAND flash
  devices.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  nand.o

Support for software ECC algorithm
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC
  This enables software-based ECC for use with NAND flash chips. It
  can detect and correct 1 bit errors per 256 byte blocks. This
  should be used to increase the reliability of the data stored and
  read on the device.

Support for verify read after write
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
  flipped accidentally due to device wear, gamma rays, whatever.
  Enable this if you are really paranoid.

Support for the SPIA board
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_SPIA
  If you had to ask, you don't have one. Say 'N'.

SmartMediaCard on autronix autcpu12 board
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_AUTCPU12
  This enables the driver for the autronix autcpu12 board to
  access the SmartMediaCard.

  If compiled as a module, it will be called autcpu12.o.

Support for Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation board
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_EDB7312
  This enables the driver for the Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation
  board to access the onboard NAND Flash.

  If compiled as a module, it will be called edb7312.o.

M-Systems Disk-On-Chip 1000 support
CONFIG_MTD_DOC1000
  This provides an MTD device driver for the M-Systems DiskOnChip
  1000 devices, which are obsolete so you probably want to say 'N'.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  doc1000.o

M-Systems Disk-On-Chip 2000 and Millennium support
CONFIG_MTD_DOC2000
  This provides an MTD device driver for the M-Systems DiskOnChip
  2000 and Millennium devices.  Originally designed for the DiskOnChip
  2000, it also now includes support for the DiskOnChip Millennium.
  If you have problems with this driver and the DiskOnChip Millennium,
  you may wish to try the alternative Millennium driver below. To use
  the alternative driver, you will need to undefine DOC_SINGLE_DRIVER
  in the <file:drivers/mtd/devices/docprobe.c> source code.

  If you use this device, you probably also want to enable the NFTL
  'NAND Flash Translation Layer' option below, which is used to
  emulate a block device by using a kind of file system on the flash
  chips.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  doc2000.o

Alternative Disk-On-Chip Millennium support
CONFIG_MTD_DOC2001
  This provides an alternative MTD device driver for the M-Systems 
  DiskOnChip Millennium devices.  Use this if you have problems with
  the combined DiskOnChip 2000 and Millennium driver above.  To get
  the DiskOnChip probe code to load and use this driver instead of
  the other one, you will need to undefine DOC_SINGLE_DRIVER near
  the beginning of <file:drivers/mtd/devices/docprobe.c>.

  If you use this device, you probably also want to enable the NFTL
  'NAND Flash Translation Layer' option below, which is used to
  emulate a block device by using a kind of file system on the flash
  chips.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  doc2001.o

Probe for DiskOnChip devices
CONFIG_MTD_DOCPROBE
  This isn't a real config option, it's derived.

Advanced detection options for DiskOnChip
CONFIG_MTD_DOCPROBE_ADVANCED
  This option allows you to specify nonstandard address at which to
  probe for a DiskOnChip, or to change the detection options.  You
  are unlikely to need any of this unless you are using LinuxBIOS.
  Say 'N'.

Probe for 0x55 0xAA BIOS Extension Signature
CONFIG_MTD_DOCPROBE_55AA
  Check for the 0x55 0xAA signature of a DiskOnChip, and do not
  continue with probing if it is absent.  The signature will always be
  present for a DiskOnChip 2000 or a normal DiskOnChip Millennium.
  Only if you have overwritten the first block of a DiskOnChip
  Millennium will it be  absent.  Enable this option if you are using
  LinuxBIOS or if you need to recover a DiskOnChip Millennium on which
  you have managed to wipe the first block.

Physical address of DiskOnChip
CONFIG_MTD_DOCPROBE_ADDRESS
  By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
  DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
  This option allows you to specify a single address at which to probe
  for the device, which is useful if you have other devices in that
  range which get upset when they are probed.

  (Note that on PowerPC, the normal probe will only check at
  0xE4000000.)

  Normally, you should leave this set to zero, to allow the probe at
  the normal addresses.

Probe high addresses
CONFIG_MTD_DOCPROBE_HIGH
  By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
  DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
  This option changes to make it probe between 0xFFFC8000 and
  0xFFFEE000.  Unless you are using LinuxBIOS, this is unlikely to be
  useful to you.  Say 'N'.

Ramix PMC551 PCI Mezzanine ram card support
CONFIG_MTD_PMC551
  This provides a MTD device driver for the Ramix PMC551 RAM PCI card
  from Ramix Inc. <http://www.ramix.com/products/memory/pmc551.html>.
  These devices come in memory configurations from 32M - 1G.  If you
  have one, you probably want to enable this.

  If this driver is compiled as a module you get the ability to select
  the size of the aperture window pointing into the devices memory.
  What this means is that if you have a 1G card, normally the kernel
  will use a 1G memory map as its view of the device.  As a module,
  you can select a 1M window into the memory and the driver will
  "slide" the window around the PMC551's memory.  This was
  particularly useful on the 2.2 kernels on PPC architectures as there
  was limited kernel space to deal with.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  pmc551.o

PMC551 256M DRAM Bugfix
CONFIG_MTD_PMC551_BUGFIX
  Some of Ramix's PMC551 boards with 256M configurations have invalid
  column and row mux values.  This option will fix them, but will
  break other memory configurations.  If unsure say N.

PMC551 Debugging
CONFIG_MTD_PMC551_DEBUG
  This option makes the PMC551 more verbose during its operation and
  is only really useful if you are developing on this driver or
  suspect a possible hardware or driver bug.  If unsure say N.

Use extra onboard system memory as MTD device
CONFIG_MTD_SLRAM
  If your CPU cannot cache all of the physical memory in your machine,
  you can still use it for storage or swap by using this driver to
  present it to the system as a Memory Technology Device.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  slram.o

DEC MS02-NV NVRAM module support
CONFIG_MTD_MS02NV
  This is an MTD driver for the DEC's MS02-NV (54-20948-01) battery
  backed-up NVRAM module.  The module was originally meant as an NFS
  accelerator.  Say Y here if you have a DECstation 5000/2x0 or a
  DECsystem 5900 equipped with such a module.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will
  be called ms02-nv.o.

Debugging RAM test driver
CONFIG_MTD_MTDRAM
  This enables a test MTD device driver which uses vmalloc() to
  provide storage.  You probably want to say 'N' unless you're
  testing stuff.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  mtdram.o

MTDRAM erase block size in KB
CONFIG_MTDRAM_ERASE_SIZE
  This allows you to configure the size of the erase blocks in the
  device emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
  as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when
  loading the module.

MTDRAM device size in KB
CONFIG_MTDRAM_TOTAL_SIZE
  This allows you to configure the total size of the MTD device
  emulated by the MTDRAM driver.  If the MTDRAM driver is built
  as a module, it is also possible to specify this as a parameter when
  loading the module.

SRAM Hexadecimal Absolute position or 0
CONFIG_MTDRAM_ABS_POS
  If you have system RAM accessible by the CPU but not used by Linux
  in normal operation, you can give the physical address at which the
  available RAM starts, and the MTDRAM driver will use it instead of
  allocating space from Linux's available memory. Otherwise, leave 
  this set to zero. Most people will want to leave this as zero.

CFI Flash device mapping on the Flaga Digital Module
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_FLAGADM
  Mapping for the Flaga digital module.  If you dont have one, ignore
  this setting.

Momenco Ocelot boot flash device
CONFIG_MTD_OCELOT
  This enables access routines for the boot flash device and for the
  NVRAM on the Momenco Ocelot board.  If you have one of these boards
  and would like access to either of these, say 'Y'.

Support for absent chips in bus mapping
CONFIG_MTD_ABSENT
  This option enables support for a dummy probing driver used to
  allocated placeholder MTD devices on systems that have socketed
  or removable media.  Use of this driver as a fallback chip probe
  preserves the expected registration order of MTD device nodes on
  the system regardless of media presence.  Device nodes created
  with this driver will return -ENODEV upon access.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  map_absent.o

MTD emulation using block device
CONFIG_MTD_BLKMTD
  This driver allows a block device to appear as an MTD. It would
  generally be used in the following cases:

    Using Compact Flash as an MTD, these usually present themselves to
    the system as an ATA drive.
    Testing MTD users (eg JFFS2) on large media and media that might
    be removed during a write (using the floppy drive).

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  blkmtd.o

Cirrus CDB89712 evaluation board mappings
CONFIG_MTD_CDB89712
  This enables access to the flash or ROM chips on the CDB89712 board.
  (This board has 8 MB of Intel Strataflash, a 128 byte boot ROM, and 48 KB of
  internal SRAM.  This driver provides MTD devices for all three components.)
  If you have such a board, say 'Y'.

Detect non-CFI AMD/JEDEC-compatible flash chips
CONFIG_MTD_JEDECPROBE
  This option enables JEDEC-style probing of flash chips which are not
  compatible with the Common Flash Interface, but will use the common
  CFI-targetted flash drivers for any chips which are identified which
  are in fact compatible in all but the probe method. This actually
  covers most AMD/Fujitsu-compatible chips, and will shortly cover also
  non-CFI Intel chips (that code is in MTD CVS and should shortly be sent
  for inclusion in Linus' tree)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  jedec_probe.o

BIOS flash chip on Intel L440GX boards
CONFIG_MTD_L440GX
  Support for treating the BIOS flash chip on Intel L440GX motherboards
  as an MTD device - with this you can reprogram your BIOS.

  BE VERY CAREFUL.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  l440gx.o

28F160xx flash driver for LART
CONFIG_MTD_LART
  This enables the flash driver for LART. Please note that you do
  not need any mapping/chip driver for LART. This one does it all
  for you, so go disable all of those if you enabled some of them (:

Older (theoretically obsoleted now) drivers for non-CFI chips
CONFIG_MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS
  This option does not enable any code directly, but will allow you to
  select some other chip drivers which are now considered obsolete,
  because the generic CONFIG_JEDEC_PROBE code above should now detect
  the chips which are supported by these drivers, and allow the generic
  CFI-compatible drivers to drive the chips. Say 'N' here unless you have
  already tried the CONFIG_JEDEC_PROBE method and reported its failure
  to the MTD mailing list at <linux-mtd@lists.infradead.org>

CFI Flash device mapped on Hitachi SolutionEngine
CONFIG_MTD_SOLUTIONENGINE
  This enables access to the flash chips on the Hitachi SolutionEngine and
  similar boards. Say 'Y' if you are building a kernel for such a board.

CFI Flash device mapped on TQM8XXL PPC board
CONFIG_MTD_TQM8XXL
  The TQM8xxL PowerPC board has up to two banks of CFI-compliant
  chips, currently uses AMD one. This 'mapping' driver supports
  that arrangement, allowing the CFI probe and command set driver
  code to communicate with the chips on the TQM8xxL board. More at
  <http://www.denx.de/embedded-ppc-en.html>.

Darkness
CONFIG_MEMORY_SET
  This is an option about which you will never be asked a question.
  Therefore, I conclude that you do not exist - go away.

  There is a grue here.

Physical memory size
CONFIG_MEMORY_SIZE
  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command
  line. If unsure, consult your board specifications or just leave it
  as 0x00400000 which was the default value before this became
  configurable.

Cache and PCI noncoherent
CONFIG_SH_PCIDMA_NONCOHERENT
  Enable this option if your platform does not have a CPU cache which
  remains coherent with PCI DMA. It is safest to say 'Y', although you
  will see better performance if you can say 'N', because the PCI DMA
  code will not have to flush the CPU's caches. If you have a PCI host
  bridge integrated with your SH CPU, refer carefully to the chip specs
  to see if you can say 'N' here. Otherwise, leave it as 'Y'.

USB (Universal Serial Bus) support
CONFIG_USB
  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
  connected to a single USB port in a tree structure.  The USB port is
  the root of the tree, the peripherals are the leaves and the inner
  nodes are special USB devices called hubs.  Many newer PC's have USB
  ports and newer peripherals such as scanners, keyboards, mice,
  modems, and printers support the USB protocol and can be connected
  to the PC via those ports.

  Say Y here if your computer has a USB port and you want to use USB
  devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of "UHCI support"
  or "OHCI support" below (the type of interface that the USB hardware
  in your computer provides to the operating system) and then choose
  from among the drivers for USB peripherals.  You may want to check
  out the information provided in <file:Documentation/usb/> and
  especially the links given in <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usbcore.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

USB verbose debug messages
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the USB core & hub drivers to produce a bunch
  of debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
  problem with USB support and want to see more of what is going on.

USB long timeout for slow-responding devices (some MGE Ellipse UPSes)
CONFIG_USB_LONG_TIMEOUT
  This option makes the standard time out a bit longer.  Basically,
  some devices are just slow to respond, so this makes usb more
  patient.  There should be no harm in selecting this, but it is
  needed for some MGE Ellipse UPSes.

  If you have an MGE Ellipse UPS, or you see timeouts in HID
  transactions, say Y; otherwise say N.

EHCI (USB 2.0) support
CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD
  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
  configure this Host Controller Driver.  At this writing, the primary
  implementation of EHCI is a chip from NEC, widely available in add-on
  PCI cards, but implementations are in the works from other vendors
  including Intel and Philips.  Motherboard support is appearing.

  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
  will connect to EHCI if it the device is high speed, otherwise they
  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
  Controller Driver too.

  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called ehci-hcd.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

UHCI (Intel PIIX4, VIA, ...) support
CONFIG_USB_UHCI
  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for
  accessing the USB hardware in the PC (which is also called the USB
  host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to this
  standard, you may want to say Y, but see below. All recent boards
  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
  133).

  Currently there exist two drivers for UHCI host controllers: this
  one and the so-called JE driver, which you can get from
  "UHCI alternate (JE) support", below. You need only one.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usb-uhci.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

UHCI (Intel PIIX4, VIA, ...) alternate (JE) support
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT
  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for

  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
  133). If unsure, say Y.

  Currently there exist two drivers for UHCI host controllers: this
  so-called JE driver, and the one you get from "UHCI support", above.

OHCI (Compaq, iMacs, OPTi, SiS, ALi, ...) support
CONFIG_USB_OHCI
  The Open Host Controller Interface is a standard by
  Compaq/Microsoft/National for accessing the USB PC hardware (also
  called USB host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to
  this standard, say Y. The USB host controllers on most non-Intel
  architectures and on several x86 compatibles with non-Intel chipsets
  -- like SiS (aktual 610, 610 and so on) or ALi (ALi IV, ALi V,
  Aladdin Pro..) -- conform to this standard.

  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ohci.txt>.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usb-ohci.o. If you want to compile it

USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support
CONFIG_USB_HID
  Say Y here if you want full HID support to connect keyboards,
  mice, joysticks, graphic tablets, or any other HID based devices
  to your computer via USB. You also need to select HID Input layer
  support (below) if you want to use keyboards, mice, joysticks and
  the like.

  You can't use this driver and the HIDBP (Boot Protocol) keyboard
  and mouse drivers at the same time. More information is available:
  <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called hid.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

USB HID Input layer support
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT
  Say Y here if you want to use a USB keyboard, mouse or joystick,
  or any other HID input device. You also need Input layer support, 
  (CONFIG_INPUT) which you select under "Input core support".

  If unsure, say Y.

/dev/usb/hiddev raw HID device support
CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV
  Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
  specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
  devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

  This module supports these devices separately using a separate
  event interface on /dev/usb/hiddevX (char 180:96 to 180:111).
  This driver requires CONFIG_USB_HID.

  If unsure, say Y.

USB HIDBP Keyboard (basic) support
CONFIG_USB_KBD
  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
  to use the generic HID driver for your USB keyboard and prefer
  to use the keyboard in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.

  This is almost certainly not what you want.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usbkbd.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If even remotely unsure, say N.

USB HIDBP Mouse (basic) support
CONFIG_USB_MOUSE
  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
  to use the generic HID driver for your USB mouse and prefer
  to use the mouse in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.

  This is almost certainly not what you want.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usbmouse.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  This driver is likely to work with most 10Mbps only USB Ethernet
  adapters, including some "no brand" devices. It does NOT work on
  SmartBridges smartNIC or on Belkin F5U111 devices - you should use
  the CATC NetMate driver for those. If you are not sure which one
  you need, select both, and the correct one should be selected for
  you.

  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface,
  typically on eth0, if it is the only ethernet device, or perhaps on
  eth1, if you have a PCI or ISA ethernet card installed.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be

USS720 parport driver
CONFIG_USB_USS720
  This driver is for USB parallel port adapters that use the Lucent
  Technologies USS-720 chip. These cables are plugged into your USB
  port and provide USB compatibility to peripherals designed with
  parallel port interfaces.

  The chip has two modes: automatic mode and manual mode. In automatic
  mode, it looks to the computer like a standard USB printer. Only
  printers may be connected to the USS-720 in this mode. The generic
  USB printer driver ("USB Printer support", above) may be used in
  that mode, and you can say N here if you want to use the chip only
  in this mode.

  Manual mode is not limited to printers, any parallel port
  device should work. This driver utilizes manual mode.
  Note however that some operations are three orders of magnitude
  slower than on a PCI/ISA Parallel Port, so timing critical
  applications might not work.

  Say Y here if you own an USS-720 USB->Parport cable and intend to
  connect anything other than a printer to it.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called uss720.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

USB device file system
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS
  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
  systems section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
  busses, a file /proc/bus/usb/drivers which lists the USB kernel
  client drivers currently loaded, and for every connected device a
  file named  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and
  yyy the device number; the latter files can be used by user space
  programs to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual",
  meaning they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard
  drive.

  You may need to mount the usbdevfs file system to see the files, use
   mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb

  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

  Please note that this code is completely unrelated to devfs, the
  "/dev file system support".

  Most users want to say Y here.

Enforce USB bandwidth allocation
CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH
  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem enforces USB bandwidth
  allocation and will prevent some device opens from succeeding
  if they would cause USB bandwidth usage to go above 90% of
  the bus bandwidth.

  If you say N here, these conditions will cause warning messages
  about USB bandwidth usage to be logged and some devices or
  drivers may not work correctly.

DABUSB driver
CONFIG_USB_DABUSB
  A Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Receiver for USB and Linux
  brought to you by the DAB-Team (<http://dab.in.tum.de/>).  This
  driver can be taken as an example for URB-based bulk, control, and
  isochronous transactions. URB's are explained in
  <file:Documentation/usb/URB.txt>.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called dabusb.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Host-to-Host USB networking
CONFIG_USB_USBNET
  This driver supports network links over USB with USB "Network"
  or "data transfer" cables, often used to network laptops to PCs.
  Such cables have chips from suppliers such as Belkin/eTEK, GeneSys
  (GeneLink), NetChip and Prolific. Intelligent USB devices could also
  use this approach to provide Internet access, using standard USB
  cabling. You can find these chips also on some motherboards with
  USB PC2PC support.

  These links will have names like "usb0", "usb1", etc.  They act
  like two-node Ethernets, so you can use 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
  (CONFIG_BRIDGE) to simplify your network routing.

  This code is also available as a kernel module (code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usbnet.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  your calculator through a set of device nodes under /dev.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called tiglusb.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  If you don't know what the SilverLink cable is or what a Texas
  Instruments graphing calculator is, then you probably don't need this
  driver.

  If unsure, say N.

Texas Instruments parallel link cable support
CONFIG_TIPAR
  If you own a Texas Instruments graphing calculator and use a
  parallel link cable, then you might be interested in this driver.

  If you enable this driver, you will be able to communicate with
  your calculator through a set of device nodes under /dev. The
  main advantage of this driver is that you don't have to be root
  to use this precise link cable (depending on the permissions on
  the device nodes, though).

  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called tipar.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>

  If you don't know what a parallel link cable is or what a Texas

D-Link DSB-R100 FM radio support
CONFIG_USB_DSBR
  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of radio to your
  computer's USB port. Note that the audio is not digital, and
  you must connect the line out connector to a sound card or a
  set of speakers.

  This driver uses the Video For Linux API.  You must enable
  (Y or M in config) Video For Linux (under Character Devices)
  to use this driver.  Information on this API and pointers to
  "v4l" programs may be found on the WWW at
  <http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4l.shtml>.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).

  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Alcatel Speedtouch USB support
CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH
  Say Y here if you have an Alcatel SpeedTouch USB or SpeedTouch 330
  modem.  In order to use your modem you will need to install some user
  space tools, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/> for details.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called speedtch.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CONFIG_USB_GADGET
  USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
  host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
  The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
  you can't connect two "to-the-host" connectors to each other.

  Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
  you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
  talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
  or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
  familiar host side controllers have names like like "EHCI", "OHCI",
  or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
  motherboards.

  Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
  a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
  peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
  your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
  you may configure more than one.)

  If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
  don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

CONFIG_USB_NET2280
  NetChip 2280 is a PCI based USB peripheral controller which
  supports both full and high speed USB 2.0 data transfers.  
           
  It has six configurable endpoints, as well as endpoint zero
  (for control transfers) and several endpoints with dedicated
  functions.

  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
  dynamically linked module called "net2280" and force all
  gadget drivers to also be dynamically linked.

CONFIG_USB_ZERO
  Gadget Zero is a two-configuration device.  It either sinks and
  sources bulk data; or it loops back a configurable number of
  transfers.  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9"
  conformance.  The driver needs only two bulk-capable endpoints, so
  it can work on top of most device-side usb controllers.  It's
  useful for testing, and is also a working example showing how
  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
  dynamically linked module called "g_zero".

CONFIG_USB_ETH
  This driver implements Ethernet style communication, in either
  of two ways:
          
   - The "Communication Device Class" (CDC) Ethernet Control Model.
     That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in
     favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely
     supported by firmware for smart network devices.

   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simpler approach
     is used, placing fewer demands on USB.

   Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
   "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
   Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

   The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
   driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
   use "CDCEther" instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC
   mode should also interoperate with standard CDC Ethernet class
   drivers on other host operating systems.

   Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
   dynamically linked module called "g_ether".

Always do synchronous disk IO for UBD
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UBD_SYNC
  The User-Mode Linux port includes a driver called UBD which will let
  you access arbitrary files on the host computer as block devices.
  Writes to such a block device are not immediately written to the
  host's disk; this may cause problems if, for example, the User-Mode
  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling file system and the host
  computer crashes.

  Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk
  immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special
  kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to
  turn on synchronous operation by default for all block.

  If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for
  example) in your virtual machine, you will want to say Y here.  If
  you care for the safety of the data in your virtual machine, Y is a
  wise choice too.  In all other cases (for example, if you're just
  playing around with User-Mode Linux) you can choose N.

Enable ptrace proxy
CONFIG_PT_PROXY
  This option enables a debugging interface which allows gdb to debug
  the kernel without needing to actually attach to kernel threads.
  If you want to do kernel debugging, say Y here; otherwise say N.

Management console
CONFIG_MCONSOLE
  The user mode linux management console is a low-level interface to
  the kernel, somewhat like the i386 SysRq interface.  Since there is
  a full-blown operating system running under every user mode linux
  instance, there is much greater flexibility possible than with the
  SysRq mechanism.

  If you answer 'Y' to this option, to use this feature, you need the
  mconsole client (called uml_mconsole) which is present in CVS in
  2.4.5-9um and later (path /tools/mconsole), and is also in the
  distribution RPM package in 2.4.6 and later.

  It is safe to say 'Y' here.

Enable kernel debugging symbols
CONFIG_DEBUGSYM
  When this is enabled, the User-Mode Linux binary will include
  debugging symbols.  This enlarges the binary by a few megabytes,
  but aids in tracking down kernel problems in UML.  It is required
  if you intend to do any kernel development.

  If you're truly short on disk space or don't expect to report any
  bugs back to the UML developers, say N, otherwise say Y.

Enable gcov support
CONFIG_GCOV
  This option allows developers to retrieve coverage data from a UML
  session.

  See <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/gcov.html> for more
  details.

  If you're involved in UML kernel development and want to use gcov,
  say Y.  If you're unsure, say N.

Enable gprof support
CONFIG_GPROF
  This allows profiling of a User-Mode Linux kernel with the gprof
  utility.

  See <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/gprof.html> for more
  details.

  If you're involved in UML kernel development and want to use gprof,
  say Y.  If you're unsure, say N.

Host filesystem
CONFIG_HOSTFS
  While the User-Mode Linux port uses its own root file system for
  booting and normal file access, this module lets the UML user
  access files stored on the host.  It does not require any
  network connection between the Host and UML.  An example use of
  this might be:

  mount none /tmp/fromhost -t hostfs -o /tmp/umlshare

  where /tmp/fromhost is an empty directory inside UML and
  /tmp/umlshare is a directory on the host with files the UML user
  wishes to access.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/hostfs.html>.

  If you'd like to be able to work with files stored on the host, 
  say Y or M here; otherwise say N.

Example IO Memory driver
CONFIG_MMAPPER
  The User-Mode Linux port can provide support for IO Memory
  emulation with this option.  This allows a host file to be
  specified as an I/O region on the kernel command line. That file
  will be mapped into UML's kernel address space where a driver can
  locate it and do whatever it wants with the memory, including
  providing an interface to it for UML processes to use.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/iomem.html>.

  If you'd like to be able to provide a simulated IO port space for
  User-Mode Linux processes, say Y.  If unsure, say N.

Virtual Serial Line
CONFIG_SSL
  The User-Mode Linux environment allows you to create virtual serial
  lines on the UML that are usually made to show up on the host as
  ttys or ptys.

  See <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/input.html> for more
  information and command line examples of how to use this facility.

  Unless you have a specific reason for disabling this, say Y.

Virtual network device
CONFIG_UML_NET
  While the User-Mode port cannot directly talk to any physical
  hardware devices, this choice and the following transport options
  provide one or more virtual network devices through which the UML
  kernels can talk to each other, the host, and with the host's help,
  machines on the outside world.

  For more information, including explanations of the networking and
  sample configurations, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/networking.html>.

  If you'd like to be able to enable networking in the User-Mode
  linux environment, say Y; otherwise say N.  Note that you must
  enable at least one of the following transport options to actually
  make use of UML networking.

Daemon transport
CONFIG_UML_NET_DAEMON
  This User-Mode Linux network transport allows one or more running
  UMLs on a single host to communicate with each other, but not to
  the host.

  To use this form of networking, you'll need to run the UML
  networking daemon on the host.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/networking.html>  That site
  has examples of the UML command line to use to enable Daemon
  networking.

  If you'd like to set up a network with other UMLs on a single host,
  say Y.  If you need a network between UMLs on multiple physical
  hosts, choose the Multicast Transport.  To set up a network with
  the host and/or other IP machines, say Y to the Ethertap or Slip
  transports.  You'll need at least one of them, but may choose
  more than one without conflict.  If you don't need UML networking,
  say N.

Ethertap transport
CONFIG_UML_NET_ETHERTAP
  The Ethertap User-Mode Linux network transport allows a single
  running UML to exchange packets with its host over one of the
  host's Ethertap devices, such as /dev/tap0.  Additional running
  UMLs can use additional Ethertap devices, one per running UML.
  While the UML believes it's on a (multi-device, broadcast) virtual
  Ethernet network, it's in fact communicating over a point-to-point
  link with the host.

  To use this, your host kernel must have support for Ethertap
  devices.  Also, if your host kernel is 2.4.x, it must have 
  CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV configured as Y or M.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/networking.html>  That site
  has examples of the UML command line to use to enable Ethertap
  networking.

  If you'd like to set up an IP network with the host and/or the
  outside world, say Y to this, the Daemon Transport and/or the 
  Slip Transport.  You'll need at least one of them, but may choose
  more than one without conflict.  If you don't need UML networking,
  say N.

TUN/TAP transport
CONFIG_UML_NET_TUNTAP
  The UML TUN/TAP network transport allows a UML instance to exchange
  packets with the host over a TUN/TAP device.  This option will only
  work with a 2.4 host, unless you've applied the TUN/TAP patch to
  your 2.2 host kernel.

  To use this transport, your host kernel must have support for TUN/TAP
  devices, either built-in or as a module.

Multicast transport
CONFIG_UML_NET_MCAST
  This Multicast User-Mode Linux network transport allows multiple
  UMLs (even ones running on different host machines!) to talk to
  each other over a virtual ethernet network.  However, it requires
  at least one UML with one of the other transports to act as a
  bridge if any of them need to be able to talk to their hosts or any
  other IP machines.

  To use this, your host kernel(s) must support IP Multicasting.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/networking.html>  That site
  has examples of the UML command line to use to enable Multicast
  networking, and notes about the security of this approach.

  If you need UMLs on multiple physical hosts to communicate as if
  they shared an Ethernet network, say Y.  If you need to communicate
  with other IP machines, make sure you select one of the other
  transports (possibly in addition to Multicast; they're not
  exclusive).  If you don't need to network UMLs say N to each of
  the transports.

SLIP transport
CONFIG_UML_NET_SLIP
  The Slip User-Mode Linux network transport allows a running UML to
  network with its host over a point-to-point link.  Unlike Ethertap,
  which can carry any Ethernet frame (and hence even non-IP packets),
  the Slip transport can only carry IP packets.

  To use this, your host must support Slip devices.

  For more information, see
  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/networking.html>.  That site
  has examples of the UML command line to use to enable Slip
  networking, and details of a few quirks with it.

  The Ethertap Transport is preferred over Slip because of its
  limitation.  If you prefer Slip, however, say Y here.  Otherwise
  choose the Multicast transport (to network multiple UMLs on 
  multiple hosts), Ethertap (to network with the host and the
  outside world), and/or the Daemon transport (to network multiple
  UMLs on a single host).  You may choose more than one without
  conflict.  If you don't need UML networking, say N.

Microtek USB scanner support
CONFIG_USB_MICROTEK
  Say Y here if you want support for the Microtek X6USB and
  possibly the Phantom 336CX, Phantom C6 and ScanMaker V6U(S)L.
  Support for anything but the X6 is experimental.
  Please report failures and successes.
  The scanner will appear as a scsi generic device to the rest
  of the system. Scsi support is required for this driver to compile
  and work. SANE 1.0.4 or newer is needed to make use of your scanner.
  This driver can be compiled as a module.

HP53xx and Minolta Dual Scanner support
CONFIG_USB_HPUSBSCSI
  Say Y here if you want support for the HP 53xx series of scanners
  and the Minolta Scan Dual. This driver is experimental.
  The scanner will be accessible as a SCSI device.

USB Bluetooth support
CONFIG_USB_BLUETOOTH
  Say Y here if you want to connect a USB Bluetooth device to your
  computer's USB port. You will need the Bluetooth stack (available
  at <http://developer.axis.com/software>) to fully use the device.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called bluetooth.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

USB MIDI support
CONFIG_USB_MIDI
  Say Y here if you want to connect a USB MIDI device to your
  computer's USB port. This driver is for devices that comply with
  'Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for MIDI Device'.

  The following devices are known to work:
    * Steinberg USB2MIDI
    * Roland MPU64
    * Roland PC-300
    * Roland SC8850
    * Roland UM-1
    * Roland UM-2
    * Roland UA-100
    * Yamaha MU1000

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usb-midi.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Minix fs support
CONFIG_MINIX_FS
  Minix is a simple operating system used in many classes about OS's.
  The minix file system (method to organize files on a hard disk
  partition or a floppy disk) was the original file system for Linux,
  but has been superseded by the second extended file system ext2fs.
  You don't want to use the minix file system on your hard disk
  because of certain built-in restrictions, but it is sometimes found
  on older Linux floppy disks.  This option will enlarge your kernel
  by about 28 KB. If unsure, say N.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called minix.o.  Note that the file system of your root
  partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as
  a module.

Reiserfs support
CONFIG_REISERFS_FS
  Stores not just filenames but the files themselves in a balanced
  tree.  Uses journalling.

  Balanced trees are more efficient than traditional file system
  architectural foundations.

  In general, ReiserFS is as fast as ext2, but is very efficient with
  large directories and small files.  It is much faster for writes,
  and slightly slower for reads than ext2.  It is much faster than
  ext3.  It will be obsoleted by Reiser4 in not too long, so keep
  an eye on our website for when Reiser4 ships.

  Mount with the notail option if performance matters more to you than
  saving space (the design flaw underlying this is fixed in reiser4).

  Read <http://www.namesys.com> to learn more about reiserfs.

Enable extra Reiserfs consistency checks
CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK
  If you set this to Y, then ReiserFS will perform every check it can
  possibly imagine of its internal consistency throughout its
  operation.  It will also go substantially slower.  More than once we
  have forgotten that this was on, and then gone despondent over the
  latest benchmarks.:-) Use of this option allows our team to go all
  out in checking for consistency when debugging without fear of its
  effect on end users.  If you are on the verge of sending in a bug
  report, say Y and you might get a useful error message.  Almost
  everyone should say N.

Publish some reiserfs-specific info under /proc/fs/reiserfs
CONFIG_REISERFS_PROC_INFO
  Create under /proc/fs/reiserfs a hierarchy of files, displaying
  various ReiserFS statistics and internal data at the expense of making
  your kernel or module slightly larger (+8 KB). This also increases the
  amount of kernel memory required for each mount by 440 bytes.
  It isn't useful to average persons, and you probably can't measure the
  performance cost of it.  If you are fine-tuning reiserfs, say Y,
  otherwise say N.

Second extended fs support
CONFIG_EXT2_FS
  This is the de facto standard Linux file system (method to organize
  files on a storage device) for hard disks.

  You want to say Y here, unless you intend to use Linux exclusively
  from inside a DOS partition using the UMSDOS file system. The
  advantage of the latter is that you can get away without
  repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies backing
  everything up and restoring afterwards); the disadvantage is that
  Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and that UMSDOS is somewhat
  slower than ext2fs. Even if you want to run Linux in this fashion,
  it might be a good idea to have ext2fs around: it enables you to
  read more floppy disks and facilitates the transition to a *real*
  Linux partition later. Another (rare) case which doesn't require
  ext2fs is a diskless Linux box which mounts all files over the
  network using NFS (in this case it's sufficient to say Y to "NFS
  file system support" below). Saying Y here will enlarge your kernel
  by about 44 KB.

  The Ext2fs-Undeletion mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, gives information about
  how to retrieve deleted files on ext2fs file systems.

  To change the behaviour of ext2 file systems, you can use the tune2fs
  utility ("man tune2fs"). To modify attributes of files and
  directories on ext2 file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").

  Ext2fs partitions can be read from within DOS using the ext2tool
  command line tool package (available from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ext2/>) and from
  within Windows NT using the ext2nt command line tool package from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/dos/>.  Explore2fs is a
  graphical explorer for ext2fs partitions which runs on Windows 95
  and Windows NT and includes experimental write support; it is
  available from
  <http://jnewbigin-pc.it.swin.edu.au/Linux/Explore2fs.htm>.

  If you want to compile this file system as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called ext2.o.  Be aware however that the file system
  of your root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot
  be compiled as a module, and so this could be dangerous.  Most
  everyone wants to say Y here.

Ext3 journalling file system support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_EXT3_FS
  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
  system.

  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
  behaviour of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

  If you want to compile this file system as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called ext3.o.  Be aware however that the file system
  of your root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot
  be compiled as a module, and so this may be dangerous.

Journal Block Device support (JBD for ext3) (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_JBD
  This is a generic journalling layer for block devices.  It is
  currently used by the ext3 file system, but it could also be used to
  add journal support to other file systems or block devices such as
  RAID or LVM.

  If you are using the ext3 file system, you need to say Y here. If
  you are not using ext3 then you will probably want to say N.

  If you want to compile this device as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called jbd.o.  If you are compiling ext3 into the kernel,
  you cannot compile this code as a module.

JBD (ext3) debugging support
CONFIG_JBD_DEBUG
  If you are using the ext3 journalling file system (or potentially any
  other file system/device using JBD), this option allows you to
  enable debugging output while the system is running, in order to
  help track down any problems you are having.  By default the
  debugging output will be turned off.

  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging
  with "echo N > /proc/sys/fs/jbd-debug", where N is a number between
  1 and 5, the higher the number, the more debugging output is
  generated.  To turn debugging off again, do
  "echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/jbd-debug".

Buffer Head tracing (DEBUG)
CONFIG_BUFFER_DEBUG
  If you are a kernel developer working with file systems or in the
  block device layer, this buffer head tracing may help you to track
  down bugs in your code.  This enables some debugging macros
  (BUFFER_TRACE, etc.) which allow you to track the state of a buffer
  through various layers of code.  The debugging code is used
  primarily by ext3 and JBD code.

  Because this option adds considerably to the size of each buffer,
  most people will want to say N here.

BeOS filesystem support (BeFS) (read only)
CONFIG_BEFS_FS
  The BeOS File System (BeFS) is the native file system of Be, Inc's
  BeOS. Notable features include support for arbitrary attributes
  on files and directories, and database-like indices on selected
  attributes. (Also note that this driver doesn't make those features
  available at this time). It is a 64 bit filesystem, so it supports
  extremely large volumes and files.

  If you use this filesystem, you should also say Y to at least one
  of the NLS (native language support) options below.

  If you don't know what this is about, say N.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be
  called befs.o.

Debug BeFS
CONFIG_BEFS_DEBUG
  If you say Y here, you can use the 'debug' mount option to enable
  debugging output from the driver. This is unlike previous versions
  of the driver, where enabling this option would turn on debugging
  output automatically.

  Example:
  mount -t befs /dev/hda2 /mnt -o debug

BFS file system support
CONFIG_BFS_FS
  Boot File System (BFS) is a file system used under SCO UnixWare to
  allow the bootloader access to the kernel image and other important
  files during the boot process.  It is usually mounted under /stand
  and corresponds to the slice marked as "STAND" in the UnixWare
  partition.  You should say Y if you want to read or write the files
  on your /stand slice from within Linux.  You then also need to say Y
  to "UnixWare slices support", below.  More information about the BFS
  file system is contained in the file
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/bfs.txt>.

  If you don't know what this is about, say N.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called bfs.o.  Note that the file system of your root
  partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as
  a module.

Compressed ROM file system support
CONFIG_CRAMFS
  Saying Y here includes support for CramFs (Compressed ROM File
  System).  CramFs is designed to be a simple, small, and compressed
  file system for ROM based embedded systems.  CramFs is read-only,
  limited to 256MB file systems (with 16MB files), and doesn't support
  16/32 bits uid/gid, hard links and timestamps.

  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/cramfs.txt> and
  <file:fs/cramfs/README> for further information.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called cramfs.o.  Note that the root file system (the one
  containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.

  If unsure, say N.

CMS file system support
CONFIG_CMS_FS
  Read only support for CMS minidisk file systems found on IBM
  mainframe systems.  Only the basic format is supported so far.  If
  you don't know what CMS is you probably don't want to know any more.

# When the 2.5 version of configure.help goes away, the part of this that 
# duplicates Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt can drop out.
Virtual memory file system support
CONFIG_TMPFS
  Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory.
  Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be
  created on your hard drive. If you reboot, everything in tmpfs will
  be lost.

  In contrast to RAM disks, which get allocated a fixed amount of
  physical RAM, tmpfs grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it
  contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space.

  Everything is "virtual" in the sense that no files will be created
  on your hard drive; if you reboot, everything in tmpfs will be
  lost.

  You should mount the file system somewhere to be able to use
  POSIX shared memory. Adding the following line to /etc/fstab should
  take care of things:

  tmpfs		/dev/shm	tmpfs		defaults	0 0

  Remember to create the directory that you intend to mount tmpfs on
  if necessary (/dev/shm is automagically created if you use devfs).

  You can set limits for the number of blocks and inodes used by the
  file system with the mount options "size", "nr_blocks" and
  "nr_inodes". These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g for kilo,
  mega and giga and can be changed on remount.

  The initial permissions of the root directory can be set with the
  mount option "mode".

  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt> for details.

Simple RAM-based file system support
CONFIG_RAMFS
  Ramfs is a file system which keeps all files in RAM. It allows
  read and write access.

  It is more of an programming example than a usable file system.  If
  you need a file system which lives in RAM with limit checking use
  tmpfs.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ramfs.o.

ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support
CONFIG_ISO9660_FS
  This is the standard file system used on CD-ROMs.  It was previously
  known as "High Sierra File System" and is called "hsfs" on other
  Unix systems.  The so-called Rock-Ridge extensions which allow for
  long Unix filenames and symbolic links are also supported by this
  driver.  If you have a CD-ROM drive and want to do more with it than
  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/isofs.txt> and the CD-ROM-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), thereby
  enlarging your kernel by about 27 KB; otherwise say N.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called isofs.o.

Microsoft Joliet CD-ROM extensions
CONFIG_JOLIET
  Joliet is a Microsoft extension for the ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system
  which allows for long filenames in unicode format (unicode is the
  new 16 bit character code, successor to ASCII, which encodes the
  characters of almost all languages of the world; see
  <http://www.unicode.org/> for more information).  Say Y here if you
  want to be able to read Joliet CD-ROMs under Linux.

Transparent decompression extension
CONFIG_ZISOFS
  This is a Linux-specific extension to RockRidge which lets you store
  data in compressed form on a CD-ROM and have it transparently
  decompressed when the CD-ROM is accessed.  See
  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/zisofs/> for the tools
  necessary to create such a filesystem.  Say Y here if you want to be
  able to read such compressed CD-ROMs.

UDF file system support (read-only)
CONFIG_UDF_FS
  This is the new file system used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs. Say Y if
  you intend to mount DVD discs or CDRW's written in packet mode, or
  if written to by other UDF utilities, such as DirectCD. This UDF
  file system support is read-only. If you want to write to UDF
  file systems on some media, you need to say Y to "UDF read-write
  support" below in addition. Please read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/udf.txt>.

  This file system support is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). The module is called udf.o. If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

UDF write support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_UDF_RW
  Say Y if you want to test write support for UDF file systems.
  Due to lack of support for writing to CDR/CDRW's, this option
  is only supported for hard discs, DVD-RAM, and loopback files.

DOS FAT fs support
CONFIG_FAT_FS
  If you want to use one of the FAT-based file systems (the MS-DOS,
  VFAT (Windows 95) and UMSDOS (used to run Linux on top of an
  ordinary DOS partition) file systems), then you must say Y or M here
  to include FAT support. You will then be able to mount partitions or
  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the
  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all
  other Unix files.

  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides
  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or
  M to at least one of "MSDOS fs support" or "VFAT fs support" in
  order to make use of it.

  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive
  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the
  mtools ("man mtools") program suite. You don't need to say Y here in
  order to do that.

  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a
  Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS
  file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program
  available for Unix and DOS ("man tar" or "info tar").

  It is now also becoming possible to read and write compressed FAT
  file systems; read <file:Documentation/filesystems/fat_cvf.txt> for
  details.

  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure,
  say Y.

  If you want to compile this as a module however ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called fat.o.  Note that if you compile the FAT
  support as a module, you cannot compile any of the FAT-based file
  systems into the kernel -- they will have to be modules as well.
  The file system of your root partition (the one containing the
  directory /) cannot be a module, so don't say M here if you intend
  to use UMSDOS as your root file system.

MSDOS fs support
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS
  This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your hard drive (unless
  they are compressed; to access compressed MSDOS partitions under
  Linux, you can either use the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in the
  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or try dmsdosfs in
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/>. If you
  intend to use dosemu with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y
  here) and MSDOS floppies. This means that file access becomes
  transparent, i.e. the MSDOS files look and behave just like all
  other Unix files.

  If you want to use UMSDOS, the Unix-like file system on top of a
  DOS file system, which allows you to run Linux from within a DOS
  partition without repartitioning, you'll have to say Y or M here.

  If you have Windows 95 or Windows NT installed on your MSDOS
  partitions, you should use the VFAT file system (say Y to "VFAT fs
  support" below), or you will not be able to see the long filenames
  generated by Windows 95 / Windows NT.

  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 7 KB. If unsure,
  answer Y. This will only work if you said Y to "DOS FAT fs support"
  as well. If you want to compile this as a module however ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called msdos.o.

VFAT (Windows-95) fs support
CONFIG_VFAT_FS
  This option provides support for normal Windows file systems with
  long filenames.  That includes non-compressed FAT-based file systems
  used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and the Unix
  programs from the mtools package.

  You cannot use the VFAT file system for your Linux root partition
  (the one containing the directory /); use UMSDOS instead if you
  want to run Linux from within a DOS partition (i.e. say Y to
  "Unix like fs on top of std MSDOS fs", below).

  The VFAT support enlarges your kernel by about 10 KB and it only
  works if you said Y to the "DOS FAT fs support" above.  Please read
  the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt> for details.  If
  unsure, say Y.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called vfat.o.

Unix-like file system on top of standard MSDOS fs
CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS
  Say Y here if you want to run Linux from within an existing DOS
  partition of your hard drive. The advantage of this is that you can
  get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies
  backing everything up and restoring afterwards) and hence you're
  able to quickly try out Linux or show it to your friends; the
  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
  that UMSDOS is somewhat slower than ext2fs.  Another use of UMSDOS
  is to write files with long unix filenames to MSDOS floppies; it
  also allows Unix-style soft-links and owner/permissions of files on
  MSDOS floppies.  You will need a program called umssync in order to
  make use of UMSDOS; read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/umsdos.txt>.

  To get utilities for initializing/checking UMSDOS file system, or
  latest patches and/or information, visit the UMSDOS home page at
  <http://www.voyager.hr/~mnalis/umsdos/>.

  This option enlarges your kernel by about 28 KB and it only works if
  you said Y to both "DOS FAT fs support" and "MSDOS fs support"
  above.  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called umsdos.o.  Note that the file system of your
  root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be a
  module, so saying M could be dangerous.  If unsure, say N.

/proc file system support
CONFIG_PROC_FS
  This is a virtual file system providing information about the status
  of the system. "Virtual" means that it doesn't take up any space on
  your hard disk: the files are created on the fly by the kernel when
  you try to access them. Also, you cannot read the files with older
  version of the program less: you need to use more or cat.

  It's totally cool; for example, "cat /proc/interrupts" gives
  information about what the different IRQs are used for at the moment
  (there is a small number of Interrupt ReQuest lines in your computer
  that are used by the attached devices to gain the CPU's attention --
  often a source of trouble if two devices are mistakenly configured
  to use the same IRQ). The program procinfo to display some
  information about your system gathered from the /proc file system.

  Before you can use the /proc file system, it has to be mounted,
  meaning it has to be given a location in the directory hierarchy.
  That location should be /proc. A command such as "mount -t proc proc
  /proc" or the equivalent line in /etc/fstab does the job.

  The /proc file system is explained in the file
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt> and on the proc(5) manpage
  ("man 5 proc").

  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 67 KB. Several
  programs depend on this, so everyone should say Y here.

Support for PReP Residual Data
CONFIG_PREP_RESIDUAL
  Some PReP systems have residual data passed to the kernel by the
  firmware.  This allows detection of memory size, devices present and
  other useful pieces of information.  Sometimes this information is
  not present or incorrect.

  Unless you expect to boot on a PReP system, there is no need to
  select Y.

PReP residual data available in /proc/residual
CONFIG_PROC_PREPRESIDUAL
  Enabling this option will create a /proc/residual file which allows
  you to get at the residual data on PReP systems.  You will need a tool
  (lsresidual) to parse it.  If you aren't on a PReP system, you don't
  want this.

/dev file system support
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
  This is support for devfs, a virtual file system (like /proc) which
  provides the file system interface to device drivers, normally found
  in /dev. Devfs does not depend on major and minor number
  allocations. Device drivers register entries in /dev which then
  appear automatically, which means that the system administrator does
  not have to create character and block special device files in the
  /dev directory using the mknod command (or MAKEDEV script) anymore.

  This is work in progress. If you want to use this, you *must* read
  the material in <file:Documentation/filesystems/devfs/>, especially
  the file README there.

  If unsure, say N.

Automatically mount devfs at boot time
CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT
  This option appears if you have CONFIG_DEVFS_FS enabled. Setting
  this to 'Y' will make the kernel automatically mount devfs onto /dev
  when the system is booted, before the init thread is started.
  You can override this with the "devfs=nomount" boot option.

  If unsure, say N.

Debug devfs
CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG
  If you say Y here, then the /dev file system code will generate
  debugging messages. See the file
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/devfs/boot-options> for more
  details.

  If unsure, say N.

NFS file system support
CONFIG_NFS_FS
  If you are connected to some other (usually local) Unix computer
  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or Ethernet) and want to mount files residing
  on that computer (the NFS server) using the Network File Sharing
  protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client can access
  the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were sitting on the
  client's hard disk. For this to work, the server must run the
  programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS file system
  support enabled in its kernel). NFS is explained in the Network
  Administrator's Guide, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>, on its man page: "man
  nfs", and in the NFS-HOWTO.

  A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
  the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.

  If you say Y here, you should have said Y to TCP/IP networking also.
  This option would enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.

  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called nfs.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you are configuring a diskless machine which will mount its root
  file system over NFS at boot time, say Y here and to "Kernel
  level IP autoconfiguration" above and to "Root file system on NFS"
  below. You cannot compile this driver as a module in this case.
  There are two packages designed for booting diskless machines over
  the net: netboot, available from
  <http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/netboot/>, and Etherboot,
  available from <http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/etherboot/>.

  If you don't know what all this is about, say N.

Provide NFSv3 client support
CONFIG_NFS_V3
  Say Y here if you want your NFS client to be able to speak the newer
  version 3 of the NFS protocol.

  If unsure, say N.

Allow direct I/O on files in NFS
CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO
  There are important applications whose performance or correctness
  depends on uncached access to file data.  Database clusters (multiple
  copies of the same instance running on separate hosts) implement their
  own cache coherency protocol that subsumes the NFS cache protocols.
  Applications that process datasets considerably larger than the client's
  memory do not always benefit from a local cache.  A streaming video
  server, for instance, has no need to cache the contents of a file.

  This option enables applications to perform direct I/O on files in NFS
  file systems using the O_DIRECT open() flag.  When O_DIRECT is set for
  files, their data is not cached in the system's page cache.  Direct
  read and write operations are aligned to block boundaries.  Data is
  moved to and from user-level application buffers directly.

  Unless your program is designed to use O_DIRECT properly, you are much
  better off allowing the NFS client to manage caching for you.  Misusing
  O_DIRECT can cause poor server performance or network storms.  This
  kernel build option defaults OFF to avoid exposing system administrators
  unwittingly to a potentially hazardous feature.

  If unsure, say N.

Root file system on NFS
CONFIG_ROOT_NFS
  If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) from some other computer over the
  net via NFS (presumably because your box doesn't have a hard disk),
  say Y. Read <file:Documentation/nfsroot.txt> for details. It is
  likely that in this case, you also want to say Y to "Kernel level IP
  autoconfiguration" so that your box can discover its network address
  at boot time.

  Most people say N here.

NFS server support
CONFIG_NFSD
  If you want your Linux box to act as an NFS *server*, so that other
  computers on your local network which support NFS can access certain
  directories on your box transparently, you have two options: you can
  use the self-contained user space program nfsd, in which case you
  should say N here, or you can say Y and use the kernel based NFS
  server. The advantage of the kernel based solution is that it is
  faster.

  In either case, you will need support software; the respective
  locations are given in the file <file:Documentation/Changes> in the
  NFS section.

  If you say Y here, you will get support for version 2 of the NFS
  protocol (NFSv2). If you also want NFSv3, say Y to the next question
  as well.

  Please read the NFS-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  The NFS server is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called nfsd.o.  If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure,
  say N.

Provide NFSv3 server support
CONFIG_NFSD_V3
  If you would like to include the NFSv3 server as well as the NFSv2
  server, say Y here.  If unsure, say Y.

Provide NFS over TCP server support EXPERIMENTAL
CONFIG_NFSD_TCP
  Enable NFS service over TCP connections.  This the officially
  still experimental, but seems to work well.

OS/2 HPFS file system support
CONFIG_HPFS_FS
  OS/2 is IBM's operating system for PC's, the same as Warp, and HPFS
  is the file system used for organizing files on OS/2 hard disk
  partitions. Say Y if you want to be able to read files from and
  write files to an OS/2 HPFS partition on your hard drive. OS/2
  floppies however are in regular MSDOS format, so you don't need this
  option in order to be able to read them. Read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/hpfs.txt>.

  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called hpfs.o.  If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure,
  say N.

NTFS file system support (read-only)
CONFIG_NTFS_FS
  NTFS is the file system of Microsoft Windows NT. Say Y if you want
  to get read access to files on NTFS partitions of your hard drive.
  The Linux NTFS driver supports most of the mount options of the VFAT
  driver, see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt>. Saying Y here
  will give you read-only access to NTFS partitions.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called ntfs.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

NTFS write support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_NTFS_RW
  If you say Y here, you will (maybe) be able to write to NTFS file
  systems as well as read from them. The read-write support in NTFS
  is far from being complete and is not well tested. If you say Y
  here, back up your NTFS volume first, since it will probably get
  damaged. Also, download the Linux-NTFS project distribution from
  Sourceforge at <http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/> and always run the
  included ntfsfix utility after writing to an NTFS partition from
  Linux to fix some of the damage done by the driver. You should run
  ntfsfix _after_ unmounting the partition in Linux but _before_
  rebooting into Windows. When Windows next boots, chkdsk will be
  run automatically to fix the remaining damage.
  Please note that write support is limited to Windows NT4 and
  earlier versions.

  If unsure, say N.

System V/Xenix/V7/Coherent file system support
CONFIG_SYSV_FS
  SCO, Xenix and Coherent are commercial Unix systems for Intel
  machines, and Version 7 was used on the DEC PDP-11. Saying Y
  here would allow you to read from their floppies and hard disk
  partitions.

  If you have floppies or hard disk partitions like that, it is likely
  that they contain binaries from those other Unix systems; in order
  to run these binaries, you will want to install linux-abi which is a
  a set of kernel modules that lets you run SCO, Xenix, Wyse,
  UnixWare, Dell Unix and System V programs under Linux.  It is
  available via FTP (user: ftp) from
  <ftp://ftp.openlinux.org/pub/people/hch/linux-abi/>).
  NOTE: that will work only for binaries from Intel-based systems;
  PDP ones will have to wait until somebody ports Linux to -11 ;-)

  If you only intend to mount files from some other Unix over the
  network using NFS, you don't need the System V file system support
  (but you need NFS file system support obviously).

  Note that this option is generally not needed for floppies, since a
  good portable way to transport files and directories between unixes
  (and even other operating systems) is given by the tar program ("man
  tar" or preferably "info tar").  Note also that this option has
  nothing whatsoever to do with the option "System V IPC". Read about
  the System V file system in
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/sysv-fs.txt>.
  Saying Y here will enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called sysv.o.

  If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.

Amiga FFS file system support
CONFIG_AFFS_FS
  The Fast File System (FFS) is the common file system used on hard
  disks by Amiga(tm) systems since AmigaOS Version 1.3 (34.20).  Say Y
  if you want to be able to read and write files from and to an Amiga
  FFS partition on your hard drive.  Amiga floppies however cannot be
  read with this driver due to an incompatibility of the floppy
  controller used in an Amiga and the standard floppy controller in
  PCs and workstations. Read <file:Documentation/filesystems/affs.txt>
  and <file:fs/affs/Changes>.

  With this driver you can also mount disk files used by Bernd
  Schmidt's Un*X Amiga Emulator
  (<http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/>).
  If you want to do this, you will also need to say Y or M to "Loop
  device support", above.

  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called affs.o.  If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure,
  say N.

Apple HFS file system support
CONFIG_HFS_FS
  If you say Y here, you will be able to mount Macintosh-formatted
  floppy disks and hard drive partitions with full read-write access.
  Please read <file:fs/hfs/HFS.txt> to learn about the available mount
  options.

  This file system support is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). The module is called hfs.o.  If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Apple HFS+ (Extended HFS) file system support
CONFIG_HFSPLUS_FS
  If you say Y here, you will be able to mount extended format
  Macintosh-formatted hard drive partitions with full read-write access.

  This file system is often called HFS+ and was introduced with
  MacOS 8. It includes all Mac specific filesystem data such as
  data forks and creator codes, but it also has several UNIX
  style features such as file ownership and permissions.

  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called hfsplus.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

ROM file system support
CONFIG_ROMFS_FS
  This is a very small read-only file system mainly intended for
  initial ram disks of installation disks, but it could be used for
  other read-only media as well.  Read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/romfs.txt> for details.

  This file system support is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). The module is called romfs.o.  If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  Note that the file system of your
  root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be a
  module.

  If you don't know whether you need it, then you don't need it:
  answer N.

QNX4 file system support (read only)
CONFIG_QNX4FS_FS
  This is the file system used by the real-time operating systems
  QNX 4 and QNX 6 (the latter is also called QNX RTP).
  Further information is available at <http://www.qnx.com/>.
  Say Y if you intend to mount QNX hard disks or floppies.
  Unless you say Y to "QNX4FS read-write support" below, you will
  only be able to read these file systems.

  This file system support is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). The module is called qnx4.o. If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you don't know whether you need it, then you don't need it:
  answer N.

QNX4FS write support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_QNX4FS_RW
  Say Y if you want to test write support for QNX4 file systems.

  It's currently broken, so for now:
  answer N.

Kernel automounter support
CONFIG_AUTOFS_FS
  The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file systems
  on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce
  overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
  automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.

  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from the autofs
  package; you can find the location in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
  You also want to answer Y to "NFS file system support", below.

  If you want to use the newer version of the automounter with more
  features, say N here and say Y to "Kernel automounter v4 support",
  below.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called autofs.o.

  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network, you
  probably do not need an automounter, and can say N here.

Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3)
CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
  The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file systems
  on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce
  overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
  automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.

  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from
  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/testing-v4/>; you also
  want to answer Y to "NFS file system support", below.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called autofs4.o.  You will need to add "alias autofs
  autofs4" to your modules configuration file.

  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network or
  don't have a laptop which needs to dynamically reconfigure to the
  local network, you probably do not need an automounter, and can say
  N here.

EFS file system support (read-only)
CONFIG_EFS_FS
  EFS is an older file system used for non-ISO9660 CD-ROMs and hard
  disk partitions by SGI's IRIX operating system (IRIX 6.0 and newer
  uses the XFS file system for hard disk partitions however).

  This implementation only offers read-only access. If you don't know
  what all this is about, it's safe to say N. For more information
  about EFS see its home page at <http://aeschi.ch.eu.org/efs/>.

  If you want to compile the EFS file system support as a module ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called efs.o.

Journalling Flash File System (JFFS) support
CONFIG_JFFS_FS
  JFFS is the Journalling Flash File System developed by Axis
  Communications in Sweden, aimed at providing a crash/powerdown-safe
  file system for disk-less embedded devices. Further information is
  available at (<http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/>).

JFFS debugging verbosity (0 = quiet, 3 = noisy)
CONFIG_JFFS_FS_VERBOSE
  Determines the verbosity level of the JFFS debugging messages.

Journalling Flash File System v2 (JFFS2) support
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS
  JFFS2 is the second generation of the Journalling Flash File System
  for use on diskless embedded devices. It provides improved wear
  levelling, compression and support for hard links. You cannot use
  this on normal block devices, only on 'MTD' devices.

  Further information should be made available soon at
  <http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/>.

JFFS2 debugging verbosity (0 = quiet, 2 = noisy)
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_DEBUG
  This controls the amount of debugging messages produced by the JFFS2
  code. Set it to zero for use in production systems. For evaluation,
  testing and debugging, it's advisable to set it to one. This will
  enable a few assertions and will print debugging messages at the
  KERN_DEBUG loglevel, where they won't normally be visible. Level 2
  is unlikely to be useful - it enables extra debugging in certain
  areas which at one point needed debugging, but when the bugs were
  located and fixed, the detailed messages were relegated to level 2.

  If reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of the
  messages at debug level 1 while the misbehaviour was occurring.

JFFS stats available in /proc filesystem
CONFIG_JFFS_PROC_FS
  Enabling this option will cause statistics from mounted JFFS file systems
  to be made available to the user in the /proc/fs/jffs/ directory.

UFS file system support (read-only)
CONFIG_UFS_FS
  BSD and derivate versions of Unix (such as SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
  OpenBSD and NeXTstep) use a file system called UFS. Some System V
  Unixes can create and mount hard disk partitions and diskettes using
  this file system as well. Saying Y here will allow you to read from
  these partitions; if you also want to write to them, say Y to the
  experimental "UFS file system write support", below. Please read the
  file <file:Documentation/filesystems/ufs.txt> for more information.

  If you only intend to mount files from some other Unix over the
  network using NFS, you don't need the UFS file system support (but
  you need NFS file system support obviously).

  Note that this option is generally not needed for floppies, since a
  good portable way to transport files and directories between unixes
  (and even other operating systems) is given by the tar program ("man
  tar" or preferably "info tar").

  When accessing NeXTstep files, you may need to convert them from the
  NeXT character set to the Latin1 character set; use the program
  recode ("info recode") for this purpose.

  If you want to compile the UFS file system support as a module ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called ufs.o.

  If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.

UFS file system write support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE
  Say Y here if you want to try writing to UFS partitions. This is
  experimental, so you should back up your UFS partitions beforehand.

XFS filesystem support
CONFIG_XFS_FS
  XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
  on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
  support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
  variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
  Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
  and scalability.

  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>
  for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
  with the IRIX version of XFS.

  If you want to compile this file system as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called xfs.o.  Be aware, however, that if the file
  system of your root partition is compiled as a module, you'll need
  to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) to boot.

Quota support
CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA
  If you say Y here, you will be able to set limits for disk usage on
  a per user and/or per group basis under XFS.  XFS considers quota
  information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide a
  higher level guarantee of consistency.  The on-disk data format for
  quota is also compatible with the IRIX version of XFS, allowing a
  filesystem to be migrated between Linux and IRIX without any need
  for conversion.

  If unsure, say N.  More comprehensive documentation can be found in
  README.quota in the xfsprogs package.  XFS quota can be used either
  with or without the generic quota support enabled (CONFIG_QUOTA) -
  they are completely independent subsystems.

Realtime support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_XFS_RT
  If you say Y here you will be able to mount and use XFS filesystems
  which contain a realtime subvolume. The realtime subvolume is a
  separate area of disk space where only file data is stored. The
  realtime subvolume is designed to provide very deterministic
  data rates suitable for media streaming applications.

  See the xfs man page in section 5 for a bit more information.

  This feature is unsupported at this time, is not yet fully
  functional, and may cause serious problems.

  If unsure, say N.

Tracing support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_XFS_TRACE
  Say Y here to get an XFS build with activity tracing enabled.
  Enabling this option will attach historical information to XFS
  inodes, pagebufs, certain locks, the log, the IO path, and a
  few other key areas within XFS.  These traces can be examined
  using a kernel debugger.

  Note that for the pagebuf traces, you will also have to enable
  the sysctl in /proc/sys/vm/pagebuf/debug for this to work.

  Say N unless you are an XFS developer.

Debugging support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG
  Say Y here to get an XFS build with many debugging features,
  including ASSERT checks, function wrappers around macros,
  and extra sanity-checking functions in various code paths.

  Note that the resulting code will be HUGE and SLOW, and probably
  not useful unless you are debugging a particular problem.

  Say N unless you are an XFS developer, or play one on TV.

Advanced partition selection
CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned under an operating system running on a different
  architecture than your Linux system.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about foreign partitioning schemes.

  If unsure, say N.

Acorn partition support
CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION
  Support hard disks partitioned under Acorn operating systems.

Native filecore partition support
CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION_ADFS
  The Acorn Disc Filing System is the standard file system of the
  RiscOS operating system which runs on Acorn's ARM-based Risc PC
  systems and the Acorn Archimedes range of machines.  If you say
  `Y' here, Linux will support disk partitions created under ADFS.

PowerTec partition support
CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION_POWERTEC
  Support reading partition tables created on Acorn machines using
  the PowerTec SCSI drive.

RISCiX partition support
CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION_RISCIX
  Once upon a time, there was a native Unix port for the Acorn series
  of machines called RISCiX.  If you say 'Y' here, Linux will be able
  to read disks partitioned under RISCiX.

ICS partition support
CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION_ICS
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned using the ICS interface on Acorn machines.

Alpha OSF partition support
CONFIG_OSF_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned on an Alpha machine.

Macintosh partition map support
CONFIG_MAC_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned on a Macintosh.

Windows Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned using Windows 2000's or XP's Logical Disk Manager.
  They are also known as "Dynamic Disks".

  Windows 2000 introduced the concept of Dynamic Disks to get around
  the limitations of the PC's partitioning scheme.  The Logical Disk
  Manager allows the user to repartition a disk and create spanned,
  mirrored, striped or RAID volumes, all without the need for
  rebooting.

  Normal partitions are now called Basic Disks under Windows 2000 and
  XP.

  Technical documentation to accompany this driver is available from:
  <http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/ldm/>.

  If unsure, say N.

Windows LDM extra logging
CONFIG_LDM_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you would like LDM to log verbosely.  This could be
  helpful if the driver doesn't work as expected and you'd like to
  report a bug.

  If unsure, say N.

PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned on an x86 PC (not necessarily by DOS).

Amiga partition table support
CONFIG_AMIGA_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned under AmigaOS.

Atari partition table support
CONFIG_ATARI_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned under the Atari OS.

BSD disklabel (FreeBSD partition tables) support
CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL
  FreeBSD uses its own hard disk partition scheme on your PC. It
  requires only one entry in the primary partition table of your disk
  and manages it similarly to DOS extended partitions, putting in its
  first sector a new partition table in BSD disklabel format. Saying Y
  here allows you to read these disklabels and further mount FreeBSD
  partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS
  file system support", above. If you don't know what all this is
  about, say N.

Minix subpartition support
CONFIG_MINIX_SUBPARTITION
  Minix 2.0.0/2.0.2 subpartition table support for Linux.
  Say Y here if you want to mount and use Minix 2.0.0/2.0.2
  subpartitions.

Sun partition table support
CONFIG_SUN_PARTITION
  Like most systems, SunOS uses its own hard disk partition table
  format, incompatible with all others. Saying Y here allows you to
  read these partition tables and further mount SunOS partitions from
  within Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS file system support",
  above. This is mainly used to carry data from a SPARC under SunOS to
  your Linux box via a removable medium like magneto-optical or ZIP
  drives; note however that a good portable way to transport files and
  directories between unixes (and even other operating systems) is
  given by the tar program ("man tar" or preferably "info tar"). If
  you don't know what all this is about, say N.

Solaris (x86) partition table support
CONFIG_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION
  Like most systems, Solaris x86 uses its own hard disk partition
  table format, incompatible with all others. Saying Y here allows you
  to read these partition tables and further mount Solaris x86
  partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS
  file system support", above.

SGI partition support
CONFIG_SGI_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk
  partition table format used by SGI machines.

Intel EFI GUID partition support
CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which
  were partitioned using EFI GPT.  Presently only useful on the
  IA-64 platform.

Ultrix partition table support
CONFIG_ULTRIX_PARTITION
  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk
  partition table format used by DEC (now Compaq) Ultrix machines.
  Otherwise, say N.

IBM disk label and partition support
CONFIG_IBM_PARTITION
  You have to say Y here if you would like to be able to read volume 
  labels of IBM DASD disks. These can be ECKD DASD disks with 
  compatible disk layout (cdl) and standard Linux disk layout (ldl), 
  FBA DASD disks and CMS reserved minidisks.
  Otherwise, say N and you will not be able to access these disks.

ADFS file system support
CONFIG_ADFS_FS
  The Acorn Disc Filing System is the standard file system of the
  RiscOS operating system which runs on Acorn's ARM-based Risc PC
  systems and the Acorn Archimedes range of machines. If you say Y
  here, Linux will be able to read from ADFS partitions on hard drives
  and from ADFS-formatted floppy discs. If you also want to be able to
  write to those devices, say Y to "ADFS write support" below.

  The ADFS partition should be the first partition (i.e.,
  /dev/[hs]d?1) on each of your drives. Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/adfs.txt> for further details.

  This code is also available as a module called adfs.o ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

ADFS write support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_ADFS_FS_RW
  If you say Y here, you will be able to write to ADFS partitions on
  hard drives and ADFS-formatted floppy disks. This is experimental
  codes, so if you're unsure, say N.

JFS filesystem support
CONFIG_JFS_FS
  This is a port of IBM's Journalling Filesystem .  More information is
  available in the file Documentation/filesystems/jfs.txt.

  If you do not intend to use the JFS filesystem, say N.

JFS Debugging
CONFIG_JFS_DEBUG
  If you are experiencing any problems with the JFS filesystem, say
  Y here.  This will result in additional debugging messages to be
  written to the system log.  Under normal circumstances, this
  results in very little overhead.

JFS Statistics
CONFIG_JFS_STATISTICS
  Enabling this option will cause statistics from the JFS file system
  to be made available to the user in the /proc/fs/jfs/ directory.

/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs
CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS
  You should say Y here if you said Y to "Unix98 PTY support" above.
  You'll then get a virtual file system which can be mounted on
  /dev/pts with "mount -t devpts". This, together with the pseudo
  terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx, is used for pseudo terminal
  support as described in The Open Group's Unix98 standard: in order
  to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number
  of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the
  pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

  The GNU C library glibc 2.1 contains the requisite support for this
  mode of operation; you also need client programs that use the Unix98
  API. Please read <file:Documentation/Changes> for more information
  about the Unix98 pty devices.

  Note that the experimental "/dev file system support"
  (CONFIG_DEVFS_FS)  is a more general facility.

FreeVxFS file system support (VERITAS VxFS(TM) compatible)
CONFIG_VXFS_FS
  FreeVxFS is a file system driver that support the VERITAS VxFS(TM)
  file system format.  VERITAS VxFS(TM) is the standard file system
  of SCO UnixWare (and possibly others) and optionally available
  for Sunsoft Solaris, HP-UX and many other operating systems.
  Currently only readonly access is supported.

  NOTE: the file system type as used by mount(1), mount(2) and
        fstab(5) is 'vxfs' as it describes the file system format, not
        the actual driver.

  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called freevxfs.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If
  unsure, say N. 

UnixWare slices support
CONFIG_UNIXWARE_DISKLABEL
  Like some systems, UnixWare uses its own slice table inside a
  partition (VTOC - Virtual Table of Contents). Its format is
  incompatible with all other OSes. Saying Y here allows you to read
  VTOC and further mount UnixWare partitions read-only from within
  Linux if you have also said Y to "UFS file system support" or
  "System V and Coherent file system support", above.

  This is mainly used to carry data from a UnixWare box to your
  Linux box via a removable medium like magneto-optical, ZIP or
  removable IDE drives. Note, however, that a good portable way to
  transport files and directories between unixes (and even other
  operating systems) is given by the tar program ("man tar" or
  preferably "info tar").

  If you don't know what all this is about, say N.

SMB file system support (to mount Windows shares etc.)
CONFIG_SMB_FS
  SMB (Server Message Block) is the protocol Windows for Workgroups
  (WfW), Windows 95/98, Windows NT and OS/2 Lan Manager use to share
  files and printers over local networks.  Saying Y here allows you to
  mount their file systems (often called "shares" in this context) and
  access them just like any other Unix directory.  Currently, this
  works only if the Windows machines use TCP/IP as the underlying
  transport protocol, and not NetBEUI.  For details, read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt> and the SMB-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  Note: if you just want your box to act as an SMB *server* and make
  files and printing services available to Windows clients (which need
  to have a TCP/IP stack), you don't need to say Y here; you can use
  the program SAMBA (available from <ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/>)
  for that.

  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.

  If you want to compile the SMB support as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called smbfs.o.  Most people say N, however.

Use a default NLS
CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT
  Enabling this will make smbfs use nls translations by default. You
  need to specify the local charset (CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT) in the nls
  settings and you need to give the default nls for the SMB server as
  CONFIG_SMB_NLS_REMOTE.

  The nls settings can be changed at mount time, if your smbmount
  supports that, using the codepage and iocharset parameters.

  smbmount from samba 2.2.0 or later supports this.

Default Remote NLS Option
CONFIG_SMB_NLS_REMOTE
  This setting allows you to specify a default value for which
  codepage the server uses. If this field is left blank no
  translations will be done by default. The local codepage/charset
  default to CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.

  The nls settings can be changed at mount time, if your smbmount
  supports that, using the codepage and iocharset parameters.

  smbmount from samba 2.2.0 or later supports this.

Enable Unix Extensions
CONFIG_SMB_UNIX
  Enabling this will make smbfs use the CIFS Unix Extensions if
  supported by the server. These extensions allows use of unix user
  ids, permissions, file modes, symlinks, etc that normally do not
  work on smbfs.

  Samba 3.0 servers supports these extensions.

  If you don't know what all this is about, it is safe to say Y.

Coda file system support (advanced network fs)
CONFIG_CODA_FS
  Coda is an advanced network file system, similar to NFS in that it
  enables you to mount file systems of a remote server and access them
  with regular Unix commands as if they were sitting on your hard
  disk.  Coda has several advantages over NFS: support for
  disconnected operation (e.g. for laptops), read/write server
  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,
  persistent client caches and write back caching.

  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda
  *client*.  You will need user level code as well, both for the
  client and server.  Servers are currently user level, i.e. they need
  no kernel support.  Please read
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/coda.txt> and check out the Coda
  home page <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>.

  If you want to compile the coda client support as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called coda.o.

InterMezzo file system support (replicating fs)
CONFIG_INTERMEZZO_FS
  InterMezzo is a networked file system with disconnected operation
  and kernel level write back caching.  It is most often used for
  replicating potentially large trees or keeping laptop/desktop copies
  in sync.

  If you say Y or M your kernel or module will provide InterMezzo
  support.  You will also need a file server daemon, which you can get
  from <http://www.inter-mezzo.org/>.

NCP file system support (to mount NetWare volumes)
CONFIG_NCP_FS
  NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) is a protocol that runs over IPX and is
  used by Novell NetWare clients to talk to file servers.  It is to
  IPX what NFS is to TCP/IP, if that helps.  Saying Y here allows you
  to mount NetWare file server volumes and to access them just like
  any other Unix directory.  For details, please read the file
  <file:Documentation/filesystems/ncpfs.txt> in the kernel source and
  the IPX-HOWTO from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  You do not have to say Y here if you want your Linux box to act as a
  file *server* for Novell NetWare clients.

  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ncpfs.o.  Say N unless you are connected to a Novell
  network.

Packet signatures
CONFIG_NCPFS_PACKET_SIGNING
  NCP allows packets to be signed for stronger security. If you want
  security, say Y.  Normal users can leave it off.  To be able to use
  packet signing you must use ncpfs > 2.0.12.

Proprietary file locking
CONFIG_NCPFS_IOCTL_LOCKING
  Allows locking of records on remote volumes.  Say N unless you have
  special applications which are able to utilize this locking scheme.

Clear remove/delete inhibit when needed
CONFIG_NCPFS_STRONG
  Allows manipulation of files flagged as Delete or Rename Inhibit.
  To use this feature you must mount volumes with the ncpmount
  parameter "-s" (ncpfs-2.0.12 and newer).  Say Y unless you are not
  mounting volumes with -f 444.

Use NFS namespace if available
CONFIG_NCPFS_NFS_NS
  Allows you to utilize NFS namespace on NetWare servers.  It brings
  you case sensitive filenames.  Say Y.  You can disable it at
  mount-time with the `-N nfs' parameter of ncpmount.

Use LONG (OS/2) namespace if available
CONFIG_NCPFS_OS2_NS
  Allows you to utilize OS2/LONG namespace on NetWare servers.
  Filenames in this namespace are limited to 255 characters, they are
  case insensitive, and case in names is preserved.  Say Y.  You can
  disable it at mount time with the -N os2 parameter of ncpmount.

Lowercase DOS filenames on LONG namespace volume
CONFIG_NCPFS_SMALLDOS
  If you say Y here, every filename on a NetWare server volume using
  the OS2/LONG namespace and created under DOS or on a volume using
  DOS namespace will be converted to lowercase characters.
  Saying N here will give you these filenames in uppercase.

  This is only a cosmetic option since the OS2/LONG namespace is case
  insensitive. The only major reason for this option is backward
  compatibility when moving from DOS to OS2/LONG namespace support.
  Long filenames (created by Win95) will not be affected.

  This option does not solve the problem that filenames appear
  differently under Linux and under Windows, since Windows does an
  additional conversions on the client side. You can achieve similar
  effects by saying Y to "Allow using of Native Language Support"
  below.

Use Native Language Support
CONFIG_NCPFS_NLS
  Allows you to use codepages and I/O charsets for file name
  translation between the server file system and input/output. This
  may be useful, if you want to access the server with other operating
  systems, e.g. Windows 95. See also NLS for more Information.

  To select codepages and I/O charsets use ncpfs-2.2.0.13 or newer.

Symbolic links and mode permission bits
CONFIG_NCPFS_EXTRAS
  This enables the use of symbolic links and an execute permission
  bit on NCPFS. The file server need not have long name space or NFS
  name space loaded for these to work.

  To use the new attributes, it is recommended to use the flags
  '-f 600 -d 755' on the ncpmount command line.

Default NLS Option
CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT
  The default NLS used when mounting file system. Note, that this is
  the NLS used by your console, not the NLS used by a specific file
  system (if different) to store data (filenames) on a disk.
  Currently, the valid values are:
  big5, cp437, cp737, cp775, cp850, cp852, cp855, cp857, cp860, cp861,
  cp862, cp863, cp864, cp865, cp866, cp869, cp874, cp932, cp936,
  cp949, cp950, cp1250, cp1251, cp1255, euc-jp, euc-kr, gb2312, iso8859-1,
  iso8859-2, iso8859-3, iso8859-4, iso8859-5, iso8859-6, iso8859-7,
  iso8859-8, iso8859-9, iso8859-13, iso8859-14, iso8859-15,
  koi8-r, koi8-ru, koi8-u, sjis, tis-620, utf8.
  If you specify a wrong value, it will use the built-in NLS;
  compatible with iso8859-1.

  If unsure, specify it as "iso8859-1".

Codepage 437 (United States, Canada)
CONFIG_NLS_CODEPAGE_437

  correctly on the screen, you need to include the appropriate
  input/output character sets. Say Y here for the UTF-8 encoding of
  the Unicode/ISO9646 universal character set.

Virtual terminal
CONFIG_VT
  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
  or network connection.

  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
  shiny Linux system :-)

Support for console on virtual terminal
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE
  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

  If unsure, say Y.

STI console
CONFIG_STI_CONSOLE
  The STI console is the builtin display/keyboard on HP-PARISC
  machines.  Say Y here to build support for it into your kernel.
  The alternative is to use your primary serial port as a console.

Use MDIO for PHY configuration
CONFIG_USE_MDIO
  On some boards the hardware configuration of the ethernet PHY can be
  used without any software interaction over the MDIO interface, so
  all MII code can be omitted. Say N here if unsure or if you don't
  need link status reports.

860T FEC Ethernet
CONFIG_FEC_ENET
  Enable Ethernet support via the Fast Ethernet Controller (FCC) on
  the Motorola MPC8260.

Ethernet on FCC1
CONFIG_FCC1_ENET
  Use MPC8260 fast Ethernet controller 1 to drive Ethernet (default).

  Enable Ethernet support via the Motorola MPC8xx serial
  communications controller.

# Choice: scc_ethernet
Ethernet on SCC1
CONFIG_SCC1_ENET
  Use MPC8xx serial communications controller 1 to drive Ethernet
  (default).

Ethernet on SCC2
CONFIG_SCC2_ENET
  Use MPC8xx serial communications controller 2 to drive Ethernet.

Ethernet on SCC3
CONFIG_SCC3_ENET
  Use MPC8xx serial communications controller 3 to drive Ethernet.

Use Big CPM Ethernet Buffers
CONFIG_ENET_BIG_BUFFERS
  Allocate large buffers for MPC8xx Ethernet.  Increases throughput
  and decreases the likelihood of dropped packets, but costs memory.

Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support
CONFIG_ADB
  Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support is for support of devices which
  are connected to an ADB port.  ADB devices tend to have 4 pins.
  If you have an Apple Macintosh prior to the iMac, or a
  "Blue and White G3", you probably want to say Y here.  Otherwise
  say N.

Support for CUDA based PowerMacs
CONFIG_ADB_CUDA
  This provides support for CUDA based Power Macintosh systems.  This
  includes most OldWorld PowerMacs, the first generation iMacs, the
  Blue&White G3 and the Yikes G4 (PCI Graphics).  All later models
  should use CONFIG_ADB_PMU instead.

  If unsure say Y.

Support for PMU-based PowerMacs
CONFIG_ADB_PMU
  This provides support for PMU based Power Macintosh systems.  This
  includes all PowerBooks and all AGP-based machines.
  
  If unsure say Y.

Include MacIO ADB driver
CONFIG_ADB_MACIO
  Say Y here to include direct support for the ADB controller in the
  Hydra chip used on PowerPC Macintoshes of the CHRP type.  (The Hydra
  also includes a MESH II SCSI controller, DBDMA controller, VIA chip,
  OpenPIC controller and two RS422/Geoports.)

Support for ADB keyboard (old driver)
CONFIG_ADB_KEYBOARD
  This option allows you to use an ADB keyboard attached to your
  machine. Note that this disables any other (ie. PS/2) keyboard
  support, even if your machine is physically capable of using both at
  the same time.

  If you use an ADB keyboard (4 pin connector), say Y here.
  If you use a PS/2 keyboard (6 pin connector), say N here.

HIL keyboard support
CONFIG_HIL
  The "Human Interface Loop" is a older, 8-channel USB-like controller
  used in Hewlett Packard PA-RISC based machines.  There are a few
  cases where it is seen on PC/MAC architectures as well, usually also
  manufactured by HP.  This driver is based off MACH and BSD drivers,
  and implements support for a keyboard attached to the HIL port.
  Full support for the USB-like functions and non-keyboard channels of
  the HIL is not provided for in this driver.  There are vestiges of
  mouse support in the driver, but it is probably not working.  The
  necessary hardware documentation to fully support the HIL controller
  and interface it to the linux-input API is lacking.

  Enable this option if you intend to use a HIL keyboard.

HP System Device Controller support
CONFIG_HP_SDC
  This option enables supports for the the "System Device Controller",
  an i8042 carrying microcode to manage a few miscellanous devices
  on some Hewlett Packard systems.  The SDC itself contains a 10ms
  resolution timer/clock capable of delivering interrupts on periodic
  and one-shot basis.  The SDC may also be connected to a battery-backed
  real-time clock, a basic audio waveform generator, and an HP-HIL
  Master Link Controller serving up to seven input devices.

  By itself this option is rather useless, but enabling it will
  enable selection of drivers for the abovementioned devices.
  It is, however, incompatible with the old, reliable HIL keyboard
  driver, and the new HIL driver is experimental, so if you plan to
  use a HIL keyboard as your primary keyboard, you may wish to
  keep using that driver until the new HIL drivers have had more
  testing.

Include IOP (IIfx/Quadra 9x0) ADB driver
CONFIG_ADB_IOP
  The I/O Processor (IOP) is an Apple custom IC designed to provide
  intelligent support for I/O controllers.  It is described at
  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/dev68k/iopdesc.html> to enable direct
  support for it, say 'Y' here.

Mac II style Apple Desktop Bus support
CONFIG_ADB_MACII
  Say Y here if want your kernel to support Macintosh systems that use
  the Mac II style ADB.  This includes the II, IIx, IIcx, SE/30, IIci,

  floppy controller on the Macintosh IIfx and Quadra 900/950.

Macintosh NS8390 based Ethernet support
CONFIG_MAC8390
  If you want to include a driver to support Nubus or LC-PDS
  Ethernet cards using an NS8390 chipset or its equivalent, say Y
  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Macintosh CS89x0 based Ethernet support
CONFIG_MAC89x0
  Support for CS89x0 chipset based Ethernet cards.  If you have a
  Nubus or LC-PDS network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and
  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.  This module will
  be called mac89x0.o.

Macintosh onboard AMD 79C940 MACE based Ethernet support
CONFIG_MACMACE
  Support for the onboard AMD 79C940 MACE Ethernet controller used in
  the 660AV and 840AV Macintosh.  If you have one of these Macintoshes
  say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Macintosh SONIC based Ethernet support (onboard, NuBus, LC, CS)
CONFIG_MACSONIC
  Support for NatSemi SONIC based Ethernet devices.  This includes
  the onboard Ethernet in many Quadras as well as some LC-PDS,
  a few Nubus and all known Comm Slot Ethernet cards.  If you have
  one of these say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.  This module will
  be called macsonic.o.

Macintosh NCR5380 SCSI support
CONFIG_MAC_SCSI
  This is the NCR 5380 SCSI controller included on most of the 68030
  based Macintoshes.  If you have one of these say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Macintosh NCR53c9[46] SCSI support
CONFIG_SCSI_MAC_ESP
  This is the NCR 53c9x SCSI controller found on most of the 68040
  based Macintoshes.  If you have one of these say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mac_esp.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial support
CONFIG_SERIAL
  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
  work.)

  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  serial.o.
  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
  in the future.]

  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
  the X window system, try running gpm first.

  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

Support for console on serial port
CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
  to that serial port.

  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
  system console.

  If unsure, say N.

Support for serial port described by EFI HCDP table
CONFIG_SERIAL_HCDP
  If you wish to make the serial console port described by the EFI
  HCDP table available for use as serial console or general
  purpose port, say Y here. See
  <http://www.dig64.org/specifications/DIG64_HCDPv10a_01.pdf>.

Support for PowerMac serial ports
CONFIG_MAC_SERIAL
  If you have Macintosh style serial ports (8 pin mini-DIN), say Y
  here. If you also have regular serial ports and enable the driver
  for them, you can't currently use the serial console feature.

Comtrol Rocketport support
CONFIG_ROCKETPORT
  This is a driver for the Comtrol Rocketport cards which provide
  multiple serial ports. You would need something like this to connect
  more than two modems to your Linux box, for instance in order to
  become a dial-in server.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  rocket.o.

Digiboard Intelligent async support
CONFIG_DIGIEPCA
  This is a driver for Digi International's Xx, Xeve, and Xem series
  of cards which provide multiple serial ports. You would need
  something like this to connect more than two modems to your Linux
  box, for instance in order to become a dial-in server. This driver
  supports the original PC (ISA) boards as well as PCI, and EISA. If
  you have a card like this, say Y here and read the file
  <file:Documentation/digiepca.txt>.

  NOTE: There is another, separate driver for the Digiboard PC boards:
  "Digiboard PC/Xx Support" below. You should (and can) only select
  one of the two drivers.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called epca.o.

Digiboard PC/Xx Support
CONFIG_DIGI
  This is a driver for the Digiboard PC/Xe, PC/Xi, and PC/Xeve cards
  that give you many serial ports. You would need something like this
  to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for instance in
  order to become a dial-in server. If you have a card like that, say
  Y here and read the file <file:Documentation/digiboard.txt>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called pcxx.o.

SDL RISCom/8 card support
CONFIG_RISCOM8
  This is a driver for the SDL Communications RISCom/8 multiport card,
  which gives you many serial ports. You would need something like
  this to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for instance
  in order to become a dial-in server. If you have a card like that,
  say Y here and read the file <file:Documentation/riscom8.txt>.

  Also it's possible to say M here and compile this driver as kernel
  loadable module; the module will be called riscom8.o.

Computone IntelliPort Plus serial support
CONFIG_COMPUTONE
  This driver supports the entire family of Intelliport II/Plus
  controllers with the exception of the MicroChannel controllers and
  products previous to the Intelliport II. These are multiport cards,
  which give you many serial ports. You would need something like this
  to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for instance in
  order to become a dial-in server. If you have a card like that, say
  Y here and read <file:Documentation/computone.txt>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. You will get
  two modules called ip2.o and ip2main.o.

Specialix IO8+ card support
CONFIG_SPECIALIX
  This is a driver for the Specialix IO8+ multiport card (both the
  ISA and the PCI version) which gives you many serial ports. You
  would need something like this to connect more than two modems to
  your Linux box, for instance in order to become a dial-in server.

  If you have a card like that, say Y here and read the file
  <file:Documentation/specialix.txt>. Also it's possible to say M here
  and compile this driver as kernel loadable module which will be
  called specialix.o.

Specialix DTR/RTS pin is RTS
CONFIG_SPECIALIX_RTSCTS
  The Specialix IO8+ card can only support either RTS or DTR. If you
  say N here, the driver will use the pin as "DTR" when the tty is in
  software handshake mode.  If you say Y here or hardware handshake is
  on, it will always be RTS.  Read the file
  <file:Documentation/specialix.txt> for more information.

Specialix RIO system support
CONFIG_RIO
  This is a driver for the Specialix RIO, a smart serial card which
  drives an outboard box that can support up to 128 ports.  Product
  information is at <http://www.sphinxcst.co.uk/perle/multi.htm>.
  There are both ISA and PCI versions.

Support really old RIO/PCI cards
CONFIG_RIO_OLDPCI
  Older RIO PCI cards need some initialization-time configuration to
  determine the IRQ and some control addresses.  If you have a RIO and
  this doesn't seem to work, try setting this to Y.

Cyclades async mux support
CONFIG_CYCLADES
  This is a driver for a card that gives you many serial ports. You
  would need something like this to connect more than two modems to
  your Linux box, for instance in order to become a dial-in server.
  For information about the Cyclades-Z card, read
  <file:drivers/char/README.cycladesZ>.

  As of 1.3.9x kernels, this driver's minor numbers start at 0 instead
  of 32.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called cyclades.o.

  If you haven't heard about it, it's safe to say N.

Cyclades-Z interrupt mode operation
CONFIG_CYZ_INTR
  The Cyclades-Z family of multiport cards allows 2 (two) driver op
  modes: polling and interrupt. In polling mode, the driver will check
  the status of the Cyclades-Z ports every certain amount of time
  (which is called polling cycle and is configurable). In interrupt
  mode, it will use an interrupt line (IRQ) in order to check the
  status of the Cyclades-Z ports. The default op mode is polling. If
  unsure, say N.

Stallion multiport serial support
CONFIG_STALDRV
  Stallion cards give you many serial ports.  You would need something
  like this to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for
  instance in order to become a dial-in server.  If you say Y here,
  you will be asked for your specific card model in the next
  questions.  Make sure to read <file:Documentation/stallion.txt> in
  this case.  If you have never heard about all this, it's safe to
  say N.

Stallion EasyIO or EC8/32 support
CONFIG_STALLION
  If you have an EasyIO or EasyConnection 8/32 multiport Stallion
  card, then this is for you; say Y.  Make sure to read
  <file:Documentation/stallion.txt>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called stallion.o.

Stallion EC8/64, ONboard, Brumby support
CONFIG_ISTALLION
  If you have an EasyConnection 8/64, ONboard, Brumby or Stallion
  serial multiport card, say Y here. Make sure to read
  <file:Documentation/stallion.txt>.

  To compile it as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  istallion.o.

PDC software console support
CONFIG_PDC_CONSOLE
  Saying Y here will enable the software based PDC console to be
  used as the system console.  This is useful for machines in
  which the hardware based console has not been written yet.  The
  following steps must be competed to use the PDC console:

    1. create the device entry (mknod /dev/ttyB0 c 60 0)
    2. Edit the /etc/inittab to start a getty listening on /dev/ttyB0
    3. Add device ttyB0 to /etc/securetty (if you want to log on as
         root on this console.)
    4. Change the kernel command console parameter to: console=ttyB0

Microgate SyncLink adapter support
CONFIG_SYNCLINK
  Provides support for the SyncLink ISA and PCI multiprotocol serial
  adapters. These adapters support asynchronous and HDLC bit
  synchronous communication up to 10Mbps (PCI adapter).

  This driver can only be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called synclink.o.  If you want to do that, say M
  here.

CONFIG_SYNCLINKMP
  Enable support for the SyncLink Multiport (2 or 4 ports)
  serial adapter, running asynchronous and HDLC communications up
  to 2.048Mbps. Each ports is independently selectable for
  RS-232, V.35, RS-449, RS-530, and X.21

  This driver may be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called synclinkmp.o.  If you want to do that, say M
  here.

Synchronous HDLC line discipline support
CONFIG_N_HDLC
  Allows synchronous HDLC communications with tty device drivers that
  support synchronous HDLC such as the Microgate SyncLink adapter.

  This driver can only be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called n_hdlc.o. If you want to do that, say M
  here.

Specialix SX (and SI) card support
CONFIG_SX
  This is a driver for the SX and SI multiport serial cards.
  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sx.txt> for details.

  This driver can only be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sx.o. If you want to do that, say M here.

Hayes ESP serial port support
CONFIG_ESPSERIAL
  This is a driver which supports Hayes ESP serial ports.  Both single
  port cards and multiport cards are supported.  Make sure to read
  <file:Documentation/hayes-esp.txt>.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called esp.o.  If unsure, say N.

Moxa Intellio support
CONFIG_MOXA_INTELLIO
  Say Y here if you have a Moxa Intellio multiport serial card.

  This driver can also be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called moxa.o. If you want to do that, say M
  here.

Moxa SmartIO support
CONFIG_MOXA_SMARTIO
  Say Y here if you have a Moxa SmartIO multiport serial card.

  This driver can also be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mxser.o. If you want to do that, say M
  here.

Multi-Tech multiport card support
CONFIG_ISI
  This is a driver for the Multi-Tech cards which provide several
  serial ports.  The driver is experimental and can currently only be
  built as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want).  Please read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  isicom.o.

Unix98 PTY support
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS
  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
  and xterms.

  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to
  pseudo terminals. It's safe to say N.

Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
  The maximum number of Unix98 PTYs that can be used at any one time.
  The default is 256, and should be enough for desktop systems. Server
  machines which support incoming telnet/rlogin/ssh connections and/or
  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.

Parallel printer support
CONFIG_PRINTER
  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
  corresponding drivers into the kernel.  If you want to compile this
  driver as a module however ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.o.

  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

Support for console on line printer
CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE
  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you
  can make the kernel continue when this happens,
  but it'll lose the kernel messages.

  If unsure, say N.

Support for user-space parallel port device drivers
CONFIG_PPDEV
  Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
  is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
  port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
  IDs).

  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing
  or parallel port CD-ROM/disk support.

  This support is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  ppdev.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Cobalt Networks support
CONFIG_COBALT
  Support for Cobalt Networks x86-based servers.

Gen III (3000 series) system support
CONFIG_COBALT_GEN_III
  This option enables support for the 3000 series of Cobalt Networks
  systems. This includes the RaQ 3, RaQ 4, and Qube 3 product lines.

  This platform uses an AMD K6-2 processor, an ALI M1541/1533 chipset,
  an optional NCR 53c875 SCSI controller, and two Intel 82559ER or
  National Semiconductor DP83815 NICs.

  Getting this option wrong will likely result in a kernel that does
  not boot. Selecting support for more than 1 system series will add
  bloat to your kernel, but will not cause anything bad to happen.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks System, but aren't sure what kind,
  say Y here.

Gen V (5000 series) system support
CONFIG_COBALT_GEN_V
  This option enables support for the 5000 series of Cobalt Networks
  systems. This includes the RaQ XTR product line.

  This platform uses Intel Pentium III Coppermine FCPGA CPUs, the
  ServerWorks LE chipset (with registered ECC DIMMs only!), two
  HighPoint HPT370 IDE controllers, and two National Semiconductor
  DP83815 NICs.

  Getting this option wrong will likely result in a kernel that does
  not boot. Selecting support for more than 1 system series will add
  bloat to your kernel, but will not cause anything bad to happen.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks System, but aren't sure what kind,
  say Y here.

Create legacy /proc files
CONFIG_COBALT_OLDPROC
  This option forces some Cobalt Networks drivers to support legacy
  files in /proc.  Older versions of these drivers exported files
  directly in /proc, as opposed to the newer /proc/cobalt.  If you say
  N to this option, the old filenames will no longer be exported.
  Regardless of your selection here, files in /proc/cobalt will be
  exported.  Of course, you have to include support for /proc fs, too.

  It is safe to say Y here.

Front panel LCD support
CONFIG_COBALT_LCD
  This enables support for the Cobalt Networks front panel.  This is
  for the LCD panel and buttons.  The primary method for connection is
  via the parallel port (IO base 0x370), but newer systems use an
  I2C bus.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here.

Software controlled LED support
CONFIG_COBALT_LED
  This enables support for the software-controlled LEDs on Cobalt
  Networks systems.  This includes the fault light and front panel
  LEDs on the RaQ XTR, the lightbar on the Qube 3, and others.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here.

Silicon serial number support
CONFIG_COBALT_SERNUM
  This enables support for the on-board serial number on Cobalt
  Networks systems.  This is a universally-unique 64-bit serial
  number.  Some systems use a Dallas DS2401 chip, others have an I2C
  based EEPROM.

  If you select Y here, the files /proc/cobalt/hostid and
  /proc/cobalt/serialnumber will be created.  The hostid file contains
  a 32 bit integer generated from the serial number, in binary form.
  The serialnumber file contains the hexadecimal representation of the
  serial number, in ASCII.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here.

Chipset watchdog timer support
CONFIG_COBALT_WDT
  This enables support for the watchdog timer built into Cobalt
  chipsets.  The timer wakes up periodically, to make find out if
  system has hung, or disabled interrupts too long.  The result of
  detecting a hang is a hard reboot.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here.

Thermal sensor support
CONFIG_COBALT_THERMAL
  This enables support for the thermal sensor(s) built into Cobalt
  Networks systems.  This driver exports /proc/cobalt/thermal_sensors.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here.

Fan tachometer support
CONFIG_COBALT_FANS
  This enables support for the fan tachometers built into some Cobalt
  Networks systems.  This driver exports /proc/cobalt/faninfo.  Some
  Cobalt software depends on this feature, and enabling it does not
  cause any risks.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here, unless
  you are absolutely sure.

Disk drive ruler support
CONFIG_COBALT_RULER
  This enables support for the cobalt hard drive ruler, found on some
  Cobalt systems, including the RaQ XTR.  This is the device that
  enables swapping of drives.  It is not needed for basic disk
  operation. Enabling this on a system with no ruler will have no
  adverse effects.

  If you have a Cobalt Networks system, you should say Y here,
  unless you are absolutely sure.

IT8172G Sound
CONFIG_SOUND_IT8172
  Say Y here to support the on-board sound generator on the Integrated
  Technology Express, Inc. ITE8172 SBC.  Vendor page at
  <http://www.ite.com.tw/ia/brief_it8172bsp.htm>; picture of the
  board at <http://www.mvista.com/partners/semiconductor/ite.html>.

I2C support
CONFIG_I2C
  I2C (pronounce: I-square-C) is a slow serial bus protocol used in
  many micro controller applications and developed by Philips.  SMBus,
  or System Management Bus is a subset of the I2C protocol.  More
  information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/i2c/>,
  especially in the file called "summary" there.

  Both I2C and SMBus are supported here. You will need this for
  hardware sensors support, and also for Video For Linux support.
  Specifically, if you want to use a BT848 based frame grabber/overlay
  boards under Linux, say Y here and also to "I2C bit-banging
  interfaces", below.

  This I2C support is also available as a module.  If you want to
  compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called i2c-core.o.

UltraSPARC-III bootbus i2c controller driver
CONFIG_BBC_I2C
  The BBC devices on the UltraSPARC III have two I2C controllers.  The
  first I2C controller connects mainly to configuration PROMs (NVRAM,
  CPU configuration, DIMM types, etc.).  The second I2C controller
  connects to environmental control devices such as fans and
  temperature sensors.  The second controller also connects to the
  smartcard reader, if present.  Say Y to enable support for these.

I2C bit-banging interfaces
CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT
  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called bit-banging
  adapters.  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class

  Note that if you want support for different parallel port devices,
  life will be much easier if you compile them all as modules.

ELV adapter
CONFIG_I2C_ELV
  This supports parallel-port I2C adapters called ELV.  Say Y if you
  own such an adapter.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile

  The module will be called i2c-elektor.o.

ITE I2C Algorithm
CONFIG_ITE_I2C_ALGO
  This supports the use the ITE8172 I2C interface found on some MIPS
  systems. Say Y if you have one of these. You should also say Y for
  the ITE I2C peripheral driver support below.

  This support is also available as a module. If you want to compile
  it as a modules, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called i2c-algo-ite.o.

ITE I2C Adapter
CONFIG_ITE_I2C_ADAP

  systems. Say Y if you have one of these. You should also say Y for
  the ITE I2C driver algorithm support above.

  This support is also available as a module. If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called i2c-adap-ite.o.

SiByte I2C Algorithm
CONFIG_I2C_ALGO_SIBYTE
  Supports the SiByte SOC on-chip I2C interfaces (2 channels).

MAX1617 Temperature Sensor
CONFIG_I2C_MAX1617
  This builds a simple polling driver for the Maxim 1617 temperature
  sensor.  Currently the device is only supported on a SiByte I2C
  adapter, and the driver prints status updates to the system log.

SGI I2C Algorithm
CONFIG_I2C_ALGO_SGI
  Supports the SGI interfaces like the ones found on SGI Indy VINO
  or SGI O2 MACE.

I2C device interface
CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV
  Say Y here to use i2c-* device files, usually found in the /dev
  directory on your system.  They make it possible to have user-space
  programs use the I2C bus.  Information on how to do this is
  contained in the file <file:Documentation/i2c/dev-interface>.

  This code is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  The module will be called i2c-dev.o.

  chip on recent Apple machines.  Say Y if you have such a machine.

  This driver is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.
  The module will be called i2c-keywest.o.

Bus Mouse Support
CONFIG_BUSMOUSE
  Say Y here if your machine has a bus mouse as opposed to a serial
  mouse. Most people have a regular serial MouseSystem or
  Microsoft mouse (made by Logitech) that plugs into a COM port
  (rectangular with 9 or 25 pins). These people say N here. 

  If you have a laptop, you either have to check the documentation or
  experiment a bit to find out whether the trackball is a serial mouse
  or not; it's best to say Y here for you.

  This is the generic bus mouse driver code. If you have a bus mouse,
  you will have to say Y here and also to the specific driver for your
  mouse below.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called busmouse.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Mouse Support (not serial and bus mice)
CONFIG_MOUSE
  This is for machines with a mouse which is neither a serial nor a
  bus mouse. Examples are PS/2 mice (such as the track balls on some
  laptops) and some digitizer pads. Most people have a regular serial
  MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse (made by Logitech) that plugs into a
  COM port (rectangular with 9 or 25 pins). These people say N here.
  If you have something else, read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. This HOWTO contains
  information about all non-serial mice, not just bus mice.

  If you have a laptop, you either have to check the documentation or
  experiment a bit to find out whether the trackball is a serial mouse
  or not; it's best to say Y here for you.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about non-serial mice. If unsure, say Y.

Logitech busmouse support
CONFIG_LOGIBUSMOUSE
  Logitech mouse connected to a proprietary interface card.  It's
  generally a round connector with 9 pins. Note that the newer mice
  made by Logitech don't use the Logitech protocol anymore; for those,
  you don't need this option.  You want to read the Busmouse-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called busmouse.o.  If you are unsure, say N and read the
  HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have.

PS/2 mouse (aka "auxiliary device") support
CONFIG_PSMOUSE
  The PS/2 mouse connects to a special mouse port that looks much like
  the keyboard port (small circular connector with 6 pins). This way,
  the mouse does not use any serial ports. This port can also be used
  for other input devices like light pens, tablets, keypads. Compaq,
  AST and IBM all use this as their mouse port on currently shipping
  machines. The trackballs of some laptops are PS/2 mice also. In
  particular, the C&T 82C710 mouse on TI Travelmates is a PS/2 mouse.

  Although PS/2 mice are not technically bus mice, they are explained
  in detail in the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  When using a PS/2 mouse, you can get problems if you want to use the
  mouse both on the Linux console and under X. Using the "-R" option
  of the Linux mouse managing program gpm (available from
  <ftp://gnu.systemy.it/pub/gpm/>) solves this problem, or you can get
  the "mconv2" utility from <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/mouse/>.

C&T 82C710 mouse port support (as on TI Travelmate)
CONFIG_82C710_MOUSE
  This is a certain kind of PS/2 mouse used on the TI Travelmate. If
  you are unsure, try first to say N here and come back if the mouse
  doesn't work. Read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

PC110 digitizer pad support
CONFIG_PC110_PAD
  This drives the digitizer pad on the IBM PC110 palmtop.  It can turn
  the digitizer pad into a PS/2 mouse emulation with tap gestures or
  into an absolute pad.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called pc110pad.o.

Microsoft busmouse support
CONFIG_MS_BUSMOUSE
  These animals (also called Inport mice) are connected to an
  expansion board using a round connector with 9 pins. If this is what
  you have, say Y and read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you are unsure, say N and read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will
  tell you what you have. Also be aware that several vendors talk
  about 'Microsoft busmouse' and actually mean PS/2 busmouse -- so
  count the pins on the connector.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called msbusmouse.o.

Apple Desktop Bus mouse support
CONFIG_ADBMOUSE
  Say Y here if you have this type of bus mouse (4 pin connector) as
  is common on Macintoshes.  You may want to read the Busmouse-HOWTO,
  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called adbmouse.o.

ATIXL busmouse support
CONFIG_ATIXL_BUSMOUSE
  This is a rare type of busmouse that is connected to the back of an
  ATI video card.  Say Y if you have one of those. Note however that
  most mice by ATI are actually Microsoft busmice; you should say Y to
  "Microsoft busmouse support" above if you have one of those.  Read
  the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called atixlmouse.o.

  If you are unsure, say N and read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will
  tell you what you have.

QIC-02 tape support
CONFIG_QIC02_TAPE
  If you have a non-SCSI tape drive like that, say Y. Or, if you want
  to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  tpqic02.o.

iSeries Virtual Tape Support
CONFIG_VIOTAPE
  If you are running Linux on an iSeries system and you want Linux
  to read and/or write a tape drive owned by OS/400, say Y here.

Do you want runtime configuration for QIC-02
CONFIG_QIC02_DYNCONF
  You can either configure this driver once and for all by editing a
  header file (<file:include/linux/tpqic02.h>), in which case you
  should say N, or you can fetch a program via anonymous FTP which is
  able to configure this driver during runtime.  The program to do
  this is called 'qic02conf' and it is part of the
  tpqic02-support-X.Y.tar.gz support package.

  If you want to use the qic02conf program, say Y.

Floppy tape drive (QIC-80/40/3010/3020/TR-1/TR-2/TR-3) support
CONFIG_FTAPE
  If you have a tape drive that is connected to your floppy
  controller, say Y here.

  Some tape drives (like the Seagate "Tape Store 3200" or the Iomega
  "Ditto 3200" or the Exabyte "Eagle TR-3") come with a "high speed"
  controller of their own. These drives (and their companion
  controllers) are also supported if you say Y here.

  If you have a special controller (such as the CMS FC-10, FC-20,
  Mountain Mach-II, or any controller that is based on the Intel 82078
  FDC like the high speed controllers by Seagate and Exabyte and
  Iomega's "Ditto Dash") you must configure it by selecting the
  appropriate entries from the "Floppy tape controllers" sub-menu
  below and possibly modify the default values for the IRQ and DMA
  channel and the IO base in ftape's configuration menu.

  If you want to use your floppy tape drive on a PCI-bus based system,
  please read the file <file:drivers/char/ftape/README.PCI>.

  The ftape kernel driver is also available as a runtime loadable
  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The
  module will be called ftape.o.

  Note that the Ftape-HOWTO is out of date (sorry) and documents the
  older version 2.08 of this software but still contains useful
  information.  There is a web page with more recent documentation at
  <http://www.instmath.rwth-aachen.de/~heine/ftape/>.  This page
  always contains the latest release of the ftape driver and useful
  information (backup software, ftape related patches and
  documentation, FAQ).  Note that the file system interface has
  changed quite a bit compared to previous versions of ftape.  Please
  read <file:Documentation/ftape.txt>.

VFS interface for ftape
CONFIG_ZFTAPE
  Normally, you want to say Y or M. DON'T say N here or you
  WON'T BE ABLE TO USE YOUR FLOPPY TAPE DRIVE.

  The ftape module itself no longer contains the routines necessary
  to interface with the kernel VFS layer (i.e. to actually write data
  to and read data from the tape drive).  Instead the file system
  interface (i.e. the hardware independent part of the driver) has
  been moved to a separate module.

  If you say M zftape will be compiled as a runtime loadable
  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want).  In this case you should read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  zftape.o.

  Regardless of whether you say Y or M here, an additional runtime
  loadable module called `zft-compressor.o' which contains code to
  support user transparent on-the-fly compression based on Ross
  William's lzrw3 algorithm will be produced.  If you have enabled the
  kernel module loader (i.e. have said Y to "Kernel module loader
  support", above) then `zft-compressor.o' will be loaded
  automatically by zftape when needed.

  Despite its name, zftape does NOT use compression by default.  The
  file <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> contains a short description of
  the most important changes in the file system interface compared to
  previous versions of ftape.  The ftape home page
  <http://www.instmath.rwth-aachen.de/~heine/ftape/> contains
  further information.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: zftape can read archives created by previous
  versions of ftape and provide file mark support (i.e. fast skipping
  between tape archives) but previous version of ftape will lack file
  mark support when reading archives produced by zftape.

Default block size for zftape
CONFIG_ZFT_DFLT_BLK_SZ
  If unsure leave this at its default value, i.e. 10240. Note that
  you specify only the default block size here. The block size can be
  changed at run time using the MTSETBLK tape operation with the
  MTIOCTOP ioctl (i.e. with "mt -f /dev/qft0 setblk #BLKSZ" from the
  shell command line).

  The probably most striking difference between zftape and previous
  versions of ftape is the fact that all data must be written or read
  in multiples of a fixed block size. The block size defaults to
  10240 which is what GNU tar uses. The values for the block size
  should be either 1 or multiples of 1024 up to a maximum value of
  63488 (i.e. 62 K). If you specify `1' then zftape's builtin
  compression will be disabled.

  Reasonable values are `10240' (GNU tar's default block size),
  `5120' (afio's default block size), `32768' (default block size some
  backup programs assume for SCSI tape drives) or `1' (no restriction
  on block size, but disables builtin compression).

Number of DMA buffers
CONFIG_FT_NR_BUFFERS
  Please leave this at `3' unless you REALLY know what you are doing.
  It is not necessary to change this value. Values below 3 make the
  proper use of ftape impossible, values greater than 3 are a waste of
  memory. You can change the amount of DMA memory used by ftape at
  runtime with "mt -f /dev/qft0 setdrvbuffer #NUMBUFFERS". Each buffer
  wastes 32 KB of memory. Please note that this memory cannot be
  swapped out.

Enable procfs status report (+2kb)
CONFIG_FT_PROC_FS
  Optional. Saying Y will result in creation of a directory
  `/proc/ftape' under the /proc file system. The files can be viewed
  with your favorite pager (i.e. use "more /proc/ftape/history" or
  "less /proc/ftape/history" or simply "cat /proc/ftape/history"). The
  file will contain some status information about the inserted
  cartridge, the kernel driver, your tape drive, the floppy disk
  controller and the error history for the most recent use of the
  kernel driver. Saying Y will enlarge the size of the ftape driver
  by approximately 2 KB.

  WARNING: When compiling ftape as a module (i.e. saying M to "Floppy
  tape drive") it is dangerous to use ftape's /proc file system
  interface. Accessing `/proc/ftape' while the module is unloaded will
  result in a kernel Oops. This cannot be fixed from inside ftape.

# Choice: ftdebug
Controlling the amount of debugging output of ftape
CONFIG_FT_NORMAL_DEBUG
  This option controls the amount of debugging output the ftape driver
  is ABLE to produce; it does not increase or diminish the debugging
  level itself. If unsure, leave this at its default setting,
  i.e. choose "Normal".

  Ftape can print lots of debugging messages to the system console
  resp. kernel log files. Reducing the amount of possible debugging
  output reduces the size of the kernel module by some KB, so it might
  be a good idea to use "None" for emergency boot floppies.

  If you want to save memory then the following strategy is
  recommended: leave this option at its default setting "Normal" until
  you know that the driver works as expected, afterwards reconfigure
  the kernel, this time specifying "Reduced" or "None" and recompile
  and install the kernel as usual. Note that choosing "Excessive"
  debugging output does not increase the amount of debugging output
  printed to the console but only makes it possible to produce
  "Excessive" debugging output.

  Please read <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> for a short description
  how to control the amount of debugging output.

Excessive
CONFIG_FT_FULL_DEBUG
  Extremely verbose output for driver debugging purposes.

Reduced
CONFIG_FT_NO_TRACE
  Reduced tape driver debugging output.

None
CONFIG_FT_NO_TRACE_AT_ALL
  Suppress all debugging output from the tape drive.

# Choice: ftcontroller
The floppy drive controller for ftape
CONFIG_FT_STD_FDC
  Only change this setting if you have a special controller. If you
  didn't plug any add-on card into your computer system but just
  plugged the floppy tape cable into the already existing floppy drive
  controller then you don't want to change the default setting,
  i.e. choose "Standard".

  Choose "MACH-2" if you have a Mountain Mach-2 controller.
  Choose "FC-10/FC-20" if you have a Colorado FC-10 or FC-20
  controller.
  Choose "Alt/82078" if you have another controller that is located at
  an IO base address different from the standard floppy drive
  controller's base address of `0x3f0', or uses an IRQ (interrupt)
  channel different from `6', or a DMA channel different from
  `2'. This is necessary for any controller card that is based on
  Intel's 82078 FDC such as Seagate's, Exabyte's and Iomega's "high
  speed" controllers.

  If you choose something other than "Standard" then please make
  sure that the settings for the IO base address and the IRQ and DMA
  channel in the configuration menus below are correct. Use the manual
  of your tape drive to determine the correct settings!

  If you are already successfully using your tape drive with another
  operating system then you definitely should use the same settings
  for the IO base, the IRQ and DMA channel that have proven to work
  with that other OS.

  Note that this menu lets you specify only the default setting for
  the hardware setup. The hardware configuration can be changed at
  boot time (when ftape is compiled into the kernel, i.e. if you
  have said Y to "Floppy tape drive") or module load time (i.e. if you
  have said M to "Floppy tape drive").

  Please read also the file <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> which
  contains a short description of the parameters that can be set at
  boot or load time. If you want to use your floppy tape drive on a
  PCI-bus based system, please read the file
  <file:drivers/char/ftape/README.PCI>.

IO base for the floppy disk controller used with Ftape
CONFIG_FT_FDC_BASE
  You don't need to specify a value if the following default
  settings for the base IO address are correct:
  <<< MACH-2     : 0x1E0 >>>
  <<< FC-10/FC-20: 0x180 >>>
  <<< Secondary  : 0x370 >>>
  Secondary refers to a secondary FDC controller like the "high speed"
  controllers delivered by Seagate or Exabyte or Iomega's Ditto Dash.
  Please make sure that the setting for the IO base address
  specified here is correct. USE THE MANUAL OF YOUR TAPE DRIVE OR
  CONTROLLER CARD TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT SETTING. If you are already
  successfully using the tape drive with another operating system then
  you definitely should use the same settings for the IO base that has
  proven to work with that other OS.

  Note that this menu lets you specify only the default setting for
  the IO base. The hardware configuration can be changed at boot time
  (when ftape is compiled into the kernel, i.e. if you specified Y to
  "Floppy tape drive") or module load time (i.e. if you have said M to
  "Floppy tape drive").

  Please read also the file <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> which
  contains a short description of the parameters that can be set at
  boot or load time.

IRQ channel for the floppy disk controller used with Ftape
CONFIG_FT_FDC_IRQ
  You don't need to specify a value if the following default
  settings for the interrupt channel are correct:
  <<< MACH-2     : 6 >>>
  <<< FC-10/FC-20: 9 >>>
  <<< Secondary  : 6 >>>
  Secondary refers to secondary a FDC controller like the "high speed"
  controllers delivered by Seagate or Exabyte or Iomega's Ditto Dash.
  Please make sure that the setting for the IO base address
  specified here is correct. USE THE MANUAL OF YOUR TAPE DRIVE OR
  CONTROLLER CARD TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT SETTING. If you are already
  successfully using the tape drive with another operating system then
  you definitely should use the same settings for the IO base that has
  proven to work with that other OS.

  Note that this menu lets you specify only the default setting for
  the IRQ channel. The hardware configuration can be changed at boot
  time (when ftape is compiled into the kernel, i.e. if you said Y to
  "Floppy tape drive") or module load time (i.e. if you said M to
  "Floppy tape drive").

  Please read also the file <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> which
  contains a short description of the parameters that can be set at
  boot or load time.

DMA channel for the floppy disk controller used with Ftape
CONFIG_FT_FDC_DMA
  You don't need to specify a value if the following default
  settings for the DMA channel are correct:
  <<< MACH-2     : 2 >>>
  <<< FC-10/FC-20: 3 >>>
  <<< Secondary  : 2 >>>
  Secondary refers to a secondary FDC controller like the "high speed"
  controllers delivered by Seagate or Exabyte or Iomega's Ditto Dash.
  Please make sure that the setting for the IO base address
  specified here is correct. USE THE MANUAL OF YOUR TAPE DRIVE OR
  CONTROLLER CARD TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT SETTING. If you are already
  successfully using the tape drive with another operating system then
  you definitely should use the same settings for the IO base that has
  proven to work with that other OS.

  Note that this menu lets you specify only the default setting for
  the DMA channel. The hardware configuration can be changed at boot
  time (when ftape is compiled into the kernel, i.e. if you said Y to
  "Floppy tape drive") or module load time (i.e. if you said M to
  "Floppy tape drive").

  Please read also the file <file:Documentation/ftape.txt> which
  contains a short description of the parameters that can be set at
  boot or load time.

FDC FIFO Threshold before requesting DMA service
CONFIG_FT_FDC_THR
  Set the FIFO threshold of the FDC. If this is higher the DMA
  controller may serve the FDC after a higher latency time. If this is
  lower, fewer DMA transfers occur leading to less bus contention.
  You may try to tune this if ftape annoys you with "reduced data
  rate because of excessive overrun errors" messages. However, this
  doesn't seem to have too much effect.

  If unsure, don't touch the initial value, i.e. leave it at "8".

FDC maximum data rate
CONFIG_FT_FDC_MAX_RATE
  With some motherboard/FDC combinations ftape will not be able to
  run your FDC/tape drive combination at the highest available
  speed. If this is the case you'll encounter "reduced data rate
  because of excessive overrun errors" messages and lots of retries
  before ftape finally decides to reduce the data rate.

  In this case it might be desirable to tell ftape beforehand that
  it need not try to run the tape drive at the highest available
  speed. If unsure, leave this disabled, i.e. leave it at 2000
  bits/sec.

Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 DRI support)
CONFIG_DRM
  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
  (/dev/agpgart) support.

Build drivers for new (XFree 4.1) DRM
CONFIG_DRM_NEW
  If you set this option, the new DRM version needed by XFree86 4.1
  will be used.  Otherwise, the old DRM version will be used,
  appropriate for XFree86 4.0.

  852GM, 855GM or 865G integrated graphics.  If M is selected, the
  module will be called i830.o.  AGP support is required for this driver
  to work.

Matrox G200/G400/G450
CONFIG_DRM_MGA
  Choose this option if you have a Matrox G200, G400 or G450 graphics
  card.  If M is selected, the module will be called mga.o.  AGP
  support is required for this driver to work.

3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+

CONFIG_DRM40_MGA
  Choose this option if you have a Matrox G200, G400 or G450 graphics
  card.  If M is selected, the module will be called mga.o.  AGP
  support is required for this driver to work.

Creator/Creator3D/Elite3D
CONFIG_DRM_FFB
  Choose this option if you have one of Sun's Creator3D-based graphics
  and frame buffer cards.  Product page at
  <http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/Graphics/creator3d.html>.

MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
CONFIG_MTRR
  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
  as well:

  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

CPU clock frequency of your DEC Alpha
CONFIG_FT_ALPHA_CLOCK
  On some DEC Alpha machines the CPU clock frequency cannot be
  determined automatically, so you need to specify it here ONLY if
  running a DEC Alpha, otherwise this setting has no effect.

Double Talk PC internal speech card support
CONFIG_DTLK
  This driver is for the DoubleTalk PC, a speech synthesizer
  manufactured by RC Systems (<http://www.rcsys.com/>).  It is also
  called the `internal DoubleTalk'.  If you want to compile this as a
  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called dtlk.o.

Siemens R3964 serial protocol support
CONFIG_R3964
  This driver allows synchronous communication with devices using the
  Siemens R3964 packet protocol. Unless you are dealing with special
  hardware like PLCs, you are unlikely to need this.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  n_r3964.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Applicom intelligent fieldbus card support
CONFIG_APPLICOM
  This driver provides the kernel-side support for the intelligent
  fieldbus cards made by Applicom International. More information
  about these cards can be found on the WWW at the address
  <http://www.applicom-int.com/>, or by email from David Woodhouse
  <dwmw2@infradead.org>.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  applicom.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Sony Vaio Programmable I/O Control Device support
CONFIG_SONYPI
  This driver enables access to the Sony Programmable I/O Control
  Device which can be found in many (all ?) Sony Vaio laptops.

  If you have one of those laptops, read
  <file:Documentation/sonypi.txt>, and say Y or M here.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called sonypi.o.

Intel Random Number Generator support
CONFIG_INTEL_RNG
  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
  Generator hardware found on Intel i8xx-based motherboards.

  Both a character driver, used to read() entropy data, and a timer
  function which automatically adds entropy directly into the
  kernel pool, are exported by this driver.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  i810_rng.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Intel/AMD/VIA HW Random Number Generator support
CONFIG_HW_RANDOM
  This driver provides kernel-side support for the
  Random Number Generator hardware found on Intel i8xx-based motherboards,
  AMD 76x-based motherboards, and Via Nehemiah CPUs.

  Provides a character driver, used to read() entropy data.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  hw_random.

  If unsure, say N.

Power Management support
CONFIG_PM
  "Power Management" means that parts of your computer are shut
  off or put into a power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not
  being used.  There are two competing standards for doing this: APM
  and ACPI.  If you want to use either one, say Y here and then also
  to the requisite support below.

  Power Management is most important for battery powered laptop
  computers; if you have a laptop, check out the Linux Laptop home
  page on the WWW at
  <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/> and the
  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  Note that, even if you say N here, Linux on the x86 architecture
  will issue the hlt instruction if nothing is to be done, thereby
  sending the processor to sleep and saving power.

ACPI support
CONFIG_ACPI
  ACPI/OSPM support for Linux is currently under development. As such,
  this support is preliminary and EXPERIMENTAL.  Configuring ACPI
  support enables kernel interfaces that allow higher level software
  (OSPM) to manipulate ACPI defined hardware and software interfaces,
  including the evaluation of ACPI control methods.  If unsure, choose
  N here.  Note, this option will enlarge your kernel by about 120K.

  This support requires an ACPI compliant platform (hardware/firmware).
  If both ACPI and Advanced Power Management (APM) support are
  configured, whichever is loaded first shall be used.

  This code DOES NOT currently provide a complete OSPM implementation
  -- it has not yet reached APM's level of functionality.  When fully
  implemented, Linux ACPI/OSPM will provide a more robust functional
  replacement for legacy configuration and power management
  interfaces, including the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP
  BIOS), the Multi-Processor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced
  Power Management specification (APM).

  Linux support for ACPI/OSPM is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
  Component Architecture (ACPI CA). The latest ACPI CA source code,
  documentation, debug builds, and implementation status information
  can be downloaded from:
  <http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm>.

  The ACPI Sourceforge project may also be of interest:
  <http://sf.net/projects/acpi/>

  Note that "acpi=off" can be used to disable all ACPI code in the kernel.

ACPI kernel configuration manager
CONFIG_ACPI_KERNEL_CONFIG
  If you say `Y' here, Linux's ACPI support will use the
  hardware-level system descriptions found on IA64 machines.

ACPI Debug Statements
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG
  The ACPI driver can optionally report errors with a great deal
  of verbosity. Saying Y enables these statements. This will increase
  your kernel size by around 50K.

ACPI Button
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON
  This driver registers for events based on buttons, such as the
  power, sleep, and lid switch.  In the future, a daemon will read
  /proc/acpi/event and perform user-defined actions such as shutting
  down the system.  Until then, you can cat it, and see output when
  a button is pressed.

CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY
  This driver adds support for battery information through
  /proc/acpi/battery. If you have a mobile system with a battery, 
  say Y.

CONFIG_ACPI_FAN
  This driver adds support for ACPI fan devices, allowing user-mode 
  applications to perform basic fan control (on, off, status).

CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR
  This driver installs ACPI as the idle handler for Linux, and uses
  ACPI C2 and C3 processor states to save power, on systems that
  support it.

ACPI AC Adapter
CONFIG_ACPI_AC
  This driver adds support for the AC Adapter object, which indicates
  whether a system is on AC, or not.  Typically, only laptops have
  this object, since desktops are always on AC.

ACPI Embedded Controller
CONFIG_ACPI_EC
  This driver is required on some systems for the proper operation of
  the battery and thermal drivers.  If you are compiling for a laptop,
  say Y.

ACPI Thermal
CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL
  This driver handles overheating conditions on laptops. It is HIGHLY
  recommended, as your laptop CPU may be damaged without it.

ACPI ASUS/Medion Laptop Extras
CONFIG_ACPI_ASUS
  This driver provides support for extra features of ACPI-compatible
  ASUS laptops. As some of Medion laptops are made by ASUS, it may also
  support some Medion laptops (such as 9675 for example).  It makes all
  the extra buttons generate standard ACPI events that go through
  /proc/acpi/events, and (on some models) adds support for changing the
  display brightness and output, switching the LCD backlight on and off,
  and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs intended
  for reporting mail and wireless status.

  Note: the display switching code is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL,
  toying with these values may even lock your machine.
  
  All settings are changed via /proc/acpi/asus directory entries. Owner
  and group for these entries can be set with asus_uid and asus_gid
  parameters.
  
  More information and a userspace daemon for handling the extra buttons
  at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi4asus/>.
  
  If you have an ACPI-compatible ASUS laptop, say Y or M here. This
  driver is still under development, so if your laptop is unsupported or
  something works not quite as expected, please use the mailing list
  available on the above page (acpi4asus-user@lists.sourceforge.net)
  
ACPI Toshiba Laptop Extras
CONFIG_ACPI_TOSHIBA
  This driver adds support for access to certain system settings
  on "legacy free" Toshiba laptops.  These laptops can be recognized by
  their lack of a BIOS setup menu and APM support.

  On these machines, all system configuration is handled through the
  ACPI.  This driver is required for access to controls not covered
  by the general ACPI drivers, such as LCD brightness, video output,
  etc.

  This driver differs from the non-ACPI Toshiba laptop driver (located
  under "Processor type and features") in several aspects.
  Configuration is accessed by reading and writing text files in the
  /proc tree instead of by program interface to /dev.  Furthermore, no
  power management functions are exposed, as those are handled by the
  general ACPI drivers.

  More information about this driver is available at
  <http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver>.

  If you have a legacy free Toshiba laptop (such as the Libretto L1
  series), say Y.

Advanced Power Management BIOS support
CONFIG_APM
  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
  machines with more than one CPU.

  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
  APM in your BIOS).

  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
  "weird" problems:

   1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
      enabled.
   2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
   3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
      the "no387" option to the kernel
   4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
   5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
      all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
   6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
   7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
   8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
   9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
   10) install a better fan for the CPU
   11) exchange RAM chips
   12) exchange the motherboard.

  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  apm.o.

Ignore USER SUSPEND
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests. On machines with a
  compliant APM BIOS, you want to say N. However, on the NEC Versa M
  series notebooks, it is necessary to say Y because of a BIOS bug.

Enable APM at boot time
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE
  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
  this feature.

Make CPU Idle calls when idle
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE
  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.
  On some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as
  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,
  333 mS). On some machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or
  whenever the CPU becomes idle. (On machines with more than one CPU,
  this option does nothing.)

Enable console blanking using APM
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK
  Enable console blanking using the APM. Some laptops can use this to
  turn off the LCD backlight when the screen blanker of the Linux
  virtual console blanks the screen. Note that this is only used by
  the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight
  when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to
  do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this
  option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your
  backlight at all, or it might print a lot of errors to the console,
  especially if you are using gpm.

RTC stores time in GMT
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT
  Say Y here if your RTC (Real Time Clock a.k.a. hardware clock)
  stores the time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Say N if your RTC
  stores localtime.

  It is in fact recommended to store GMT in your RTC, because then you
  don't have to worry about daylight savings time changes. The only
  reason not to use GMT in your RTC is if you also run a broken OS
  that doesn't understand GMT.

Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS
  Normally we disable external interrupts while we are making calls to
  the APM BIOS as a measure to lessen the effects of a badly behaving
  BIOS implementation.  The BIOS should reenable interrupts if it
  needs to.  Unfortunately, some BIOSes do not -- especially those in
  many of the newer IBM Thinkpads.  If you experience hangs when you
  suspend, try setting this to Y.  Otherwise, say N.

Use real mode APM BIOS call to power off
CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF
  Use real mode APM BIOS calls to switch off the computer. This is
  a work-around for a number of buggy BIOSes. Switch this option on if
  your computer crashes instead of powering off properly.

Watchdog Timer Support
CONFIG_WATCHDOG
  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog.txt>
  in the kernel source.

  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
  which is available from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
  table is full.

  If unsure, say N.

Disable watchdog shutdown on close
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
  it has been started.

WDT Watchdog timer
CONFIG_WDT
  If you have a WDT500P or WDT501P watchdog board, say Y here,
  otherwise N. It is not possible to probe for this board, which means
  that you have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ using
  the "wdt=" kernel option (try "man bootparam" or see the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel at boot time).

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called wdt.o.

WDT PCI Watchdog timer
CONFIG_WDTPCI
  If you have a PCI WDT500/501 watchdog board, say Y here, otherwise
  N.  It is not possible to probe for this board, which means that you
  have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ using the "wdt="
  kernel option (try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your
  boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time).

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called wdt_pci.o.

WDT501 features
CONFIG_WDT_501
  Saying Y here and creating a character special file /dev/temperature
  with major number 10 and minor number 131 ("man mknod") will give
  you a thermometer inside your computer: reading from
  /dev/temperature yields one byte, the temperature in degrees
  Fahrenheit. This works only if you have a WDT501P watchdog board
  installed.

Fan Tachometer
CONFIG_WDT_501_FAN
  Enable the Fan Tachometer on the WDT501. Only do this if you have a
  fan tachometer actually set up.

Software Watchdog
CONFIG_SOFT_WATCHDOG
  A software monitoring watchdog. This will fail to reboot your system
  from some situations that the hardware watchdog will recover
  from. Equally it's a lot cheaper to install.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
   softdog.o.

Berkshire Products PC Watchdog
CONFIG_PCWATCHDOG
  This is the driver for the Berkshire Products PC Watchdog card.

  This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for slightly different hardware.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called ib700wdt.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. Most people
  will say N.

Mixcom Watchdog
CONFIG_MIXCOMWD
  This is a driver for the Mixcom hardware watchdog cards.  This
  watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
  time.

  people will say N.

ZF MachZ Watchdog
CONFIG_MACHZ_WDT
  If you are using a ZF Micro MachZ processor, say Y here, otherwise
  N.  This is the driver for the watchdog timer builtin on that
  processor using ZF-Logic interface.  This watchdog simply watches
  your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if it does, it
  reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be

  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

Wafer 5823 Watchdog
CONFIG_WAFER_WDT
  This is a driver for the hardware watchdog on the ICP Wafer 5823
  Single Board Computer (and probably other similar models).

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  wafer5823wdt.o
	      
Machine Check Exception
CONFIG_X86_MCE
  Machine Check Exception support allows the processor to notify the
  kernel if it detects a problem (e.g. overheating, component failure).
  The action the kernel takes depends on the severity of the problem, 
  ranging from a warning message on the console, to halting the machine.
  You can safely select this on machines that do not support this feature.

  For pentium machines the mce support defaults to off as the mainboard
  support is not always present. You must activate it as a boot option.

Toshiba Laptop support
CONFIG_TOSHIBA
  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode of
  the CPU on Toshiba portables with a genuine Toshiba BIOS. It does
  not work on models with a Phoenix BIOS. The System Management Mode
  is used to set the BIOS and power saving options on Toshiba portables.

  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the
  Toshiba Linux utilities web site at:
  <http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  toshiba.o

  Say Y if you intend to run this kernel on a Toshiba portable.
  Say N otherwise.

Dell laptop support
CONFIG_I8K
  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode
  of the CPU on the Dell Inspiron and Latitude laptops. The System
  Management Mode is used to read cpu temperature, cooling fan
  status and Fn-keys status on Dell laptops. It can also be used
  to switch the fans on and off.

  The driver has been developed and tested on an Inspiron 8000
  but it should work on any Dell Inspiron or Latitude laptop.
  You can force loading on unsupported models by passing the
  parameter `force=1' to the module. Use at your own risk.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).

  Say N otherwise.

/dev/cpu/microcode - Intel IA32 CPU microcode support
CONFIG_MICROCODE
  If you say Y here and also to "/dev file system support" in the
  'File systems' section, you will be able to update the microcode on
  Intel processors in the IA32 family, e.g. Pentium Pro, Pentium II,
  Pentium III, Pentium 4, Xeon etc.  You will obviously need the
  actual microcode binary data itself which is not shipped with the
  Linux kernel.

  For latest news and information on obtaining all the required
  ingredients for this driver, check:
  <http://www.urbanmyth.org/microcode/>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called microcode.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If
  you use modprobe or kmod you may also want to add the line
  'alias char-major-10-184 microcode' to your /etc/modules.conf file.

/dev/cpu/*/msr - Model-specific register support
CONFIG_X86_MSR
  This device gives privileged processes access to the x86
  Model-Specific Registers (MSRs).  It is a character device with
  major 202 and minors 0 to 31 for /dev/cpu/0/msr to /dev/cpu/31/msr.
  MSR accesses are directed to a specific CPU on multi-processor
  systems.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  msr.o

/dev/cpu/*/cpuid - CPU information support
CONFIG_X86_CPUID
  This device gives processes access to the x86 CPUID instruction to
  be executed on a specific processor.  It is a character device
  with major 203 and minors 0 to 31 for /dev/cpu/0/cpuid to
  /dev/cpu/31/cpuid.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cpuid.o

x86 BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive support
CONFIG_EDD
  Say Y or M here if you want to enable BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive
  Services real mode BIOS calls to determine which disk
  BIOS tries boot from.  This information is then exported via /proc.

  This option is experimental, but believed to be safe,
  and most disk controller BIOS vendors do not yet implement this feature.

SBC-60XX Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_60XX_WDT
 This driver can be used with the watchdog timer found on some
 single board computers, namely the 6010 PII based computer.
 It may well work with other cards.  It reads port 0x443 to enable
 and re-set the watchdog timer, and reads port 0x45 to disable
 the watchdog.  If you have a card that behave in similar ways,
 you can probably make this driver work with your card as well.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called sbc60xxwdt.o.

Eurotech CPU-1220/1410 Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_EUROTECH_WDT
  Enable support for the watchdog timer on the Eurotech CPU-1220 and 
  CPU-1410 cards.  These are PC/104 SBCs. Spec sheets and product 
  information are at <http://www.eurotech.it/>.

W83877F Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_W83877F_WDT
 This is the driver for the hardware watchdog on the W83877F chipset
 as used in EMACS PC-104 motherboards (and may work on others). This
 watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
 and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
 time.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called w83877f_wdt.o.

SC520 (AMD Elan) Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_SC520_WDT
 This is the driver for the hardware watchdog built in to the
 AMD "Elan" SC520 microcomputer commonly used in embedded systems.
 This watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't
 freeze, and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain
 amount of time.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called sc520_wdt.o.

Enhanced Real Time Clock Support
CONFIG_RTC
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
  into your computer.

  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
  /dev/rtc.

  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.

  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
  sampling), then say Y here, and read <file:Documentation/rtc.txt>
  for details.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called rtc.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Generic MIPS RTC Support
CONFIG_MIPS_RTC

  If your machine is a MIPS machine, this option provides a simple,
  generic RTC driver for /dev/rtc device.  It only implements two IOCTL 
  operations of the standard PC RTC driver: RTC_RD_TIME and RTC_SET_TIME.
  It is sufficient to run hwclock program. 

  You should say Y here if there is no machine-specific RTC driver for your
  MIPS machine but you do want a simple RTC driver for your RTC device.

Generic Real Time Clock Support
CONFIG_GEN_RTC
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
  into your computer.

  In 2.4 and later kernels this is the only way to set and get rtc
  time on m68k systems so it is highly recommended.

  It reports status information via the file /proc/driver/rtc and its 
  behaviour is set by various ioctls on /dev/rtc. If you enable the
  "extended RTC operation" below it will also provide an emulation
  for RTC_UIE which is required by some programs and may improve
  precision in some cases.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called genrtc.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. To load the
  module automatically add 'alias char-major-10-135 genrtc' to your
  /etc/modules.conf

Extended RTC operation
CONFIG_GEN_RTC_X
  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE which is required by some programs 
  and may improve precision of the generic RTC support in some cases.

Tadpole ANA H8 Support
CONFIG_H8
  The Hitachi H8/337 is a microcontroller used to deal with the power
  and thermal environment. If you say Y here, you will be able to
  communicate with it via a character special device.

  If unsure, say N.

/dev/nvram support
CONFIG_NVRAM
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
  to be selected.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called nvram.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Joystick support
CONFIG_JOYSTICK
  If you have a joystick, 6dof controller, gamepad, steering wheel,
  weapon control system or something like that you can say Y here to
  enable generic support for these controllers. You will also need to
  say Y or M to at least one of the hardware specific drivers. This
  will make the controllers available as /dev/input/jsX devices.
  Please read the file <file:Documentation/input/joystick.txt> which
  contains more information and the location of the joystick package
  that you'll need.

Game port support
CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT
  Gameport support is for the standard 15-pin PC gameport.  If you

Atomwide serial port support
CONFIG_ATOMWIDE_SERIAL
  If you have an Atomwide Serial card for an Acorn system, say Y to
  this option.  The driver can handle 1, 2, or 3 port cards.
  If unsure, say N.

Dual serial port support
CONFIG_DUALSP_SERIAL
  If you have the Serial Port's dual serial card for an Acorn system,
  say Y to this option.  If unsure, say N.

NetWinder Button
CONFIG_NWBUTTON
  If you say Y here and create a character device node /dev/nwbutton
  with major and minor numbers 10 and 158 ("man mknod"), then every
  time the orange button is pressed a number of times, the number of
  times the button was pressed will be written to that device.

  This is most useful for applications, as yet unwritten, which
  perform actions based on how many times the button is pressed in a
  row.

  Do not hold the button down for too long, as the driver does not
  alter the behaviour of the hardware reset circuitry attached to the
  button; it will still execute a hard reset if the button is held
  down for longer than approximately five seconds.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  nwbutton.o.

  Most people will answer Y to this question and "Reboot Using Button"
  below to be able to initiate a system shutdown from the button.

Reboot Using Button
CONFIG_NWBUTTON_REBOOT
  If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system
  shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times.
  The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default,
  but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT
  in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the
  driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load
  time with "insmod button reboot_count=<something>".

Sound card support
CONFIG_SOUND
  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
  the modular sound system is contained in the files
  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
  outdated but still useful information as well.

  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
  compile the sound card support as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
  and load that module after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do
  this, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/sound/README.modules>; the module will be
  called soundcore.o.

  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.

OSS sound modules
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS
  OSS is the Open Sound System suite of sound card drivers.  They make
  sound programming easier since they provide a common API.  Say Y or
  M here (the module will be called sound.o) if you haven't found a
  driver for your sound card above, then pick your driver from the
  list below.

Persistent DMA buffers
CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP
  Linux can often have problems allocating DMA buffers for ISA sound
  cards on machines with more than 16MB of RAM. This is because ISA
  DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundary and it is quite
  possible that a large enough free block in this region cannot be
  found after the machine has been running for a while. If you say Y
  here the DMA buffers (64Kb) will be allocated at boot time and kept
  until the shutdown. This option is only useful if you said Y to
  "OSS sound modules", above. If you said M to "OSS sound modules"
  then you can get the persistent DMA buffer functionality by passing
  the command-line argument "dmabuf=1" to the sound.o module.

  Say Y unless you have 16MB or less RAM or a PCI sound card.

Support for Aztech Sound Galaxy (non-PnP) cards
CONFIG_SOUND_SGALAXY
  This module initializes the older non Plug and Play sound galaxy
  cards from Aztech. It supports the Waverider Pro 32 - 3D and the
  Galaxy Washington 16.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "sgalaxy=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sgbase>" to the kernel command
  line.

Support for AD1816(A) based cards
CONFIG_SOUND_AD1816
  Say M here if you have a sound card based on the Analog Devices
  AD1816(A) chip.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "ad1816=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel command line.

Yamaha OPL3-SA1 audio controller
CONFIG_SOUND_OPL3SA1
  Say Y or M if you have a Yamaha OPL3-SA1 sound chip, which is
  usually built into motherboards. Read
  <file:Documentation/sound/OPL3-SA> for details.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "opl3sa=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

ProAudioSpectrum 16 support
CONFIG_SOUND_PAS
  Answer Y only if you have a Pro Audio Spectrum 16, ProAudio Studio
  16 or Logitech SoundMan 16 sound card. Answer N if you have some
  other card made by Media Vision or Logitech since those are not
  PAS16 compatible. Please read <file:Documentation/sound/PAS16>.
  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
  is included in PAS support.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "pas2=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sbio>,<sbirq>,<sbdma>,<sbdma2>
  to the kernel command line.

Enable PAS16 joystick port
CONFIG_PAS_JOYSTICK
  Say Y here to enable the Pro Audio Spectrum 16's auxiliary joystick
  port.

100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support
CONFIG_SOUND_SB
  Answer Y if you have an original Sound Blaster card made by Creative
  Labs or a 100% hardware compatible clone (like the Thunderboard or
  SM Games). For an unknown card you may answer Y if the card claims
  to be Sound Blaster-compatible.

  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sound/Soundblaster>.

  You should also say Y here for cards based on the Avance Logic
  ALS-007 and ALS-1X0 chips (read <file:Documentation/sound/ALS>) and
  for cards based on ESS chips (read
  <file:Documentation/sound/ESS1868> and
  <file:Documentation/sound/ESS>). If you have an SB AWE 32 or SB AWE
  64, say Y here and also to "AWE32 synth" below and read
  <file:Documentation/sound/INSTALL.awe>. If you have an IBM Mwave
  card, say Y here and read <file:Documentation/sound/mwave>.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel and don't want to use
  isapnp, you have to add "sb=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel
  command line.

  You can say M here to compile this driver as a module; the module is
  called sb.o.

Gravis Ultrasound support
CONFIG_SOUND_GUS
  Say Y here for any type of Gravis Ultrasound card, including the GUS
  or GUS MAX.  See also <file:Documentation/sound/ultrasound> for more
  information on configuring this card with modules.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "gus=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel command line.

MPU-401 support (NOT for SB16)
CONFIG_SOUND_MPU401
  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> file.  It
  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "mpu401=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

6850 UART support
CONFIG_SOUND_UART6850
  This option enables support for MIDI interfaces based on the 6850
  UART chip. This interface is rarely found on sound cards. It's safe
  to answer N to this question.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "uart6850=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

PSS (AD1848, ADSP-2115, ESC614) support
CONFIG_SOUND_PSS
  Answer Y or M if you have an Orchid SW32, Cardinal DSP16, Beethoven
  ADSP-16 or some other card based on the PSS chipset (AD1848 codec +
  ADSP-2115 DSP chip + Echo ESC614 ASIC CHIP). For more information on
  how to compile it into the kernel or as a module see the file
  <file:Documentation/sound/PSS>.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "pss=<io>,<mssio>,<mssirq>,<mssdma>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

Enable PSS mixer (Beethoven ADSP-16 and other compatible)
CONFIG_PSS_MIXER
  Answer Y for Beethoven ADSP-16. You may try to say Y also for other
  cards if they have master volume, bass, treble, and you can't
  control it under Linux. If you answer N for Beethoven ADSP-16, you
  can't control master volume, bass, treble and synth volume.

  If you said M to "PSS support" above, you may enable or disable this
  PSS mixer with the module parameter pss_mixer. For more information
  see the file <file:Documentation/sound/PSS>.

Have DSPxxx.LD firmware file
CONFIG_PSS_HAVE_BOOT
  If you have the DSPxxx.LD file or SYNTH.LD file for you card, say Y
  to include this file. Without this file the synth device (OPL) may
  not work.

Full pathname of DSPxxx.LD firmware file
CONFIG_PSS_BOOT_FILE
  Enter the full pathname of your DSPxxx.LD file or SYNTH.LD file,
  starting from /.

Microsoft Sound System support
CONFIG_SOUND_MSS
  Again think carefully before answering Y to this question.  It's
  safe to answer Y if you have the original Windows Sound System card
  made by Microsoft or Aztech SG 16 Pro (or NX16 Pro).  Also you may
  say Y in case your card is NOT among these:

     ATI Stereo F/X, AdLib, Audio Excell DSP16, Cardinal DSP16,
     Ensoniq SoundScape (and compatibles made by Reveal and Spea),
     Gravis Ultrasound, Gravis Ultrasound ACE, Gravis Ultrasound Max,
     Gravis Ultrasound with 16 bit option, Logitech Sound Man 16,
     Logitech SoundMan Games, Logitech SoundMan Wave, MAD16 Pro (OPTi
     82C929), Media Vision Jazz16, MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro, Microsoft
     Windows Sound System (MSS/WSS), Mozart (OAK OTI-601), Orchid
     SW32, Personal Sound System (PSS), Pro Audio Spectrum 16, Pro
     Audio Studio 16, Pro Sonic 16, Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface,
     Sound Blaster 1.0, Sound Blaster 16, Sound Blaster 16ASP, Sound
     Blaster 2.0, Sound Blaster AWE32, Sound Blaster Pro, TI TM4000M
     notebook, ThunderBoard, Turtle Beach Tropez, Yamaha FM
     synthesizers (OPL2, OPL3 and OPL4), 6850 UART MIDI Interface.

  For cards having native support in VoxWare, consult the card
  specific instructions in <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS>.
  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option
  will cause a conflict.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "ad1848=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>[,<type>]" to the kernel command
  line.

SGI Visual Workstation on-board audio
CONFIG_SOUND_VWSND
  Say Y or M if you have an SGI Visual Workstation and you want to be
  able to use its on-board audio.  Read
  <file:Documentation/sound/vwsnd> for more info on this driver's
  capabilities.

CONFIG_SOUND_VRC5477
  Say Y here to enable sound support for the NEC Vrc5477 chip, an
  integrated, multi-function controller chip for MIPS CPUs.  Works
  with the AC97 codec.

Ensoniq SoundScape support
CONFIG_SOUND_SSCAPE
  Answer Y if you have a sound card based on the Ensoniq SoundScape
  chipset. Such cards are being manufactured at least by Ensoniq, Spea
  and Reveal (Reveal makes also other cards).

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

  If you say N here, those macros will mostly turn to no-ops.  Currently
  supported by MIPS arch.  See include/asm-mips/debug.h for debuging macros.
  If unsure, say N.

Run uncached
CONFIG_MIPS_UNCACHED
  If you say Y here there kernel will disable all CPU caches.  This will
  reduce the system's performance dramatically but can help finding
  otherwise hard to track bugs.  It can also useful if you're doing
  hardware debugging with a logic analyzer and need to see all traffic
  on the bus.

  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
  unless you really know what this hack does.

ISDN support
CONFIG_ISDN
  ISDN ("Integrated Services Digital Networks", called RNIS in France)
  is a special type of fully digital telephone service; it's mostly
  used to connect to your Internet service provider (with SLIP or
  PPP).  The main advantage is that the speed is higher than ordinary
  modem/telephone connections, and that you can have voice
  conversations while downloading stuff.  It only works if your
  computer is equipped with an ISDN card and both you and your service
  provider purchased an ISDN line from the phone company.  For
  details, read <http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/> on the WWW.

  This driver allows you to use an ISDN-card for networking
  connections and as dialin/out device.  The isdn-tty's have a built
  in AT-compatible modem emulator.  Network devices support autodial,
  channel-bundling, callback and caller-authentication without having
  a daemon running.  A reduced T.70 protocol is supported with tty's
  suitable for German BTX.  On D-Channel, the protocols EDSS1
  (Euro-ISDN) and 1TR6 (German style) are supported.  See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README> for more information.

  If you want to compile the ISDN code as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called isdn.o. If unsure, say N.

Support synchronous PPP
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP
  Over digital connections such as ISDN, there is no need to
  synchronize sender and recipient's clocks with start and stop bits
  as is done over analog telephone lines. Instead, one can use
  "synchronous PPP". Saying Y here will include this protocol. This
  protocol is used by Cisco and Sun for example. So you want to say Y
  here if the other end of your ISDN connection supports it. You will
  need a special version of pppd (called ipppd) for using this
  feature. See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp> and
  <file:Documentation/isdn/syncPPP.FAQ> for more information.

PPP filtering for ISDN
CONFIG_IPPP_FILTER
  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over
  IPPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as
  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up
  a demand-dialled link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.
  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and
  active-filter options to ipppd.

  If unsure, say N.

Support generic MP (RFC 1717)
CONFIG_ISDN_MPP
  With synchronous PPP enabled, it is possible to increase throughput
  by bundling several ISDN-connections, using this protocol. See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp> for more information.

Use VJ-compression with synchronous PPP
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ
  This enables Van Jacobson header compression for synchronous PPP.
  Say Y if the other end of the connection supports it.

Support BSD compression
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP
  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
  it is safe to say Y here.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called isdn_bsdcomp.o.

Support audio via ISDN
CONFIG_ISDN_AUDIO
  If you say Y here, the modem-emulator will support a subset of the
  EIA Class 8 Voice commands. Using a getty with voice-support
  (mgetty+sendfax by gert@greenie.muc.de with an extension, available
  with the ISDN utility package for example), you will be able to use
  your Linux box as an ISDN-answering machine. Of course, this must be
  supported by the lowlevel driver also. Currently, the HiSax driver
  is the only voice-supporting driver. See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.audio> for more information.

X.25 PLP on top of ISDN
CONFIG_ISDN_X25
  This feature provides the X.25 protocol over ISDN connections.
  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.x25> for more information
  if you are thinking about using this.

ISDN diversion services support
CONFIG_ISDN_DIVERSION
  This option allows you to use some supplementary diversion
  services in conjunction with the HiSax driver on an EURO/DSS1
  line.

  Supported options are CD (call deflection), CFU (Call forward
  unconditional), CFB (Call forward when busy) and CFNR (call forward
  not reachable). Additionally the actual CFU, CFB and CFNR state may
  be interrogated.

  The use of CFU, CFB, CFNR and interrogation may be limited to some
  countries. The keypad protocol is still not implemented. CD should
  work in all countries if the service has been subscribed to.

  Please read the file <file:Documentation/isdn/README.diversion>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called dss1_divert.o.

ICN 2B and 4B support
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_ICN
  This enables support for two kinds of ISDN-cards made by a German
  company called ICN.  2B is the standard version for a single ISDN
  line with two B-channels, 4B supports two ISDN lines.  For running
  this card, additional firmware is necessary, which has to be
  downloaded into the card using a utility which is distributed
  separately.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README> and
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.icn> for more
  information.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called icn.o.

isdnloop support
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_LOOP
  This driver provides a virtual ISDN card. Its primary purpose is
  testing of linklevel features or configuration without getting
  charged by your service-provider for lots of phone calls.
  You need will need the loopctrl utility from the latest isdn4k-utils
  package to set up this driver.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called isdnloop.o.

  platforms above must be disabled in order to produce a working 
  kernel.

  Also, you will want to enable 68020 support below, and disable 
  all other CPU types.  General Linux information on the Sun 3x series
  (now discontinued) is at
  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

  If you don't want to compile a kernel for a Sun 3, say N.

Sun 3X support
CONFIG_SUN3X
  This option enables support for the Sun 3x series of workstations.
  Currently, only the Sun 3/80 is supported within the Sun 3x family.
  You will also want to enable 68030 support below  
  General Linux information on the Sun 3x series (now discontinued)
  is at <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

  If you don't want to compile a kernel for a Sun 3x, say N.

Sun3x builtin serial support
CONFIG_SUN3X_ZS
  ZS refers to a type of asynchronous serial port built in to the Sun3
  and Sun3x workstations; if you have a Sun 3, you probably have
  these.  Say 'Y' to support ZS ports directly.  This option must be
  enabled in order to support the keyboard and mouse ports.

Sun keyboard support
CONFIG_SUN_KEYBOARD
  Say Y here to support the keyboard found on Sun 3 and 3x
  workstations.  It can also be used support Sun Type-5 keyboards
  through an adaptor.  See
  <http://www.suse.cz/development/input/adapters.html> and
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxconsole/> for details on the
  latter.

68020 support
CONFIG_M68020
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68020
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that the 68020 requires a
  68851 MMU (Memory Management Unit) to run Linux/m68k, except on the
  Sun 3, which provides its own version.

68030 support
CONFIG_M68030
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68030
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that a MC68EC030 will not
  work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory Management Unit).

68040 support
CONFIG_M68040
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68LC040
  or MC68040 processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that an
  MC68EC040 will not work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory
  Management Unit).

68060 support
CONFIG_M68060
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68060
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

Math emulation support
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU
  At some point in the future, this will cause floating-point math
  instructions to be emulated by the kernel on machines that lack a
  floating-point math coprocessor.  Thrill-seekers and chronically
  sleep-deprived psychotic hacker types can say Y now, everyone else
  should probably wait a while.

Math emulation only kernel
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU_ONLY
  This option prevents any floating-point instructions from being
  compiled into the kernel, thereby the kernel doesn't save any
  floating point context anymore during task switches, so this
  kernel will only be usable on machines without a floating-point
  math coprocessor. This makes the kernel a bit faster as no tests
  needs to be executed whether a floating-point instruction in the
  kernel should be executed or not.

Math emulation extra precision
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU_EXTRAPREC
  The fpu uses normally a few bit more during calculations for
  correct rounding, the emulator can (often) do the same but this
  extra calculation can cost quite some time, so you can disable
  it here. The emulator will then "only" calculate with a 64 bit
  mantissa and round slightly incorrect, what is more then enough
  for normal usage.

Advanced configuration options
CONFIG_ADVANCED
  This gives you access to some advanced options for the CPU. The
  defaults should be fine for most users, but these options may make
  it possible for you to improve performance somewhat if you know what
  you are doing.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about these options.

  Most users should say N to this question.

Use one physical chunk of memory only
CONFIG_SINGLE_MEMORY_CHUNK
  Ignore all but the first contiguous chunk of physical memory for VM
  purposes.  This will save a few bytes kernel size and may speed up
  some operations.  Say N if not sure.

Use read-modify-write instructions
CONFIG_RMW_INSNS
  This allows to use certain instructions that work with indivisible
  read-modify-write bus cycles. While this is faster than the
  workaround of disabling interrupts, it can conflict with DMA
  ( = direct memory access) on many Amiga systems, and it is also said
  to destabilize other machines. It is very likely that this will
  cause serious problems on any Amiga or Atari Medusa if set. The only
  configuration where it should work are 68030-based Ataris, where it
  apparently improves performance. But you've been warned! Unless you
  really know what you are doing, say N. Try Y only if you're quite
  adventurous.

Amiga Zorro (AutoConfig) bus support
CONFIG_ZORRO
  This enables support for the Zorro bus in the Amiga. If you have
  expansion cards in your Amiga that conform to the Amiga
  AutoConfig(tm) specification, say Y, otherwise N. Note that even
  expansion cards that do not fit in the Zorro slots but fit in e.g.
  the CPU slot may fall in this category, so you have to say Y to let
  Linux use these.

Zorro device name database
CONFIG_ZORRO_NAMES
  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known Zorro device
  names to make the information in /proc/iomem comprehensible to the
  user. This database increases the size of the kernel image by about
  15KB, but it gets freed after the system boots up, so it doesn't
  take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you are building an installation
  floppy or kernel for an embedded system where kernel image size
  really matters, you can disable this feature and you'll get device
  ID numbers instead of names.

  When in doubt, say Y.

Amiga 1200/600 PCMCIA support
CONFIG_AMIGA_PCMCIA
  Include support in the kernel for pcmcia on Amiga 1200 and Amiga
  600. If you intend to use pcmcia cards say Y; otherwise say N.

Hisoft Whippet PCMCIA serial support
CONFIG_WHIPPET_SERIAL
  HiSoft has a web page at <http://www.hisoft.co.uk/>, but there
  is no listing for the Whippet in their Amiga section.

Amiga Zorro II ramdisk support
CONFIG_AMIGA_Z2RAM
  This enables support for using Chip RAM and Zorro II RAM as a
  ramdisk or as a swap partition. Say Y if you want to include this
  driver in the kernel. This driver is also available as a module
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). The module is called z2ram.o. If you want
  to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Support for ST-RAM as swap space
CONFIG_STRAM_SWAP
  Some Atari 68k machines (including the 520STF and 1020STE) divide
  their addressable memory into ST and TT sections.  The TT section
  (up to 512MB) is the main memory; the ST section (up to 4MB) is
  accessible to the built-in graphics board, runs slower, and is
  present mainly for backward compatibility with older machines.

  This enables support for using (parts of) ST-RAM as swap space,
  instead of as normal system memory. This can first enhance system
  performance if you have lots of alternate RAM (compared to the size
  of ST-RAM), because executable code always will reside in faster
  memory. ST-RAM will remain as ultra-fast swap space. On the other
  hand, it allows much improved dynamic allocations of ST-RAM buffers
  for device driver modules (e.g. floppy, ACSI, SLM printer, DMA
  sound). The probability that such allocations at module load time
  fail is drastically reduced.

ST-RAM statistics in /proc
CONFIG_STRAM_PROC
  Say Y here to report ST-RAM usage statistics in /proc/stram.  See
  the help for CONFIG_STRAM_SWAP for discussion of ST-RAM and its
  uses.

Atari ACSI support
CONFIG_ATARI_ACSI
  This enables support for the Atari ACSI interface. The driver
  supports hard disks and CD-ROMs, which have 512-byte sectors, or can
  be switched to that mode. Due to the ACSI command format, only disks
  up to 1 GB are supported. Special support for certain ACSI to SCSI
  adapters, which could relax that, isn't included yet. The ACSI
  driver is also the basis for certain other drivers for devices
  attached to the ACSI bus: Atari SLM laser printer, BioNet-100
  Ethernet, and PAMsNet Ethernet. If you want to use one of these
  devices, you need ACSI support, too.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called acsi.o.

Probe all LUNs on each ACSI device
CONFIG_ACSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have a ACSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, you should say Y here so that all
  will be found by the ACSI driver. An ACSI device with multiple LUNs
  acts logically like multiple ACSI devices. The vast majority of ACSI
  devices have only one LUN, and so most people can say N here and
  should in fact do so, because it is safer.

Atari SLM laser printer support
CONFIG_ATARI_SLM
  If you have an Atari SLM laser printer, say Y to include support for
  it in the kernel. Otherwise, say N. This driver is also available as
  a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want). The module will be called
  acsi_slm.o. Be warned: the driver needs much ST-RAM and can cause
  problems due to that fact!

A3000 WD33C93A support
CONFIG_A3000_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga 3000 and have SCSI devices connected to the
  built-in SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise, say N. This driver is
  also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The module is
  called wd33c93.o. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

A2091 WD33C93A support
CONFIG_A2091_SCSI
  If you have a Commodore A2091 SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N. This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called wd33c93.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

GVP Series II WD33C93A support
CONFIG_GVP11_SCSI
  If you have a Great Valley Products Series II SCSI controller,
  answer Y. Also say Y if you have a later model of GVP SCSI
  controller (such as the GVP A4008 or a Combo board). Otherwise,
  answer N. This driver does NOT work for the T-Rex series of
  accelerators from TekMagic and GVP-M.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module will be called gvp11.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CyberStorm SCSI support
CONFIG_CYBERSTORM_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with an original (MkI) Phase5 Cyberstorm
  accelerator board and the optional Cyberstorm SCSI controller,
  answer Y. Otherwise, say N.

CyberStorm II SCSI support
CONFIG_CYBERSTORMII_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with a Phase5 Cyberstorm MkII accelerator board
  and the optional Cyberstorm SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  answer N.

Blizzard 2060 SCSI support
CONFIG_BLZ2060_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with a Phase5 Blizzard 2060 accelerator board
  and want to use the onboard SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  answer N.

Blizzard 1230IV/1260 SCSI support
CONFIG_BLZ1230_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga 1200 with a Phase5 Blizzard 1230IV or Blizzard
  1260 accelerator, and the optional SCSI module, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N.

Fastlane SCSI support
CONFIG_FASTLANE_SCSI
  If you have the Phase5 Fastlane Z3 SCSI controller, or plan to use
  one in the near future, say Y to this question. Otherwise, say N.

BSC Oktagon SCSI support
CONFIG_OKTAGON_SCSI
  If you have the BSC Oktagon SCSI disk controller for the Amiga, say
  Y to this question.  If you're in doubt about whether you have one,
  see the picture at
  <http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/search.pl?product=oktagon>.

Atari native SCSI support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI
  If you have an Atari with built-in NCR5380 SCSI controller (TT,
  Falcon, ...) say Y to get it supported. Of course also, if you have
  a compatible SCSI controller (e.g. for Medusa).  This driver is also
  available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed
  from the running kernel whenever you want).  The module is called
  atari_scsi.o.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This driver supports both
  styles of NCR integration into the system: the TT style (separate
  DMA), and the Falcon style (via ST-DMA, replacing ACSI).  It does
  NOT support other schemes, like in the Hades (without DMA).

Long delays for Toshiba CD-ROMs
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_TOSHIBA_DELAY
  This option increases the delay after a SCSI arbitration to
  accommodate some flaky Toshiba CD-ROM drives. Say Y if you intend to
  use a Toshiba CD-ROM drive; otherwise, the option is not needed and
  would impact performance a bit, so say N.

Reset SCSI-devices at boottime
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT
  Reset the devices on your Atari whenever it boots.  This makes the
  boot process fractionally longer but may assist recovery from errors
  that leave the devices with SCSI operations partway completed.

Hades SCSI DMA emulator
CONFIG_TT_DMA_EMUL
  This option enables code which emulates the TT SCSI DMA chip on the
  Hades. This increases the SCSI transfer rates at least ten times
  compared to PIO transfers.

Sun3x ESP SCSI
CONFIG_SUN3X_ESP
  This option will enable support for the ESP SCSI controller found
  onboard the Sun 3/80.

Ariadne support
CONFIG_ARIADNE
  If you have a Village Tronic Ariadne Ethernet adapter, say Y.
  Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called ariadne.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Zorro NS8390-based Ethernet support
CONFIG_ZORRO8390
  This driver is for Zorro Ethernet cards using an NS8390-compatible
  chipset, like the Village Tronic Ariadne II and the Individual
  Computers X-Surf Ethernet cards. If you have such a card, say Y.
  Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called zorro8390.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

A2065 support
CONFIG_A2065
  If you have a Commodore A2065 Ethernet adapter, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called a2065.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Hydra support
CONFIG_HYDRA
  If you have a Hydra Ethernet adapter, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called hydra.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sun3 NCR5380 SCSI
CONFIG_SUN3_SCSI
  This option will enable support for the OBIO (onboard io) NCR5380
  SCSI controller found in the Sun 3/50 and 3/60, as well as for
  "Sun3" type VME scsi controllers also based on the NCR5380.
  General Linux information on the Sun 3 series (now discontinued)
  is at <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

PCMCIA NE2000 and compatibles support
CONFIG_APNE
  If you have a PCMCIA NE2000 compatible adapter, say Y.  Otherwise,
  say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called apne.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari Lance support
CONFIG_ATARILANCE
  Say Y to include support for several Atari Ethernet adapters based
  on the AMD Lance chipset: RieblCard (with or without battery), or
  PAMCard VME (also the version by Rhotron, with different addresses).

BioNet-100 support
CONFIG_ATARI_BIONET
  Say Y to include support for BioData's BioNet-100 Ethernet adapter
  for the ACSI port. The driver works (has to work...) with a polled
  I/O scheme, so it's rather slow :-(

PAMsNet support
CONFIG_ATARI_PAMSNET
  Say Y to include support for the PAMsNet Ethernet adapter for the
  ACSI port ("ACSI node"). The driver works (has to work...) with a
  polled I/O scheme, so it's rather slow :-(

Amiga mouse support
CONFIG_AMIGAMOUSE
  If you want to be able to use an Amiga mouse in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called amigamouse.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari mouse support
CONFIG_ATARIMOUSE
  If you want to be able to use an Atari mouse in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called atarimouse.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari MFP serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_MFPSER
  If you like to use the MFP serial ports ("Modem1", "Serial1") under
  Linux, say Y. The driver equally supports all kinds of MFP serial
  ports and automatically detects whether Serial1 is available.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  Note for Falcon users: You also have an MFP port, it's just not
  wired to the outside... But you could use the port under Linux.

Atari SCC serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCC
  If you have serial ports based on a Zilog SCC chip (Modem2, Serial2,
  LAN) and like to use them under Linux, say Y. All built-in SCC's are
  supported (TT, MegaSTE, Falcon), and also the ST-ESCC. If you have
  two connectors for channel A (Serial2 and LAN), they are visible as
  two separate devices.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari SCC serial DMA support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCC_DMA
  This enables DMA support for receiving data on channel A of the SCC.
  If you have a TT you may say Y here and read
  drivers/char/atari_SCC.README. All other users should say N here,
  because only the TT has SCC-DMA, even if your machine keeps claiming
  so at boot time.

Atari MIDI serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_MIDI
  If you want to use your Atari's MIDI port in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari DSP56k Digital Signal Processor support
CONFIG_ATARI_DSP56K
  If you want to be able to use the DSP56001 in Falcons, say Y. This
  driver is still experimental, and if you don't know what it is, or
  if you don't have this processor, just say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Support for early boot text console
CONFIG_BOOTX_TEXT
  Say Y here to see progress messages from the boot firmware in text
  mode. Requires either BootX or Open Firmware.

Amiga builtin serial support
CONFIG_AMIGA_BUILTIN_SERIAL
  If you want to use your Amiga's built-in serial port in Linux,
  answer Y.

  IO-Extender card, N otherwise.

Multiface Card III serial support
CONFIG_MULTIFACE_III_TTY
  If you want to use a Multiface III card's serial port in Linux,
  answer Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Amiga/Atari/PowerMac DMA sound support
CONFIG_DMASOUND
  Support built-in audio chips accessible by DMA on various machines
  that have them.  Note that this symbol does not affect the kernel
  directly; rather, it controls whether configuration questions
  enabling DMA sound drivers for various specific machine
  architectures will be used.

Atari DMA sound support
CONFIG_DMASOUND_ATARI
  If you want to use the internal audio of your Atari in Linux, answer
  Y to this question. This will provide a Sun-like /dev/audio,
  compatible with the Linux/i386 sound system. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

PowerMac DMA sound support
CONFIG_DMASOUND_PMAC
  If you want to use the internal audio of your PowerMac in Linux,
  answer Y to this question. This will provide a Sun-like /dev/audio,
  compatible with the Linux/i386 sound system. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Amiga DMA sound support
CONFIG_DMASOUND_PAULA
  If you want to use the internal audio of your Amiga in Linux, answer
  Y to this question. This will provide a Sun-like /dev/audio,
  compatible with the Linux/i386 sound system. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Q40 sound support
CONFIG_DMASOUND_Q40
  If you want to use the internal audio of your Q40 in Linux, answer
  Y to this question. This will provide a Sun-like /dev/audio,
  compatible with the Linux/i386 sound system. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

HP DCA serial support
CONFIG_HPDCA
  If you want to use the internal "DCA" serial ports on an HP300
  machine, say Y here.

HP on-board LANCE support
CONFIG_HPLANCE
  If you want to use the builtin "LANCE" Ethernet controller on an
  HP300 machine, say Y here.

DIO bus support
CONFIG_DIO
  Say Y here to enable support for the "DIO" expansion bus used in
  HP300 machines. If you are using such a system you almost certainly
  want this.

# Choice: ppctype
Processor Type
CONFIG_6xx
  There are four types of PowerPC chips supported.  The more common
  types (601, 603, 604, 740, 750, 7400), the Motorola embedded
  versions (821, 823, 850, 855, 860, 8260), the IBM embedded versions
  (403 and 405) and the high end 64 bit Power processors (Power 3,
  Power 4).  Unless you are building a kernel for one of the embedded
  processor systems, or a 64 bit IBM RS/6000, choose 6xx.  Note that
  the kernel runs in 32-bit mode even on 64-bit chips.  Also note that
  because the 82xx family has a 603e core, specific support for that
  chipset is asked later on.

Motorola MPC8260 CPM support
CONFIG_8260
  The MPC8260 CPM (Communications Processor Module) is a typical
  embedded CPU made by Motorola.  Selecting this option means that
  you wish to build a kernel for a machine with specifically an 8260
  for a CPU.

  If in doubt, say N.

# Choice: ppc4xxtype
Oak
CONFIG_OAK
  Select Oak if you have an IBM 403GCX "Oak" Evaluation Board.

  Select Walnut if you have an IBM 405GP "Walnut" Evaluation Board.

  More information on these boards is available at:
  <http://www.chips.ibm.com/products/powerpc/tools/evk_pn.html#GCX>.

Walnut
CONFIG_WALNUT
  Select Walnut if you have an IBM 405GP "Walnut" Evaluation Board.

Workarounds for PPC601 bugs
CONFIG_PPC601_SYNC_FIX
  Some versions of the PPC601 (the first PowerPC chip) have bugs which
  mean that extra synchronization instructions are required near
  certain instructions, typically those that make major changes to the
  CPU state.  These extra instructions reduce performance slightly.
  If you say N here, these extra instructions will not be included,
  resulting in a kernel which will run faster but may not run at all
  on some systems with the PPC601 chip.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

8xx Cache (Copy-Back or Writethrough)
CONFIG_8xx_COPYBACK
  Saying Y here will cause the cache on an MPC8xx processor to be used
  in Copy-Back mode.  If you say N here, it is used in Writethrough
  mode.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

MPC860 (Pre Rev. C) CPU6 Silicon Errata
CONFIG_8xx_CPU6
  MPC860 CPUs, prior to Rev C have some bugs in the silicon, which
  require workarounds for Linux (and most other OSes to work).  If you
  get a BUG() very early in boot, this might fix the problem.  For
  more details read the document entitled "MPC860 Family Device Errata
  Reference" on Motorola's website.  This option also incurs a
  performance hit.

  If in doubt, say N here.

MPC8xx direct IDE support on PCMCIA port
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MPC8xx_IDE
  This option provides support for IDE on Motorola MPC8xx Systems.
  Please see 'Type of MPC8xx IDE interface' for details.

  If unsure, say N.

# Choice: mpc8xxtype
Type of MPC8xx IDE interface
CONFIG_IDE_8xx_PCCARD
  Select how the IDE devices are connected to the MPC8xx system:

  8xx_PCCARD uses the 8xx internal PCMCIA interface in combination
             with a PC Card (e.g. ARGOSY portable Hard Disk Adapter),
             ATA PC Card HDDs or ATA PC Flash Cards (example: TQM8xxL

  8xx_DIRECT is used for directly connected IDE devices using the 8xx
             internal PCMCIA interface (example: IVMS8 systems)

  EXT_DIRECT is used for IDE devices directly connected to the 8xx
             bus using some glue logic, but _not_ the 8xx internal
             PCMCIA interface (example: IDIF860 systems)

Use SMC2 for UART
CONFIG_8xx_SMC2
  If you would like to use SMC2 as a serial port, say Y here.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

Use SMC2 for Console
CONFIG_CONS_SMC2
  If you are going to have a serial console on your device and are
  using SMC2 for your serial port, say Y here, else say N.

Use the alternate SMC2 I/O
CONFIG_ALTSMC2
  If you have an MPC823 or MPC850 and would like to use the alternate
  SMC2 for I/O, say Y here.

# Choice: ppc6xxtype
Machine Type
CONFIG_ALL_PPC
  Linux currently supports several different kinds of PowerPC-based
  machines: Apple Power Macintoshes and clones (such as the Motorola
  Starmax series), PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform) machines (such
  as the Motorola PowerStacks, Motorola cPCI/VME embedded systems,
  and some IBM RS/6000 systems), CHRP (Common Hardware Reference
  Platform), and several embedded PowerPC systems containing 4xx, 6xx,
  7xx, 8xx, 74xx, and 82xx processors.  Currently, the default option
  is to build a kernel which works on the first three.

  Select PowerMac/PReP/MTX/CHRP if configuring for any of the above.

  Select Gemini if configuring for a Synergy Microsystems' Gemini
  series Single Board Computer.  More information is available at:
  <http://www.synergymicro.com/PressRel/97_10_15.html>.

  Select APUS if configuring for a PowerUP Amiga.  More information is
  available at: <http://linux-apus.sourceforge.net/>.

  Note that Total Impact briQ is handled as a CHRP machine.

Synergy-Gemini
CONFIG_GEMINI
  Select Gemini if configuring for a Synergy Microsystems' Gemini
  series Single Board Computer.  More information is available at:
  <http://www.synergymicro.com/PressRel/97_10_15.html>.

Amiga-Apus
CONFIG_APUS
  Select APUS if configuring for a PowerUP Amiga.
  More information is available at:
  <http://linux-apus.sourceforge.net/>.

AltiVec kernel support
CONFIG_ALTIVEC
  This option enables kernel support for the Altivec extensions to the
  PowerPC processor. The kernel currently supports saving and restoring
  altivec registers, and turning on the 'altivec enable' bit so user
  processes can execute altivec instructions.

  This option is only usefully if you have a processor that supports
  altivec (G4, otherwise known as 74xx series), but does not have
  any affect on a non-altivec cpu (it does, however add code to the
  kernel).

  If in doubt, say Y here.

Thermal Management Support
CONFIG_TAU
  G3 and G4 processors have an on-chip temperature sensor called the
  'Thermal Assist Unit (TAU)', which, in theory, can measure the on-die
  temperature within 2-4 degrees Celsius. This option shows the current
  on-die temperature in /proc/cpuinfo if the cpu supports it.

  Unfortunately, on some chip revisions, this sensor is very inaccurate
  and in some cases, does not work at all, so don't assume the cpu
  temp is actually what /proc/cpuinfo says it is.

Interrupt driven TAU driver
CONFIG_TAU_INT
  The TAU supports an interrupt driven mode which causes an interrupt
  whenever the temperature goes out of range. This is the fastest way
  to get notified the temp has exceeded a range. With this option off,
  a timer is used to re-check the temperature periodically.

  However, on some cpus it appears that the TAU interrupt hardware
  is buggy and can cause a situation which would lead unexplained hard
  lockups.

  Unless you are extending the TAU driver, or enjoy kernel/hardware
  debugging, leave this option off.

Average high and low temp
CONFIG_TAU_AVERAGE
  The TAU hardware can compare the temperature to an upper and lower bound.
  The default behaviour is to show both the upper and lower bound in
  /proc/cpuinfo. If the range is large, the temperature is either changing
  a lot, or the TAU hardware is broken (likely on some G4's). If the range
  is small (around 4 degrees), the temperature is relatively stable.

Power management support for PowerBooks
CONFIG_PMAC_PBOOK
  This provides support for putting a PowerBook to sleep; it also
  enables media bay support.  Power management works on the
  PB2400/3400/3500, Wallstreet, Lombard, and Bronze PowerBook G3. You
  must get the power management daemon, pmud, to make it work and you
  must have the /dev/pmu device (see the pmud README).

  Get pmud from <ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/ppclinux/pmud/>.

  If you have a PowerBook, you should say Y.

  You may also want to compile the dma sound driver as a module and
  have it autoloaded. The act of removing the module shuts down the
  sound hardware for more power savings.

APM emulation
CONFIG_PMAC_APM_EMU
  This driver provides an emulated /dev/apm_bios and /proc/apm. The
  first one is mostly intended for XFree to sleep & wakeup properly,
  the second ones provides some battery informations to allow existing
  APM utilities to work. It provides less useful informations than
  tools specifically designed for PowerBooks or /proc/pmu/battery_x

Backlight control for LCD screens
CONFIG_PMAC_BACKLIGHT
  Say Y here to build in code to manage the LCD backlight on a
  Macintosh PowerBook.  With this code, the backlight will be turned
  on and off appropriately on power-management and lid-open/lid-closed
  events; also, the PowerBook button device will be enabled so you can
  change the screen brightness.

ADB raw keycode support
CONFIG_MAC_ADBKEYCODES
  This provides support for sending raw ADB keycodes to console
  devices.  This is the default up to 2.4.0, but in future this may be
  phased out in favor of generic Linux keycodes.  If you say Y here,
  you can dynamically switch via the
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes
  sysctl and with the "keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes=" kernel
  argument.

  This option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  kernel release.
  
  If unsure, say N here.

I2C/SPI Microcode Patch
CONFIG_UCODE_PATCH
  Motorola releases microcode updates for their 8xx CPM modules.  The
  microcode update file has updates for IIC, SMC and USB.  Currently only
  the USB update is available by default, if the MPC8xx USB option is
  enabled.  If in doubt, say 'N' here.

Mouse button 2+3 emulation support
CONFIG_MAC_EMUMOUSEBTN
  This provides generic support for emulating the 2nd and 3rd mouse
  button with keypresses.  If you say Y here, the emulation is still
  disabled by default.  The emulation is controlled by these sysctl
  entries:
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button2_keycode
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button3_keycode

Set high memory pool address
CONFIG_HIGHMEM_START_BOOL
  Unless you know what you are doing you *should not* set this option.

  It can be used to override the default PKMAP_BASE address which
  is the location of the high memory pool.  This can be useful in
  optimizing virtual memory usage in a system.

Set maximum low memory
CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE_BOOL
  Unless you know what you are doing you *should not* set this option.

  It can be used to override the standard calculated value of
  MAX_LOW_MEM. This can be useful in optimizing virtual memory usage
  in a system.

Set custom kernel base address
CONFIG_KERNEL_START_BOOL
  Unless you know what you are doing you *should not* set this option.

  It can be used to override the standard PAGE_OFFSET/KERNELBASE
  value used by the kernel.  This can be useful in controlling
  amount of virtual address space available to the kernel.

Set custom user task size
CONFIG_TASK_SIZE_BOOL
  Unless you know what you are doing you *should not* set this option.

  It can be used to override the standard TASK_SIZE value used
  by the kernel.  This can be useful in controlling amount of
  virtual address space available to user tasks.

Enhanced Real Time Clock Support (/dev/rtc)
CONFIG_PPC_RTC
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
  into your computer.

  If unsure, say Y here.

Support for Open Firmware device tree in /proc
CONFIG_PROC_DEVICETREE
  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
  Firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

RTAS (RunTime Abstraction Services) in /proc
CONFIG_PPC_RTAS
  When you use this option, you will be able to use RTAS from
  userspace.

  RTAS stands for RunTime Abstraction Services and should
  provide a portable way to access and set system information. This is
  commonly used on RS/6000 (pSeries) computers.

  You can access RTAS via the special proc file system entry rtas.
  Don't confuse this rtas entry with the one in /proc/device-tree/rtas
  which is readonly.

  If you don't know if you can use RTAS look into
  /proc/device-tree/rtas. If there are some entries, it is very likely
  that you will be able to use RTAS.

  You can do cool things with rtas. To print out information about
  various sensors in the system, just do a

    $ cat /proc/rtas/sensors

  or if you power off your machine at night but want it running when
  you enter your office at 7:45 am, do a

    # date -d 'tomorrow 7:30' +%s > /proc/rtas/poweron

  and shutdown.

  If unsure, say Y.

Support for Lpar Configuration data in /proc
CONFIG_LPARCFG
  This option adds lparcfg entry as /proc/ppc64/lparcfg which returns
  system configuration info in <key word>=<value> pairs. 

MESH (Power Mac internal SCSI) support
CONFIG_SCSI_MESH
  Many Power Macintoshes and clones have a MESH (Macintosh Enhanced
  SCSI Hardware) SCSI bus adaptor (the 7200 doesn't, but all of the
  other Power Macintoshes do). Say Y to include support for this SCSI
  adaptor. This driver is also available as a module called mesh.o
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Maximum synchronous transfer rate (MB/s) (0 = async)
CONFIG_SCSI_MESH_SYNC_RATE
  On Power Macintoshes (and clones) where the MESH SCSI bus adaptor
  drives a bus which is entirely internal to the machine (such as the
  7500, 7600, 8500, etc.), the MESH is capable of synchronous
  operation at up to 10 MB/s. On machines where the SCSI bus
  controlled by the MESH can have external devices connected, it is
  usually rated at 5 MB/s. 5 is a safe value here unless you know the
  MESH SCSI bus is internal only; in that case you can say 10. Say 0
  to disable synchronous operation.

53C94 (Power Mac external SCSI) support
CONFIG_SCSI_MAC53C94
  On Power Macintoshes (and clones) with two SCSI buses, the external
  SCSI bus is usually controlled by a 53C94 SCSI bus adaptor. Older
  machines which only have one SCSI bus, such as the 7200, also use
  the 53C94. Say Y to include support for the 53C94.

  This driver is also available as a module called mac53c94.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

MACE (Power Mac Ethernet) support
CONFIG_MACE
  Power Macintoshes and clones with Ethernet built-in on the
  motherboard will usually use a MACE (Medium Access Control for
  Ethernet) interface. Say Y to include support for the MACE chip.

  This driver is also available as a module called mace.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Use AAUI port instead of TP by default
CONFIG_MACE_AAUI_PORT
  Some Apple machines (notably the Apple Network Server) which use the
  MACE ethernet chip have an Apple AUI port (small 15-pin connector),
  instead of an 8-pin RJ45 connector for twisted-pair ethernet.  Say
  Y here if you have such a machine.  If unsure, say N.
  The driver will default to AAUI on ANS anyway, and if you use it as
  a module, you can provide the port_aaui=0|1 to force the driver.

BMAC (G3 Ethernet) support
CONFIG_BMAC
  Say Y for support of BMAC Ethernet interfaces. These are used on G3
  computers.

  This driver is also available as a module called bmac.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

GMAC (G4/iBook Ethernet) support
CONFIG_GMAC
  Say Y for support of GMAC Ethernet interfaces. These are used on G4
  and iBook computers.

  This driver is also available as a module called gmac.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

National DP83902AV (Oak Ethernet) support
CONFIG_OAKNET
  Say Y if your machine has this type of Ethernet network card.

  This driver is also available as a module called oaknet.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Video For Linux
CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV
  Support for audio/video capture and overlay devices and FM radio
  cards. The exact capabilities of each device vary. User tools for
  this are available from
  <ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/video4linux/>.

  devices on IBM S/390 or zSeries.
  If you select this option you will also want to select at
  least one of the tape interface options and one of the tape
  hardware options in order to access a tape device.
  This option is also available as a module. The module will be
  called tape390.o and include all selected interfaces.
  The hardware drivers will be seperate modules.
  If unsure, say "Y".

Support for tape character devices
CONFIG_S390_TAPE_CHAR
  Select this option if you want to access your channel-attached
  tape devices using the character device interface.
  This interface is similar to other Linux tape devices like
  SCSI-Tapes (st) and the floppy tape device (ftape).
  If unsure, say "Y".

Support for tape block devices
CONFIG_S390_TAPE_BLOCK
  Select this option if you want to access your channel-attached tape
  devices using the block device interface.  This interface is similar
  to CD-ROM devices on other platforms.  The tapes can only be
  accessed read-only when using this interface.  Have a look at
  Documentation/s390/TAPE for further information about creating
  volumes for and using this interface.  It is safe to say "Y" here.

Support for 3490 tape hardware

CONFIG_CTC
  Select this option if you want to use channel-to-channel networking
  on IBM S/390 or zSeries. This device driver supports real CTC
  coupling using ESCON. It also supports virtual CTCs when running
  under VM. It will use the channel device configuration if this is
  available.  This option is also available as a module which will be
  called ctc.o.  If you do not know what it is, it's safe to say "Y".

XPRAM disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XPRAM
  Select this option if you want to use your expanded storage on S/390
  or zSeries as a disk.  This is useful as a _fast_ swap device if you
  want to access more than 2G of memory when running in 31 bit mode.
  This option is also available as a module which will be called
  xpram.o.  If unsure, say "N".

Fast IRQ handling
CONFIG_FAST_IRQ
  Select this option in order to get the interrupts processed faster
  on your S/390 or zSeries machine.  If selected, after an interrupt
  is processed, the channel subsystem will be asked for other pending
  interrupts which will also be processed before leaving the interrupt
  context.  This speeds up the I/O a lot. Say "Y".

IUCV device support (VM only)
CONFIG_IUCV
  Select this option if you want to use inter-user communication

  obtained by channel subsystem calls. This will enable Linux to process link
  failures and resource accessibility events. Moreover, if you have procfs
  enabled, you'll be able to toggle chpids logically offline and online. Even
  if you don't understand what this means, you should say "Y".

Process warning machine checks
CONFIG_MACHCHK_WARNING
  Select this option if you want the machine check handler on IBM S/390 or 
  zSeries to process warning machine checks (e.g. on power failures). 
  If unsure, say "Y".

Use chscs for Common I/O
CONFIG_CHSC
  Select this option if you want the s390 common I/O layer to use information
  obtained by channel subsystem calls. This will enable Linux to process link
  failures and resource accessibility events. Moreover, if you have procfs
  enabled, you'll be able to toggle chpids logically offline and online. Even
  if you don't understand what this means, you should say "Y".

Kernel support for 31 bit ELF binaries
CONFIG_S390_SUPPORT
  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

Channel Device Configuration
CONFIG_CHANDEV
  The channel device layer is a layer to provide a consistent
  interface for configuration & default machine check (devices
  appearing & disappearing) handling on Linux for s/390 & z/Series
  channel devices.

  s/390 & z/Series channel devices include among others

  lcs (the most common ethernet/token ring/fddi standard on
  zSeries)
  ctc/escon hi speed like serial link standard on zSeries
  claw used to talk to cisco routers.
  qeth gigabit ethernet.

  These devices use two channels one read & one write for
  configuration & communication (& a third channel, the data
  channel the case of gigabit ethernet). The motivation
  behind developing this layer was that there was a lot of
  duplicate code among the channel device drivers for
  configuration.

  Also the lcs & ctc drivers tended to fight over
  3088/08's & 3088/1F's which could be either 2216/3172
  channel attached lcs compatible devices or escon/ctc pipes
  had to be configured separately as they couldn't autodetect,
  this is now simplified by doing the configuration in a single
  place (the channel device layer).

  This layer isn't invasive & it is quite okay to use channel
  drivers which don't use the channel device layer in
  conjunction with drivers which do.

  For more info see the chandev manpage usually distributed in
  <file:Documentation/s390/chandev.8> in the Linux source tree.

  <http://www.inhandelectronics.com/html/omni1.html> for details.

Load kernel using Angel Debug Monitor
CONFIG_ANGELBOOT
  Say Y if you plan to load the kernel using Angel, ARM Ltd's target
  debug stub.  If you are not using Angel, you must say N.  It is
  important to get this setting correct.

CDB89712
CONFIG_ARCH_CDB89712
  This is an evaluation board from Cirrus for the CS89712 processor.  The
  board includes 2 serial ports, Ethernet, IRDA, and expansion headers.
  It comes with 16 MB SDRAM and 8 MB flash ROM.

CLPS-711X internal ROM bootstrap
CONFIG_EP72XX_ROM_BOOT
  If you say Y here, your CLPS711x-based kernel will use the bootstrap
  mode memory map instead of the normal memory map.

  Processors derived from the Cirrus CLPS-711X core support two boot modes.
  Normal mode boots from the external memory device at CS0.  Bootstrap mode
  rearranges parts of the memory map, placing an internal 128 byte bootstrap
  ROM at CS0.  This option performs the address map changes required to
  support booting in this mode.

  You almost surely want to say N here.

Math emulation
CONFIG_FPE_NWFPE
  Say Y to include the NWFPE floating point emulator in the kernel.
  This is necessary to run most binaries. Linux does not currently
  support floating point hardware so you need to say Y here even if
  your machine has an FPA or floating point co-processor podule.

  It is also possible to say M to build the emulator as a module
  (nwfpe.o) or indeed to leave it out altogether. However, unless you
  know what you are doing this can easily render your machine
  unbootable. Saying Y is the safe option.

  You may say N here if you are going to load the Acorn FPEmulator
  early in the bootup.

FastFPE math emulation
CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE
  Say Y here to include the FAST floating point emulator in the kernel.
  This is an experimental much faster emulator which has only 32 bit
  precision for the mantissa.  It does not support any exceptions.
  This makes it very simple, it is approximately 4-8 times faster than
  NWFPE.

  It should be sufficient for most programs.  It is definitely not
  suitable if you do scientific calculations that need double
  precision for iteration formulas that sum up lots of very small
  numbers.  If you do not feel you need a faster FP emulation you
  should better choose NWFPE.

  It is also possible to say M to build the emulator as a module
  (fastfpe.o).  But keep in mind that you should only load the FP
  emulator early in the bootup.  You should never change from NWFPE to
  FASTFPE or vice versa in an active system!

DS1620 thermometer support
CONFIG_DS1620
  Say Y here to include support for the thermal management hardware
  found in the NetWinder. This driver allows the user to control the
  temperature set points and to read the current temperature.

  It is also possible to say M here to build it as a module (ds1620.o)
  It is recommended to be used on a NetWinder, but it is not a
  necessity.

Check for stack overflows
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
  This option make do_IRQ() check for enough stack space beeing left.
  This is safe to enable.

Debug high memory support
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM
  This options enables addition error checking for high memory systems.
  Disable for production systems.

Verbose kernel error messages
CONFIG_DEBUG_ERRORS
  This option controls verbose debugging information which can be
  printed when the kernel detects an internal error. This debugging
  information is useful to kernel hackers when tracking down problems,
  but mostly meaningless to other people. It's safe to say Y unless
  you are concerned with the code size or don't want to see these
  messages.

Compile kernel with frame pointer
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
  If you say Y here, the resulting kernel will be slightly larger and
  slower, but it will give very useful debugging information. If you
  don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able to
  solve problems without frame pointers.

Verbose user fault messages
CONFIG_DEBUG_USER
  When a user program crashes due to an exception, the kernel can
  print a brief message explaining what the problem was. This is
  sometimes helpful for debugging but serves no purpose on a
  production system. Most people should say N here.

Include gdb debugging information in kernel binary
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
  Say Y here to include source-level debugging information in the
  `vmlinux' binary image. This is handy if you want to use gdb or
  addr2line to debug the kernel. It has no impact on the in-memory
  footprint of the running kernel but it can increase the amount of
  time and disk space needed for compilation of the kernel. If in
  doubt say N.

Kernel low-level debugging functions
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL
  Say Y here to include definitions of printascii, printchar, printhex
  in the kernel.  This is helpful if you are debugging code that
  executes before the console is initialized.

Kernel low-level debugging messages via footbridge serial port
CONFIG_DEBUG_DC21285_PORT
  Say Y here if you want the debug print routines to direct their
  output to the serial port in the DC21285 (Footbridge). Saying N
  will cause the debug messages to appear on the first 16550
  serial port.

Kernel low-level debugging messages via UART2
CONFIG_DEBUG_CLPS711X_UART2
  Say Y here if you want the debug print routines to direct their
  output to the second serial port on these devices.  Saying N will
  cause the debug messages to appear on the first serial port.

Kernel log buffer length shift
CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT
  The kernel log buffer has a fixed size of :
      64 kB (2^16) on MULTIQUAD and IA64,
     128 kB (2^17) on S390
      32 kB (2^15) on SMP systems
      16 kB (2^14) on UP systems

  You have the ability to change this size with this paramter which
  fixes the bit shift of to get the buffer length (which must be a
  power of 2). Eg: a value of 16 sets the buffer to 64 kB (2^16).
  The default value of 0 uses standard values above.

Disable pgtable cache
CONFIG_NO_PGT_CACHE
  Normally the kernel maintains a `quicklist' of preallocated
  pagetable structures in order to increase performance. On machines
  with very few pages this may however be a loss. Say Y here to
  disable the pgtable cache.

RISC OS personality
CONFIG_ARTHUR
  Say Y here to include the kernel code necessary if you want to run
  Acorn RISC OS/Arthur binaries under Linux. This code is still very
  experimental; if this sounds frightening, say N and sleep in peace.
  You can also say M here to compile this support as a module (which
  will be called arthur.o).

Initial kernel command line
CONFIG_CMDLINE
  On some architectures (EBSA110 and CATS), there is currently no way
  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these
  architectures, you should supply some command-line options at build
  time by entering them here. As a minimum, you should specify the
  memory size and the root device (e.g., mem=64M root=/dev/nfs).

Kernel-mode alignment trap handler
CONFIG_ALIGNMENT_TRAP
  ARM processors can not fetch/store information which is not
  naturally aligned on the bus, i.e., a 4 byte fetch must start at an
  address divisible by 4. On 32-bit ARM processors, these non-aligned
  fetch/store instructions will be emulated in software if you say
  here, which has a severe performance impact. This is necessary for
  correct operation of some network protocols. With an IP-only
  configuration it is safe to say N, otherwise say Y.

DC21285 serial port support
CONFIG_SERIAL_21285
  If you have a machine based on a 21285 (Footbridge) StrongARM(R)/
  PCI bridge you can enable its onboard serial port by enabling this
  option. The device has major ID 4, minor 64.

Console on DC21285 serial port

  * If you read this note from the configurator, please contact *
  * the Configure.help maintainers.                             *
  The 21285 Footbridge chip can operate in either `host mode' or
  `add-in' mode.  Say Y if your 21285 is in host mode, and therefore
  is the configuration master, otherwise say N. This must not be
  set to Y if the card is used in 'add-in' mode.

MFM hard disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MFM
  Support the MFM hard drives on the Acorn Archimedes both
  on-board the A4x0 motherboards and via the Acorn MFM modules.
  Drives up to 64MB are supported. If you haven't got one of these
  machines or drives just say N.

Old Archimedes floppy (1772) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772
  Support the floppy drive on the Acorn Archimedes (A300, A4x0, A540,
  R140 and R260) series of computers; it supports only 720K floppies
  at the moment. If you don't have one of these machines just answer
  N.

Autodetect hard drive geometry
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MFM_AUTODETECT
  If you answer Y, the MFM code will attempt to automatically detect
  the cylinders/heads/sectors count on your hard drive. WARNING: This
  sometimes doesn't work and it also does some dodgy stuff which
  potentially might damage your drive.

NetWinder /dev/flash support
CONFIG_NWFLASH
  If you say Y here and create a character device /dev/flash with
  major 10 and minor 160 you can manipulate the flash ROM containing
  the NetWinder firmware. Be careful as accidentally overwriting the
  flash contents can render your computer unbootable. On no account
  allow random users access to this device. :-)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called nwflash.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you're not sure, say N.

SRM environment variables in procfs
CONFIG_SRM_ENV
  If you enable this option, a subdirectory inside /proc called
  /proc/srm_environment will give you access to the all important
  SRM environment variables (those which have a name) and also
  to all others (by their internal number).

  SRM is something like a BIOS for Alpha machines. There are some
  other such BIOSes, like AlphaBIOS, which this driver cannot
  support (hey, that's not SRM!).

  Despite the fact that this driver doesn't work on all Alphas (but
  only on those which have SRM as their firmware), it's save to
  build it even if your particular machine doesn't know about SRM
  (or if you intend to compile a generic kernel). It will simply
  not create those subdirectory in /proc (and give you some warning,
  of course).

  This driver is also available as a module and will be called
  srm_env.o then.

Footbridge internal watchdog
CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG
  The Intel Footbridge chip contains a builtin watchdog circuit. Say Y
  here if you wish to use this. Alternatively say M to compile the
  driver as a module, which will be called wdt285.o.

  This driver does not work on all machines. In particular, early CATS
  boards have hardware problems that will cause the machine to simply
  lock up if the watchdog fires.

  "If in doubt, leave it out" - say N.

NetWinder WB83C977 watchdog
CONFIG_977_WATCHDOG
  Say Y here to include support for the WB977 watchdog included in
  NetWinder machines. Alternatively say M to compile the driver as
  a module, which will be called wdt977.o.

  Not sure? It's safe to say N.

IrDA subsystem support
CONFIG_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
  The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
  infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.

  To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
  some user-space utilities like irattach.  For more information, see
  the file <file:Documentation/networking/irda.txt>.  You also want to
  read the IR-HOWTO, available at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to exchange bits of data (vCal, vCard) with a PDA, you
  will need to install some OBEX application, such as OpenObex :
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/>

  This support is also available as a module called irda.o.  If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Ultra (connectionless) protocol
CONFIG_IRDA_ULTRA
  Say Y here to support the connectionless Ultra IRDA protocol.
  Ultra allows to exchange data over IrDA with really simple devices
  (watch, beacon) without the overhead of the IrDA protocol (no handshaking,
  no management frames, simple fixed header).
  Ultra is available as a special socket : socket(AF_IRDA, SOCK_DGRAM, 1);

IrDA cache last LSAP
CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP
  Say Y here if you want IrLMP to cache the last LSAP used.  This
  makes sense since most frames will be sent/received on the same
  connection.  Enabling this option will save a hash-lookup per frame.

  If unsure, say Y.

IrDA Fast RRs
CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR
  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
  when acting as a primary station.
  Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling
  this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly
  necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).

  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when
  receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This
  will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since
  the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around
  time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time.
  If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will
  start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer
  each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time.
  This back-off increase in controlled via
  /proc/sys/net/irda/fast_poll_increase

  If unsure, say Y.

IrDA debugging information
CONFIG_IRDA_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the IrDA subsystem to write debug information
  to your syslog. You can change the debug level in
  /proc/sys/net/irda/debug .
  When this option is enabled, the IrDA also perform many extra internal
  verifications which will usually prevent the kernel to crash in case of
  bugs.

  If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).

IrLAN protocol
CONFIG_IRLAN
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (irlan.o), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and
  makes it possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.

  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points
  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET.  You can also connect
  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc
  networking!

IrNET protocol
CONFIG_IRNET
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrNET protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (irnet.o), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrNET is a PPP driver, so you
  will also need a working PPP subsystem (driver, daemon and
  config)...

  IrNET is an alternate way to transfer TCP/IP traffic over IrDA.  It
  uses synchronous PPP over a set of point to point IrDA sockets.  You
  can use it between Linux machine or with W2k.

IrCOMM protocol
CONFIG_IRCOMM
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (you will get ircomm.o and
  ircomm-tty.o), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  IrCOMM implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to
  use all existing applications that understands TTY's with an
  infrared link.  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP,
  minicom and others.  Enabling this option will create two modules
  called ircomm and ircomm_tty.

IrTTY IrDA Device Driver
CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
  discipline.  If you want to compile it as a module (irtty.o), say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrTTY makes it
  possible to use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that
  are 16550 compatible.  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you
  should probably say Y to this option.  Using IrTTY will however
  limit the speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

  If unsure, say Y.

IrPORT IrDA serial driver
CONFIG_IRPORT_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport.o), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrPORT can be used
  instead of IrTTY and sometimes this can be better.  One example is
  if your IrDA port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK
  with IrPORT since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only.
  You don't need to use irattach with IrPORT, but you just insert it
  the same way as FIR drivers (insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11).  Notice
  that IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited
  to 115200 bps.

  If unsure, say Y.

USB IrDA FIR dongle Device Driver
CONFIG_USB_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the USB IrDA FIR Dongle
  device driver.  If you want to compile it as a module (irda-usb.o),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrDA-USB
  support the various IrDA USB dongles available and most of their
  peculiarities.  Those dongles plug in the USB port of your computer,
  are plug and play, and support SIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.  On the
  other hand, those dongles tend to be less efficient than a FIR
  chipset.

  Please note that the driver is still experimental.  And of course,
  you will need both USB and IrDA support in your kernel...

Datafab MDCFE-B Compact Flash Reader support
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

HP CD-Writer 82xx support
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_HP8200e
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

Lexar Jumpshot Compact Flash Reader
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT       
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called kbtab.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CONFIG_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your
  computer's serial port. These devices are called dongles. Then say Y
  or M to the driver for your particular dongle below.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about serial dongles.

  board.  Boards currently supported include Motorola boards MVME147,
  MVME162, MVME166, MVME167, MVME172, and MVME177.  BVME4000 and
  BVME6000 boards from BVM Ltd are also supported.

MVME147 support
CONFIG_MVME147
  Say Y to include support for early Motorola VME boards.  This will
  build a kernel which can run on MVME147 single-board computers.  If
  you select this option you will have to select the appropriate
  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

MVME162, 166 and 167 support
CONFIG_MVME16x

  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

Use write-through caching for 68060 supervisor accesses
CONFIG_060_WRITETHROUGH
  The 68060 generally uses copyback caching of recently accessed data.
  Copyback caching means that memory writes will be held in an on-chip
  cache and only written back to memory some time later.  Saying Y
  here will force supervisor (kernel) accesses to use writethrough
  caching.  Writethrough caching means that data is written to memory
  straight away, so that cache and memory data always agree.
  Writethrough caching is less efficient, but is needed for some
  drivers on 68060 based systems where the 68060 bus snooping signal
  is hardwired on.  The 53c710 SCSI driver is known to suffer from
  this problem.

  This is the driver for the 7-segment display and LED present on
  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called display7seg.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with a 7-segment display,

CONFIG_ETRAX_PA_BUTTON_BITMASK
  This is a bitmask with information about what bits on PA that
  are used for buttons.
  Most products has a so called TEST button on PA1, if that's true
  use 02 here.
  Use 00 if there are no buttons on PA.
  If the bitmask is <> 00 a button driver will be included in the gpio
  driver. Etrax general I/O support must be enabled.

  The CRIS version of gdb can be used to remotely debug a running
  Linux kernel via the serial debug port.  Provided you have gdb-cris
  installed, run gdb-cris vmlinux, then type

  (gdb) set remotebaud 115200           <- kgdb uses 115200 as default
  (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0        <- maybe you use another port

  This should connect you to your booted kernel (or boot it now if you
  didn't before).  The kernel halts when it boots, waiting for gdb if
  this option is turned on!

Etrax bus waitstates
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_WAITSTATES
  Waitstates for SRAM, Flash and peripherals (not DRAM).  95f8 is a
  good choice for most Axis products...

Etrax bus configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_BUS_CONFIG
  Assorted bits controlling write mode, DMA burst length etc.  104 is
  a good choice for most Axis products...

Etrax SDRAM configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_SDRAM
  Enable this if you use SDRAM chips and configure
  R_SDRAM_CONFIG and R_SDRAM_TIMING as well.

DRAM size (dec, in MB)
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_DRAM_CONFIG
  The R_DRAM_CONFIG register specifies everything on how the DRAM
  chips in the system are connected to the Etrax CPU.  This is
  different depending on the manufacturer, chip type and number of
  chips.  So this value often needs to be different for each Axis
  product.

Etrax DRAM timing
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_DRAM_TIMING
  Different DRAM chips have different speeds.  Current Axis products
  use 50ns DRAM chips which can use the timing: 5611.

Etrax SDRAM configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_SDRAM_CONFIG
  The R_SDRAM_CONFIG register specifies everything on how the SDRAM
  chips in the system are connected to the Etrax CPU.  This is
  different depending on the manufacturer, chip type and number of
  chips.  So this value often needs to be different for each Axis
  product.

Etrax SDRAM timing
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_SDRAM_TIMING
  Different SDRAM chips have different timing.

Etrax General port A direction
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PA_DIR
  Configures the direction of general port A bits.  1 is out, 0 is in.
  This is often totally different depending on the product used.
  There are some guidelines though - if you know that only LED's are
  connected to port PA, then they are usually connected to bits 2-4
  and you can therefore use 1c.  On other boards which don't have the
  LED's at the general ports, these bits are used for all kinds of
  stuff.  If you don't know what to use, it is always safe to put all
  as inputs, although floating inputs isn't good.

Etrax General port A data
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PA_DATA
  Configures the initial data for the general port A bits.  Most
  products should use 00 here.

Etrax General port B config
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_CONFIG
  Configures the type of the general port B bits.  1 is chip select,
  0 is port.  Most products should use 00 here.

Etrax General port B direction
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_DIR
  Configures the direction of general port B bits. 1 is out, 0 is in.
  This is often totally different depending on the product used.  Bits
  0 and 1 on port PB are usually used for I2C communication, but the
  kernel I2C driver sets the appropriate directions itself so you
  don't need to take that into consideration when setting this option.
  If you don't know what to use, it is always safe to put all as
  inputs.

Etrax General port B data
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_DATA
  Configures the initial data for the general port A bits.  Most
  products should use FF here.

Etrax General port device
CONFIG_ETRAX_GPIO
  Enables the Etrax general port device (major 120, minors 0 and 1).
  You can use this driver to access the general port bits. It supports
  these ioctl's:
        #include <linux/etraxgpio.h>
       fd = open("/dev/gpioa", O_RDWR); // or /dev/gpiob
       ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_SETBITS), bits_to_set);
       ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_CLRBITS), bits_to_clear);
       val = ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_READBITS), NULL);
  Remember that you need to setup the port directions appropriately in
  the General configuration.

Etrax parallel data support
CONFIG_ETRAX_PARDATA
  Adds support for writing data to the parallel port par0 of the ETRAX
  100.  If you create a character special file with major number 126,
  you can write to the data bits of par0.
  Note: you need to disable Etrax100 parallel port support.

Etrax parallel LCD (HD44780) Driver
CONFIG_ETRAX_LCD_HD44780
  Adds support for a HD44780 controlled LCD connected to the parallel
  port par0 of the Etrax.

Etrax Serial port ser0 support

  Enables the ETRAX 100 serial driver for ser0 (ttyS0)
  You probably want this enabled.

/proc/serial entry
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_PROC_ENTRY
  Enables /proc/serial entry where errors and statistics can be
  viewed.  CONFIG_PROC_FS must also be set for this to work.

Etrax Serial port fast flush of DMA using fast timer API
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_FAST_TIMER
  Select this to have the serial DMAs flushed at a higher rate than
  normally, possible by using the fast timer API, the timeout is
  approx. 4 character times.
  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_FLUSH_DMA_FAST
  Select this to have the serial DMAs flushed at a higher rate than
  normally possible through a fast timer interrupt (currently at
  15360 Hz).
  If unsure, say N.

  Number of timer ticks between flush of receive fifo (1 tick = 10ms).
  Try 0-3 for low latency applications.  Approx 5 for high load
  applications (e.g. PPP).  Maybe this should be more adaptive some
  day...

  Options: Probed, 2k, 8k, 16k.
  (Probing works for 2k and 8k but not that well for 16k)

Etrax DS1302 Real-Time Clock driver
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302
  Enables the driver for the DS1302 Real-Time Clock battery-backed
  chip on some products.  The kernel reads the time when booting, and
  the date can be set using ioctl(fd, RTC_SET_TIME, &rt) with rt a
  rtc_time struct (see <file:include/asm-cris/rtc.h>) on the /dev/rtc
  device, major 121.  You can check the time with cat /proc/rtc, but
  normal time reading should be done using libc function time and
  friends.

Etrax DS1302 RST on the Generic Port
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_RST_ON_GENERIC_PORT
  If your product has the RST signal line for the DS1302 RTC on the

  (just like the SCL and SDA lines).

Etrax DS1302 RST bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_RSTBIT
  This is the bit number for the RST signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  the selected port. If you have selected the generic port then it
  should be bit 27, otherwise your best bet is bit 5.

Etrax DS1302 SCL bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_SCLBIT
  This is the bit number for the SCL signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  Port PB. This is probably best left at 3.

Etrax DS1302 SDA bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_SDABIT
  This is the bit number for the SDA signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  Port PB. This is probably best left at 2.

  reset.

ARTPEC-1 support
CONFIG_JULIETTE
  The ARTPEC-1 is a video-compression chip used in the AXIS 2100
  network camera, which is built around an ETRAX-100 board.  With this
  option selected, the ETRAX kernel configures a DMA channel at boot
  time to talk to the chip.

Axis flash-map support
CONFIG_ETRAX_AXISFLASHMAP
  This option enables MTD mapping of flash devices.  Needed to use
  flash memories.  If unsure, say Y.

Byte-offset of partition table sector
CONFIG_ETRAX_PTABLE_SECTOR
  Byte-offset of the partition table in the first flash chip.
  The default value is 64kB and should not be changed unless
  you know exactly what you are doing. The only valid reason
  for changing this is when the flash block size is bigger
  than 64kB (e.g. when using two parallel 16 bit flashes).

Enable Etrax100 watchdog
CONFIG_ETRAX_WATCHDOG
  Enable the built-in watchdog timer support on Etrax100 embedded
  network computers.

  Select one of the four serial ports as a rescue port.  The default
  is port 0.

Serial-1
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER1
  Use serial port 1 as the rescue port.

Serial-2
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER2
  Use serial port 2 as the rescue port.

Serial-3
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER3
  Use serial port 3 as the rescue port.

RIO Hardware Watchdog support
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_RIO
  Say Y here to support the hardware watchdog capability on Sun RIO
  machines.  The watchdog timeout period is normally one minute but
  can be changed with a boot-time parameter.

CP1XXX Hardware Watchdog support
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_CP1XXX
  This is the driver for the hardware watchdog timers present on
  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpwatchdog.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with hardware watchdog,
  you should say N to this option.

# Choice: ia64type
Itanium
CONFIG_ITANIUM
  Select your IA-64 processor type.  The default is Intel Itanium.
  This choice is safe for all IA-64 systems, but may not perform
  optimally on systems with, say, Itanium 2 or newer processors.

Itanium 2
CONFIG_MCKINLEY
  Select this to configure for an Itanium 2 (McKinley) processor.

# Choice: ia64system
IA-64 system type
CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC
  This selects the system type of your hardware.  A "generic" kernel
  will run on any supported IA-64 system.  However, if you configure
  a kernel for your specific system, it will be faster and smaller.

  generic        For any supported IA-64 system
  DIG-compliant  For DIG ("Developer's Interface Guide") compliant systems
  HP             For HP systems
  SGI-SN2        For SGI SN2 systems
  Ski-simulator  For the HP simulator (<http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/ski/>)

  If you don't know what to do, choose "generic".

CONFIG_IA64_HP_ZX1
  Build a kernel that runs on HP zx1-based systems.  This adds support
  for the zx1 IOMMU and makes root bus bridges appear in PCI config space
  (required for zx1 agpgart support).

# Choice: pagesize
Kernel page size
CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB
  This lets you select the page size of the kernel.  For best IA-64
  performance, a page size of 8KB or 16KB is recommended.  For best
  IA-32 compatibility, a page size of 4KB should be selected (the vast
  majority of IA-32 binaries work perfectly fine with a larger page
  size).  For Itanium systems, do NOT chose a page size larger than
  16KB.

  4KB                For best IA-32 compatibility
  8KB                For best IA-64 performance
  16KB               For best IA-64 performance
  64KB               Not for Itanium.

  If you don't know what to do, choose 8KB.

Enable Itanium B-step specific code
CONFIG_ITANIUM_BSTEP_SPECIFIC
  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system
  with a B-step CPU.  Only B3 step CPUs are supported.  You have a B3-step
  CPU if the "revision" field in /proc/cpuinfo is equal to 4.  If the
  "revision" field shows a number bigger than 4, you do not have to turn
  on this option.

Enable IA-64 Machine Check Abort
CONFIG_IA64_MCA
  Say Y here to enable machine check support for IA-64.  If you're
  unsure, answer Y.

Use PAL_HALT_LIGHT in idle loop
CONFIG_IA64_PAL_IDLE
  Say Y here to enable use of PAL_HALT_LIGHT in the cpu_idle loop.
  This allows the CPU to enter a low power state when idle.  You
  can enable CONFIG_IA64_PALINFO and check /proc/pal/cpu0/power_info
  to see the power consumption and latency for this state.  If you're
  unsure your firmware supports it, answer N.

Disable IA-64 Virtual Hash Page Table
CONFIG_DISABLE_VHPT
  The Virtual Hash Page Table (VHPT) enhances virtual address
  translation performance.  Normally you want the VHPT active but you
  can select this option to disable the VHPT for debugging.  If you're
  unsure, answer N.

Turn on compare-and-exchange bug checking (slow!)
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_CMPXCHG
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64
  compare-and-exchange instructions.  This is slow!  Itaniums
  from step B3 or later don't have this problem. If you're unsure,
  select N.

IA64 IRQ bug checking
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_IRQ
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64 irq_save
  and restore instructions.  It's useful for tracking down spinlock
  problems, but slow!  If you're unsure, select N.

Early printk support
CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK
  Selecting this option uses a UART or VGA screen (or both) for
  printk() output before the consoles are initialised.  It is useful
  for debugging problems early in the boot process, but only if you
  have a serial terminal or a VGA screen attached.  If you're unsure,
  select N.

Early printk on serial port
CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK_UART
  Select this option to use a serial port for early printk() output.
  You must also select either CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK_UART_BASE or
  CONFIG_SERIAL_HCDP.  If you select CONFIG_SERIAL_HCDP, early
  printk() output will appear on the first console device described by
  the HCDP.  If you set CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK_UART_BASE, the HCDP
  will be ignored.

UART base address
CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK_UART_BASE
  The physical MMIO address of the UART to use for early printk().
  This overrides any UART located using the EFI HCDP table.

Early printk on VGA
CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK_VGA
  Select this option to use VGA for early printk() output.

Print possible IA64 hazards to console
CONFIG_IA64_PRINT_HAZARDS
  Selecting this option prints more information for Illegal Dependency
  Faults, that is, for Read after Write, Write after Write or Write
  after Read violations.  If you're unsure, select Y.

Performance monitor support
CONFIG_PERFMON
  Selects whether support for the IA-64 performance monitor hardware
  is included in the kernel.  This makes some kernel data-structures a
  little bigger and slows down execution a bit, but it is still
  usually a good idea to turn this on.  If you're unsure, say N.

/proc/pal support
CONFIG_IA64_PALINFO
  If you say Y here, you are able to get PAL (Processor Abstraction
  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
  and the PAL firmware version in use.

  To use this option, you have to check that the "/proc file system
  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

PPC4xx DMA controller support
CONFIG_PPC4xx_DMA
  Select this to enable support for the PPC4xx general purpose DMA
  controller.

ttyS0 device
CONFIG_UART0_TTYS0
  This option reverses the mapping between the hardware UART and software
  device.  Selecting UART0 gives the normal mapping of UART0=ttyS0 and
  UART1=ttyS1.  Selecting UART1 gives the reverse mapping of UART0=ttyS1
  and UART1=ttyS0.  Most people will use UART0.

PowerPC 405 on-chip ethernet
CONFIG_IBM_OCP_ENET
  If you want to use the 405 built-in ethernet select this.

CONFIG_IBM_OCP_ENET_ERROR_MSG
  Enable this option to print verbose debug messages for troubleshooting.

PowerPC 405 on-chip ethernet -- Number of receive buffers
CONFIG_IBM_OCP_ENET_RX_BUFF
  Number of ethernet receive (read) buffers.  Unless you know what you
  are doing the default should be fine.

PowerPC 405 on-chip ethernet -- Number of transmit buffers
CONFIG_IBM_OCP_ENET_TX_BUFF
  Number of ethernet transmit (write) buffers.  Unless you know what
  you are doing the default should be fine.

PowerPC 405 on-chip ethernet -- Amount of bytes to Reserve on a skb
CONFIG_IBM_OCP_ENET_SKB_RES
  Many standard ethernet drivers need to reserve 2 bytes of data
  on the skb before giving the data ptr to the hardware. This is
  so the IP data will be 16-byte aligned when it goes up the stack.
  This is a requirement for some processors and it can cause major
  slow downs on others. The 405GP dose not have problems with the 
  misaligned data so the default is 0. If you need to route the
  incoming ethernet packets to another device that has alignment
  requirements this can help remove a data copy. A value of 2 can
  help at getting 16-byte aligned IP data for another device. A
  larger value can be used when routing to a IP tunnel device.
  Make sure XXX_DESC_SIZE - XXX_SKB_RES >= 1514, or larger if VLANS
  are used.

PPC 405 I2C Algorithm
CONFIG_PPC405_I2C_ALGO
  Enable this option to use the built-in I2C on your 405.

PPC 405 I2C Adapter
CONFIG_PPC405_I2C_ADAP
  Enable this option to use the built-in I2C on your 405.

/proc/efi/vars support
CONFIG_EFI_VARS
  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
  Interface) variable information in /proc/efi/vars.  You may read,
  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

  To use this option, you have to check that the "/proc file system
  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

Kernel support for IA-32 emulation
CONFIG_IA32_SUPPORT
  IA64 processors can run IA32 (that is, x86) binaries by emulating
  the IA32 instruction set.  Say Y here to build in kernel support for
  this.  If in doubt, say Y.

Physical memory granularity (16 MB)
CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_16MB
  IA64 identity-mapped regions use a large page size.  We'll call such
  large pages "granules".  If you can think of a better name that's
  unambiguous, let us know...  Unless your identity-mapped regions are
  very large, select a granule size of 16MB.

Physical memory granularity (64 MB)
CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_64MB
  IA64 identity-mapped regions use a large page size.  We'll call such
  large pages "granules".  If you can think of a better name that's
  unambiguous, let us know...  Unless your identity-mapped regions are
  very large, select a granule size of 16MB.  (This is the "large" choice.)

Enable SGI SN extra debugging code
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_DEBUG
  Turns on extra debugging code in the SGI SN (Scalable NUMA) platform
  for IA64.  Unless you are debugging problems on an SGI SN IA64 box,
  say N.

Enable SGI Medusa Simulator Support
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_SIM
  If you are compiling a kernel that will run under SGI's IA64
  simulator (Medusa) then say Y, otherwise say N.

PCIBA Support
CONFIG_PCIBA
  IRIX PCIBA-inspired user mode PCI interface for the SGI SN (Scalable
  NUMA) platform for IA64.  Unless you are compiling a kernel for an              SGI SN IA64 box, say N.

Enable protocol mode for the L1 console
SERIAL_SGI_L1_PROTOCOL
  Uses protocol mode instead of raw mode for the level 1 console on the
  SGI SN (Scalable NUMA) platform for IA64.  If you are compiling for
  an SGI SN box then Y is the recommended value, otherwise say N.

Directly Connected Compact Flash support
CONFIG_CF_ENABLER
  Compact Flash is a small, removable mass storage device introduced
  in 1994 originally as a PCMCIA device.  If you say `Y' here, you
  compile in support for Compact Flash devices directly connected to
  a SuperH processor.  A Compact Flash FAQ is available at
  <http://www.compactflash.org/faqs/faq.htm>.

  If your board has "Directly Connected" CompactFlash at area 5 or 6,
  you may want to enable this option.  Then, you can use CF as
  primary IDE drive (only tested for SanDisk).

  If in doubt, select 'N'.

Kernel debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL
  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
  identify kernel problems.

Debug memory allocations
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
  memory.

Memory mapped I/O debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT
  Say Y here to get warned whenever an attempt is made to do I/O on
  obviously invalid addresses such as those generated when ioremap()
  calls are forgotten.  Memory mapped I/O will go through an extra
  check to catch access to unmapped ISA addresses, an access method
  that can still be used by old drivers that are being ported from
  2.0/2.2.

Spinlock debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
  deadlocks are also debuggable.

Additional run-time checks
CONFIG_CHECKING
  Enables some internal consistency checks for kernel debugging.
  You should normally say N.

Read-write spinlock debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_RWLOCK
  If you say Y here then read-write lock processing will count how many
  times it has tried to get the lock and issue an error message after
  too many attempts.  If you suspect a rwlock problem or a kernel
  hacker asks for this option then say Y.  Otherwise say N.

Semaphore debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_SEMAPHORE
  If you say Y here then semaphore processing will issue lots of
  verbose debugging messages.  If you suspect a semaphore problem or a
  kernel hacker asks for this option then say Y.  Otherwise say N.

Verbose BUG() reporting (adds 70K)
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
  Say Y here to make BUG() panics output the file name and line number
  of the BUG call as well as the EIP and oops trace.  This aids
  debugging but costs about 70-100K of memory.

Include kgdb kernel debugger
CONFIG_KGDB
  Include in-kernel hooks for kgdb, the Linux kernel source level
  debugger.  For i386 architecture there is project page at
  <http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/>.

  enter what you would like to add in the next question.

Include kgdb kernel debugger
CONFIG_KWDB
  Include in-kernel hooks for kdb, the source level debugger for the
  PA-RISC port.

IODC console
CONFIG_IODC_CONSOLE
  IODC is HP's pre-PCI standard for device identification (a la PCI
  vendor, device IDs), detection, configuration, initialization and so
  on.  It also can provide firmware function to do the actual IO,
  which are slow, not really defined for runtime usage and generally
  not desirable.

  See <http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/doc/parisc/IODC.txt.html>
  for the gory details.

  Say Y here to enable use of the IODC firmware functions for console
  I/O.  This is only useful on older PA-RISC workstations.  If in
  doubt, say Y.

U2/Uturn I/O MMU
CONFIG_IOMMU_CCIO
  Say Y here to enable DMA management routines for the first
  generation of PA-RISC cache-coherent machines.  Programs the
  U2/Uturn chip in "Virtual Mode" and use the I/O MMU.

LBA/Elroy PCI support
CONFIG_PCI_LBA
  Say Y here to give the PA-RISC kernel access to PCI configuration
  and IO-port space on PA-RISC workstations equipped with a Lower Bus

BareCPU
CONFIG_SH_UNKNOWN
  "Bare CPU" aka "unknown" means an SH-based system which is not one
  of the specific ones mentioned above, which means you need to enter
  all sorts of stuff like CONFIG_MEMORY_START because the config
  system doesn't already know what it is.  You get a machine vector
  without any platform-specific code in it, so things like the RTC may
  not work.

  This option is for the early stages of porting to a new machine.

Memory on LMI
CONFIG_ST40_LMI_MEMORY
  Currently all ST40 CPUs have two external buses the
  'Local Memory Interface' (LMI) which supports SDRAM and
  DDR SDRAM, and the 'Enhanced flash Memory Interface' (EMI),
  which supports SDRAM, Flash, peripherials and MPX. Linux
  can support memory on either of these buses, it is simply
  necessary to specify its base address. This option is simply
  a shortcut method of specifying that RAM starts from the
  bottom of the LMI.

Physical memory start address
CONFIG_MEMORY_START
  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
  does not specify the range that RAM takes.  

  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
  set to 08000000, unless you selected one of the following
  processor types: SolutionEngine, Overdrive, HP620, HP680, HP690,
  in which case the start address will be set to 0c000000.

  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which is not already
  known by the config system.  Changing it from the known correct
  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

HD64465 start address
CONFIG_HD64465_IOBASE
  The default setting of the HD64465 IO base address is 0xb0000000.

  Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.
  
Early printk support
CONFIG_SH_EARLY_PRINTK
  Say Y here to redirect kernel printk messages to the serial port
  used by the SH-IPL bootloader, starting very early in the boot
  process and ending when the kernel's serial console is initialised.
  This option is only useful porting the kernel to a new machine,
  when the kernel may crash or hang before the serial console is
  initialised. If unsure, say N.

SuperH SCI (serial) support
CONFIG_SH_SCI
  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to transfer data
  over SCI (Serial Communication Interface) and/or SCIF (Serial
  Communication Interface with FIFO) which are built into the Hitachi
  SuperH processor.  The option provides 1 to 3 (depending
  on the CPU model) standard Linux tty devices, /dev/ttySC[012]; one
  of these is normally used as the system console.

  If in doubt, press "y".

Use LinuxSH standard BIOS
CONFIG_SH_STANDARD_BIOS
  Say Y here if your target has the gdb-sh-stub
  package from www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS)
  in FLASH or EPROM.  The kernel will use standard BIOS calls during
  boot for various housekeeping tasks (including calls to read and
  write characters to a system console, get a MAC address from an
  on-board Ethernet interface, and shut down the hardware).  Note this
  does not work with machines with an existing operating system in
  mask ROM and no flash (WindowsCE machines fall in this category).
  If unsure, say N.

GDB Stub kernel debug
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL_WITH_GDB_STUB
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to remotely debug the SuperH
  kernel using gdb, if you have the gdb-sh-stub package from
  www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS) in FLASH or
  EPROM.  This enlarges your kernel image disk size by several
  megabytes but allows you to load, run and debug the kernel image
  remotely using gdb.  This is only useful for kernel hackers.  If
  unsure, say N.

Console output to GDB
CONFIG_GDB_CONSOLE
  If you are using GDB for remote debugging over a serial port and
  would like kernel messages to be formatted into GDB $O packets so
  that GDB prints them as program output, say 'Y'.

802.1Q VLAN Support
CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q
  Select this and you will be able to create 802.1Q VLAN interfaces on your
  ethernet interfaces.  802.1Q VLAN supports almost everything a regular
  ethernet interface does, including firewalling, bridging, and of course
  IP traffic.  You will need the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in
  order to effectively use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more
  information:  <http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html>  If unsure,
  you can safely say 'N'.

ARC console support
CONFIG_ARC_CONSOLE
  Support for the PROM-based console on MIPS machines built according
  to the Advanced Risc Computing specification, which is now (2001)
  dead.  These included boxes from Deskstation, Acer, Olivetti and
  NEC.  There is a history at <http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html>.

  instruction sequences for cache and TLB operations.  Curiously,
  there is no documentation on it at the ARM corporate website.

  Say Y if you want support for the ARM926T processor.
  Otherwise, say N.

Support CPU clock change (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
  CPU clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of the
  running CPU on the fly. This is a nice method to save battery power,
  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU
  consumes. Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
  clock speed, you need some userland tools (which still have to be
  written) to implement the policy. If you don't understand what this
  is all about, it's safe to say 'N'.

SiS
CONFIG_DRM_SIS
  Choose this option if you have a SIS graphics card. AGP support is
  required for this driver to work.

Etrax Ethernet slave support (over lp0/1)
CONFIG_ETRAX_ETHERNET_LPSLAVE

CONFIG_ETRAX_POWERBUTTON_BIT
  Configure where power button is connected.

Root device name
CONFIG_ETRAX_ROOT_DEVICE
  Specifies the device that should be mounted as root file system
  when booting from flash. The axisflashmap driver adds an additional
  mtd partition for the appended root file system image, so this option
  should normally be the mtdblock device for the partition after the
  last partition in the partition table.

Serial port 0 enabled
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_PORT0
  Enables the ETRAX 100 serial driver for ser0 (ttyS0)
  Normally you want this on, unless you use external DMA 1 that uses
  the same DMA channels.

Shutdown bit on port CSP0
CONFIG_ETRAX_SHUTDOWN_BIT
  Configure what pin on CSPO-port that is used for controlling power
  supply.

Software Shutdown Support
CONFIG_ETRAX_SOFT_SHUTDOWN

  controller.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpqphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  When in doubt, say N.

Enable autotest (llsc). Option to run cache test instead of booting
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_AUTOTEST
  Build a kernel used for hardware validation. If you include the
  keyword "autotest" on the boot command line, the kernel does NOT boot.
  Instead, it starts all cpus and runs cache coherency tests instead.

  If unsure, say N.

  to work.  Note that you must have this enabled to do any other IPMI
  things.

  IPMI is a standard for managing sensors (temperature,
  voltage, etc.) in a system.

  See Documentation/IPMI.txt for more details on the driver.

  If unsure, say N.

Generate a panic event to all BMCs on a panic
CONFIG_IPMI_PANIC_EVENT
  When a panic occurs, this will cause the IPMI message handler to
  generate an IPMI event describing the panic to each interface
  registered with the message handler.

Device interface for IPMI
CONFIG_IPMI_DEVICE_INTERFACE
  This provides an IOCTL interface to the IPMI message handler so
  userland processes may use IPMI.  It supports poll() and select().

IPMI KCS handler
CONFIG_IPMI_KCS
  Provides a driver for a KCS-style interface to a BMC.

IPMI Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_IPMI_WATCHDOG
  This enables the IPMI watchdog timer.

CRC32 functions
CONFIG_CRC32
  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
  modules require CRC32 functions, but a module built outside the
  kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC32 functions
  require that you say M or Y here.

Chassis LCD and LED support
CONFIG_CHASSIS_LCD_LED
  Say Y here if you want to enable support for the Heartbeat,
  Disk/Network activities LEDs on some PA-RISC machines,
  or support for the LCD that can be found on recent material.

  This has nothing to do with LED State support for A, J and E class.

  If unsure, say Y.

VSC/GSC/HSC bus support
CONFIG_GSC
  The VSC, GSC and HSC busses were used from the earliest 700-series
  workstations up to and including the C360/J2240 workstations.  They
  were also used in servers from the E-class to the K-class.  They
  are not found in B1000, C3000, J5000, A500, L1000, N4000 and upwards.
  If in doubt, say "Y".

Wax I/O support
CONFIG_GSC_WAX
  Say Y here to support the Wax multifunction chip found in some
  older systems, including B/C/D/R class and 715/64, 715/80 and
  715/100.  Wax includes an EISA adapter, a serial port (not always
  used), a HIL interface chip and is also known to be used as the
  GSC bridge for an X.25 GSC card.

GSCtoPCI/Dino PCI support
CONFIG_GSC_DINO
  Say Y here to support the Dino & Cujo GSC to PCI bridges found in
  machines from the B132 to the C360, the J2240 and the A180.  Some
  GSC/HSC cards (eg gigabit & dual 100 Mbit Ethernet) have a Dino on
  the card, and you also need to say Y here if you have such a card.
  Note that Dino also supplies one of the serial ports on certain
  machines.  If in doubt, say Y.

HPET timers
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
  Use the IA-PC HPET (High Precision Event Timer) to manage
  time in preference to the PIT and RTC, if a HPET is
  present.  The HPET provides a stable time base on SMP
  systems, unlike the RTC, but it is more expensive to access,
  as it is off-chip.  You can find the HPET spec at
  <http://www.intel.com/labs/platcomp/hpet/hpetspec.htm>.

  If unsure, say Y.

IOMMU support
CONFIG_GART_IOMMU
  Support the K8 IOMMU. Needed to run systems with more than 4GB of memory
  properly with 32-bit PCI devices that do not support DAC (Double Address
  Cycle). The IOMMU can be turned off at runtime with the iommu=off parameter.
  Normally the kernel will take the right choice by itself.
  If unsure say Y

Debug __init statements
CONFIG_INIT_DEBUG
  Fill __init and __initdata at the end of boot. This helps debugging
  invalid uses of __init and __initdata after initialization.	

Force IOMMU to on
CONFIG_IOMMU_DEBUG
  Force the IOMMU to on even when you have less than 4GB of memory and add
  debugging code.
  Can be disabled at boot time with iommu=noforce.

IOMMU leak tracing
CONFIG_IOMMU_LEAK
  Add a simple leak tracer to the IOMMU code. This is useful when you
  are debugging a buggy device driver that leaks IOMMU mappings.

pSeries Hypervisor Virtual Console support
CONFIG_HVC_CONSOLE
  pSeries machines when partitioned support a hypervisor virtual
  console. This driver allows each pSeries partition to have a console
  which is accessed via the HMC.

CONFIG_CRYPTO
  This option provides the core Cryptographic API.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC
  HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (RFC2104).
  This is required for IPSec.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_NULL
  These are 'Null' algorithms, used by IPsec, which do nothing.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD4
  MD4 message digest algorithm (RFC1320).
  
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD5
  MD5 message digest algorithm (RFC1321).

CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1
  SHA-1 secure hash standard (FIPS 180-1/DFIPS 180-2).

CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256
  SHA256 secure hash standard (DFIPS 180-2).

  This version of SHA implements a 256 bit hash with 128 bits of
  security against collision attacks.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512
  SHA512 secure hash standard (DFIPS 180-2).

  This version of SHA implements a 512 bit hash with 256 bits of
  security against collision attacks.

  This code also includes SHA-384, a 384 bit hash with 192 bits
  of security against collision attacks.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_DES
  DES cipher algorithm (FIPS 46-2), and Triple DES EDE (FIPS 46-3).

CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLOWFISH
  Blowfish cipher algorithm, by Bruce Schneier.

  This is a variable key length cipher which can use keys from 32
  bits to 448 bits in length.  It's fast, simple and specifically
  designed for use on "large microprocessors".

  See also <http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html>.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH
  Twofish cipher algorithm.

  Twofish was submitted as an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  candidate cipher by researchers at CounterPane Systems.  It is a
  16 round block cipher supporting key sizes of 128, 192, and 256
  bits.

  See also:
  http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html

CONFIG_CRYPTO_SERPENT
  Serpent cipher algorithm, by Anderson, Biham & Knudsen.

  Keys are allowed to be from 0 to 256 bits in length, in steps
  of 8 bits.

  See also:
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html

CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES
  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael 
  algorithm.

  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing 
  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback 
  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is 
  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well 
  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also 
  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are 
  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.	

  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits	  

  See http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/ for more information.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAST5
  CAST5 (CAST-128) cipher algorithm.

  The CAST5 encryption algorithm (synonymous with CAST-128) is
  described in RFC2144.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAST6
  CAST6 (CAST-256) cipher algorithm.
  
  The CAST6 encryption algorithm (synonymous with CAST-256) is
  described in RFC2612.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_ARC4
  ARC4 cipher algorithm.
  
  This is a stream cipher using keys ranging from 8 bits to 2048
  bits in length.  ARC4 is commonly used in protocols such as WEP 
  and SSL.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEFLATE
  This is the Deflate algorithm (RFC1951), specified for use in
  IPSec with the IPCOMP protocol (RFC3173, RFC2394).

  You will most probably want this if using IPSec.

CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST
  Quick & dirty crypto test module.
  
CONFIG_SOUND_WM97XX
  Say Y here to support the Wolfson WM9705 and WM9712 touchscreen
  controllers. These controllers are mainly found in PDA's 
  i.e. Dell Axim and Toshiba e740

  This is experimental code.
  Please see Documentation/wolfson-touchscreen.txt for
  a complete list of parameters.
  
  In order to use this driver, a char device called wm97xx with a major
  number of 10 and minor number 16 will have to be created under 
  /dev/touchscreen.
  
  e.g.
  mknod /dev/touchscreen/wm97xx c 10 16

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here.  The module will be called ac97_plugin_wm97xx.o.
  
  If unsure, say N.
