INTRODUCTION:

This is a driver for the TI-GRAPH LINK USB (aka SilverLink) cable, a cable 
designed by TI for connecting their TI8x/9x calculators to a computer 
(PC or Mac usually).

If you need more information, please visit the 'SilverLink drivers' homepage 
at the above URL.

WHAT YOU NEED:

A TI calculator of course and a program capable to communicate with your 
calculator.
TiLP will work for sure (since I am his developer !). yal92 may be able to use
it by changing tidev for tiglusb (may require some hacking...).

HOW TO USE IT:

You must have first compiled USB support, support for your specific USB host
controller (UHCI or OHCI).

Next, (as root) from your appropriate modules directory (lib/modules/2.5.XX):

       insmod usb/usbcore.o
       insmod usb/usb-uhci.o  <OR>  insmod usb/ohci-hcd.o
       insmod tiglusb.o

If it is not already there (it usually is), create the device:

       mknod /dev/tiglusb0 c 115 16

You will have to set permissions on this device to allow you to read/write
from it:

       chmod 666 /dev/tiglusb0
       
Now you are ready to run a linking program such as TiLP. Be sure to configure 
it properly (RTFM).
       
MODULE PARAMETERS:

  You can set these with:  insmod tiglusb NAME=VALUE
  There is currently no way to set these on a per-cable basis.

  NAME: timeout
  TYPE: integer
  DEFAULT: 15
  DESC: Timeout value in tenth of seconds. If no data is available once this 
       time has expired then the driver will return with a timeout error.

QUIRKS:

The following problem seems to be specific to the link cable since it appears 
on all platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X). 

In some very particular cases, the driver returns with success but
without any data. The application should retry a read operation at least once.

HOW TO CONTACT US:

You can email me at roms@lpg.ticalc.org. Please prefix the subject line
with "TIGLUSB: " so that I am certain to notice your message.
You can also mail JB at jb@jblache.org: he has written the first release of 
this driver but he better knows the Mac OS-X driver.

CREDITS:

The code is based on dabusb.c, printer.c and scanner.c !
The driver has been developed independantly of Texas Instruments.
