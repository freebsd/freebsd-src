OVERVIEW

This README addresses issues regarding how to configure the kernel to access a
USB scanner.  Although the driver was originally conceived for USB HP
scanners, it's general enough so that it can be used with most other USB
scanners.  Also, one can pass the USB Vendor and Product IDs using module
parameters for unknown scanners.

There are two drivers for SCSI-over-USB scanners: 
* The "hpusbscsi" module for Hewlett-Packard 53xx series, Hewlett-Packard 7400,
  Minolta Scan Dual II, Minolta Elite II
* The "microtek" module for the Microtek Scanmaker X6

In addition to the kernel driver, user-space tools like SANE are necessary to
actually use the scanner.  SANE ("Scanner Access Now Easy") provides drivers
for a variety of USB scanners.  See the appropriate SANE man page for details,
e.g. man sane-usb and man sane-hp (for HP scanners).

NOTE: Just because a product is detected by this driver does not mean that
applications exist that support the product.  It's in the hopes that this will
allow developers a means to produce applications that will support the listed
USB products.

REQUIREMENTS

A host with a USB port.  Ideally, either a UHCI (Intel), OHCI (Compaq and
others) or EHCI hardware should work.  

Using "make menuconfig" or your preferred method for configuring the kernel,
select "Support for USB", "OHCI/UHCI/EHCI" depending on your hardware, "USB
Scanner support", and "Preliminary USB device filesystem".  Compile and
install the modules (you may need to execute "depmod -a" to update the module
dependencies).  If any of the USB sections were compiled into the kernel, a
reboot is necessary.  NOTE: Updating the boot disk with "lilo" may also be
required.  Testing was performed only as modules, YMMV.

Up to 16 scanners can be connected/used simultaneously.  If devfs support is
enabled, see next section.  Otherwise, the device files must be created
manually if they don't exist yet, either by MAKEDEV or mknod.

MAKEDEV method:
  cd /dev
  MAKEDEV usb
  Check that the device files "/dev/usb/scanner0" - "/dev/usb/scanner15" have
  been created.

mknod method:
  mknod /dev/usb/scanner0 c 180 48
  mknod /dev/usb/scanner1 c 180 49
                  . 
                  .
  mknod /dev/usb/scanner15 c 180 63

Set appropriate permissions for /dev/usb/scanner[0-15] (don't forget
about group and world permissions).  Both read and write permissions
are required for proper operation.  For example:
  chmod 666 /dev/usb/scanner0

Load the appropriate modules (if compiled as modules):

  modprobe usb-ohci (or uhci, usb-uhci, ehci)
  modprobe scanner


DEVFS

The later versions of the Linux kernel (2.4.8'ish) included a dynamic
device filesystem call "devfs".  With devfs, there is no need to
create the device files as explained above; instead, they are
dynamically created for you.  For USB Scanner, the device is created
in /dev/usb/scannerX where X can range from 0 to 15 depending on the
number of scanners connected to the system.

To see if you have devfs, issue the command "cat /proc/filesytems".
If devfs is listed you should be ready to go.  You should also have a
process running called "devfsd".  In order to make sure, issue the
command "ps aux | grep '[d]evfsd'".


CONCLUSION

That's it.  SANE should now be able to access the device.  To make sure the
device was detected, use "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices".  Your scanner should be
listed and the line starting with "I:" should look similar to this example:

  I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=usbscanner

The important part is "Driver=usbscanner".  If it reads "Driver=(none)", the
USB scanner driver didn't recognize the scanner.  Have a look at the MODULE
PARAMETERS section for what to do in this case.

For more details on the format of "/proc/bus/usb/devices" see
Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt.


MESSAGES

usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout -- On occasions this message will appear
in "/var/adm/messages", on the console, or both depending on how
your system is configured.  This is a side effect that scanners are
sometimes very slow at warming up and/or initializing.  In most cases,
however, only several of these messages should appear and is generally
considered to be normal.  

excessive NAK's received -- This message should be considered abnormal
and generally indicates that the USB system is unable to communicate
with the scanner for some particular reason.

probe_scanner: Undetected endpoint -- The USB Scanner driver is fairly
general when it comes to communicating to scanners.  Unfortunately,
some vendors have designed their scanners in one way or another that
this driver doesn't account for.

probe_scanner: Endpoint determination failed -- This means that the
driver is unable to detect a supported configuration for means to
communicate with the scanner.  See also "probe_scanner: Undetected
endpoint".

funky result -- Most of the time the data flow between the computer
and the scanner goes smoothly.  However, due to whatever reason,
whether it be solar flares or stray neutrons, sometimes the
communications don't work as expected.  The driver tries to handle
most types of errors but not all.  When this message is seen,
something weird happened.  Please contact the mailing list (see
CONTACT section for details).


MODULE PARAMETERS

If you have a device that you wish to experiment with or try using
this driver with, but the Vendor and Product IDs are not coded in,
don't despair.  If the driver was compiled as a module, you can pass
options to the driver.  Simply add 

  options scanner vendor=0x#### product=0x****

to the /etc/modules.conf file replacing the #'s and the *'s with the
correct IDs.  The IDs can be retrieved from the messages file or
using "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices".

If the default timeout is too low, i.e. there are frequent "timeout" messages,
you may want to increase the timeout manually by using the parameter
"read_timeout".  The time is given in seconds.  This is an example for
modules.conf with a timeout of 60 seconds:

  options scanner read_timeout=60
 
If the "scanner" module is already loaded into memory, it must be reloaded for
the module parameters to take effect.  In essence, "rmmod scanner; modprobe
scanner" must be performed.


BUGS

Just look at the list of fixes in the source files. 


CONTACT

For asking about problems and fixes, use the linux-usb-users mailing list. For
patches, linux-usb-devel should be used. Information on both lists can be
found on http://www.linux-usb.org/.

HP TEST PROGRAM

There is a small test program (hp_scan.c -- appended below) that can
be used to test the scanner device if it's an HP scanner that supports
SCL (Scanner Control Language).  Known HP scanner that support SCL are
the 4100, 5200, 6200, the 6300 -- note that the 4200 is *not*
supported since it does not understand SCL; it's also strongly
suspected that the 3300 and the PhotoSmart S20 are not SCL compliant.
Hp_scan.c's purpose is to test the driver without having to
retrieve/configure SANE.  Hp_scan.c will scan the entire bed and put
the output into a file called "out.dat" in the current directory.  The
data in the file is raw data so it's not very useful for imaging.

--------------- snip -- hp_scan.c -- snip ---------------
/*

This is a really crude attempt at writing a short test program.  It's
mostly only to be used to test connectivity with USB HP scanners that
understand SCL.  Currently, the supported models are 4100C, 5200C,
6200C, and the 6300C.  Note that the 4200C is *NOT* acceptable.
