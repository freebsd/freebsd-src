Version 0.8, April 2002

The brlvger driver supports a Braille display (aka Braille terminal)
model Voyager from Tieman.

The driver has been in heavy use for about six months now (as of April
2002) by a very few users (about 3-4), who say it has worked very well
for them.

We have tested it with a Voyager 44, but it should also support
the Voyager 70.

This driver implements a character device which allows userspace programs
access to the braille displays raw functions. You still need a userspace
program to perform the screen-review functions and control the
display. Get BRLTTY from http://mielke.cc/brltty/ (version 2.99.8 or
later). It has a Voyager driver which interfaces with this kernel driver.

The interface is through a character device, major 180, minor 128, called
"brlvger" under devfs.

Many thanks to the Tieman people: Corand van Strien, Ivar Illing, Daphne
Vogelaar and Ingrid Vogel. They provided us with a Braille display (as
well as programming information) so that we could write this driver. They
replaced the display when it broke and they answered our technical
questions. It is very motivating when companies take an interest in such
projects and are so supportive.

Thanks to Andor Demarteau <ademarte@students.cs.uu.nl> who got this whole
project started and beta-tested all our early buggy attempts.
