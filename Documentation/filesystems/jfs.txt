The following mount options are supported:

iocharset=name	Character set to use for converting from Unicode to
		ASCII.  The default is compiled into the kernel as
		CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.  Use iocharset=utf8 for UTF8
		translations.  This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 to be set
		in the kernel .config file.

resize=value	Resize the volume to <value> blocks.  JFS only supports
		growing a volume, not shrinking it.  This option is only
		valid during a remount, when the volume is mounted
		read-write.  The resize keyword with no value will grow
		the volume to the full size of the partition.

nointegrity	Do not write to the journal.  The primary use of this option
		is to allow for higher performance when restoring a volume
		from backup media.  The integrity of the volume is not
		guaranteed if the system abnormally abends.

integrity	Default.  Commit metadata changes to the journal.  Use this
		option to remount a volume where the nointegrity option was
		previously specified in order to restore normal behavior.

errors=continue		Keep going on a filesystem error.
errors=remount-ro	Default. Remount the filesystem read-only on an error.
errors=panic		Panic and halt the machine if an error occurs.

JFS TODO list:

Plans for our near term development items

   - enhance support for logfile on dedicated partition

Longer term work items

   - implement defrag utility, for online defragmenting
   - add quota support
   - add support for block sizes (512,1024,2048)

Please send bugs, comments, cards and letters to shaggy@austin.ibm.com.
