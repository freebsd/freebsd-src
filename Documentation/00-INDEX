This is a brief list of all the files in ./linux/Documentation and what
they contain. If you add a documentation file, please list it here in 
alphabetical order as well, or risk being hunted down like a rabid dog. 
Please try and keep the descriptions small enough to fit on one line.
							 Thanks -- Paul G.
