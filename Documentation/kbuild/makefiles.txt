=== 1 Overview

The Makefiles have five parts:

    Makefile: the top Makefile.
    .config: the kernel configuration file.
    arch/*/Makefile: the arch Makefiles.
    Subdirectory Makefiles: there are about 300 of these.
    Rules.make: the common rules for all subdirectory Makefiles.

The top Makefile reads the .config file, which comes from the
kernel configuration process.

The top Makefile is responsible for building two major products: vmlinux
(the resident kernel image) and modules (any module files).  It builds
these goals by recursively descending into the subdirectories of the
kernel source tree.  The list of subdirectories which are visited depends
upon the kernel configuration.

The top Makefile textually includes an arch Makefile with the name
arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile.  The arch Makefile supplies architecture-specific
information to the top Makefile.

Each subdirectory has a Makefile which carries out the commands passed
down from above.  The subdirectory Makefile uses information from the
.config file to construct various file lists, and then it textually
includes the common rules in Rules.make.

Rules.make defines rules which are common to all the subdirectory
Makefiles.  It has a public interface in the form of certain variable
lists.  It then declares rules based on those lists.



=== 2 Who does what

People have four different relationships with the kernel Makefiles.

*Users* are people who build kernels.  These people type commands such as
"make menuconfig" or "make bzImage".  They usually do not read or edit
any kernel Makefiles (or any other source files).

*Normal developers* are people who work on features such as device
drivers, file systems, and network protocols.  These people need to
maintain the subdirectory Makefiles for the subsystem that they are
working on.  In order to do this effectively, they need some overall
knowledge about the kernel Makefiles, plus detailed knowledge about the
public interface for Rules.make.

*Arch developers* are people who work on an entire architecture, such
as sparc or ia64.  Arch developers need to know about the arch Makefiles
as well as subdirectory Makefiles.

*Kbuild developers* are people who work on the kernel build system itself.
These people need to know about all aspects of the kernel Makefiles.

This document is aimed towards normal developers and arch developers.



=== 3 Makefile language

The kernel Makefiles are designed to run with GNU Make.  The Makefiles
use only the documented features of GNU Make, but they do use many
GNU extensions.

GNU Make supports elementary list-processing functions.  The kernel
Makefiles use a novel style of list building and manipulation with few
"if" statements.

GNU Make has two assignment operators, ":=" and "=".  ":=" performs
immediate evaluation of the right-hand side and stores an actual string
into the left-hand side.  "=" is like a formula definition; it stores the
right-hand side in an unevaluated form and then evaluates this form each
time the left-hand side is used.

There are some cases where "=" is appropriate.  Usually, though, ":="
is the right choice.

All of the examples in this document were drawn from actual kernel
sources.  The examples have been reformatted (white space changed, lines
split), but are otherwise exactly the same.



=== 4 Variables passed down from the top

The top Makefile exports the following variables:

    VERSION, PATCHLEVEL, SUBLEVEL, EXTRAVERSION

	These variables define the current kernel version.  A few arch
	Makefiles actually use these values directly; they should use
	$(KERNELRELEASE) instead.

	$(VERSION), $(PATCHLEVEL), and $(SUBLEVEL) define the basic
	three-part version number, such as "2", "4", and "0".  These three
	values are always numeric.

	$(EXTRAVERSION) defines an even tinier sublevel for pre-patches
	or additional patches.	It is usually some non-numeric string
	such as "-pre4", and is often blank.

    KERNELRELEASE

	$(KERNELRELEASE) is a single string such as "2.4.0-pre4", suitable
	for constructing installation directory names or showing in
	version strings.  Some arch Makefiles use it for this purpose.

    ARCH

	This variable defines the target architecture, such as "i386",
	"arm", or "sparc".   Many subdirectory Makefiles test $(ARCH)
	to determine which files to compile.

	By default, the top Makefile sets $(ARCH) to be the same as the
	host system system architecture.  For a cross build, a user may
	override the value of $(ARCH) on the command line:

	    make ARCH=m68k ...

    TOPDIR, HPATH
	
	$(TOPDIR) is the path to the top of the kernel source tree.
	Subdirectory Makefiles need this so that they can include
	$(TOPDIR)/Rules.make.

	$(HPATH) is equal to $(TOPDIR)/include.  A few arch Makefiles
	need to use this to do special things using include files.

    SUBDIRS

	$(SUBDIRS) is a list of directories which the top Makefile
	enters in order to build either vmlinux or modules.  The actual
	directories in $(SUBDIRS) depend on the kernel configuration.
	The top Makefile defines this variable, and the arch Makefile
	extends it.

    HEAD, CORE_FILES, NETWORKS, DRIVERS, LIBS
    LINKFLAGS

	$(HEAD), $(CORE_FILES), $(NETWORKS), $(DRIVERS), and $(LIBS)
	specify lists of object files and libraries to be linked into
	vmlinux.
	
	The files in $(HEAD) are linked first in vmlinux.

	$(LINKFLAGS) specifies the flags to build vmlinux.

	The top Makefile and the arch Makefile jointly define these
	variables.  The top Makefile defines $(CORE_FILES), $(NETWORKS),
	$(DRIVERS), and $(LIBS).  The arch Makefile defines $(HEAD)
	and $(LINKFLAGS), and extends $(CORE_FILES) and $(LIBS).

	Note: there are more variables here than necessary.  $(NETWORKS),
	$(DRIVERS), and even $(LIBS) could be subsumed into $(CORE_FILES).

    CPP, CC, AS, LD, AR, NM, STRIP, OBJCOPY, OBJDUMP
    CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CFLAGS_KERNEL, MODFLAGS, AFLAGS, LDFLAGS
    PERL
    GENKSYMS

	These variables specify the commands and flags that Rules.make
	uses to build goal files from source files.

	$(CFLAGS_KERNEL) contains extra C compiler flags used to compile
	resident kernel code.

	$(MODFLAGS) contains extra C compiler flags used to compile code
	for loadable kernel modules.  In the future, this flag may be
	renamed to the more regular name $(CFLAGS_MODULE).

	$(AFLAGS) contains assembler flags.

	$(GENKSYMS) contains the command used to generate kernel symbol
	signatures when CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled.	The genksyms
	command comes from the modutils package.

    CROSS_COMPILE

	This variable is a prefix path for other variables such as $(CC),
	$(AS), and $(LD).  The arch Makefiles sometimes use and set this
	variable explicitly.  Subdirectory Makefiles don't need to worry
	about it.

	The user may override $(CROSS_COMPILE) on the command line if
	desired.

    HOSTCC, HOSTCFLAGS

	These variables define the C compiler and C compiler flags to
	be used for compiling host side programs.  These are separate
	variables because the target architecture can be different from
	the host architecture.

	If your Makefile compiles and runs a program that is executed
	during the course of building the kernel, then it should use
	$(HOSTCC) and $(HOSTCFLAGS).

	For example, the subdirectory drivers/pci has a helper program
	named gen-devlist.c.  This program reads a list of PCI ID's and
	generates C code in the output files classlist.h and devlist.h.

	Suppose that a user has an i386 computer and wants to build a
	kernel for an ia64 machine.  Then the user would use an ia64
	cross-compiler for most of the compilation, but would use a
	native i386 host compiler to compile drivers/pci/gen-devlist.c.

	For another example, kbuild helper programs such as
	scripts/mkdep.c and scripts/lxdialog/*.c are compiled with
	$(HOSTCC) rather than $(CC).

    ROOT_DEV, SVGA_MODE, RAMDISK

	End users edit these variables to specify certain information
	about the configuration of their kernel.  These variables
	are ancient!  They are also specific to the i386 architecture.
	They really should be replaced with CONFIG_* options.

    MAKEBOOT

	This variable is defined and used only inside the main arch
	Makefiles.  The top Makefile should not export it.

    INSTALL_PATH

	This variable defines a place for the arch Makefiles to install
	the resident kernel image and System.map file.

    INSTALL_MOD_PATH, MODLIB

	$(INSTALL_MOD_PATH) specifies a prefix to $(MODLIB) for module
	installation.  This variable is not defined in the Makefile but
	may be passed in by the user if desired.

	$(MODLIB) specifies the directory for module installation.
	The top Makefile defines $(MODLIB) to
	$(INSTALL_MOD_PATH)/lib/modules/$(KERNELRELEASE).  The user may
	override this value on the command line if desired.

    CONFIG_SHELL

	This variable is private between Makefile and Rules.make.
	Arch makefiles and subdirectory Makefiles should never use this.

    MODVERFILE

	An internal variable.  This doesn't need to be exported, as it
	is never used outside of the top Makefile.

    MAKE, MAKEFILES

	Some variables internal to GNU Make.

	$(MAKEFILES) in particular is used to force the arch Makefiles
	and subdirectory Makefiles to read $(TOPDIR)/.config without
	including it explicitly.  (This was an implementational hack
	and could be fixed).



=== 5 The structure of an arch Makefile



--- 5.1 Architecture-specific variables

The top Makefile includes one arch Makefile file, arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile.
This section describes the functions of the arch Makefile.

An arch Makefile extends some of the top Makefile's variables with
architecture-specific values.

    SUBDIRS

	The top Makefile defines $(SUBDIRS).  The arch Makefile extends
	$(SUBDIRS) with a list of architecture-specific directories.

	Example:

		# arch/alpha/Makefile

		SUBDIRS := $(SUBDIRS) arch/alpha/kernel arch/alpha/mm \
		           arch/alpha/lib arch/alpha/math-emu

	This list may depend on the configuration:

		# arch/arm/Makefile

		ifeq ($(CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN),y)
		SUBDIRS         += drivers/acorn
		...
		endif

    CPP, CC, AS, LD, AR, NM, STRIP, OBJCOPY, OBJDUMP
    CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CFLAGS_KERNEL, MODFLAGS, AFLAGS, LDFLAGS

	The top Makefile defines these variables, and the arch Makefile
	extends them.

	Many arch Makefiles dynamically run the target C compiler to
	probe supported options:

		# arch/i386/Makefile

		# prevent gcc from keeping the stack 16 byte aligned
		CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 \
			  -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; \
			  then echo "-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2"; fi)

	And, of course, $(CFLAGS) can depend on the configuration:

		# arch/i386/Makefile

		ifdef CONFIG_M386
		CFLAGS += -march=i386
		endif

		ifdef CONFIG_M486
		CFLAGS += -march=i486
		endif

		ifdef CONFIG_M586
		CFLAGS += -march=i586
		endif

	Some arch Makefiles redefine the compilation commands in order
	to add architecture-specific flags:

		# arch/s390/Makefile

		LD=$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld -m elf_s390
		OBJCOPY=$(CROSS_COMPILE)objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S



--- 5.2 Vmlinux build variables

An arch Makefile cooperates with the top Makefile to define variables
which specify how to build the vmlinux file.  Note that there is no
corresponding arch-specific section for modules; the module-building
machinery is all architecture-independent.

    HEAD, CORE_FILES, LIBS
    LINKFLAGS

	The top Makefile defines the architecture-independent core of
	thse variables, and the arch Makefile extends them.  Note that the
	arch Makefile defines (not just extends) $(HEAD) and $(LINKFLAGS).

	Example:

		# arch/m68k/Makefile

		ifndef CONFIG_SUN3
		LINKFLAGS = -T $(TOPDIR)/arch/m68k/vmlinux.lds
		else
		LINKFLAGS = -T $(TOPDIR)/arch/m68k/vmlinux-sun3.lds -N
		endif

		...

		ifndef CONFIG_SUN3
		HEAD := arch/m68k/kernel/head.o
		else
		HEAD := arch/m68k/kernel/sun3-head.o
		endif

		SUBDIRS += arch/m68k/kernel arch/m68k/mm arch/m68k/lib
		CORE_FILES := arch/m68k/kernel/kernel.o arch/m68k/mm/mm.o $(CORE_FILES)
		LIBS += arch/m68k/lib/lib.a



--- 5.3 Post-vmlinux goals

An arch Makefile specifies goals that take the vmlinux file, compress
it, wrap it in bootstrapping code, and copy the resulting files somewhere.
This includes various kinds of installation commands.

These post-vmlinux goals are not standardized across different
architectures.  Here is a list of these goals and the architectures
that support each of them (as of kernel version 2.4.0-test6-pre5):

    balo		mips
    bootimage		alpha
    bootpfile		alpha, ia64
    bzImage		i386, m68k
    bzdisk		i386
    bzlilo		i386
    compressed		i386, m68k, mips, mips64, sh
    dasdfmt		s390
    Image		arm
    image		s390
    install		arm, i386
    lilo		m68k
    msb			alpha, ia64
    my-special-boot	alpha, ia64
    orionboot		mips
    rawboot		alpha
    silo		s390
    srmboot		alpha
    tftpboot.img	sparc, sparc64
    vmlinux.64		mips64
    vmlinux.aout	sparc64
    zImage		arm, i386, m68k, mips, mips64, ppc, sh
    zImage.initrd	ppc
    zdisk		i386, mips, mips64, sh
    zinstall		arm
    zlilo		i386
    znetboot.initrd	ppc



--- 5.4 Mandatory arch-specific goals

An arch Makefile must define the following arch-specific goals.
These goals provide arch-specific actions for the corresponding goals
in the top Makefile:

    archclean		clean
    archdep		dep
    archmrproper	mrproper



=== 6 The structure of a subdirectory Makefile

A subdirectory Makefile has four sections.



--- 6.1 Comments

The first section is a comment header. Historically, many anonymous
people have edited kernel Makefiles without leaving any change
histories in the header; comments from them would have been valuable.



--- 6.2 Goal definitions

The second section is a bunch of definitions that are the heart of the
subdirectory Makefile.  These lines define the files to be built, any
special compilation options, and any subdirectories to be recursively
entered.  The declarations in these lines depend heavily on the kernel
configuration variables (CONFIG_* symbols).

The second section looks like this:

	# drivers/block/Makefile
	obj-$(CONFIG_MAC_FLOPPY)	+= swim3.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD)	+= floppy.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_AMIGA_FLOPPY)	+= amiflop.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_ATARI_FLOPPY)	+= ataflop.o


--- 6.3 Rules.make section

The third section is the single line:

	include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make



--- 6.4 Special rules

The fourth section contains any special Makefile rules needed that are
not available through the common rules in Rules.make.



=== 7 Rules.make variables

The public interface of Rules.make consists of the following variables:



--- 7.1 Subdirectories

A Makefile is only responsible for building objects in its own
directory. Files in subdirectories should be taken care of by
Makefiles in the these subdirs. The build system will automatically
invoke make recursively in subdirectories, provided you let it know of
them.

To do so, use the subdir-{y,m,n,} variables:

	subdir-$(CONFIG_ISDN)                   += i4l
	subdir-$(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI)              += capi

When building the actual kernel, i.e. vmlinux ("make
{vmlinux,bzImage,...}"), make will recursively descend into
directories listed in $(subdir-y).

When building modules ("make modules"), make will recursively descend
into directories listed in $(subdir-m).

When building the dependencies ("make dep") make needs to visit every
subdir, so it'll descend into every directory listed in 
$(subdir-y), $(subdir-m), $(subdir-n), $(subdir-).

You may encounter the case where a config option may be set to "y", but
you still want to possibly build modules in that subdirectory.

For example, drivers/isdn/capi/Makefile has

	obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI)                 += kernelcapi.o capiutil.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20)          += capi.o

where it's possible that CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI=y, but
CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI_CAPI20=m.

This is expressed by the following construct in the parent Makefile
drivers/isdn/Makefile:

	mod-subdirs                             := i4l hisax capi eicon
	subdir-$(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI)              += capi

Having a subdir ("capi") listed in the variable $(mod-subdirs) will
make the build system enter the specified subdirectory during "make
modules" also, even though the subdir ("capi") is listed only in
$(subdir-y), not $(subdir-m).


--- 7.2 Object file goals

    O_TARGET, obj-y

	The subdirectory Makefile specifies object files for vmlinux
	in the lists $(obj-y).  These lists depend on the kernel
	configuration.

	Rules.make compiles all the $(obj-y) files.  It then calls
	"$(LD) -r" to merge these files into one .o file with the name
	$(O_TARGET).  This $(O_TARGET) is later linked into vmlinux by 
	a parent Makefile.

	The order of files in $(obj-y) is significant.  Duplicates in
	the lists are allowed: the first instance will be linked into
	$(O_TARGET) and succeeding instances will be ignored.

	Link order is significant, because certain functions
	(module_init() / __initcall) will be called during boot in the
	order they appear. So keep in mind that changing the link
	order may e.g.  change the order in which your SCSI
	controllers are detected, and thus you disks are renumbered.

	Example:

	    # Makefile for the kernel ISDN subsystem and device drivers.

	    # The target object and module list name.

	    O_TARGET        := vmlinux-obj.o

	    # Each configuration option enables a list of files.

	    obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN)                      += isdn.o
	    obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP)          += isdn_bsdcomp.o

	    # The global Rules.make.

	    include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make

--- 7.3 Library file goals

    L_TARGET

	Instead of building an O_TARGET object file, you may also
	build an archive which again contains objects listed in
	$(obj-y). This is normally not necessary and only used in
	the lib, arch/$(ARCH)/lib directories.


--- 7.4 Loadable module goals

    obj-m

	$(obj-m) specify object files which are built as loadable
	kernel modules.

	A module may be built from one source file or several source
	files. In the case of one source file, the subdirectory
	Makefile simply adds the file to $(obj-m)

	Example:

	    obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP)          += isdn_bsdcomp.o

	If a kernel module is built from several source files, you specify
	that you want to build a module in the same way as above.

	However, the build system of course needs to know which the parts
	are that you want to build your module of, so you have to tell it
	by setting an $(<module_name>-objs) variable.

	Example:

	    obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN)                      += isdn.o

	    isdn-objs := isdn_net.o isdn_tty.o isdn_v110.o isdn_common.o

	In this example, the module name will be isdn.o. Rules.make
	will compile the objects listed in $(isdn-objs) and then run
	"$(LD) -r" on the list of these files to generate isdn.o

	Note: Of course, when you are building objects into the kernel,
	the syntax above will also work. So, if you have CONFIG_ISDN=y,
	the build system will build an isdn.o for you out of the individual
	parts and then link this into the $(O_TARGET), as you'd expect.


--- 7.5 Objects which export symbols

    export-objs

	When using loadable modules, not every global symbol in the
	kernel / other modules is automatically available, only those
	explicitly exported are available for your module.

	To make a symbol available for use in modules, to "export" it,
	use the EXPORT_SYMBOL(<symbol>) directive in your source. In
	addition, you need to list all object files which export symbols
	(i.e. their source contains an EXPORT_SYMBOL() directive) in the
	Makefile variable $(export-objs).

	Example:

	    # Objects that export symbols.

	    export-objs     := isdn_common.o

	since isdn_common.c contains

	    EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_isdn);

	which makes the function register_isdn available to
	low-level ISDN drivers.
	    

--- 7.6 Compilation flags

    EXTRA_CFLAGS, EXTRA_AFLAGS, EXTRA_LDFLAGS, EXTRA_ARFLAGS

	$(EXTRA_CFLAGS) specifies options for compiling C files with
	$(CC).	The options in this variable apply to all $(CC) commands
	for files in the current directory.

	Example:

		# drivers/sound/emu10k1/Makefile
		EXTRA_CFLAGS += -I.
		ifdef DEBUG
		    EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DEMU10K1_DEBUG
		endif

	$(EXTRA_CFLAGS) does not apply to subdirectories of the current
	directory.  Also, it does not apply to files compiled with
	$(HOSTCC).

	This variable is necessary because the top Makefile owns the
	variable $(CFLAGS) and uses it for compilation flags for the
	entire tree.

	$(EXTRA_AFLAGS) is a similar string for per-directory options
	when compiling assembly language source.

	Example: at the time of writing, there were no examples of
	$(EXTRA_AFLAGS) in the kernel corpus.

	$(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) and $(EXTRA_ARFLAGS) are similar strings for
	per-directory options to $(LD) and $(AR).

	Example: at the time of writing, there were no examples of
	$(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) or $(EXTRA_ARFLAGS) in the kernel corpus.

    CFLAGS_$@, AFLAGS_$@

	$(CFLAGS_$@) specifies per-file options for $(CC).  The $@
	part has a literal value which specifies the file that it's for.

	Example:

		# drivers/scsi/Makefile
		CFLAGS_aha152x.o =   -DAHA152X_STAT -DAUTOCONF
		CFLAGS_gdth.o    = # -DDEBUG_GDTH=2 -D__SERIAL__ -D__COM2__ \
				     -DGDTH_STATISTICS
		CFLAGS_seagate.o =   -DARBITRATE -DPARITY -DSEAGATE_USE_ASM

	These three lines specify compilation flags for aha152x.o,
	gdth.o, and seagate.o

	$(AFLAGS_$@) is a similar feature for source files in assembly
	languages.

	Example:

		# arch/arm/kernel/Makefile
		AFLAGS_head-armv.o := -DTEXTADDR=$(TEXTADDR) -traditional
		AFLAGS_head-armo.o := -DTEXTADDR=$(TEXTADDR) -traditional

	Rules.make has a feature where an object file depends on the
	value of $(CFLAGS_$@) that was used to compile it.  (It also
	depends on the values of $(CFLAGS) and $(EXTRA_CFLAGS)).  Thus,
	if you change the value of $(CFLAGS_$@) for a file, either by
	editing the Makefile or overriding the value some other way,
	Rules.make will do the right thing and re-compile your source
	file with the new options.

	Note: because of a deficiency in Rules.make, assembly language
	files do not have flag dependencies.  If you edit $(AFLAGS_$@)
	for such a file, you will have to remove the object file in order
	to re-build from source.

    LD_RFLAG

	This variable is used, but never defined.  It appears to be a
	vestige of some abandoned experiment.



--- 7.7 Miscellaneous variables

    IGNORE_FLAGS_OBJS

	$(IGNORE_FLAGS_OBJS) is a list of object files which will not have
	their flag dependencies automatically tracked.	This is a hackish
	feature, used to kludge around a problem in the implementation
	of flag dependencies.  (The problem is that flag dependencies
	assume that a %.o file is built from a matching %.S or %.c file.
	This is sometimes not true).

    USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE

	This is a transition variable.	If $(USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE)
	is defined, then Rules.make will provide standard rules for
	assembling %.S files into %.o files or %.s files (%.s files
	are useful only to developers).

	If $(USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE) is not defined, then Rules.make
	will not provide these standard rules.	In this case, the
	subdirectory Makefile must provide its own private rules for
	assembling %.S files.

	In the past, all Makefiles provided private %.S rules.	Newer
	Makefiles should define USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE and use the standard
	Rules.make rules.  As soon as all the Makefiles across all
	architectures have been converted to USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE, then
	Rules.make can drop the conditional test on USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE.
	After that, all the other Makefiles can drop the definition of
	USE_STANDARD_AS_RULE.



=== 8 New-style variables

[ This sections dates back from a time where the way to write Makefiles
  described above was "new-style". I'm leaving it in as it describes the
  same thing in other words, so it may be of some use ]

The "new-style variables" are simpler and more powerful than the
"old-style variables".  As a result, many subdirectory Makefiles shrank
more than 60%.  This author hopes that, in time, all arch Makefiles and
subdirectory Makefiles will convert to the new style.

Rules.make does not understand new-style variables.  Thus, each new-style
Makefile has a section of boilerplate code that converts the new-style
variables into old-style variables.  There is also some mixing, where
people define most variables using "new style" but then fall back to
"old style" for a few lines.

--- 8.1 New variables

    obj-y obj-m obj-n obj-

	These variables replace $(O_OBJS), $(OX_OBJS), $(M_OBJS),
	and $(MX_OBJS).

	Example:

		# drivers/block/Makefile
		obj-$(CONFIG_MAC_FLOPPY)        += swim3.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD)        += floppy.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_AMIGA_FLOPPY)      += amiflop.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_ATARI_FLOPPY)      += ataflop.o

	Notice the use of $(CONFIG_...) substitutions on the left hand
	side of an assignment operator.  This gives GNU Make the power
	of associative indexing!  Each of these assignments replaces
	eight lines of code in an old-style Makefile.

	After executing all of the assignments, the subdirectory
	Makefile has built up four lists: $(obj-y), $(obj-m), $(obj-n),
	and $(obj-).

	$(obj-y) is a list of files to include in vmlinux.
	$(obj-m) is a list of files to build as single-file modules.
	$(obj-n) and $(obj-) are ignored.

	Each list may contain duplicates items; duplicates are
	automatically removed later.  Duplicates in both $(obj-y) and
	$(obj-m) will automatically be removed from the $(obj-m) list.

	Example:

		# drivers/net/Makefile

		...
		obj-$(CONFIG_OAKNET) += oaknet.o 8390.o
		...
		obj-$(CONFIG_NE2K_PCI) += ne2k-pci.o 8390.o
		...
		obj-$(CONFIG_STNIC) += stnic.o 8390.o
		...
		obj-$(CONFIG_MAC8390) += daynaport.o 8390.o
		...

	In this example, four different drivers require the code in
	8390.o.  If one or more of these four drivers are built into
	vmlinux, then 8390.o will also be built into vmlinux, and will
	*not* be built as a module -- even if another driver which needs
	8390.o is built as a module.  (The modular driver is able to
	use services of the 8390.o code in the resident vmlinux image).

    export-objs

	$(export-objs) is a list of all the files in the subdirectory
	which potentially export symbols.  The canonical way to construct
	this list is:

	    grep -l EXPORT_SYMBOL *.c

	(but watch out for sneaky files that call EXPORT_SYMBOL from an
	included header file!)

	This is a potential list, independent of the kernel configuration.
	All files that export symbols go into $(export-objs).  The
	boilerplate code then uses the $(export-objs) list to separate
	the real file lists into $(*_OBJS) and $(*X_OBJS).

	Experience has shown that maintaining the proper X's in an
	old-style Makefile is difficult and error-prone.  Maintaining the
	$(export-objs) list in a new-style Makefile is simpler and easier
	to audit.

    $(foo)-objs

	Some kernel modules are composed of multiple object files linked
	together.

	For each multi-part kernel modul there is a list of all the
	object files which make up that module.  For a kernel module
	named foo.o, its object file list is foo-objs.

	Example:

		# drivers/scsi/Makefile
		list-multi	:= scsi_mod.o sr_mod.o initio.o a100u2w.o

		...

		scsi_mod-objs	:= hosts.o scsi.o scsi_ioctl.o constants.o \
				   scsicam.o scsi_proc.o scsi_error.o \
				   scsi_obsolete.o scsi_queue.o scsi_lib.o \
				   scsi_merge.o scsi_dma.o scsi_scan.o \
				   scsi_syms.o
		sr_mod-objs	:= sr.o sr_ioctl.o sr_vendor.o
		initio-objs	:= ini9100u.o i91uscsi.o
		a100u2w-objs	:= inia100.o i60uscsi.o

	The subdirectory Makefile puts the modules onto obj-* lists in
	the usual configuration-dependent way:

		obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI)		+= scsi_mod.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR)	+= sr_mod.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO)	+= initio.o
		obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_INIA100)	+= a100u2w.o

	Suppose that CONFIG_SCSI=y.  Then vmlinux needs to link in all
	14 components of scsi_mod.o.

	Suppose that CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=m.  Then the 3 components
	of sr_mod.o will be linked together with "$(LD) -r" to make the
	kernel module sr_mod.o.

	Also suppose CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO=n.  Then initio.o goes onto
	the $(obj-n) list and that's the end of it.  Its component
	files are not compiled, and the composite file is not created.


    subdir-y subdir-m subdir-n subdir-

	These variables replace $(ALL_SUB_DIRS), $(SUB_DIRS) and
	$(MOD_SUB_DIRS).

	Example:

		# drivers/Makefile
		subdir-$(CONFIG_PCI)		+= pci
		subdir-$(CONFIG_PCMCIA)		+= pcmcia
		subdir-$(CONFIG_MTD)		+= mtd
		subdir-$(CONFIG_SBUS)		+= sbus

	These variables work similar to obj-*, but are used for
	subdirectories instead of object files.

	After executing all assignments, the subdirectory Makefile has
	built up four lists: $(subdir-y), $(subdir-m), $(subdir-n),
	and $(subdir-).

	$(subdir-y) is a list of directories that should be entered
		for making vmlinux.
	$(subdir-m) is a list of directories that should be entered
		for making modules.
	$(subdir-n) and $(subdir-) are only used for collecting a list
		of all subdirectories of this directory.

	Each list besides subdir-y may contain duplicates items; duplicates
	are automatically removed later.

    mod-subdirs

	$(mod-subdirs) is a list of all the subdirectories that should
	be added to $(subdir-m), too if they appear in $(subdir-y)

	Example:

		# fs/Makefile
		mod-subdirs :=	nls

	This means nls should be added to (subdir-y) and $(subdir-m) if
	CONFIG_NFS = y.
