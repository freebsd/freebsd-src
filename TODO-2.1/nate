Update: Thu Apr  6 22:24:38 PDT 1995
Due:	Before 2.1
Prio:	High
Task:	Fix the linker to enforce command line order linking when mixing
        static/shared libraries.

The state of affairs of the linker when mixing static and shared
libraries is non-intuitive.  A program can have completely different
runtime behavior dependant on if it compiled shared/static, which is
bogus IMHO.  This 'feature' crops up in many unrelated areas of FreeBSD
and needs to be resolved correctly.  Unfortunately, it may require a
complete re-write of some of the underlying functions in both ld and
ld.so.

Update: Thu Apr  6 22:24:38 PDT 1995
Due:	Unspcified
Prio:	Low
Task:	Integrate the VM86() patches posted on the NetBSD mailing list
        into FreeBSD for inclusion as an 'experimental' project

John Kohl posted patches to the NetBSD mailing list to implement a
vm86() call.  These patches do not patch cleanly into FreeBSD, and may
not even work after they do.  I'd like to get them in so that people can
go off and try  things with at least a basis to start from.
