Update: Thu Apr 20 01:09:59 PDT 1995
Due:	Apr 22 1995
Prio:	High
Task:	Should the files in the src-dist be "cvs co"'ed or "cvs export"'ed.

Pro cvs co:

	cvs Id's and other magic stuff survives, so it people send us a
	patch we don't risk loosing the cvs core-team,v 1.6 1995/05/30 06:45:57 rgrimes Exp info.

Pro cvs export:

	If people import our source to a foreign cvs/rcs tree, we will not
	loose our core-team,v 1.6 1995/05/30 06:45:57 rgrimes Exp info.

Contra cvs export:

	The diff (& ctm-delta) to current is big for no good reason.

Update: Thu Apr 20 01:09:59 PDT 1995
Due:	Apr 22 1995
Prio:	High
Task:	RELEASE/RELDATE strings

Should we set the RELEASE to "CURRENT-yyyymmdd" as default in current
and fix it up in src/release/Makefile ?

Should we set RELDATE to this month, or administratively at release time.

Pro "this month":  We would get better granularity for -current).

Pro "admin":  Thats the way Garrett meant it to be.

Update: Wed Apr 26 03:36:18 PDT 1995
Due:	Apr 22 1995
Prio:	High
Task:	The name of 2.0.foo
State:	Closed

2.0.5 ...  2.0.9 or 2.1 ?

Contra 2.0.5: pcvt jumped ahead of us :-/

[It has been declared by executive decision of the new release engineer (me)
 to be 2.0.5, period.  I needed to tell the artists something while everyone
 was still wranging.  It's too late.  You will call it 2.0.5 and you will
 like it. :-) -jkh]

Update: Mon Apr 24 17:48:20 PDT 1995
Due:	Apr 27 1995
Prio:	Low
Task:	Change to config

While I can see the general idea that config will generate a
        -D<KERNELNAME>
I have now received several emails from people with kernels named "DEBUG"
and thats not fun.

Would the world end if config was changed to generate
        -DKERNEL_<KERNELNAME>
instead ?
