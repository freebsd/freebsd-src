Update: Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:	Closed
Prio:	High
Task:	Forms language spec and first implementation for "ncurses graphics"

Finish this up with the install-geeks after Paul gets back from Tallin
(lucky dog).  Need to have the first few screens up and in the generally
planned framework before any of this will really start to make sense.

[Closed: This is no longer a 2.1 item]

Update: Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:    Mid-April
Prio:   Closed
Task:	Investigate libftp.

Need to see if libftp can let me dump ncftp from the boot floppy and
use a more directly controlled (error handling and timeouts!  yes!) ftp
interface directly from sysinstall.  This would also allow me to fetch
index files on the fly and digest their contents easily.  How about a
scheme that elimiated the temp files on your HD during an ftp install at
all?  Just fork and have the child end feed you the pieces down a pipe
in order, that'd work!  Libftp definitely has possibilities.

[Closed:  libftp doesn't support passive mode transfers and is therefore
useless for my purposes]

Update:	Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:    late-May
Prio:   High
Task:   Reorganise the /etc/*ly crud.

I can't stand it.  I have to do it.  I promise to at least plan it
out in advance before doing anything this time!  Honest! :-)
[Revised due-date:  This won't happen right away]

Update:	Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:	end-May
Prio:	High
Task:	Identify the default docfile browser and get it into the system.

Something is going to be invoked on our docfiles as part of the
installation (what happens when you type F1) and I'd like to make sure
I know what it is (Lynx?  info?  Something else?).
[Revised due-date: This isn't going to make it into 2.0.5, clearly]

Update: Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:	Mid-April
Prio:	Finished
Task:	Fix the broken pkg_delete command

Either John's changes or my merging of those changes really hosed pkg_delete
and the delete routines used by pkg_add as well.
[Closed:  Problem was fixed]

Update: Mon May 15 22:30:05 PDT 1995
Due:	?
Prio:	Med
Task:	Update pkg_install to not rely on libftp.

libftp doesn't handle passive ftp connections, making it useless
for firewall situations.  pkg_install needs to stop relying on it
for this reason.
