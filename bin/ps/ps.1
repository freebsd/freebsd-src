.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
displays a header line, followed by lines containing information about
all of your
processes that have controlling terminals.
If the
.Fl x
options is specified,
.Nm
will also display processes that do not have controlling terminals.
.Pp
A different set of processes can be selected for display by using any
combination of the
.Fl a , G , p , T , t ,
and
.Fl U
options.
If more than one of these options are given, then
.Nm
will select all processes which are matched by at least one of the
given options.
.Pp
For the processes which have been selected for display,
.Nm
will usually display one line per process.
The
.Fl H
option may result in multiple output lines (one line per thread) for
some processes.
By default all of these output lines are sorted first by controlling
terminal, then by process ID.
The
.Fl m , r , u ,
and
.Fl v
options will change the sort order.
If more than one sorting option was given, then the selected processes
will be sorted by the last sorting option which was specified.
.Pp
For the processes which have been selected for display, the information
to display is selected based on a set of keywords (see the
.Fl L , O ,
and
.Fl o
options).
The default output format includes, for each process, the process' ID,
controlling terminal, state, CPU time (including both user and system time)
and associated command.
.Pp
The process file system (see
.Xr procfs 5 )
should be mounted when
.Nm
is executed, otherwise not all information will be available.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.
If the
.Va security.bsd.see_other_uids
sysctl is set to zero, this option is honored only if the UID of the user is 0.
.It Fl c
Change the
.Dq command
column output to just contain the executable name,
rather than the full command line.
.It Fl C
Change the way the CPU percentage is calculated by using a
.Dq raw
CPU calculation that ignores
.Dq resident
time (this normally has
no effect).
.It Fl d
Arrange processes into descendancy order and prefix each command with
indentation text showing sibling and parent/child relationships.
If either of the
.Fl m
and
.Fl r
options are also used, they control how sibling processes are sorted
relative to eachother.
.It Fl e
Display the environment as well.
.It Fl f
Show commandline and environment information about swapped out processes.
This option is honored only if the UID of the user is 0.
.It Fl G
Display information about processes which are running with the specified
real group IDs.
.It Fl H
Show all of the
.Em kernel visible
threads associated with each process.
Depending on the threading package that
is in use, this may show only the process, only the kernel scheduled entities,
or all of the process threads.
.It Fl h
Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee one
header per page of information.
.It Fl j
Print information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm user , pid , ppid , pgid , sid , jobc , state , tt , time ,
and
.Cm command .
.It Fl L
List the set of keywords available for the
.Fl O
and
.Fl o
options.
.It Fl l
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm uid , pid , ppid , cpu , pri , nice , vsz , rss , mwchan , state ,
.Cm tt , time ,
and
.Cm command .
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the currently running system.
.It Fl m
Sort by memory usage, instead of the combination of controlling
terminal and process ID.
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default,
which is the kernel image the system has booted from.
.It Fl O
Add the information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specified, after the process ID,
in the default information
display.
Keywords may be appended with an equals
.Pq Ql =
sign and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.It Fl o
Display information associated with the space or comma separated
list of keywords specified.
The last keyword in the list may be appended with an equals
.Pq Ql =
sign and a string that spans the rest of the argument, and can contain
space and comma characters.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
Multiple keywords may also be given in the form of more than one
.Fl o
option.
So the header texts for multiple keywords can be changed.
If all keywords have empty header texts, no header line is written.
.It Fl p
Display information about processes which match the specified process IDs.
.It Fl r
Sort by current CPU usage, instead of the combination of controlling
terminal and process ID.
.It Fl S
Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited
children to their parent process.
.It Fl T
Display information about processes attached to the device associated
with the standard input.
.It Fl t
Display information about processes attached to the specified terminal
devices.
Full pathnames, as well as abbreviations (see explanation of the
.Cm tt
keyword) can be specified.
.It Fl U
Display the processes belonging to the specified usernames.
.It Fl u
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm user , pid , %cpu , %mem , vsz , rss , tt , state , start , time ,
and
.Cm command .
The
.Fl u
option implies the
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl v
Display information associated with the following keywords:
.Cm pid , state , time , sl , re , pagein , vsz , rss , lim , tsiz ,
.Cm %cpu , %mem ,
and
.Cm command .
The
.Fl v
option implies the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl w
Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default which
is your window size.
If the
.Fl w
option is specified more than once,
.Nm
will use as many columns as necessary without regard for your window size.
.It Fl X
When displaying processes matched by other options, skip any processes
which do not have a controlling terminal.
.It Fl x
When displaying processes matched by other options, include processes
which do not have a controlling terminal.
This is the opposite of the
.Fl X
option.
If both
.Fl X
and
.Fl x
are specified in the same command, then
.Nm
will use the one which was specified last.
.It Fl Z
Add
.Xr mac 4
label to the list of keywords for which
.Nm
will display information.
.El
.Pp
A complete list of the available keywords are listed below.
Some of these keywords are further specified as follows:
.Bl -tag -width lockname
.It Cm %cpu
The CPU utilization of the process; this is a decaying average over up to
a minute of previous (real) time.
Since the time base over which this is computed varies (since processes may
be very young) it is possible for the sum of all
.Cm %cpu
fields to exceed 100%.
.It Cm %mem
The percentage of real memory used by this process.
.It Cm flags
The flags associated with the process as in
the include file
.In sys/proc.h :
.Bl -column P_STOPPED_SINGLE 0x4000000

.El
.It Cm label
The MAC label of the process.
.It Cm lim
The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
.It Cm lstart
The exact time the command started, using the
.Ql %c
format described in
.Xr strftime 3 .
.It Cm lockname
The name of the lock that the process is currently blocked on.
If the name is invalid or unknown, then
.Dq ???\&
is displayed.
.It Cm logname
The login name associated with the session the process is in (see
.Xr getlogin 2 ) .
.It Cm mwchan
The event name if the process is blocked normally, or the lock name if
the process is blocked on a lock.
See the wchan and lockname keywords
for details.
.It Cm nice
The process scheduling increment (see
.Xr setpriority 2 ) .
.It Cm rss
the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte units).
.It Cm start
The time the command started.
If the command started less than 24 hours ago, the start time is
displayed using the
.Dq Li %l:ps.1p
format described in
.Xr strftime 3 .
If the command started less than 7 days ago, the start time is
displayed using the
.Dq Li %a6.15p
format.
Otherwise, the start time is displayed using the
.Dq Li %e%b%y
format.
.It Cm state
The state is given by a sequence of characters, for example,
.Dq Li RWNA .
The first character indicates the run state of the process:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li D
Marks a process in disk (or other short term, uninterruptible) wait.
.It Li I
Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).
.It Li L
Marks a process that is waiting to acquire a lock.
.It Li R
Marks a runnable process.
.It Li S
Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.
.It Li T
Marks a stopped process.
.It Li W
Marks an idle interrupt thread.
.It Li Z
Marks a dead process (a
.Dq zombie ) .
.El
.Pp
Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional state
information:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li +
The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.
.It Li <
The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
.It Li E
The process is trying to exit.
.It Li J
Marks a process which is in
.Xr jail 2 .
The hostname of the prison can be found in
.Pa /proc/ Ns Ao Ar pid Ac Ns Pa /status .
.It Li L
The process has pages locked in core (for example, for raw
.Tn I/O ) .
.It Li N
The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
.Xr setpriority 2 ) .
.It Li s
The process is a session leader.
.It Li V
The process is suspended during a
.Xr vfork 2 .
.It Li W
The process is swapped out.
.It Li X
The process is being traced or debugged.
.El
.It Cm tt
An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if any.
The abbreviation consists of the three letters following
.Pa /dev/tty ,
or, for pseudo-terminals, the corresponding entry in
.Pa /dev/pts .
This is followed by a
.Ql -
if the process can no longer reach that
controlling terminal (i.e., it has been revoked).
The full pathname of the controlling terminal is available via the
.Cm tty
keyword.
.It Cm wchan
The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example, 0x80324000 prints
as 324000.
.El
.Pp
When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a zombie)
is listed as
.Dq Li <defunct> ,
and a process which is blocked while trying
to exit is listed as
.Dq Li <exiting> .
If the arguments cannot be located (usually because it has not been set, as is
the case of system processes and/or kernel threads) the command name is printed
within square brackets.
The
.Nm
utility first tries to obtain the arguments cached by the kernel (if they were
shorter than the value of the
.Va kern.ps_arg_cache_limit
sysctl).
The process can change the arguments shown with
.Xr setproctitle 3 .
Otherwise,
.Nm
makes an educated guess as to the file name and arguments given when the
process was created by examining memory or the swap area.
The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in any event a process
is entitled to destroy this information.
The ucomm (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
If the arguments are unavailable or do not agree with the ucomm keyword,
the value for the ucomm keyword is appended to the arguments in parentheses.

.Sh STANDARDS
For historical reasons, the
.Nm
utility under
.Fx
supports a different set of options from what is described by
.St -p1003.2 ,
and what is supported on
.No non- Ns Bx
operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v4 .
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Nm
cannot run faster than the system and is run as any other scheduled
process, the information it displays can never be exact.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not correctly display argument lists containing multibyte
characters.
