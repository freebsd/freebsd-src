.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrndc\-confgen\fR
generates configuration files for
\fBrndc\fR. It can be used as a convenient alternative to writing the
\fIrndc.conf\fR
file and the corresponding
\fBcontrols\fR
and
\fBkey\fR
statements in
\fInamed.conf\fR
by hand. Alternatively, it can be run with the
\fB\-a\fR
option to set up a
\fIrndc.key\fR
file and avoid the need for a
\fIrndc.conf\fR
file and a
\fBcontrols\fR
statement altogether.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
Do automatic
\fBrndc\fR
configuration. This creates a file
\fIrndc.key\fR
in
\fI/etc\fR
(or whatever
\fIsysconfdir\fR
was specified as when
BIND
was built) that is read by both
\fBrndc\fR
and
\fBnamed\fR
on startup. The
\fIrndc.key\fR
file defines a default command channel and authentication key allowing
\fBrndc\fR
to communicate with
\fBnamed\fR
on the local host with no further configuration.
.sp
Running
\fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fR
allows BIND 9 and
\fBrndc\fR
to be used as drop\-in replacements for BIND 8 and
\fBndc\fR, with no changes to the existing BIND 8
\fInamed.conf\fR
file.
.sp
If a more elaborate configuration than that generated by
\fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fR
is required, for example if rndc is to be used remotely, you should run
\fBrndc\-confgen\fR
without the
\fB\-a\fR
option and set up a
\fIrndc.conf\fR
and
\fInamed.conf\fR
as directed.
.RE
.PP
\-b \fIkeysize\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the size of the authentication key in bits. Must be between 1 and 512 bits; the default is 128.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIkeyfile\fR
.RS 4
Used with the
\fB\-a\fR
option to specify an alternate location for
\fIrndc.key\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBrndc\-confgen\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fIkeyname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the key name of the rndc authentication key. This must be a valid domain name. The default is
\fBrndc\-key\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-p \fIport\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the command channel port where
\fBnamed\fR
listens for connections from
\fBrndc\fR. The default is 953.
.RE
.PP
\-r \fIrandomfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a source of random data for generating the authorization. If the operating system does not provide a
\fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input.
\fIrandomdev\fR
specifies the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR
indicates that keyboard input should be used.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the IP address where
\fBnamed\fR
listens for command channel connections from
\fBrndc\fR. The default is the loopback address 127.0.0.1.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fIchrootdir\fR
.RS 4
Used with the
\fB\-a\fR
option to specify a directory where
\fBnamed\fR
will run chrooted. An additional copy of the
\fIrndc.key\fR
will be written relative to this directory so that it will be found by the chrooted
\fBnamed\fR.
.RE
.PP
\-u \fIuser\fR
.RS 4
Used with the
\fB\-a\fR
option to set the owner of the
\fIrndc.key\fR
file generated. If
\fB\-t\fR
is also specified only the file in the chroot area has its owner changed.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To allow
\fBrndc\fR
to be used with no manual configuration, run
.PP
\fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fR
.PP
To print a sample
\fIrndc.conf\fR
file and corresponding
\fBcontrols\fR
and
\fBkey\fR
statements to be manually inserted into
\fInamed.conf\fR, run
.PP
\fBrndc\-confgen\fR
