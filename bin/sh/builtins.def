# This file lists all the builtin commands.  The first column is the name
# of a C routine.
# The -j flag specifies that this command is to be excluded from systems
# without job control.
# The -h flag specifies that this command is to be excluded from systems
# based on the NO_HISTORY compile-time symbol.
# The -s flag specifies that this is a POSIX 'special built-in' command.
# The rest of the line specifies the command name or names used to run the
# command.  The entry for bltincmd, which is run when the user does not specify
# a command, must come first.
#
# NOTE: bltincmd must come first!
