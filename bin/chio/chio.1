.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chio
.Op Fl f Ar changer
.Ar command
.Ar arg1
.Ar arg2
.Oo
.Ar arg3 Oo ...
.Oc

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Chio
is used to control the operation of medium changers, such as those found
in tape and optical disk jukeboxes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar changer
Use the device
.Pa changer
rather than the default device
.Pa /dev/ch0 .
.El
.Pp
The default changer may be overridden by setting the environment variable
.Nm CHANGER
to the desired changer device.
.Pp
A medium changer apparatus is made up of
.Pa elements .
There are four element types:
.Pa picker
(medium transport),
.Pa slot
(storage),
.Pa portal
(import/export), and
.Pa drive
(data transfer).  In this command description, the shorthand
.Nm ET
will be used to represent an element type, and
.Nm EU
will be used to represent an element unit.  For example, to represent
the first robotic arm in the changer, the ET would be
.Dq picker
and the EU would be
.Dq 0 .
.Pp
.Sh SUPPORTED COMMANDS
.Nm chio move
.Ar <from ET> <from EU> <to ET> <to EU>
.Op Ar inv
.Pp
Moves the media unit from
.Pa <from ET/EU>
to
.Pa <to ET/EU> .
If the optional modifier
.Pa inv
is specified, the media unit will be inverted before insertion.
.Pp
.Nm chio exchange
.Ar <src ET> <src EU> <dst1 ET> <dst1 EU>
.Op Ar <dst2 ET> <dst2 ET>
.Op Ar inv1
.Op Ar inv2
.Pp
Performs a media unit exchange operation.  The media unit in
.Pa <src ET/EU>
is moved to
.Pa <dst1 ET/EU>
and the media unit previously in
.Pa <dst1 ET/EU>
is moved to
.Pa <dst2 ET/EU> .
In the case of a simple exchange,
.Pa <dst2 ET/EU>
is omitted and the values
.Pa <src ET/EU>
are used in their place.
The optional modifiers
.Pa inv1
and
.Pa inv2
specify whether the media units are to be inverted before insertion into
.Pa <dst1 ET/EU>
and
.Pa <dst2 ET/EU>
respectively.
.Pp
Note that not all medium changers support the
.Nm exchange
operation; The changer must have multiple free pickers or emulate
multiple free pickers with transient storage.
.Pp
.Nm chio position
.Ar <to ET> <to EU>
.Op Ar inv
.Pp
Position the picker in front of the element described by
.Pa <to ET/EU> .
If the optional modifier
.Pa inv
is specified, the media unit will be inverted before insertion.
.Pp
Note that not all changers behave as expected when issued this command.
.Pp
.Nm chio params
.Pp
Report the number of slots, drives, pickers, and portals in the changer,
and which picker unit the changer is currently configured to use.
.Pp
.Nm chio getpicker
.Pp
Report which picker unit the changer is currently configured to use.
.Pp
.Nm chio setpicker
.Ar <unit>
.Pp
Configure the changer to use picker
.Pa <unit> .
.Pp
.Nm chio status
.Op Ar <type>
.Pp
Report the status of all elements in the changer.  If
.Pa <type>
is specified, report the status of all elements of type
.Pa <type> .
.Pp
The status bits are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Nm FULL
Element contains a media unit.
.It Nm IMPEXP
Media was deposited into element by an outside human operator.
.It Nm EXCEPT
Element is in an abnormal state.
.It Nm ACCESS
Media in this element is accessible by a picker.
.It Nm EXENAB
Element supports passing media (exporting) to an outsite human operator.
.It Nm INENAB
Element supports receiving media (importing) from an outside human operator.
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm chio move slot 3 drive 0
.Pp
Moves the media in slot 3 (fourth slot) to drive 0 (first drive).
.Pp
.Nm chio setpicker 2
Configures the changer to use picker 2 (third picker) for operations.
.Pp
