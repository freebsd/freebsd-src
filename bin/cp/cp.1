.Sh NAME
.Nm cp
.Nd copy files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cp
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Op Fl f | i
.Op Fl p
.Ar source_file target_file
.Nm cp
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Op Fl f | i
.Op Fl p
.Ar source_file ... target_directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the first synopsis form, the
.Nm cp
utility copies the contents of the
.Ar source_file
to the
.Ar target_file .
In the second synopsis form,
the contents of each named
.Ar source_file
is copied to the destination
.Ar target_directory .
The names of the files themselves are not changed.
If
.Nm cp
detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
If
.Ar source_file
designates a directory,
.Nm cp
copies the directory and the entire subtree connected at that point.
This option also causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than
indirected through, and for
.Nm cp
to create special files rather than copying them as normal files.
Created directories have the same mode as the corresponding source
directory, unmodified by the process' umask.
.It Fl f
For each existing destination pathname, remove it and
create a new file, without prompting for confirmation
regardless of its permissions.
(The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i
options.)
.It Fl i
Causes
.Nm cp
to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file
that would overwrite an existing file.
If the response from the standard input begins with the character
.Sq Li y 
or
.Sq Li Y ,
the file copy is attempted.
(The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f
options.)
.It Fl p
Causes
.Nm cp
to preserve in the copy as many of the modification time, access time,
file flags, file mode, user ID, and group ID as allowed by permissions.
.Pp
If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message
is displayed and the exit value is not altered.
.Pp
If the source file has its set user ID bit on and the user ID cannot
be preserved, the set user ID bit is not preserved
in the copy's permissions.
If the source file has its set group ID bit on and the group ID cannot
be preserved, the set group ID bit is not preserved
in the copy's permissions.
If the source file has both its set user ID and set group ID bits on,
and either the user ID or group ID cannot be preserved, neither
the set user ID or set group ID bits are preserved in the copy's
permissions.
.El
.Pp
For each destination file that already exists, its contents are
overwritten if permissions allow, but its mode, user ID, and group
ID are unchanged.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form, 
.Ar target_directory 
must exist unless there is only one named
.Ar source_file
which is a directory and the 
.Fl R 
flag is specified.
.Pp
If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is
used as modified by the file mode creation mask
.Pf ( Ic umask ,
see
.Xr csh 1 ) .
If the source file has its set user ID bit on, that bit is removed
unless both the source file and the destination file are owned by the
same user.
If the source file has its set group ID bit on, that bit is removed
unless both the source file and the destination file are in the same
group and the user is a member of that group.
If both the set user ID and set group ID bits are set, all of the above
conditions must be fulfilled or both bits are removed.
.Pp
Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.
.Pp
Symbolic links are always followed unless the 
.Fl R 
flag is set, in which case symbolic links are not followed, by default.
The
.Fl H
or 
.Fl L
flags (in conjunction with the
.Fl R
flag) cause symbolic links to be followed as described above.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
.Nm Cp
exits 0 on success, >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historic versions of the
.Nm cp
utility had a
.Fl r
option.
This implementation supports that option, however, its use is strongly
discouraged, as it does not correctly copy special files, symbolic links
or fifo's.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm cp
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
