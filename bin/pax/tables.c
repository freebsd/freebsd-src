 * (Actually a field in the format driver table tells us if the format wants
 * hard link info. if not, we do not waste time looking for them). We also use
 * the same table when reading an archive. In that situation, this table is
 * used by the format read routine to detect hard links from stored dev and

 * device/inode mapping table routines
 * (used with formats that store device and inodes fields)
 *
 * device/inode mapping tables remap the device field in an archive header. The
 * device/inode fields are used to determine when files are hard links to each
 * other. However these values have very little meaning outside of that. This
 * database is used to solve one of two different problems.
 *
 * 1) when files are appended to an archive, while the new files may have hard
 * links to each other, you cannot determine if they have hard links to any
 * file already stored on the archive from a prior run of pax. We must assume
 * that these inode/device pairs are unique only within a SINGLE run of pax
 * (which adds a set of files to an archive). So we have to make sure the
 * inode/dev pairs we add each time are always unique. We do this by observing
 * while the inode field is very dense, the use of the dev field is fairly
 * sparse. Within each run of pax, we remap any device number of a new archive
 * member that has a device number used in a prior run and already stored in a
 * file on the archive. During the read phase of the append, we store the
 * device numbers used and mark them to not be used by any file during the
 * write phase. If during write we go to use one of those old device numbers,
 * we remap it to a new value.
 *
 * 2) Often the fields in the archive header used to store these values are
 * too small to store the entire value. The result is an inode or device value
 * which can be truncated. This really can foul up an archive. With truncation
 * we end up creating links between files that are really not links (after
 * truncation the inodes are the same value). We address that by detecting
 * truncation and forcing a remap of the device field to split truncated
 * inodes away from each other. Each truncation creates a pattern of bits that
 * are removed. We use this pattern of truncated bits to partition the inodes
 * on a single device to many different devices (each one represented by the
 * truncated bit pattern). All inodes on the same device that have the same
 * truncation pattern are mapped to the same new device. Two inodes that
 * truncate to the same value clearly will always have different truncation
 * bit patterns, so they will be split from away each other. When we spot
 * device truncation we remap the device number to a non truncated value.
