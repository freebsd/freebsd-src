/*
 * Unique device mapping tables. Some protocols (e.g. cpio) require that the
 * <c_dev,c_ino> pair will uniquely identify a file in an archive unless they
 * are links to the same file. Appending to archives can break this. For those
 * protocols that have this requirement we map c_dev to a unique value not seen
 * in the archive when we append. We also try to handle inode truncation with
 * this table. (When the inode field in the archive header are too small, we
 * remap the dev on writes to remove accidental collisions).
 *
 * The list is hashed by device number using chain collision resolution. Off of
 * each DEVT are linked the various remaps for this device based on those bits
 * in the inode which were truncated. For example if we are just remapping to
 * avoid a device number during an update append, off the DEVT we would have
 * only a single DLIST that has a truncation id of 0 (no inode bits were
 * stripped for this device so far). When we spot inode truncation we create
 * a new mapping based on the set of bits in the inode which were stripped off.
 * so if the top four bits of the inode are stripped and they have a pattern of
 * 0110...... (where . are those bits not truncated) we would have a mapping
 * assigned for all inodes that has the same 0110.... pattern (with this dev
 * number of course). This keeps the mapping sparse and should be able to store
 * close to the limit of files which can be represented by the optimal
 * combination of dev and inode bits, and without creating a fouled up archive.
 * Note we also remap truncated devs in the same way (an exercise for the
 * dedicated reader; always wanted to say that...:)
