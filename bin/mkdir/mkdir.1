.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdir
.Nd make directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl pv
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar directory_name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified,
using mode
.Dq Li rwxrwxrwx
(0777)
as modified by the current
.Xr umask 2 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl m Ar mode"
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to
the specified mode.
The
.Ar mode
argument can be in any of the formats specified to the
.Xr chmod 1
command.
If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
.Dq Li a=rwx .
.It Fl p
Create intermediate directories as required.
If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
operand must already exist.
On the other hand, with this option specified, no error will
be reported if a directory given as an operand already exists.
Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of
.Dq Li rwxrwxrwx
(0777)
as modified by the current umask, plus write and search
permission for the owner.
.It Fl v
Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are created.
.El
.Pp
The user must have write permission in the parent directory.
.Sh EXIT STATUS

.Pp
.Dl $ mkdir foobar
.Pp

.Pa foobar
and set its file mode to 700:
.Pp
.Dl $ mkdir -m 700 foobar
.Pp
Create a directory named
.Pa cow/horse/monkey ,
creating any non-existent intermediate directories as necessary:
.Pp
.Dl $ mkdir -p cow/horse/monkey
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
