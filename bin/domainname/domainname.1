.Sh NAME
.Nm domainname
.Nd set or print name of current YP/NIS domain
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar ypdomain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints the name of the current YP/NIS domain.
The super-user can
set the domain name by supplying an argument; this is usually done with the
.Va nisdomainname
variable in the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file, normally runs at boot
time.
.Sh NOTES
The YP/NIS (formerly ``Yellow Pages'' but renamed for legal reasons)
domain name does not necessarily have anything to do with the Domain
Name System domain name, although they are often set equal for administrative
convenience.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getdomainname 3 ,
.Xr rc.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 1.1 ,
based on a similar command in
.Tn SunOS .
