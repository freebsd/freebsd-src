.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
The pwd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm pwd
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh  1
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
