.Sh NAME
.Nm rm ,
.Nm unlink
.Nd remove directory entries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f | i
.Op Fl dIRrvWx
.Ar
.Nm unlink
.Op Fl -
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on the
command line.
If the permissions of the file do not permit writing, and the standard
input device is a terminal, the user is prompted (on the standard error
output) for confirmation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.It Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i
options.
.It Fl i
Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of
the file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device is a
terminal.
The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f
options.
.It Fl I
Request confirmation once if more than three files are being removed or if a
directory is being recursively removed.
This is a far less intrusive option than
.Fl i
yet provides almost the same level of protection against mistakes.
.It Fl P
This flag has no effect.
It is kept only for backwards compatibility with
.Bx 4.4 Lite2 .
.It Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each
.Ar file
argument.
The
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation before
each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the attempt
is made to remove the directory).
If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in
that directory is skipped.
.It Fl r
Equivalent to
.Fl R .
.It Fl v
Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.
.It Fl W
Attempt to undelete the named files.
Currently, this option can only be used to recover
files covered by whiteouts in a union file system (see
.Xr undelete 2 ) .
.It Fl x
When removing a hierarchy, do not cross mount points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the links.
.Pp
It is an error to attempt to remove the files
.Pa / ,
.Pa .\&
or
.Pa .. .
.Pp
When the utility is called as
.Nm unlink ,
only one argument,
which must not be a directory,
may be supplied.
No options may be supplied in this simple mode of operation,
which performs an
.Xr unlink 2
operation on the passed argument.
However, the usual option-end delimiter,
.Fl - ,
may optionally precede the argument.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies were removed,
or if the
.Fl f
option was specified and all of the existing files or file hierarchies were
removed.
If an error occurs,
.Nm
exits with a value >0.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
command uses
.Xr getopt 3
to parse its arguments, which allows it to accept
the
.Sq Li --
option which will cause it to stop processing flag options at that
point.
This will allow the removal of file names that begin
with a dash
.Pq Sq - .
For example:
.Pp
.Dl "rm -- -filename"
.Pp
The same behavior can be obtained by using an absolute or relative
path reference.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl "rm /home/user/-filename"
.Dl "rm ./-filename"
.Sh EXAMPLES
Recursively remove all files contained within the
.Pa foobar
directory hierarchy:
.Pp
.Dl $ rm -rf foobar
.Pp
Any of these commands will remove the file
.Pa -f :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rm -- -f
$ rm ./-f
$ unlink -f
.Ed
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
utility differs from historical implementations in that the
.Fl f
option only masks attempts to remove non-existent files instead of
masking a large variety of errors.
The
.Fl v
option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.
.Pp
Also, historical
.Bx
implementations prompted on the standard output,
not the standard error output.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option does not have any effect as of
.Fx 13
and may be removed in the future.

The
.Nm
command conforms to

The simplified
.Nm unlink
command conforms to
