#	This script is called by isdnd when an unknown incoming call
#	is received. In case the destination telephone number is
#	available, it sends mail with the time, source and destination
#	numbers to a configurable address.
#
#	For this to work, and entry like this:
#
#		regexpr	= "<unknown> incoming call from"
#		regprog	= unknown_incoming
#
#	is needed in the system section of /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc.
#

# configure: who shall receive the mail
mailaddr=root

from=`echo $* | awk '{print $6}'`
to=`echo $* | awk '{print $8}'`
date=`date "+%b %d"`

# do nothing if no number available
