// a secondary at least for the zone your own domain is in.  Ask
// your network administrator for the IP address of the responsible
// primary.
//
// Never forget to include the reverse lookup (IN-ADDR.ARPA) zone!
// (This is named after the first bytes of the IP address, in reverse
// order, with ".IN-ADDR.ARPA" appended.)

// Before starting to set up a primary zone, make sure you fully

// non-obvious pitfalls.  Setting up a secondary is simpler.

// NB: Don't blindly enable the examples below. :-)  Use actual names
// and addresses instead.
//
// NOTE!!! FreeBSD can run bind in a sandbox (see named_flags in rc.conf).
// The directory containing the secondary zones must be write accessible 
// to bind.  The following sequence is suggested:
//
//	mkdir /etc/namedb/s
//	chown bind:bind /etc/namedb/s
//	chmod 750 /etc/namedb/s
