# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimisation settings above -O (-O2, ...) are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimisation settings to "-O" before submitting bug reports
# to the developers.
# Note also that at this time the -O2 setting is known to produce BROKEN
# CODE on the Alpha platform.

# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.

#CXXFLAGS+= -fmemoize-lookups -fsave-memoized

# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
