# BOOTP has mounted / for us.  Assume a read-only mount.  We must then
# - figure out our IP by querying the interface
# - fill /conf/etc (writable) with files from /etc, and then update
#   per-machine files from /conf/*/ where * is the IP of the host,
#   the IP of the subnet, "default", or nothing.
# - mount /conf/etc over /etc so we can see the new files.
#
# WARNING: i thing you should not change /etc/rc or strange things could
# happen.
#
# The operator is in charge of setting /conf/*/etc/* things as appropriate.
# Typically rc.conf and fstab need to be changed, but possibly
# also other files such as inetd.conf etc.
