# - figure out our IP by querying the interface
# - mount /etc as an MFS
# - populate /etc from /conf/default version
# - override files in /etc with files from /conf/*/etc where
#   '*' is default, netmask of client, ip-address of client
#
# The operator is in charge of setting /conf/*/etc/* things as appropriate.
# Typically rc.conf and fstab need to be changed, but possibly also other
