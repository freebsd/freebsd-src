# PROVIDE: LOGIN
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: FreeBSD NetBSD

#	This is a dummy dependancy to ensure user services such as xdm,
#	inetd, cron and kerberos are started after everything else, incase
#	the administrator has increased the system security level and
#	wants to delay user logins until the system is (almost) fully
#	operational.
