# This Makefile provides an easy way to generate the configuration
# file and database maps for the sendmail(8) daemon.
#
# The user-driven targets are:
#
# all     - Build cf, maps and aliases
# cf      - Build the .cf file from .mc file
# maps    - Build the feature maps
# aliases - Build the sendmail aliases
# install - Install the .cf file as /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
#
# For acting on both the MTA daemon and MSP queue running daemon:
# start        - Start both the sendmail MTA daemon and MSP queue running
#                daemon with the flags defined in /etc/defaults/rc.conf or
#                /etc/rc.conf
# stop         - Stop both the sendmail MTA daemon and MSP queue running
#                daemon
# restart      - Restart both the sendmail MTA daemon and MSP queue running
#                daemon
#
# For acting on just the MTA daemon:
# start-mta    - Start the sendmail MTA daemon with the flags defined in
#                /etc/defaults/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf
# stop-mta     - Stop the sendmail MTA daemon
# restart-mta  - Restart the sendmail MTA daemon
#
# For acting on just the MSP queue running daemon:
# start-mspq   - Start the sendmail MSP queue running daemon with the
#                flags defined in /etc/defaults/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf
# stop-mspq    - Stop the sendmail MSP queue running daemon
# restart-mspq - Restart the sendmail MSP queue running daemon
#
# Calling `make' will generate the updated versions when either the
# aliases or one of the map files were changed.
#
# A `make install` is only necessary after modifying the .mc file. In
# this case one would normally also call `make restart' to allow the
# running sendmail to pick up the changes as well.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This Makefile uses `<HOSTNAME>.mc' as the default MTA .mc file.  This
# can be changed by defining SENDMAIL_MC in /etc/make.conf, e.g.:
#
#	SENDMAIL_MC=/etc/mail/myconfig.mc
#
# If '<HOSTNAME>.mc' does not exist, it is created using 'freebsd.mc'
# as a template.
#
# It also uses '<HOSTNAME>.submit.mc' as the default mail submission .mc
# file.  This can be changed by defining SENDMAIL_SUBMIT_MC in
# /etc/make.conf, e.g.:
#
#	SENDMAIL_SUBMIT_MC=/etc/mail/mysubmit.mc
#
# If '<HOSTNAME>.submit.mc' does not exist, it is created using
# 'freebsd.submit.mc' as a template.

# access, authinfo, bitdomain, domaintable, genericstable, mailertable,
# userdb, uucpdomain, virtusertable
