		Filtering out SPAM from your site

Sendmail now includes excellent tools to block spam.  These tools are
available as FEATUREs that you can add to your site's .mc file.  Proper use
of these FEATUREs will prevent spammer from using your site as a relay as
well as significantly decrease the amount of spam that arrives at your
site.  No set of anti-spam tools will block all spam without blocking some
portion of legitimate mail as well.  Therefore, these FEATUREs are designed
to prevent as much spam as possible without blocking legitimate mail.

These tools are discussed in /usr/share/sendmail/cf/README.  Read the
section entitled "ANTI-SPAM CONFIGURATION CONTROL".  Example usage and
additional tools can be found in /usr/share/sendmail/cf/cf/knecht.mc.
