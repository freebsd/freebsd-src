		Filtering out SPAM from your site
        Sendmail now includes excellent tools block spam.  These
tools are available as FEATUREs that you can add to your site's
.mc file.  Proper use of these FEATUREs will prevent spammer from
using your site as a relay as well as significantly decrease the
amount of spam that arrives at your site.  No set of anti-spam
tools will block all spam without blocking some portion of legitimate
mail as well.  Therefore, these FEATUREs are designed to prevent
as much spam as possible without blocking legitimate mail.

	These tools are discussed in /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README.
Read the section entitled "ANTI-SPAM CONFIGURATION CONTROL".  Example
usage and additional tools can be found in
/usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/cf/knecht.mc.
