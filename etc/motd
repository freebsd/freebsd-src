Welcome to FreeBSD!  You will find security advisories and updated
errata information for all releases at http://www.FreeBSD.ORG/releases/

Before asking for technical assistance:
 1.  Consult the ERRATA section for your release at the URL above.

 2.  Search the Handbook, FAQ, and mail archives at 
     http://www.FreeBSD.ORG/search.html. If the doc distribution is

     and Handbook documents in /usr/share/doc/

 3.  If you still have a question or problem, collect the output of
     `uname -a' along with error messages from whatever part of the
     system you are having problems with and email it as a question
     to the questions@FreeBSD.ORG mailing list.
        
You may also use `/stand/sysinstall' to re-enter the installation and
configuration  utility.  Edit /etc/motd to change this login announcement.
