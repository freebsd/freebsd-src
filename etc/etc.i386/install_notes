FreeBSD 1.0
INSTALLATION NOTES <2.00, 10 September 1993>

These notes have been prepared from those written originally for NetBSD
0.9. The conversion was done by someone who has had experience with
installing and upgrading 386bsd, but who is not a unix guru, so there
will be slant towards this experience. Corrections/updates are
welcomed, it is difficult/impossible to test every last hardware
combination.

Be sure to read _ALL_ of this document before you try to install
FreeBSD.  FreeBSD probably looks a bit similar to things that you've
seen before (perhaps 386BSD), but the installation procedures are quite
different.


FreeBSD 1.0 Release Contents:
------- --- ------- --------

The FreeBSD 1.0 Release consists of the following elements:

Bootable Kernel-copy floppies

	These disks are bootable and have enough utilities on
	board to copy a new kernel to a prepared hard disk.  While
	they are primarily intended for installing FreeBSD, they
	also make upgrading to a new kernel easy:  boot from it,
	and copy a new kernel to disk.

	You must choose between one of two kernel-copy floppy
	images, depending on your disk controller type.  The
	"kcopy-ah-floppy" image supports the Adaptec 154x and 1742
	SCSI adapters, while "kcopy-bt-floppy" supports the Bustek
	742 and Ultrastore SCSI adapters.  For systems with only
	MFM, RLL, ESDI or IDE disk controllers, either image can
	be used.

Installation floppies

	In addition to a bootble floppy, currently two additional
	disks are required to prepare your hard drive for FreeBSD
	and to install the FreeBSD distribution.  Like the boot
	floppies, these are distributed as binary images.  They are
	are named "filesystem-floppy" and "cpio-floppy".

	There is also an optional fourth installation disk referred
	to as the "dos-floppy".  This can include any programs
	from the tools directory.  For instance, add kermit if
	this is needed for downloading files.  Unlike the binary
	images which are written to a floppy via dd(1) or rawrite.exe,
	these programs should be copied to a DOS formatted floppy
	using 386BSD's `mcopy' command (or the `copy' command if
	working from DOS).

Upgrade floppies

	These facilitate upgrading to FreeBSD from any previous
	patch-kit level of 386BSD 0.1.  Since they are currently
	in BETA testing, they are not further mentioned in this
	document.  However, they are currently available upon
	request to FreeBSD-questions@freebsd.cdrom.com.

FreeBSD distribution sets

	These collections contain the complete FreeBSD system and
	utilities.  There are three separate sets: the FreeBSD
	binaries, the FreeBSD sources, and the DES sources+binaries.
	The DES set contains only crypt(3) code and is subject to
	U.S.A.  export restrictions.

	The binary distribution set can be found in the "binarydist"
	subdirectory of the distribution. It is a single gzip'ed
	tar archive split into files named bin_tgz.aa to bin_tgz.db
	(i.e., 80 files all told), plus file CKSUMS.

	The source distribution sets can be found in under
	"sourcedist" subdirectory of the distribution. It is
	consists of files named src_tgz.aa to src_tgz.cp (i.e.,
	68 files all told), plus file CKSUMS.

	Finally, the security distribution set contains
	usr/src/libcrypt/*, the source files for the DES encryption
	algorithm, and the binaries which depend on it.  It can
	be found in the "securedist" subdirectory on sites which
	choose to carry the complete FreeBSD distribution.

	The individual files in each collection are no more than
	235 Kbytes in size.  (The last file is just long enough
	to contain the rest of the data for that distribution
	set.)

	Each collection is a split, gzip'ed tar archive.  They
	are reassembled and extracted by the install procedure.
	However, to view them without installing, you can use, e.g.,
	the command line:

		cat bin* | gunzip | tar tvf - | more

	or to extract the files themselves:

		cat bin* | gunzip | tar xvfp -

	Using this method, the files are extracted, "below" the
	current directory.  That is, if you want to extract the
	binaries "into" your system, i.e. replace the system
	binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xvfp" from /.

	In each of the distribution directories, there is a file
	named "CKSUMS" which contains the checksums of the files
	in that directory, as generated by the cksum(1) command.
	You can use cksum to verify the integrity of the archives,
	if you suspect one of the files is corrupted.

	N.B.: The CKSUMS files are produced using the 4.4BSD 
	version of cksum which is POSIX compliant.  The values in
	this file will probably not match with cksums from other
	systems.  FreeBSD uses the new 4.4BSD cksum routine.  A
	copy of the new cksum binary that will run on
	386bsd/Netbsd/FreeBSD can be found in the "tools" subdirectory
	of the distribution.

	
System Requirements and Supported Devices:
------ ------------ --- --------- -------

FreeBSD 1.0 runs on ISA (AT-Bus) and EISA systems, with 386 and 486
processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It does NOT support
Micro-channel systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The minimal
configuration includes 4Meg of RAM, and a 70Meg hard disk, but to
install the entire system you'll need much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system more RAM is recommended.  (4Meg will actually
allow you to run X and/or compile, but it's extremely slow.)

Supported devices include:

	Standard floppy controllers
	Standard hard disk controllers:
		MFM
		ESDI
		IDE
		RLL
	SCSI hard disk controllers:
		Adaptec AHA-1542{A,B,C}, -1742		[kcopy-ah-floppy]
		Bustek 742 (EISA) Ultrastor 14f and 34f [kcopy-bt-floppy]
	Display Adaptors:
		MDA
		CGA
		VGA (and SVGA)
		HGC
	Serial communications ports
		8250
		16450
		16550A
	Ethernet controllers
		SMC/WD 8003, 8013, and equivalents
			(including the SMC "Elite" series)
		Novell NE1000, NE2000
		3COM 3c503
		ISOLAN ISOLink
	Tape drives:
		QIC-02 format tape drives
		most SCSI tape drives should work
		_NO_ QIC-40 or QIC-80 tape drives will work
	CD-ROM drives:
		most SCSI CD-ROM drives should work
		_NO_ non-SCSI CD-ROM drives will work

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows: (Note: IRQ 9 is the same as IRQ 2
on ISA/EISA based machines)

N.B.: Disable the lpt interrupt on the board or you will
have problems using the lpa drivers.

Hard-Disk Storage Requirements 
--------- ------- ------------

The minimum base installation of FreeBSD requires a free hard disk
partition with at least 16 MB free space.  This is only enough for
the three installation disks, which don't support a multi-user
shell.

The full binary distribution  extracts to about 46 MB.
The full source distribution extracts to about 72 MB.
To recompile the sources requires an additional 55 MB.

Since additional room is required for extracting the distributions,
a full binary installation requires a minimum of about 70 MB (46
MB extracted + 16 MB archived + 8 MB minimum swap).

A complete source + binary distribution requires a minimum of
about 210 MB (assuming a minimum 8 MB swap).


Getting the System on to Useful Media:
------- --- ------ -- -- ------ -----

Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	MS-DOS floppies
	Tape
	NFS partitions
	FTP

No matter what you do, however, you'll need at least three disks (1.2M
or 1.44M) handy, on which you will put the kernel-copy image and the
install (or upgrade) floppy images.

The images are available from the directory "floppies", under the root
of the FreeBSD/FreeBSD-1.0-GAMMA tree at your favorite archive site.
They're available both as raw disk images, and gzipped, to save time
downloading.

If you are using an AHA-154x or AHA-1742 SCSI host adapter, you need
the kcopy-ah-floppy image.  If you're using a BT-742 SCSI host adapter
or an Ultrastor adaptor, then you'll need the kcopy-bt-floppy image.
If you're using MFM/RLL/IDE disk controllers, you can use either
kernel-copy floppy image.

If you are using UNIX to make the floppies, you should use the command
dd(1) to write the raw floppy images (i.e., kcopy-ah-floppy or
kcopy-bt-floppy, filesystem-floppy and cpio-floppy) to the floppies.
For example, to write kcopy-ah-floppy to a 5.25" 1.2 Mb floppy
disk under 386BSD, use:

	$ dd if=kcopy-ah-floppy of=/dev/fd0a bs=30b count=80

or for a 3.5" 1.44 Mb floppy:

	$ dd if=kcopy-ah-floppy of=/dev/fd0a bs=36b count=80

If you are using DOS to make the floppies, use the rawrite.exe
utility.  This can be found in the "tools" subdirectory of the
distribution.  Copy or download  rawrite.exe and the binary images
to a DOS disk, type "rawrite" under MS-DOS and follow the
instructions.  Rawrite can write binary images to either 1.2MB or
1.44MB floppies (which must be DOS formatted).

Any other programs from the tools directory that might be needed
for installing FreeBSD, such as kermit, should be copied to a DOS
formatted floppy (1.2MB or 1.44MB).  Under 386BSD, they can be
copied to floppy using the mcopy command.  Under DOS, use the DOS
copy command.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  The various methods
are explained below.

To prepare for installing via MS-DOS floppies:

	To prepare FreeBSD for installaton from MS-DOS floppies, you
	need to do the following:

		Count the number of "<set>_tgz.xx" files
		you have (these are split, gzip'ed, tar 
		archives).  Call this number N.  You will
		need N/6 1.44M floppies, or N/5 1.2M
		floppies to install the distribution
		in this manner. For the set of bin files
		(i.e., 80 files) and 1.2 Mb floppies you will
		need 16 disks.

		Format all of the floppies, with MS-DOS.
		Don't make any of them MS-DOS bootable
		floppies.  (i.e. don't use "format /s"!)
		(If you use "format /u" then the format
		will run a tad faster).

		Copy all of the "<set>_tgz.xx" files on
		the DOS disks.  Under DOS use the DOS copy
		command.    Under 386BSD, use, for instance, 
		the make_floppies script:

			#!/bin/sh
			N_PER_DISK=5

			x=$N_PER_DISK
			for dist in bin_tgz.*; do
				if [ $x -ge $N_PER_DISK ]; then
					x=0
					echo "Insert next disk"
					echo "And press ENTER..."
					read reply
					mdel a:/\*
				fi
				mcopy $dist a:/
				x=`expr $x + 1`
			done

	(Or you might use tar instead).

	Once you have the files on DOS disks, you can proceed to the
	next step in the installation process, viz preparing your hard
	disk.

To prepare for installing via a tape:

	To install FreeBSD from a tape, you need to be somehow
	to get the FreeBSD filesets you wish to install on
	your system on to the appropriate kind of tape,
	in tar format.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:

		tar cvf <tape_device> <files>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (either
	/dev/rst0 for SCSI tape, otherwise /dev/rwt0). 
	If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.
	"<files>" are the names of the "<set>.tar.gz.xx" files
	which you want to be placed on the tape.

To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	Place the FreeBSD software you wish to install into
	a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
	mountable by the machine which you will be installing
	FreeBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
	/etc/exports file of the NFS server and resetting
	mountd, acts which will require superuser privileges.
	Make a note of the numeric IP address of the NFS server
	and make a note of the router closest to the the new
	FreeBSD machine if the NFS server is not on a network
	which is directly attached to the FreeBSD machine.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.

To prepare for installing via FTP:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	The preparations for this method of installation
	are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
	there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
	the FreeBSD installation when it's time to do
	the install.  You should know the numeric IP
	address of that site, and the numeric IP address of
	your nearest router if the new FreeBSD computer is
	not on the same net or subnet as the FTP site.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.

	FreeBSD-questions@freefall.cdrom.com)

Preparing your Hard Disk for FreeBSD Installation:
--------- ---- ---- ---- --- ------ ------------

NOTE: If you wish to install FreeBSD on your whole drive, (i.e. you do
not want DOS or any other operating system on your hard disk), you can
skip this section, and go on to "Installing the FreeBSD System."

Firstly, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data which you may
want to keep; repartitioning your hard drive is an excellent way to
destroy important data.

WARNING: If you are using a disk controller which supports disk
geometry translation, BE SURE TO USE THE SAME PARAMETERS FOR FreeBSD AS
FOR DOS!  If you do not, FreeBSD will not be able to properly coexist
with DOS.

Secondly, make sure your disk has at least 16 Mbytes free space (or 
70 Mbytes for the complete binary distribition).

You are now set to install FreeBSD on your hard drive.

Installing the FreeBSD System:
---------- --- ------ ------

If DOS or OS/2 is already installed on the hard disk, installation should
be easy.  By default FreeBSD is installed after the last DOS or OS/2
partition.  Otherwise, you may need to specify your hard disk's geometry
(i.e., number of cylinders, heads and sectors per track).

For computing partition sizes, it might help to have a calculator handy.

And it's finally time to install the system!

The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get FreeBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation, you
may hit Control-C at any prompt and then type `halt'. 

	Boot from the kcopy-ah or kcopy-bt floppy, depending on
	your hard disk controller type.

	When prompted to insert the filesystem floppy, remove the
	kcopy floppy from the drive and insert filesystem floppy
	and hit any key.
	N.B.: The filesystem floppy must not be write protected.
	
	[When booting, if no message prompt appears after a
	reasonable period of time, reboot and try it again.  If
	this doesn't work, try disabling your CPU's internal and
	external caches, and then try to boot again. If there is
	still no message prompt, then you can't install FreeBSD
	on your hardware.  If you were able to install 386bsd,
	this is definitely a bug in our software; please report
	it!  Please include your system configuration, and any
	other relevant information in your bug report.]

	The boot sequence continues after the filesystem floppy
	has been inserted.   A copyright notice is displayed along
	with a list of the hardware that FreeBSD recognizes as
	being in your machine.  You might want to make a note of
	the disk values for cylinders, heads, sectors etc for
	later use.

	After a short while (approximately 30 to 60 seconds), you
	should see a welcome message and a prompt, asking if you
	wish to proceed with the installation.

	If you wish to proceed, enter "y" and then return.

	You will then be asked what type of disk drive you have.
	The valid options are listed on the screen (e.g., SCSI, ESDI).

	You will then be asked for a label name for your disk.
	This should be a short, one-word name for your disk,
	e.g. "cp3100-mine" for a Conner Peripherals "3100" disk.
	You needn't remember this name.

	Next, you will be prompted for the geometry information.
	The default values should be correct, in which case just
	hit ENTER to accept them.  Otherwise  enter the values
	that were displayed during the boot sequence as they are
	requested.

	The default size of the FreeBSD portion of the disk
	is the maximum available at the end of the disk (which may
	be the whole disk).  Accept the default by hitting ENTER.
	Otherwise, enter an appropriate value using the information
	displayed.

	If you are not installing on the whole disk, you will be
	asked for the offset of the FreeBSD partition from the
	beginning of the disk.  Again, hit ENTER to accept the
	default, or enter a cylinder offset from the beginning of
	the disk.

	You will then be asked for the size of your root partition,
	in cylinders. The suggested maximum size is 15 Mbytes
	which is used as a default.  Accept this, or enter a
	suitable value (after converting to cylinders using the
	formula displayed).

	Next, you will be asked for the size of your swap partition
	- again, you must calculate this in cylinders.  You should
	probably allocate around twice as much swap space as you
	have real memory.  If you wish the system to save crash dumps
	when it panics, you will need at least as much swap as you
	have RAM.

	The install program will then ask you for information about
	the rest of the partitions you want on your disk.  For the
	purposes of this document, you only want one more: /usr.
	Therefore, at the prompt, when in asks you to enter the size
	of the next partition, enter the number of cylinders remaining
	in the FreeBSD portion of the disk. When it asks you for the
	mount point for this partition, say "/usr".

	YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

	If you confirm that you want to install FreeBSD, your hard
	drive will be modified, and perhaps it contents scrambled at
	the whim of the install program.  This is especially likely
	if you gave the install program incorrect information.

	If you are sure you want to proceed, enter "yes" at the prompt.

	The install program will now make the filesystems you
	specified.  There should be no errors in this section of the
	installation.  If there are, restart from the the beginning
	of the installation process.

	After the installation program prompts you to see if you'd
	like to be told about all of the files it's going to copy
	to your hard drive, it will spend a few minutes copying these
	files and then will print out an informative message and
	place you at a "#" prompt.

	Read the message and note which partition (e.g., sd0a or wd0a)
	you need to copy a kernel to.  Reboot the machine off the
	kcopy-xx-floppy disk, but this time at the prompt asking
	you to insert a file system floppy, do _not_ replace the
	floppy, just press <enter>.

	At the "kc>" prompt, enter "copy" to prepare to copy the
	kernel on the floppy to your hard disk.

	At the next "kc>" prompt, enter the disk partition to which
	you want to copy the kernel. (e.g., sd0a or wd0a).

	It will work for a minute or two, then present you with
	another "#" prompt.  Follow the instructions given, (i.e.,
	halt the system) and reboot from the hard disk. You will
	probably have to do a hardware reset or else your ethernet
	card might not be recognised at reboot (e.g., if you have a
	WD8003EP card).

	When the machine boots, a three-line banner should appear at
	the top of the screen.  In a few seconds, a series of
	messages will appear, describing the hardware in your machine.
	Once again, this stage can take up to two minutes, so DO NOT
	PANIC!

	You will be asked to insert the cpio-floppy into a floppy
	drive, and enter that drive's number.  "0" corresponds to
	DOS's "A:" drive, "1" corresponds to DOS's "B:" drive.

	After you enter the number it will ask you if you'd like to
	watch its progress, and after you answer this question it
	will begin installing still more files on your hard disk.
	This should take no more than 3 minutes.

	You will be given (more) instructions, (e.g., to halt the
	system) and you should reboot the machine again, from the
	hard drive and probably with a hardware reset to kick your
	ethernet card back into life.

	CONGRATULATIONS: You now have the minimum base of FreeBSD
	files on your hard disk!  Now you get to install the
	distribution file sets.  Remember that, at minimum, you must
	install the bin.tar.gz.xx file set (see below for
	instructions).

	After the machine is done booting, you will be presented
	with a screenful of information about what to do next.

	What you do from this point on depends on which media you're
	using to install FreeBSD.  Follow the appropriate
	instructions, given below.

	To install from tape or floppy:

		The first thing you should do is to choose a temporary
		directory where the distribution files can be stored.
		To do this, use the command "set_tmp_dir" and enter
		your choice.  The default is /usr/distrib.

		After you have chosen a temporary directory,
		you should issue the appropriate load command:

			load_fd if you're loading from floppies
			(NOTE: as of time of writing these notes,
			this does not work).
			
			load_qic_tape if loading from QIC-02 tape

			load_scsi_tape if you're loading from the first
				       SCSI tape drive in the system.

		You will then be prompted for information as to which
		floppy drive to load from, if you choose that
		method of installation.

		Next, you will be told to insert the media into
		the appropriate drive, and hit return.  Continue
		to follow instructions until you are returned to
		the "#" prompt.

		Go to the directory which contains the first
		distribution set you wish to install.  This is
		either the directory you specified above, if loading
		from floppy, or possibly a subdirectory of that
		directory, if you loaded from tape.

		When there, run "set_tmp_dir" again, and choose
		the default temporary directory, by hitting
		return at the prompt.

		Run the "extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you
		wish to extract.  For example, to extract the binary
		distribution, use the command:

			extract bin

		and to extract the source distribution:

			extract src

		After the extraction is complete, go to the location
		of the next set you want to extract, "set_tmp_dir"
		again, and once again issue the appropriate
		extract command.  Continue this process until
		you've finished installing all of the sets which you
		desire to have on your hard disk.

		After each set is finished, if you know that you
		are running low on space you can remove the
		distribution files for that set by saying:

			rm <set>*

		For example, if you wish to remove the distribution
		files for the binarydist set, after the "extract bin"
		command has completed, issue the command:

			rm bin*

		Once you have extracted all sets and are at the "#" prompt
		again, proceed to the section "Configuring Your System,"
		below.

	To install via FTP or NFS:

		First you must decide on a temporary directory to hold
		the <set>.tar.gz.xx files. The directory /usr/distrib
		is suggested. You should cd to it, if necessary do
		a mkdir first. Use set_tmp_dir to identify this 
		directory to the install process.

		Configure the appropriate ethernet interface (e.g. ed0,
		ne0, etc.) up, with a command like:

			ifconfig <ifname> <ipaddr> [netmask <netmask>]

		where <ifname> is the interface name (e.g. ed0, etc.),
		and <ipaddr> is the numeric IP address of the interface.
		If the interface has a special netmask, supply
		the word "netmask" and that netmask at the end of the
		command line.  For instance, without a special netmask:

			ifconfig ed0 129.133.10.10

		or with a special netmask

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 0xffffff00

		or the equivalent

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 255.255.255.0

		If you are using the AUI connector on a 3C503 card, you
		must also set the LLC0 flag (the default is to use the BNC
		connector):

			ifconfig ed0 130.252.23.86 llc0

		If the NFS server or FTP server is not on a directly-
		connected network, you should set up a route to it
		with the command:

			route add default <gate_ipaddr>

		where <gate_ipaddr> is your gateway's numeric IP address.

		If you are NFS-mounting the distribution sets,
		mount them on the temporary directory with the command:

			mount -t nfs <serv_ipaddr>:<dist_dir> <tmp_dir>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's numeric IP address,
		<dist_dir> is the path to the distribution files on
		the server, and <tmp_dir> is the name of the local
		temporary directory (e.g., /usr/distrib). Proceed as if
		you had loaded the files from tape, "cd"ing to the
		appropriate directories and running "set_tmp_dir" and
		"extract" as appropriate.

		If you are retrieving the distribution sets using ftp,
		cd into the temp directory, and execute the command:

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's numeric IP address.
		Get the files with FTP, taking care to use binary mode
		to transfer all files. A simple set of commands is

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>
			user ftp
			passwd <user-id>@
			hash
			binary
			prompt
			cd <where/the/binarydist/files/are>
			mget *
			cd <where/the/sourcedist/files/are>
			mget *
			quit

		Once you have all of the files for the distribution sets
		that you wish to install, you can proceed using the
		instructions above as if you had installed the files
		from a floppy.

	You might wish to install the binarydist first, get that
	working, and then at a later point in time have a go at
	installing the sourcedist. BEFORE YOU REBOOT AFTER INSTALLING
	THE BINARYDIS, you must preserve the commands that do the
	extracting. They are kept in the single-user-mode .profile
	file called /.profile.  Proceed like this:

		mv /.profile /.profile.install
		ln /root/.profile /.profile

	When you are ready to install the sourcedist at some time
	in the future, get into multi-user mode (i.e., the normal
	means of running FreeBSD) and issue these commands:

		cp /.profile.install /.profile
		shutdown now

	This will cause the system to go into single-user mode, and
	the install profile will be active (i.e., you will find the
	commands load_fd, extract etc available to you again).


Configuring Your System:
----------- ---- ------

Once you have finished extracting all of the distribution sets that you
want on your hard drive and are back at the "#" prompt, you are ready
to configure your system.

The configuration utility expects that you have installed the base
system.  If you have not, you will not be able to run it successfully
(nor will you have a functional system regardless of configuration).

To configure the newly installed operating system, run the command
"configure".

Configure will ask for the machine's hostname, domain name, and other
network configuration information. You should check that configure has
set up the following files correctly:

	/etc/netstart
	/etc/myname

Once you have supplied configure all that it requests, your machine
will be configured well enough that when you reboot it it will be a
completely functional FreeBSD system.  It is not completely configured,
however; you should adjust the /etc/sendmail.cf file as necessary to
suit your site and/or disable sendmail in /etc/rc and you should look
in /etc/netstart to make sure the flags are defined correctly for your
site. You might wish to set up several other tcp/ip files, such as

	/etc/resolv.conf
	/etc/networks

Once you are done with configuration, reboot with the "reboot" command.

When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete FreeBSD
system!  CONGRATULATIONS! (You really deserve them!!!)
