# Set to a string representing the interrupts you are going to use
#  for generating entropy in the kernel (or NO to ignore).
#  The keyboard (IRQ 1) is good if it used a lot.
#  If the machine is networked, the ethernet card is good.
#  The IRQ on an intelligent hard disk controller is good.
#  The IRQ's on most sound devices are good.
#
#  The following choices are BAD:
#  THe IRQ's on COM-ports (SIO devices), the IRQ used by an IDE
#  disk or CDROM, and the IRQ on the system clock.
#
# Experiment with the rest. The best interrupts are the ones that
#  happen fairly irregularly, and never occur in very high-speed bursts.
#
# You'll have it right when you have a good supply of numbers from
#  /dev/random, and no problems on your system, like slowdowns,
#  Sluggish net/disk activity, perhaps even errors.
