#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.
#   The latest tables should be available from the following:
#
#   <http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/>
#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping
#   tables, see the file "README.TXT".
#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Thai code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode or Unicode sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNNNN or 0xNNNN+0xNNNN).
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Thai code order.
#
#   Some of these mappings require the use of corporate characters.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Thai character set uses the standard control characters at
#   0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Thai:
# ---------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   Codes 0xA1-0xDA and 0xDF-0xFB are the character set from Thai
#   standard TIS 620-2533, except that the following changes are
#   made:
#     0xEE is TRADE MARK SIGN (instead of THAI CHARACTER YAMAKKAN)
#     0xFA is REGISTERED SIGN (instead of THAI CHARACTER ANGKHANKHU)
#     0xFB is COPYRIGHT SIGN (instead of THAI CHARACTER KHOMUT)
#
#   Codes 0x80-0x82, 0x8D-0x8E, 0x91, 0x9D-0x9E, and 0xDB-0xDE are
#   various additional punctuation marks (e.g. curly quotes,
#   ellipsis), no-break space, and two special characters "word join"
#   and "word break".
#
#   Codes 0x83-0x8C, 0x8F, and 0x92-0x9C are for positional variants
#   of the upper vowels, tone marks, and other signs at 0xD1,
#   0xD4-0xD7, and 0xE7-0xED. The positional variants would normally
#   be considered presentation forms only and not characters. In most
#   cases they are not typed directly; they are selected automatically
#   at display time by the WorldScript software. However, using the
#   Thai-DTP keyboard, the presentation forms can in fact be typed
#   directly using dead keys. Thus they must be treated as real
#   characters in the Mac OS Thai encoding. They are mapped using
#   variant tags; see below.
#
#   Several code points are undefined and unused (they cannot be
#   typed using any of the Mac OS Thai keyboard layouts): 0x90, 0x9F,
#   0xFC-0xFE. These are not shown in the table below.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The goals in the Apple mappings provided here are:
#   - Ensure roundtrip mapping from every character in the Mac OS Thai
#   character set to Unicode and back
#   - Use standard Unicode characters as much as possible, to maximize
#   interchangeability of the resulting Unicode text. Whenever possible,
#   avoid having content carried by private-use characters.
#
#   To satisfy both goals, we use private use characters to mark variants
#   that are similar to a sequence of one or more standard Unicode
#   characters.
#
#   Apple has defined a block of 32 corporate characters as "transcoding
#   hints." These are used in combination with standard Unicode characters
#   to force them to be treated in a special way for mapping to other
#   encodings; they have no other effect. Sixteen of these transcoding
#   hints are "grouping hints" - they indicate that the next 2-4 Unicode
#   characters should be treated as a single entity for transcoding. The
#   other sixteen transcoding hints are "variant tags" - they are like
#   combining characters, and can follow a standard Unicode (or a sequence
#   consisting of a base character and other combining characters) to
#   cause it to be treated in a special way for transcoding. These always
#   terminate a combining-character sequence.
#
#   The transcoding coding hints used in this mapping table are four
#   variant tags in the range 0xF873-75. Since these are combined with
#   standard Unicode characters, some characters in the Mac OS Thai
#   character set map to a sequence of two Unicodes instead of a single
#   Unicode character. For example, the Mac OS Thai character at 0x83 is a
#   low-left positional variant of THAI CHARACTER MAI EK (the standard
#   mapping is for the abstract character at 0xE8). So 0x83 is mapped to
#   0x0E48 (THAI CHARACTER MAI EK) + 0xF875 (a variant tag).
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version b02 to version b03/c01:
#
#   - Update mapping for 0xDB to use new Unicode 3.2 character U+2060
#     WORD JOINER instead of U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (BOM)
#
#   Changes from version n04 to version n07:
#
#   - Changed mappings of the positional variants to use standard
#   Unicodes + transcoding hint, instead of using single corporate
#   zone characters. This affected the mappings for the following:
#   0x83-08C, 0x8F, 0x92-0x9C
#
#   - Just comment out unused code points in the table, instead
#   of mapping them to U+FFFD.
