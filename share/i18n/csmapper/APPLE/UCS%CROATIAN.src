#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.

#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping
#   tables, see the file "README.TXT".
#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Croatian code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Croatian code order.
#
#   One of these mappings requires the use of a corporate character.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Croatian character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Croatian:
# -------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   Mac OS Croatian is used for Croatian and Slovene.
#
#   The Mac OS Croatian encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the standard Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if
#   the Croatian encoding is being used, you must check if the
#   system region code is 68, verCroatia (or 25, verYugoCroatian,
#   only used in older systems).
#
#   This character set is a variant of standard Mac OS Roman
#   encoding, adding five accented letter case pairs to handle
#   Croatian. It has 20 code point differences from standard
#   Mac OS Roman, but only 10 differences in repertoire.
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, code point 0xDB was CURRENCY SIGN, and was
#   mapped to U+00A4. In Mac OS 8.5 and later versions, code point
#   0xDB is changed to EURO SIGN and maps to U+20AC; the standard
#   Apple fonts are updated for Mac OS 8.5 to reflect this. There is
#   a "currency sign" variant of the Mac OS Croatian encoding that
#   still maps 0xDB to U+00A4; this can be used for older fonts.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The following corporate zone Unicode character is used in this
#   mapping:
#
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n07 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 8.5; change mapping of 0xDB from
#   CURRENCY SIGN (U+00A4) to  EURO SIGN (U+20AC).
#
#   Changes from version n03 to version n05:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xBD from U+2126 to its canonical
#     decomposition, U+03A9.
