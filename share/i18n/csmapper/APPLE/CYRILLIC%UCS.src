#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Cyrillic code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Cyrillic code order.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Cyrillic character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Cyrillic:
# -------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported directly in programming
#   interfaces for QuickDraw Text, the Script Manager, and related
#   Text Utilities. For other purposes it is supported via transcoding
#   to and from Unicode.
#
#   This is the "Euro sign" version of Mac Cyrillic for Mac OS 9.0 and
#   later. Before Mac OS 9.0, there were two separate Slavic Cyrillic
#   encodings:
#
#   1. The Cyrillic currency sign variant (used for localized Russian
#      and Bulgarian systems), which had the following:
#       0xA2  U+00A2 CENT SIGN
#       0xB6  U+2202 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL
#       0xFF  U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN
#
#   2. The Ukrainian currency sign variant (used for localized Ukrainian
#      systems and the pre-9.0 Cyrillic Language Kit), which had the
#      following:
#       0xA2  U+0490 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER GHE WITH UPTURN
#       0xB6  U+0491 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER GHE WITH UPTURN
#       0xFF  U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN
#
#   This new Cyrillic Euro sign version is based on the old Ukrainian
#   currency sign variant, with 0xFF changed to be EURO SIGN.
#
#   The Mac OS Cyrillic encoding includes the Cyrillic letter repertoire
#   of ISO 8859-5 (although not at the same code points). This covers
#   most of the Slavic languages written in Cyrillic script.
#
#   The Mac OS Cyrillic encoding also includes a number of characters
#   needed for the Mac OS user interface and localization (e.g.
#   ellipsis, bullet, copyright sign). All of the characters in Mac OS
#   Cyrillic that are also in the Mac OS Roman encoding are at the
#   same code point in both; this improves application compatibility.
#
#   Note: There is a common Ukrainian glyph variation in which the glyph
#   for CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN I may or may not
#   have a dot above.

#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n05 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 9.0 to merge with Mac OS Ukrainian and
#   support EURO SIGN. 0xA2 changed from U+00A2 to U+0490; 0xB6 changed
#   from U+2202 to U+0491; 0xFF changed from U+00A4 to U+20AC.
