#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.
#   The latest tables should be available from the following:

#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping

#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Icelandic code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Icelandic code order.
#
#   One of these mappings requires the use of a corporate character.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Icelandic character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Icelandic:
# --------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   1. General
#
#   Mac OS Icelandic is used for Icelandic and Faroese.
#
#   The Mac OS Icelandic encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the standard Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if
#   the Icelandic encoding is being used, you must also check if
#   the system region code is 21, verIceland.
#
#   This character set is a variant of standard Mac OS Roman,
#   adding upper and lower eth, thorn, and Y acute. It has 6 code
#   point differences from standard Mac OS Roman.
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, code point 0xDB was CURRENCY SIGN, and was
#   mapped to U+00A4. In Mac OS 8.5 and later versions, code point
#   0xDB is changed to EURO SIGN and maps to U+20AC; the standard
#   Apple fonts are updated for Mac OS 8.5 to reflect this. There are
#   "currency sign" variants of the Mac OS Icelandic encoding that
#   still map 0xDB to U+00A4; these can be used for older fonts.
#
#   2. Font variants
#
#   The table in this file gives the Unicode mappings for the standard
#   Mac OS Icelandic encoding. This encoding is supported by the
#   Icelandic versions of the fonts Chicago, Geneva, Monaco, and New
#   York, and is the encoding supported by the text processing
#   utilities. However, other TrueType fonts implement a slightly
#   different encoding; the difference is only in two code points.
#   For the standard variant, these are:
#     0xBB -> 0x00AA  FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR
#     0xBC -> 0x00BA  MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR
#
#   For the TrueType variant (used by the Icelandic versions of the
#   fonts Courier, Helvetica, Palatino, and Times), these are:
#     0xBB -> 0xFB01  LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI
#     0xBC -> 0xFB02  LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FL
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The following corporate zone Unicode character is used in this
#   mapping:
#
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n06 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 8.5; change mapping of 0xDB from
#   CURRENCY SIGN (U+00A4) to EURO SIGN (U+20AC).
#
#   Changes from version n02 to version n03:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xBD from U+2126 to its canonical
#     decomposition, U+03A9.
