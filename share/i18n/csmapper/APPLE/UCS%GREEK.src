#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping

#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Greek code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Greek code order.
#
#   One of these mappings requires the use of a corporate character.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Greek character set uses the standard control characters at
#   0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Greek:
# ----------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   Although a Mac OS script code is defined for Greek (smGreek = 6),
#   the Greek localized system does not currently use it (the font
#   family IDs are in the Mac OS Roman range). To determine if the
#   Greek encoding is being used when the script code is smRoman (0),
#   you must check if the system region code is 20, verGreece.
#
#   The Mac OS Greek encoding is a superset of the repertoire of
#   ISO 8859-7 (although characters are not at the same code points),
#   except that LEFT & RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK replace the
#   MODIFIER LETTER REVERSED COMMA & APOSTROPHE (spacing versions of
#   Greek rough & smooth breathing marks) that are in ISO 8859-7.
#   The added characters in Mac OS Greek include more punctuation and
#   symbols and several accented Latin letters.
#
#   Before Mac OS 9.2.2, code point 0x9C was SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD), and
#   code point 0xFF was undefined. In Mac OS 9.2.2 and later versions,
#   SOFT HYPHEN was moved to 0xFF, and code point 0x9C was changed to be
#   EURO SIGN (U+20AC); the standard Apple fonts are updated for Mac OS
#   9.2.2 to reflect this. There is a "no Euro sign" variant of the Mac
#   OS Greek encoding that uses the older mapping; this can be used for
#   older fonts.
#
#   This "no Euro sign" variant of Mac OS Greek was the character set
#   used by Mac OS Greek systems before 9.2.2 except for system 6.0.7,
#   which used a variant character set but was quickly replaced with
#   Greek system 6.0.7.1 using the no Euro sign" character set
#   documented here. Greek system 4.1 used a variant Greek set that had
#   ISO 8859-7 in 0xA0-0xFF (with some holes filled in with DTP
#   characters), and Mac OS Roman accented Roman letters in 0x80-0x9F.

# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version b02 to version b03/c01:
#
#   - The Mac OS Greek encoding changed for Mac OS 9.2.2 and later
#     as follows:
#     0x9C, changed from 0x00AD SOFT HYPHEN to 0x20AC EURO SIGN
#     0xFF, changed from undefined to 0x00AD SOFT HYPHEN
#
#   Changes from version n04 to version n06:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xAF from U+0387 to its canonical
#     decomposition, U+00B7.
