#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Inuit code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Inuit code order.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Inuit character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Inuit (partly from Michael Everson):
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   This character set was developed by Michael Everson of Everson
#   Typography (everson@evertype.com) and was used for the Inuktitut
#   localizations of Mac OS, as well as for the Inuktitut utilities
#	package from Everson Typography. Note that while Apple authorized
#   the Inuktitut localization mentioned above, it was not shipped with
#   Apple hardware, and was not otherwise supported by Apple. Fonts
#   conforming to the Mac OS Inuit character set are available from
#   Everson Typography (http://www.evertype.com/software/apple/).
#   Information about the use of this character set is available at 
#   http://www.evertype.com/standards/iu/.
#
#   The Mac OS Inuit character set shares the script code smEthiopic
#   (28) with the Ethiopic encoding. To determine if the Inuktitut
#   encoding is being used, you must also check if the system region
#   code is 78, verNunavut.
#
#   The Mac OS Inuit character set includes the full syllabic letter
#   repertoire required for Inuktitut; it is a subset of the Unified
#   Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics set encoded in Unicode. The encoding
#   is InuitSCII, designed by Doug Hitch for the Government of the 
#   Northwest Territories.
#
#   The Mac OS Inuit character set also includes a number of characters
#   that were needed for the classic Mac OS user interface and
#   localization (e.g. ellipsis, bullet, copyright sign). All of the
#   characters in Mac OS Inuit that are also in the Mac OS Roman
#   encoding are at the same code point in both; this improves
#   application compatibility.
