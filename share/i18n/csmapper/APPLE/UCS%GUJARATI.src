#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Gujarati code or code sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNN or 0xNN+0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode or Unicode sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNNNN or 0xNNNN+0xNNNN).
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name or sequence
#       of names. In some cases an additional comment follows the
#       Unicode name(s).
#
#   The entries are in two sections. The first section is for pairs of
#   Mac OS Gujarati code points that must be mapped in a special way.
#   The second section maps individual code points.
#
#   Within each section, the entries are in Mac OS Gujarati code order.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Gujarati character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Gujarati:
# -------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   Mac OS Gujarati is based on IS 13194:1991 (ISCII-91), with the
#   addition of several punctuation and symbol characters. However,
#   Mac OS Gujarati does not support the ATR (attribute) mechanism of
#   ISCII-91.
#
# 1. ISCII-91 features in Mac OS Gujarati include:
#
#  a) Overloading of nukta
#
#     In addition to using the nukta (0xE9) like a combining dot below,
#     nukta is overloaded to function as a general character modifier.
#     In this role, certain code points followed by 0xE9 are treated as
#     a two-byte code point representing a character which may be
#     rather different than the characters represented by either of
#     the code points alone. For example, the character GUJARATI OM
#     (U+0AD0) is represented in ISCII-91 as candrabindu + nukta.
#
#  b) Explicit halant and soft halant
#
#     A double halant (0xE8 + 0xE8) constitutes an "explicit halant",
#     which will always appear as a halant instead of causing formation
#     of a ligature or half-form consonant.
#
#     Halant followed by nukta (0xE8 + 0xE9) constitutes a "soft
#     halant", which prevents formation of a ligature and instead
#     retains the half-form of the first consonant.
#
#  c) Invisible consonant
#
#     The byte 0xD9 (called INV in ISCII-91) is an invisible consonant:
#     It behaves like a consonant but has no visible appearance. It is
#     intended to be used (often in combination with halant) to display
#     dependent forms in isolation, such as the RA forms or consonant
#     half-forms.
#
#  d) Extensions for Vedic, etc.
#
#     The byte 0xF0 (called EXT in ISCII-91) followed by any byte in
#     the range 0xA1-0xEE constitutes a two-byte code point which can
#     be used to represent additional characters for Vedic (or other
#     extensions); 0xF0 followed by any other byte value constitutes
#     malformed text. Mac OS Gujarati supports this mechanism, but
#     does not currently map any of these two-byte code points to
#     anything.
#
# 2. Mac OS Gujarati additions
#
#   Mac OS Gujarati adds characters using the code points
#   0x80-0x8A and 0x90.
#
# 3. Unused code points
#
#   The following code points are currently unused, and are not shown
#   here: 0x8B-0x8F, 0x91-0xA0, 0xAB, 0xAF, 0xC7, 0xCE, 0xD0, 0xD3,
#   0xE0, 0xE4, 0xEB-0xEF, 0xFB-0xFF. In addition, 0xF0 is not shown
#   here, but it has a special function as described above.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
# 1. Mapping the byte pairs
#
#   If one of the following byte values is encountered when mapping
#   Mac OS Gujarati text - xA1, xAA, xDF, or 0xE8 - then the next
#   byte (if there is one) should be examined. If the next byte is
#   0xE9 - or also 0xE8, if the first byte was 0xE8 - then the byte
#   pair should be mapped using the first section of the mapping
#   table below. Otherwise, each byte should be mapped using the
#   second section of the mapping table below.
#
#   - The Unicode Standard, Version 2.0, specifies how explicit
#     halant and soft halant should be represented in Unicode;
#     these mappings are used below.
#
#   If the byte value 0xF0 is encountered when mapping Mac OS
#   Gujarati text, then the next byte should be examined. If there
#   is no next byte (e.g. 0xF0 at end of buffer), the mapping
#   process should indicate incomplete character. If there is a next
#   byte but it is not in the range 0xA1-0xEE, the mapping process
#   should indicate malformed text. Otherwise, the mapping process
#   should treat the byte pair as a valid two-byte code point with no
#   mapping (e.g. map it to QUESTION MARK, REPLACEMENT CHARACTER,
#   etc.).
#
# 2. Mapping the invisible consonant
#
#   It has been suggested that INV in ISCII-91 should map to ZERO
#   WIDTH NON-JOINER in Unicode. However, this causes problems with
#   roundtrip fidelity: The ISCII-91 sequences 0xE8+0xE8 and 0xE8+0xD9
#   would map to the same sequence of Unicode characters. We have
#   instead mapped INV to LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, which avoids these
#   problems.
