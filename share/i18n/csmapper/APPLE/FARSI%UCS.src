#
# Notes on Mac OS Farsi:
# ----------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   1. General
#
#   The Mac OS Farsi character set is based on the Mac OS Arabic
#   character set. The main difference is in the right-to-left digits
#   0xB0-0xB9: For Mac OS Arabic these correspond to right-left
#   versions of the Unicode ARABIC-INDIC DIGITs 0660-0669; for
#   Mac OS Farsi these correspond to right-left versions of the
#   Unicode EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGITs 06F0-06F9. The other
#   difference is in the nature of the font variants.
#
#   For more information, see the comments in the mapping table for
#   Mac OS Arabic.
#
#   Mac OS Farsi characters 0xEB-0xF2 are non-spacing/combining marks.
#
#   2. Directional characters and roundtrip fidelity
#
#   The Mac OS Arabic character set (on which Mac OS Farsi is based)
#   was developed in 1986-1987. At that time the bidirectional line
#   layout algorithm used in the Mac OS Arabic system was fairly simple;
#   it used only a few direction classes (instead of the 19 now used in
#   the Unicode bidirectional algorithm). In order to permit users to
#   handle some tricky layout problems, certain punctuation and symbol
#   characters were encoded twice, one with a left-right direction
#   attribute and the other with a right-left direction attribute. This
#   is the case in Mac OS Farsi too.
#
#   For example, plus sign is encoded at 0x2B with a left-right
#   attribute, and at 0xAB with a right-left attribute. However, there
#   is only one PLUS SIGN character in Unicode. This leads to some
#   interesting problems when mapping between Mac OS Farsi and Unicode;
#   see below.
#
#   A related problem is that even when a particular character is
#   encoded only once in Mac OS Farsi, it may have a different
#   direction attribute than the corresponding Unicode character.
#
#   For example, the Mac OS Farsi character at 0x93 is HORIZONTAL
#   ELLIPSIS with strong right-left direction. However, the Unicode
#   character HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS has direction class neutral.
#
#   3. Behavior of ASCII-range numbers in WorldScript
#
#   Mac OS Farsi also has two sets of digit codes.

#   The digits at 0x30-0x39 may be displayed using either European
#   digit forms or Persian digit forms, depending on context. If there
#   is a "strong European" character such as a Latin letter on either
#   side of a sequence consisting of digits 0x30-0x39 and possibly comma
#   0x2C or period 0x2E, then the characters will be displayed using
#   European forms (This will happen even if there are neutral characters
#   between the digits and the strong European character). Otherwise, the
#   digits will be displayed using Persian forms, the comma will be
#   displayed as Arabic thousands separator, and the period as Arabic
#   decimal separator. In any case, 0x2C, 0x2E, and 0x30-0x39 are always
#   left-right.
#
#   The digits at 0xB0-0xB9 are always displayed using Persian digit
#   shapes, and moreover, these digits always have strong right-left
#   directionality. These are mainly intended for special layout
#   purposes such as part numbers, etc.
#
#   4. Font variants
#
#   The table in this file gives the Unicode mappings for the standard
#   Mac OS Farsi encoding. This encoding is supported by the Tehran font
#   (the system font for Farsi), and is the encoding supported by the
#   text processing utilities. However, the other Farsi fonts actually
#   implement a somewhat different encoding; this affects nine code
#   points including 0xAA and 0xC0 (which are also affected by font
#   variants in Mac OS Arabic). For these nine code points the standard
#   Mac OS Farsi encoding has the following mappings:
#       0x8B -> 0x06BA ARABIC LETTER NOON GHUNNA (Urdu)
#       0xA4 -> <RL>+0x0024 DOLLAR SIGN, right-left
#       0xAA -> <RL>+0x002A ASTERISK, right-left
#       0xC0 -> <RL>+0x274A EIGHT TEARDROP-SPOKED PROPELLER ASTERISK,
#               right-left
#       0xF4 -> 0x0679 ARABIC LETTER TTEH (Urdu)
#       0xF7 -> 0x06A4 ARABIC LETTER VEH (for transliteration)
#       0xF9 -> 0x0688 ARABIC LETTER DDAL (Urdu)
#       0xFA -> 0x0691 ARABIC LETTER RREH (Urdu)
#       0xFF -> 0x06D2 ARABIC LETTER YEH BARREE (Urdu)
#
#   The TrueType variant is used for the Farsi TrueType fonts: Ashfahan,
#   Amir, Kamran, Mashad, NadeemFarsi. It differs from the standard
#   variant in the following ways:
#       0x8B -> 0xF882 Arabic ligature "peace on him" (corporate char.)
#       0xA4 -> 0xFDFC RIAL SIGN (added in Unicode 3.2)
#       0xAA -> <RL>+0x00D7 MULTIPLICATION SIGN, right-left
#       0xC0 -> <RL>+0x002A ASTERISK, right-left
#       0xF4 -> <RL>+0x00B0 DEGREE SIGN, right-left
#       0xF7 -> 0xFDFA ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE WASALLAM
#       0xF9 -> <RL>+0x25CF BLACK CIRCLE, right-left
#       0xFA -> <RL>+0x25A0 BLACK SQUARE, right-left
#       0xFF -> <RL>+0x25B2 BLACK UP-POINTING TRIANGLE, right-left
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   1. Matching the direction of Mac OS Farsi characters
#
#   When Mac OS Farsi encodes a character twice but with different
#   direction attributes for the two code points - as in the case of
#   plus sign mentioned above - we need a way to map both Mac OS Farsi
#   code points to Unicode and back again without loss of information.
#   With the plus sign, for example, mapping one of the Mac OS Farsi
#   characters to a code in the Unicode corporate use zone is
#   undesirable, since both of the plus sign characters are likely to
#   be used in text that is interchanged.
#
#   The problem is solved with the use of direction override characters
#   and direction-dependent mappings. When mapping from Mac OS Farsi
#   to Unicode, we use direction overrides as necessary to force the
#   direction of the resulting Unicode characters.
#
#   The required direction is indicated by a direction tag in the
#   mappings. A tag of <LR> means the corresponding Unicode character
#   must have a strong left-right context, and a tag of <RL> indicates
#   a right-left context.
#
#   For example, the mapping of 0x2B is given as <LR>+0x002B; the
#   mapping of 0xAB is given as <RL>+0x002B. If we map an isolated
#   instance of 0x2B to Unicode, it should be mapped as follows (LRO
#   indicates LEFT-RIGHT OVERRIDE, PDF indicates POP DIRECTION
#   FORMATTING):
#
#     0x2B ->  0x202D (LRO) + 0x002B (PLUS SIGN) + 0x202C (PDF)
#
#   When mapping several characters in a row that require direction
#   forcing, the overrides need only be used at the beginning and end.
#   For example:
#
#     0x24 0x20 0x28 0x29 -> 0x202D 0x0024 0x0020 0x0028 0x0029 0x202C
#
#   If neutral characters that require direction forcing are already
#   between strong-direction characters with matching directionality,
#   then direction overrides need not be used. Direction overrides are
#   always needed to map the right-left digits at 0xB0-0xB9.
#
#   When mapping from Unicode to Mac OS Farsi, the Unicode
#   bidirectional algorithm should be used to determine resolved
#   direction of the Unicode characters. The mapping from Unicode to
#   Mac OS Farsi can then be disambiguated by the use of the resolved
#   direction:
#
#     Unicode 0x002B -> Mac OS Farsi 0x2B (if L) or 0xAB (if R)
#
#   However, this also means the direction override characters should
#   be discarded when mapping from Unicode to Mac OS Farsi (after
#   they have been used to determine resolved direction), since the
#   direction override information is carried by the code point itself.
#
#   Even when direction overrides are not needed for roundtrip
#   fidelity, they are sometimes used when mapping Mac OS Farsi
#   characters to Unicode in order to achieve similar text layout with
#   the resulting Unicode text. For example, the single Mac OS Farsi
#   ellipsis character has direction class right-left,and there is no
#   left-right version. However, the Unicode HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
#   character has direction class neutral (which means it may end up
#   with a resolved direction of left-right if surrounded by left-right
#   characters). When mapping the Mac OS Farsi ellipsis to Unicode, it
#   is surrounded with a direction override to help preserve proper
#   text layout. The resolved direction is not needed or used when
#   mapping the Unicode HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS back to Mac OS Farsi.
#
#   2. Mapping the Mac OS Farsi digits
#
#   The main table below contains mappings that should be used when
#   strict round-trip fidelity is required. However, for numeric
#   values, the mappings in that table will produce Unicode characters
#   that may appear different than the Mac OS Farsi text displayed on
#   a Mac OS system using WorldScript. This is because WorldScript
#   uses context-dependent display for the 0x30-0x39 digits.
#
#   If roundtrip fidelity is not required, then the following
#   alternate mappings should be used when a sequence of 0x30-0x39
#   digits - possibly including 0x2C and 0x2E - occurs in an Arabic
#   context (that is, when the first "strong" character on either side
#   of the digit sequence is Arabic, or there is no strong character):
#
#     0x2C	0x066C	# ARABIC THOUSANDS SEPARATOR
#     0x2E	0x066B	# ARABIC DECIMAL SEPARATOR
#     0x30	0x06F0	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO
#     0x31	0x06F1	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ONE
#     0x32	0x06F2	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT TWO
#     0x33	0x06F3	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT THREE
#     0x34	0x06F4	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT FOUR
#     0x35	0x06F5	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT FIVE
#     0x36	0x06F6	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT SIX
#     0x37	0x06F7	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT SEVEN
#     0x38	0x06F8	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT EIGHT
#     0x39	0x06F9	# EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT NINE
#
#   3. Use of corporate-zone Unicodes (mapping the TrueType variant)
#
#   The following corporate zone Unicode character is used in this
#   mapping:
#
#     0xF882  Arabic ligature "peace on him"
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version b02 to version b03/c01:
#
#   - Update mapping of 0xA4 in TrueType variant to use new Unicode
#     character U+FDFC RIAL SIGN addded for Unicode 3.2
#
#   Changes from version n01 to version n04:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xA4 in TrueType variant (just described in
#     header comment) from single corporate character to use
#     grouping hint
