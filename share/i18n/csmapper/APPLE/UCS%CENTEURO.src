#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Central European code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Central European code order.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Central European character set uses the standard control
#   characters at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Central European:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported directly in programming
#   interfaces for QuickDraw Text, the Script Manager, and related
#   Text Utilities. For other purposes it is supported via transcoding
#   to and from Unicode.
#
#   This character set is intended to cover the following languages:
#
#   Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian
#
#   These are written in Latin script, but using a different set of
#   of accented characters than Mac OS Roman. The Mac OS Central
#   European character set also includes a number of characters
#   needed for the Mac OS user interface and localization (e.g.
#   ellipsis, bullet, copyright sign), several typographic
#   punctuation symbols, math symbols, etc. However, it has a
#   smaller set of punctuation and symbols than Mac OS Roman. All of
#   the characters in Mac OS Central European that are also in the
#   Mac OS Roman character set are at the same code point in both
#   character sets; this improves application compatibility.
#
#   Note: This does not have the same letter repertoire as ISO
#   8859-2 (Latin-2); each has some accented letters that the other
#   does not have.
