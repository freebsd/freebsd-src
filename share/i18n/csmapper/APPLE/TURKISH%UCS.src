#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.

#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Turkish code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Turkish code order.
#
#   Two of these mappings requires the use of a corporate character.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Turkish character set uses the standard control characters at
#   0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Turkish:
# ------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#	Mac OS Turkish is used for Turkish.
#
#   The Mac OS Turkish encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if the Turkish
#   encoding is being used, you must also check if the system region
#   code is 24, verTurkey.
#
#   This character set is a variant of standard Mac OS Roman. It adds
#   upper & lower G with breve, upper & lower S with cedilla, upper I
#   with dot, and moves the dotless lower i from its position at 0xF5
#   in standard Mac OS Roman to a position at 0xDD here (leaving the
#   0xF5 code point undefined in Mac OS Turkish). This gives a total
#   of 7 code point differences from standard Mac OS Roman.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The following corporate zone Unicode characters are used in this
#   mapping:
#
#     0xF8A0  undefined1, used to map the single undefined code point
#             in Mac OS Turkish (to obtain roundtrip fidelity for all
#             code points).
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n02 to version n03:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xBD from U+2126 to its canonical
#     decomposition, U+03A9.
