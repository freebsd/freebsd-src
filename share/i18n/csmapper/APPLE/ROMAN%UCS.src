#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.
#   The latest tables should be available from the following:

#   <http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/>
#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping
#   tables, see the file "README.TXT".
#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Roman code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Roman code order.
#
#   One of these mappings requires the use of a corporate character.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Roman character set uses the standard control characters at
#   0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Roman:
# ----------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported directly in programming
#   interfaces for QuickDraw Text, the Script Manager, and related
#   Text Utilities. For other purposes it is supported via transcoding
#   to and from Unicode.
#
#   This character set is used for at least the following Mac OS
#   localizations: U.S., British, Canadian French, French, Swiss
#   French, German, Swiss German, Italian, Swiss Italian, Dutch,
#   Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan,
#   Portuguese, Brazilian, and the default International system.
#
#   Variants of Mac OS Roman are used for Croatian, Icelandic,
#   Turkish, Romanian, and other encodings. Separate mapping tables
#   are available for these encodings.
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, code point 0xDB was CURRENCY SIGN, and was
#   mapped to U+00A4. In Mac OS 8.5 and later versions, code point
#   0xDB is changed to EURO SIGN and maps to U+20AC; the standard
#   Apple fonts are updated for Mac OS 8.5 to reflect this. There is
#   a "currency sign" variant of the Mac OS Roman encoding that still
#   maps 0xDB to U+00A4; this can be used for older fonts.
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, the ROM bitmap versions of the fonts Chicago,
#   New York, Geneva, and Monaco did not implement the full Mac OS
#   Roman character set; they only supported character codes up to
#   0xD8. The TrueType versions of these fonts have always implemented
#   the full character set, as with the bitmap and TrueType versions
#   of the other standard Roman fonts.
#
#   In all Mac OS encodings, fonts such as Chicago which are used
#   as "system" fonts (for menus, dialogs, etc.) have four glyphs
#   at code points 0x11-0x14 for transient use by the Menu Manager.
#   These glyphs are not intended as characters for use in normal
#   text, and the associated code points are not generally
#   interpreted as associated with these glyphs; they are usually
#   interpreted (if at all) as the control codes DC1-DC4.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The following corporate zone Unicode character is used in this
#   mapping:
#
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n08 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 8.5; change mapping of 0xDB from
#   CURRENCY SIGN (U+00A4) to EURO SIGN (U+20AC).
#
#   Changes from version n03 to version n04:
#
#   - Change mapping of 0xBD from U+2126 to its canonical
#     decomposition, U+03A9.
