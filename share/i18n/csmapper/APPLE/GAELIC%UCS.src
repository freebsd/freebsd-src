# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Gaelic code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (in hex as 0xNNNN)
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Gaelic code order.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Gaelic character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Gaelic (partly from Michael Everson):
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported via transcoding to and from
#   Unicode.
#
#   This character set was developed by Michael Everson of Everson
#   Typography (everson@evertype.com) and was used for fonts in his
#   Celtic Utilities and CeltScript font packages for the Mac, as well
#   as some fonts included with the Irish localizations of Mac OS 6.0.8
#   and 7.1. Note that while Apple authorized this Irish localization,
#   it was not a system which shipped with Apple hardware, and was not
#   otherwise supported by Apple. Fonts conforming to the Mac OS Gaelic
#   character set are available from Everson Typography
#   (http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/). Information about the use of
#   this character set is available at
#   http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/celtcode.html.
#
#   The Mac OS Gaelic encoding shares the script code smRoman (0) with
#   the standard Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if the Gaelic
#   encoding is being used in Mac OS 7-9, you should also check if the
#   system region code is 81. Otherwise, you can check for particular
#   fonts that conform to this encoding (since in practice Gaelic fonts
#   are used with the ordinary US or UK system versions).
#
#   This character set is a variant of standard Mac OS Roman, adding
#   capital and small y with acute, grave, and circumflex; capital and
#   small w with acute, grave, circumflex and diaeresis; capital and
#   small b, c, d, f, g, m, p, s, t with dot above; tironian et; small
#   long r, small long s, and small long s with dot above. It has 36
#   code point differences from standard Mac OS Roman.
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, code point 0xDB was CURRENCY SIGN, and was
#   mapped to U+00A4. In Mac OS 8.5 and later versions, code point
#   0xDB is changed to EURO SIGN and maps to U+20AC; the standard
#   Apple fonts are updated for Mac OS 8.5 to reflect this. There is
#   a "currency sign" variant of the Latin 8 Extended encoding that still
#   maps 0xDB to U+00A4; this can be used for older fonts.
#   Note: U+20AC is new with Unicode 2.1; for earlier Unicode
#   versions, Latin 8 Extended 0xDB may be mapped to private-use
#   character U+F8A0.
#
#   Before Unicode 3.0, code point 0xE4 was PER MILLE SIGN, and was
#   mapped to U+2030. Since August 1998, code point 0xE4 is changed
#   to TIRONIAN SIGN ET and maps to U+204A. There is a "per mille
#   sign" variant of the Mac OS Gaelic encoding that still
#   maps 0xE4 to U+2030; this can be used for older fonts.
#   Note: U+204A is new with Unicode 3.0; for earlier Unicode
#   versions, Mac OS Gaelic was unified with AMPERSAND.
