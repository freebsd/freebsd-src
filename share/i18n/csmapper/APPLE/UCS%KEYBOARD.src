#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping
#   tables, see the file "README.TXT".
#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Keyboard code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode or Unicode sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNNNN or 0xNNNN+0xNNNN, etc.).
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name.
#       In some cases an additional comment follows the Unicode name.
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Keyboard code order.
#
#   Some of these mappings require the use of corporate characters.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   The Mac OS Keyboard character set uses the ranges normally set aside
#   for controls, so those ranges are present in this table.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Keyboard:
# -------------------------
#
#   This is the encoding for the legacy font named ".Keyboard". Before
#   Mac OS X, this font was used by the user-interface system to display
#   glyphs for special keys on the keyboard. In Mac OS X, that font is
#   not present and this mapping is not associated with a font; it is
#   only used as a way to map from a set of Menu Manager constants to
#   associated Unicode sequences. As such, new mappings added for Mac OS
#   X only may be one-way mappings: From the Keyboard glyph "encoding"
#   to Unicode, but not back.
#
#   The Mac OS Keyboard encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if the Keyboard
#   encoding is being used in Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9, you must check if
#   the font name is ".Keyboard".
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The goals in the mappings provided here are:
#   - For mappings used in Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, ensure roundtrip
#     mapping from every character in the Mac OS  Keyboard character set
#     to Unicode and back. This consideration does not apply to mappings
#     added for Mac OS X only (noted below).
#   - Use standard Unicode characters as much as possible, to
#     maximize interchangeability of the resulting Unicode text.
#     Whenever possible, avoid having content carried by private-use
#     characters.
#
#   Some of the characters in the Mac OS Keyboard character set do not
#   correspond to distinct, single Unicode characters. To map these
#   and satisfy both goals above, we employ various strategies.
#
#   a) If possible, use private use characters in combination with
#   standard Unicode characters to mark variants of the standard
#   Unicode character.
#
#   Apple has defined a block of 32 corporate characters as "transcoding
#   hints." These are used in combination with standard Unicode
#   characters to force them to be treated in a special way for mapping
#   to other encodings; they have no other effect. Sixteen of these
#   transcoding hints are "grouping hints" - they indicate that the next
#   2-4 Unicode characters should be treated as a single entity for
#   transcoding. The other sixteen transcoding hints are "variant tags"
#   - they are like combining characters, and can follow a standard
#   Unicode (or a sequence consisting of a base character and other
#   combining characters) to cause it to be treated in a special way for
#   transcoding. These always terminate a combining-character sequence.
#
#   The transcoding coding hints used in this mapping table are two
#   grouping tags, 0xF860-61, and one variant tag, 0xF87F. Since these
#   are combined with standard Unicode characters, some characters in
#   the Mac OS Keyboard character set map to a sequence of two to four
#   Unicodes instead of a single Unicode character.
#
#   For example, the Mac OS Keyboard character at 0x6F, representing the
#   F1 key, is mapped to Unicode using the grouping tag F860 (group next
#   two) followed by U+0046 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F) and U+0031 (DIGIT
#   ONE).
#
#   b) Otherwise, use private use characters by themselves to map Mac OS
#   Keyboard characters which have no relationship to any standard
#   Unicode character.
#
#   The following additional corporate zone Unicode characters are
#   used for this purpose here:
#
#     0xF802  Lower left pencil
#     0xF803  Contextual menu key symbol
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version c01 to version c02:
#
#   - Mapping for 0x09 changed from 0x0009 (wrong) to 0x2423
#   - Mapping for 0x0F changed from 0x270E (wrong) to 0xF802
#   - Mapping for 0x8C changed from 0xF804 to 0x23CF (Unicode 4.0)
#   - Add Mac OS X-only mappings for 0x8D-0x8F
