#

#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Symbol code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode or Unicode sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNNNN or 0xNNNN+0xNNNN).
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name.
#       In some cases an additional comment follows the Unicode name.
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Symbol code order.
#
#   Some of these mappings require the use of corporate characters.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Symbol character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Symbol:
# -----------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported directly in programming
#   interfaces for QuickDraw Text, the Script Manager, and related
#   Text Utilities. For other purposes it is supported via transcoding
#   to and from Unicode.
#
#   The Mac OS Symbol encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if the Symbol
#   encoding is being used, you must check if the font name is
#   "Symbol".
#
#   Before Mac OS 8.5, code point 0xA0 was unused. In Mac OS 8.5
#   and later versions, code point 0xA0 is EURO SIGN and maps to
#   U+20AC (the Symbol font is updated for Mac OS 8.5 to reflect
#   this).
#
#   The layout of the Mac OS Symbol character set is identical to
#   the layout of the Adobe Symbol encoding vector, with the
#   addition of the Apple logo character at 0xF0.
#
#   This character set encodes a number of glyph fragments. Some are
#   used as extenders: 0x60 is used to extend radical signs, 0xBD and
#   0xBE are used to extend vertical and horizontal arrows, etc. In
#   addition, there are top, bottom, and center sections for
#   parentheses, brackets, integral signs, and other signs that may
#   extend vertically for 2 or more lines of normal text. As of
#   Unicode 3.2, most of these are now encoded in Unicode; a few are
#   not, so these are mapped using corporate-zone Unicode characters
#   (see below).
#
#   In addition, Symbol separately encodes both serif and sans-serif
#   forms for copyright, trademark, and registered signs. Unicode
#   encodes only the abstract characters, so one set of these (the
#   sans-serif forms) are also mapped using corporate-zone Unicode
#   characters (see below).
#
#   The following code points are unused, and are not shown here:
#   0x80-0x9F, 0xFF.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
#   The goals in the mappings provided here are:
#   - Ensure roundtrip mapping from every character in the Mac OS
#     Symbol character set to Unicode and back
#   - Use standard Unicode characters as much as possible, to
#     maximize interchangeability of the resulting Unicode text.
#     Whenever possible, avoid having content carried by private-use
#     characters.
#
#   Some of the characters in the Mac OS Symbol character set do not
#   correspond to distinct, single Unicode characters. To map these
#   and satisfy both goals above, we employ various strategies.
#
#   a) If possible, use private use characters in combination with
#   standard Unicode characters to mark variants of the standard
#   Unicode character.
#
#   Apple has defined a block of 32 corporate characters as "transcoding
#   hints." These are used in combination with standard Unicode
#   characters to force them to be treated in a special way for mapping
#   to other encodings; they have no other effect. Sixteen of these
#   transcoding hints are "grouping hints" - they indicate that the next
#   2-4 Unicode characters should be treated as a single entity for
#   transcoding. The other sixteen transcoding hints are "variant tags"
#   - they are like combining characters, and can follow a standard
#   Unicode (or a sequence consisting of a base character and other
#   combining characters) to cause it to be treated in a special way for
#   transcoding. These always terminate a combining-character sequence.
#
#   The transcoding coding hint used in this mapping table is the
#   variant tag 0xF87F. Since this is combined with standard Unicode
#   characters, some characters in the Mac OS Symbol character set map
#   to a sequence of two Unicodes instead of a single Unicode character.
#
#   For example, the Mac OS Symbol character at 0xE2 is an alternate,
#   sans-serif form of the REGISTERED SIGN (the standard mapping is for
#   the abstract character at 0xD2, which here has a serif form). So 0xE2
#   is mapped to 0x00AE (REGISTERED SIGN) + 0xF87F (a variant tag).
#
#   b) Otherwise, use private use characters by themselves to map
#   Mac OS Symbol characters which have no relationship to any standard
#   Unicode character.
#
#   The following additional corporate zone Unicode characters are
#   used for this purpose here:
#
#     0xF8E5  radical extender
#     0xF8FF  Apple logo
#
#   NOTE: The graphic image associated with the Apple logo character
#   is not authorized for use without permission of Apple, and
#   unauthorized use might constitute trademark infringement.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version c01 to version c02:
#
#   - Update mappings for 0xBD from 0xF8E6 to 0x23D0 (use new Unicode
#     4.0 char)
#   - Correct mapping for 0xE0 from 0x22C4 to 0x25CA
#
#   Changes from version b02 to version b03/c01:
#
#   - Update mappings for encoded glyph fragments 0xBE, 0xE6-EF, 0xF4,
#     0xF6-FE to use new Unicode 3.2 characters instead of using either
#     single corporate-use characters (e.g. 0xBE was mapped to 0xF8E7) or
#     sequences combining a standard Unicode character with a transcoding
#     hint (e.g. 0xE6 was mapped to 0x0028+0xF870).
#
#   Changes from version n05 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 8.5; 0xA0 now maps to 0x20AC, EURO
#   SIGN. 0xA0 was unmapped in earlier versions.
#
#   Changes from version n03 to version n05:
#
#   - Change strict mapping for 0xE1 & 0xF1 from U+2329 & U+232A
#     to their canonical decompositions, U+3008 & U+3009.
#
#   - Change mapping for the following to use standard Unicode +
#     transcoding hint, instead of single corporate-zone
#     character: 0xE2-0xE4, 0xE6-0xEE, 0xF4, 0xF6-0xFE.
