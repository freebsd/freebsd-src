# The charset used on RISC OS ('Acorn RISC OS').  The same as Latin-1,
# except for extra printable characters from 0x80 until 0xA0.
#
# -- Ed Avis, <ed@membled.com>, 2001-03-08
#
# First everything from Latin-1 outside 0x80 -| 0xA0.
# Now the RISC OS specific characters.  This is from RISC OS 3.11.  In
# earlier versions of RISC OS, some of these were used for drawing
# window icons such as close and resize.  They're no longer used for
# that purpose, but remain in the character set.
#
# The Unicode value in each line, and the first comment, reflect the
# 8x8 'system font'.  The second comment shows how the character looks
# in Homerton, one of the outline fonts that comes with RISC OS.  The
# third comment shows the character for that position in fonts
# supplied by EFF, a third-party supplier of RISC OS outline fonts.
#
# A hollow square box with a hollow square box in its top left-hand
# corner.  (Imagine a square clock showing nine o'clock.)  It means
# 'resize window' and doesn't seem to have a Unicode equivalent.
#
# A 'bubble-writing' X, meaning 'close window'.  I have picked a
# Unicode character which will hopefully look similar, though the
# special meaning is not preserved.
#
# This character is very odd.  It looks like '8 to the power 7' - the
# 7 is to the right of and above the 8, so it's not 'seven eigths'.
# It might originally have been the 'maximize' button on windows.
#
# Four arrows for window scrollbars.  These appear as 'bubble' or
# hollow arrows.  Again, Unicode doesn't have characters with this
# meaning, but they should look about the same.
