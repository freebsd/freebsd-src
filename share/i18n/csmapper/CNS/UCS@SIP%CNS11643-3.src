#	Name: Unihan database
#	Unicode version: 5.0.0
#	Table version: 1.1
#	Date: 7 July 2006

#
#	Format information:
#
#	Each line of this file consists of three tab-separated fields.
#	The first is the Unicode scalar value as U+[x]xxxx (that is, there are
#		either four or five hex digits)
#	The second is a tag indicating the type of information in the third field
#	The third is the line's value (in UTF-8)
#
#	We give below a list of the tags in alphabetical order.  For each tag,
#	we give additional information, such as its formal status in the standard, 
#	a general category to which its data belongs, the separator (if any) 
#	between individual subvalues, a regular expression indicating the 
#	format of each subvalue, the version of Unicode in which the data were 
#	originally introduced, and a description of the data associated with the 
#	tag.
#
#	Regular expressions are based on standard Perl 5.8.6 syntax and may
#	require modification for use with other regular expression engines.  
#
#	Unless otherwise noted, the order of subvalues within a single
#	value field is not significant.
#
#	Note that only the description is present for every tag value.
