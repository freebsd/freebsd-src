This install procedure is BETA code, and         `--{__________)
may very possibly *DESTROY* the contents of your
ENTIRE DISK!  Please do not proceed with this installation
unless you've adequately backed up your data first!

If any errors occur during this installation, you can see them
by toggling over to the alternate screen.  Type ALT-F2 to switch
to the debugging screen and ALT-F1 to switch back to the install screen.
The debugging output on the second screen may be very valuable to us in
understanding your bug report, so please be sure to take note of it when
reporting any failures in the installation!  Thanks!

Menus and scrolling output windows may be traversed with the arrow,
PageUp/PageDown and TAB keys.  To suspend the installation at any point,
hit ESC twice.  If you've ever dealt with a DOS installation before, then
you'll probably know how to deal with this.

For a more complete description of what's new in this release, please
see the release notes.

For more documentation on this system, it is recommended that you purchase
the 4.4BSD Document Set from O'Reilly Associates and the USENIX Association.
ISBN 1-56592-082-1  We have no connection with O'Reilly, we're just
satisfied customers!

Have fun, and please let us know of any problems you encounter with
this release!
