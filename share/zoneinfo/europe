# United Kingdom

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (July 6, 1994):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# `An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longditude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51 deg. 28' 30" N, 0 deg. 18' 45" W. The longditude should
# be within about +-2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828);
# it was popularized in 1840 by Capt. Basil Hall, RN (1788-1844),
# famed explorer and former Commissioner for Longitude.
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847 Sep 22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists most major
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the Great Clock
# in Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880 Aug 2.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847 Sep 22.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880 Aug 2, the legal transition time.

# From Arthur David Olson (January 19, 1989):
#
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler <nih-csl!uunet!mcvax!sphinx.co.uk!john>
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (September 3, 1993):
#
# Our Government...couldn't...make a decision after the 1989 consultation
# exercise about the UK changing its timezone so it just let things drift
# (different from deciding to keep the status quo).  According to the
# Summer Time Order 1992 (SI 1992/1729) the dates of Summer Time for 1993
# and 1994 are:
#	Start		End
# 1993	28 March	24 October
# 1994	27 March	23 October
# All start and end times are at 01:00 GMT.
#
# There [was] an error in your tables for the start and end times prior to 1981.
# The UK always used to change at 02:00 GMT. In 1981 it changed to 01:00 GMT
# as a part of EC harmonisation and has remained at that time since.
#
# I have found the default algorithm for UK Summer Time, it is in the
# Summer Time Act 1972. Section 1 states that in the absence of an Order
# in Council Summer Time starts at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day
# after the third Saturday in March, unless that day is Easter Day, in
# which case it is the morning of the day after the second Saturday.
# It ends at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day after the fourth Saturday
# in October. (All the redundant `morning of the day ...' is in the Act.)
# This is only of passing interest now as it will always be overridden by
# an Order in Council (a Statutary Instrument, the SI thing mentioned above)
# to specify the EC specified dates.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (October 18, 1993):
#
# My contact in the Ministry of Defence Public Relations department
# accepted the challenge of looking into this and produced the following,
# from Hansard (the official record of the UK Parliament), Oral Answers,
# 1 March 1945, cols 1559--60:
#
# `58. Major Sir Goronwy Owen asked the Secretary of State for the Home
# Department if he is now able to state the Government's proposals
# regarding double summer time.
#
# [two other similar questions omitted]
#
# Mr. H. Morrison: The Government, in reviewing the matter, have
# considered, [...] the conclusion has been reached that the adoption of
# double summer time from the beginning of April is essential to the
# maintenance of the war effort. [...] As 1st April is Easter Sunday,
# when very early services are held in many churches, it is proposed that
# double summer time shall start not in the night preceding Easter
# Sunday, but in the night of Sunday- Monday so that it will operate from
# Monday, 2nd April.'

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (September 3, 1993):
#
# > # Current rules
# > Rule GB-Eire 1981	max	-	Mar	lastSun	1:00s	1:00	BST
# > Rule GB-Eire 1981	max	-	Oct	Sun>=23	1:00s	0	GMT
#
# The ending rule here doesn't match the EC rules, which specify the fourth
# Sunday in October for the UK and Eire. The `fourth Sunday' rule wasn't
# followed in 1989, but then the sixth EC directive wasn't in force then
# and I don't know what previous ones said. 1995 is the next year with
# the 4th Sun on 22 Oct, but that year isn't covered by the UK Summer Time
# Order or the sixth EC directive. Your Oct Sun>=23 rule matches history
# and with things only announced for 2 years or so in advance who knows
# what will happen.
#
# There are renewed rumours that the Government here will make another
# attempt at resolving this issue, which is what prompted me to start
# asking the Home Office and the EC about it again. The EC categorically
# state they are not asking anybody to change timezone, they only want
# common start/end dates. The UK Govt. seem to want to change our zone
# and blame the resulting fuss on the EC. Me, I think we should scrap
# summer time completely, noon is when the Sun is overhead, and that should
# be the end of it.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (October 22, 1993):
#
# I now have the text of the Summer Time Act 1916, the granddaddy of them all.
# It is headed: `An Act to provide for the Time in Great Britain and Ireland
# being in advance of Greenwich and Dublin mean time respectively in the
# summer months'.
#
# It specifies 21 May and 1 October for 1916 (both at 02:00 GMT) and whatever
# dates an Order in Council may specify for subsequent years.
#
# Section 4 states: `This act shall apply to Ireland in like manner as it
# applies to Great Britain, with the substitution however of references
# to Dublin mean time for references to Greenwich mean time.'
#
# Lorna, my learned legal friend who supplied it, also offers this quote
# from Halsbury's Statutes on the extent of Acts:
#
# `An Act of the United Kingdom Parliament is to be construed prima facie
# to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom and not to any place outside.
# [...] The expression "United Kingdom" for this purpose includes (since
# 1922) Great Britain (ie. England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
# but it does not include the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.'
#
# She goes on to say the seminal event of 1922 was the establishment of
# the Irish Free State, now called Eire.
#
# The Act doesn't say anything about Wales (or Scotland) so I would assert
# that Shanks is wrong here. I would like to know why he thinks Wales
# was different.
#
# It also confirms the fact that Ireland followed Dublin time back then,
# and 25 minutes behind Greenwich, as Shanks has it, would be correct.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (October 28, 1993):
#
# I now have before me, thanks to my learned legal friend Lorna, the text of
# the Time (Ireland) Act 1916.
#
# It says that as from 2 AM Dublin Mean Time on 1 October 1916 the time
# for general purposes in Ireland shall be the same as the rest of Great
# Britain (ie. GMT with the Summer Time periods specified by the Summer Time
# Act 1916)....  As Ireland was behind GMT/BST at 02:00 DMT on 1 Oct GB would
# have already put the clocks back. Using DST as Dublin Summer Time the
# sequence would have been:
# Dublin		London
# 02:34 DST	02:59 BST
# 02:35 DST	02:00 GMT
# 02:59 DST	02:24 GMT
# 02:25 GMT	02:25 GMT
# with the transition 03:00 DST -> 02:00 DMT -> 02:25 GMT all at once.
#
# In a table of repeals in the Schedule to the Act it mentions the
# Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1880. This is presumably the source
# of the 1880 date in Shanks.  The little bit of it that is repealed
# also refers solely to Ireland and Dublin Mean Time.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (October 29, 1993):
#
# My case is that, with the sole exception of Ireland in 1916 using Dublin
# Mean Time, Summer Time has been uniform throughout the United Kingdom
# ever since it first started in 1916.
#
# The United Kingdom is England, Wales and Scotland plus all of Ireland from
# 1916 up to and including 1921, or plus Northern Ireland from 1922 to date.
#
# The dates used are those specified in the table in Summer Time: A Consultation
# Document (Cm 722, 1989) that are now included in the europe file, with a
# change to a single date, the start in 1924. I made a typo in my 1989 mail
# and the table itself is also wrong.  The correct date is 13 April.
# The times were 02:00 GMT up to and including 1980, 01:00 GMT from 1981 on,
# except for wartime double summer time.
#
# As evidence I would cite:
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1916.
#
# This specifically states that it applies to Ireland, specifies dates of
# 21 May and 1 October and times of 02:00, and says that in Ireland the
# times relate to Dublin mean time. It specifies an offset of 1 hour.
#
# - The Time (Ireland) Act, 1916
#
# This abolishes Dublin mean time on 02:00 DMT 1 October 1916.
# It repeals that section of the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880
# that specifies DMT. It is therefore a safe bet that DMT existed at least
# from 1880 and was the only alternative standard time in the UK.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1922
#
# This specifies an offset of 1 hour and dates of the day after the third
# Saturday in April, unless that be Easter, in which case it is the day after
# the second Saturday, and the day after the third Saturday in September.
# The time is 02:00 GMT. It applied in 1922 and 1923, and longer if Parliament
# so approved.
#
# It specifically states that it applies to Northern Ireland, the Channel
# Islands, and the Isle of Man.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1925
#
# This makes the 1922 Act permanent, with a change to the end date to the
# day after the first Saturday in October. It says nothing about extent,
# so that part of the 1922 Act will still apply.
#
# - The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939, SR&O 1939 No. 1379
#   [SR&O == Statutary Regulation and Order]
#
# These were made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.
# It changes the end date to be the day after the third Saturday in November.
# It makes consequential changes to some vehicle lighting legislation,
# which includes the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Act,
# 1934, so it seems clear it applies in Northern Ireland.
#
# - An Order in Council amending the The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations,
#   1939, SR&O 1940 No. 1883
#
# This continues summer time throughout the year after it starts in 1940.
# It says nothing about extent and has no consequential changes.
#
# - An Order in Council amending the The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations,
#   1939, SR&O 1941 No. 476
#
# This introduces double summer time, starting at 01:00 GMT on the day after
# the first Saturday in May and ending at 01:00 GMT on the day after the
# second Saturday in August, offset another hour from normal summer time,
# which continues throughout the rest of the year. It goes on a lot about
# consequential changes to agricultural wages legislation, and says in part
# `... and in its application to Northern Ireland have effect as
# if for the references to the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Acts, 1924 and
# 1940, there were substituted references to the Agricultural Wages (Regulation)
# Acts (Northern Ireland), 1939 and 1940, ...'. It also has a similar section
# for Scotland. Both sections substitute the local Agricultural Wages Board
# for the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, showing that
# England and Wales were indivisible.
#
# - An Order in Council amending the The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations,
#   1939, SR&O 1942 No. 506
#
# This changes the start date of double summer time to the day after the first
# Saturday in April. It says nothing about extent.
#
# - An Order in Council amending the The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations,
#   1939, SR&O 1944 No. 932
#
# This changed the end date of double summer time to 17 September 1944.
# (I don't have the text of this, just a note of what it did, the text almost
# certainly had the `day after the nth Saturday' form.)
#
# (I am missing whatever regulations there were to change things in 1945
# and the Summer Time Act, 1947.)
#
# - The British Standard Time Act, 1968
#
# This came into force on 27 October 1968 and continued summer time throughout
# the year as an experiment until it expired on 31 October 1971.
# There was no double summer time so we didn't have to change the clocks at all.
# It specifically said it applied to Northern Ireland. It also said it
# applied to Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man unless they passed
# measures saying it didn't.
#
# - The Manx Time Act, 1968
#
# This is an Act of Tynwald (the Isle of Man Parliament) that said that
# henceforth Manx time would be the same as the time in Great Britain.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1972
#
# This specified a reversion to normal summer time behaviour with a start
# date of the day after the third Saturday in March, unless that is Easter,
# when it is the day after the second Saturday, and an end date of the day
# after the fourth Saturday in October. Times are at 02:00 GMT, offset is
# 1 hour.
#
# It has the same wording about extent as the British Standard Time Act, 1968,
# applying to Northern Ireland unconditionally and to Jersey, Guernsey and the
# Isle of Man if they don't do something about it.
#
# (I am missing various Summer Time Orders that modified the 1972 Act to
# harmonise with the EC since 1981. The major change is that the time changes
# to 01:00 GMT.)
#
# - The Summer Time Order, 1992, SI 1992/1729 [SI == Statutary Instrument]
#
# This specifies dates of:
#       Start       End
# 1993  28 March    24 October
# 1994  27 March    23 October
# All start and end times are at 01:00 GMT....
#
# - Some text on the extent of Acts, from Halsbury's Statutes
#
# `An Act of the United Kingdom Parliament is to be construed prima facie
# to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom and not to any place outside.
# [...] The expression "United Kingdom" for this purpose includes (since
# 1922) Great Britain (ie. England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
# but it does not include the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.'
#
# So, many of these measures specifically include Northern Ireland,
# the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. None of them exclude any
# part of the UK. The default interpretation of Acts is that they apply
# throughout the UK.
#
# With that, I rest my case Milud :-)
#
# Thanks are due to my learned legal friend Lorna Montgomerie, who dug out
# the dusty old statutes, and to Melanie Allison of the Ministry of Defence,
# who provided the wartime regulations and a snippet of Hansard explaining
# why double summer time started on a Monday in 1945 (it was Easter).

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (November 18, 1993)
#
# Here is a revised version of my tabrules file for the perl script I sent
# before. I have personally verified the various Orders back to 1953 and
# all the Acts.
#
# There are no changes to the dates we already have.
#
# My doubt about an early start in 1967 on 18 Feb was misplaced, the Order
# does say 18 Feb. This is an interesting case as the first Order gave a
# different date of 7 April 1967 for the Isle of Man but this was changed
# before it came into effect by another Order for the Isle of Man alone.
#
# I don't think I will be able to find any more of the earlier Orders.
# The annual volumes for 1949--52 do not contain the various Summer Time
# Orders. They therefore don't appear in the index. They rate a mention in
# italics in the numerical list at the start but that is all.
# I think what happens is that the annual volume is produced well after the
# end of the year in question, by which time the Summer Time Order is spent.
# They assume that nobody would ever be stupid enough to want to see it
# again so they leave it out.
#
# It might be a good idea to put this table, or the output of tabscript
# showing all the moves because of Easter, in the europe file comments in
# place of my old transcription of the Green Paper table [the UK Government
# paper "Summer Time: A Consultation Document" (HMSO Cm722 June 1989)].

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (August 18, 1994):
# I now have the text of the 7th EC directive on summer time arrangements
# (94/21/EC), which was approved on 30 May....
# The major changes from existing practice are that 1995 will be the last year
# that the UK and Eire finish on a different date from everyone else,
# and the common end date from 1996 onwards will be the last Sunday in October.
# Year	 Start		End		End (UK & Eire, 1995 only)
# (rule) (last Sun)	(last Sun)	(4th Sun)
# 1995	26 March	24 September	22 October
# 1996	31 March	27 October
# 1997	30 March	26 October
#
# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (1994-12-01):
# The final piece of the legislative jigsaw for summer time in the UK for
# 1995-97 is now in place.  The Summer Time Order 1994 (SI 1994/2798)
# came into force on 16 November.  It restates the dates from the EC
# seventh Summer Time Directive....

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (March 28, 1994):
# The [GB-Eire] end date of 22 October [1995] conflicts with your current rule
# of Oct Sun>=23, and the historical UK formula of Sun after 4th Sat.
# The last time 4th Sun and Sun after 4th Sat differed was in 1989,
# when 29 October was used.  That year was covered by a UK Summer Time Order
# for only a single year and it looks as though there was a matching 4th EC
# directive for just this year.  I don't have the text of the 5th EC
# directive (for 1990--92) but my guess would be it said 4th Sun.
# To maintain strict historical accuracy you could start a new UK ending rule
# of Oct Sun>=22 in 1990.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
#
# As Ilieve remarks, the date `20 April 1924' in the table of ``Summer Time: A
# Consultation Document'' (Cm 722, 1989) table is a transcription error;
# 20 April was an Easter Sunday.  Shanks has 13 April, the correct date.
# Also, the table is not quite right for 1925 through 1938; the correct rules
# (which Shanks uses) are given in the Summer Time Acts of 1922 and 1925.
# Shanks and the UK Government paper disagree about the Apr 1956 transition;
# since we have no other data, and since Shanks was correct in the other
# points of disagreement about London, we'll believe Shanks for now.
# Also, for lack of other data, we'll follow Shanks for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Peter Ilieve's comments, the following claims by Shanks are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight savings time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight savings time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#
# The following claim by Shanks is possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore it for now.
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight savings time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
#
# Whitman says Dublin Mean Time was -0:25:21, which is more precise than Shanks.

# Iceland
#
# From Adam David <adam@veda.is> (November 6, 1993):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (December 5, 1993):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (December 10, 1993):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???). The Gregorian calendar was not introduced
# in Iceland until 1700.
#
# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (December 9, 1993):
# The Iceland Almanak, Shanks and Whitman disagree on many points.
# We go with the Almanak, except for one claim from Shanks, namely that
# Reykavik was -1:28 from 1837 to 1908, local mean time before that.

# In 1929 the Soviet Union instituted a 5 day week; in 1932 it instituted

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from

# The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
#
# According to Bernard Sieloff's source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
# uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
# Bernard Sieloff's source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
# 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
# switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
# and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European coun[tr]ies started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.

# ...
# Turning to Europe, I now have a copy of the `Sixth Council Directive 92/20/EEC
# of 26 March 1992 on summertime arrangements'. This only covers 1993 and
# 1994, a seventh one is in the works but I doubt that the algorithm will
# change. This says summertime starts at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in March
# and ends at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in September, except for the UK
# and Eire where it ends at 01:00 GMT on the fourth Sunday in October.
# It says the arrangements for 1995 onwards will be decided by 1 January 1994,
# but as the sixth directive was supposed to appear by 1 Jan 92 and didn't
# arrive til March I wouldn't hold your breath.
#
# The first summertime directive was adopted in 1980, although the UK didn't
# seem to use it until 1981. I suspect it would be safe to move your start
# dates for the -Eur rules back to 1981.
