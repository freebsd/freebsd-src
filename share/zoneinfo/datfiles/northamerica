# United States

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, October 26, 1974
# and Sunday, October 27, 1974 editions of the Washington Post.

# From seismo!munnari!kre:
# I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly
# sure enough of this to add anything.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# The above has been confirmed by Bob Devine; we'll go with it here.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# ...Alaska (and Hawaii) had the timezone names changed in 1967.
#    old			 new
#    Pacific Standard Time(PST)  -same-
#    Yukon Standard Time(YST)    -same-
#    Central Alaska S.T. (CAT)   Alaska-Hawaii St[an]dard Time (AHST)
#    Nome Standard Time (NT)     Bering Standard Time (BST)
#
# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part
#    of the Aleutian islands.   No DST.

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# The above dates are for 1988.
# Note the "AKST" and "AKDT" abbreviations, the claim that there's
# no DST in Samoa, and the claim that there is DST in Alaska and the
# Aleutians.

# From Arthur David Olson (February 13, 1988):
# Legal standard time zone names, from United States Code (1982 Edition and
# Supplement III), Title 15, Chapter 6, Section 260 and forward.  First, names
# up to April 1, 1967 (when most provisions of the Uniform Time Act of 1966
# took effect), as explained in sections 263 and 261:
#	(none)
#	United States standard eastern time
#	United States standard mountain time
#	United States standard central time
#	United States standard Pacific time
#	(none)
#	United States standard Alaska time
#	(none)
# Next, names from April 1, 1967 until November 30, 1983 (the date for
# public law 98-181):
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Yukon standard time
#	Alaska-Hawaii standard time
#	Bering standard time
# And after November 30, 1983:
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Alaska standard time
#	Hawaii-Aleutian standard time
#	Samoa standard time
# The law doesn't give abbreviations.

# Easy stuff first--including Alaska, where we ignore history (since we
# can't tell if we should give Yukon time or Alaska-Hawaii time for "old"
# times).

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (3rd edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Except where otherwise noted, it is the source for the data below.
#
# I invented the abbreviation SPST for St Pierre Standard Time; SPDT likewise.
# Corrections are welcome!
#
# See the `africa' file for Zone naming conventions.



# Canada

# Canada is reportedly lots easier than the US--leastways since 1951.
# I don't know what they did before then.
# 4.3BSD claims that it's perfectly regular.
# According to a posting in "comp.bugs.misc", "comp.unix.wizards", etc.
# on February 8, 1987, by Dave Sherman of the Law Society of Upper Canada,
# "...Canada (well, Ontario and at least some of the other provinces) are
# adopting the new daylight savings time rules...".  We assume all of
# Canada is doing so.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# All of Canada did have DST from your first rule except Saskatchewan.
# Which parts did not observe DST is hard to pinpoint but most of the
# province follows the rules.
# NOTE: those that didn't have DST for that rule, also
# probably did not have it for several years previous.

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# April 3 fell on a Sunday in 1988; October 29 fell on a Sunday in 1989.  Ahem.
# Note claim that there's double DST in Newfoundland and that Yukon should
# be same as Pacific.

# From W. Jones (jones@skdad.usask.ca) (November 6, 1992):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.
#
# Here's how I would summarize things.  Establish a "Saskatchewan" CST
# time zone, and note that it officially exists as of 15 April 1966.  Any
# current exceptions can put themselves in the "Mountain" zone, since
# those are the rules they follow.  Any past exceptions can be forgotten,
# since that's what those who live here have done.

# From Arthur David Olson (November 21, 1992):
# East-Saskatchewan kept to avoid problems for folks using that zone by name;
# plain Saskatchewan added.

# Mexico

# From Guy Harris:
# Rules are from the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, for 1987.
# Rules prior to 1987 are unknown.
# The comments in the OAG say "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and Tijuana
# observe DST."  This is presumably Baja California Norte, above 28th parallel,
# as listed there; Mexico/BajaSur is for "Baja California Sur and N. Pacific
# Coast (States of Sinaloa and Sonora)."

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# The Federal District (where Mexico City is) has observed [DST] several
# times but not recently.
#
# I don't where to drawn the line in the North Baja area.  28th latitude
# sounds good -- but it may be higher (how far [d]o radio stations from
# San Diego affect culture?).
#
# The dates of DST probably go back to 1981.  The rules are the same as
# US's.  This is going to be a headache for US presidential electi[o]n years!

# From Arthur David Olson (February 13, 1988)
# Since the 1981 starting date is only "probable," we'll keep the 1987
# starting date below.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 1989):
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N   7 H  BEHIND UTC    BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR AND
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N                      N. PACIFIC COAST (STATES
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N                      OF SINALOA AND SONORA)

# MEXICO                                 YUCATAN

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# April 3 fell on a Sunday in 1988; October 29 fell on a Sunday in 1989.  Ahem.
# USNO claims there should be four Mexican zones rather than three:
# a zone that's GMT-8 with DST; a zone that's always GMT-7;
# a zone that's GMT-6 with DST; and a zone that's always GMT-6.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
# Shanks also says there are four zones, but disagrees about the fourth.
# Instead of GMT-6 with DST, he says there's GMT-8 without DST.
