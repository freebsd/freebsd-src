# This data is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov for general use in the future).

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1996-11-22):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (3rd edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Except where otherwise noted, it is the source for the data below.
#
# Gwillim Law <LAW@encmail.encompass.com> writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks is the source for entries through 1990,
# and IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and the discovery of the longitude,
# Oxford University Press (1980).
#
# I invented the abbreviations marked `*' in the following table;
# the rest are from earlier versions of this file, or from other sources.
# Corrections are welcome!

# From Paul Eggert (1996-05-04):

# <edd@AIC.NET> reported today that Yerevan probably won't use DST this year,
# though it did use DST in 1995.  We guess Yerevan stayed in sync with Moscow
# between 1990 and 1995, but stopped using DST in 1996.

# People's Republic of China

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, 1986-02-17 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.
#
# . . .I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too
# painful to suck in another copy..  So, here is what I have for
# DST start/end dates for Peking's time zone (info from AP):
#
#     1986 May 4 - Sept 14
#     1987 mid-April - ??

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (1989-01-19):
# CHINA               8 H  AHEAD OF UTC  ALL OF CHINA, INCL TAIWAN
# CHINA               9 H  AHEAD OF UTC  APR 17 - SEP 10

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
# Shanks writes that China has had a single time zone since 1980 May 1,
# observing summer DST from 1986 through 1991; this contradicts Devine's
# note about Time magazine, though apparently _something_ happened in 1986.
# Go with Shanks for now.  I made up names for the other pre-1980 time zones.

# Georgia
# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1994-11-19):
# Today's _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
# an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
# an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.
#
# From Mathew Englander <mathew@io.org>, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.

# Iran

# Ahmad Alavi <URL:http://tehran.stanford.edu/Iran_Lib/Calendar/taghveem.txt>
# (1993-08-04) writes ``Daylight saving time in Iran starts from the first day
# of Farvardin and ends the first day of Mehr.''  This disagrees with the SSIM:
#
#		   DST start	   DST end
#	year	SSIM	Alavi	SSIM	Alavi
#	1991	05-03!=	03-21	09-20!=	09-23

#
# Go with Alavi starting with 1992.
# I used Ed Reingold's cal-persia in GNU Emacs 19.34 to compute Persian dates.
# The Persian calendar is based on the sun, and dates after around 2050
# are approximate; stop after 2037 when 32-bit time_t's overflow.

# From Ephraim Silverberg (1996-01-02):
#
# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# Each year they decide anew what havoc to wreak on the country.  However,
# there is a "supposed" set of rules which is subject to change depending
# on the party the Minister of Interior, the size of the coalition
# government, the phase of the moon and the direction of the wind.  Hence,
# changes may need to be made on a semi-annual basis.  One thing is entrenched
# in law, however: that there must be at least 150 days of daylight savings
# time annually.  Ever since 1993, the change to daylight savings time has
# been from midnight Thursday night to 1 a.m. Friday morning and the change
# back to standard time on Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time
# to 11 p.m. standard time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the
# change back to standard time takes place on Sunday night instead of Saturday
# night to avoid conflicts with the Jewish New Year.

# Caveat emptor: The dates for the years 1996-1998 were originally announced
# on 1995-08-31, by the previous Minister of Interior.  The new Minister
# of Interior changed the dates on 1996-01-01, to take into account the
# desires of certain portions of Israeli society (the next election is in the
# Fall of 1996).  After this (1996) year's Daylight Savings Time is over, the
# new minister has announced that a study will be conducted as to the wishes of
# the populace regarding the length of Daylight Savings Time and the Interior
# Committee will meet to review the results of the study and make any necessary
# changes to the 1997-1998 dates.  Never a dull moment in the State of Israel.
