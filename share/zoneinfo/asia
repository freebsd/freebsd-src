# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (August 18, 1994):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (3rd edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Except where otherwise noted, it is the source for the data below.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and the discovery of the longitude,
# Oxford University Press (1980).
#
# I invented the abbreviations marked `*' in the following table;
# the rest are from earlier versions of this file, or from other sources.

# People's Republic of China

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, February 17, 1986 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.
#
# . . .I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too
# painful to suck in another copy..  So, here is what I have for
# DST start/end dates for Peking's time zone (info from AP):
#
#     1986 May 4 - Sept 14
#     1987 mid-April - ??

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
# According to Shanks, China started using DST in 1986,
# but it's still all one big happy time zone.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 1989):
# CHINA               8 H  AHEAD OF UTC  ALL OF CHINA, INCL TAIWAN
# CHINA               9 H  AHEAD OF UTC  APR 17 - SEP 10

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (November 18, 1993):
# Shanks writes that China switched from the Chinese calendar on 1912 Feb 12.
# He also writes that China has had a single time zone since 1980 May 1,
# and that they instituted DST on 1986 May 4; this contradicts Devine's
# note about Time magazine, though apparently _something_ happened in 1986.

# From Ephraim Silverberg (September 5, 1993):
#
# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# Each year they decide anew what havoc to wreak on the country.  However,
# there is a "supposed" set of rules which is subject to change depending
# on the party the Minister of Interior, the size of the coalition
# government, the phase of the moon and the direction of the wind.  Hence,
# changes may need to be made on a semi-annual basis.  One thing is entrenched
# in law, however: that there must be at least 150 days on daylight savings
# time annually.

# `9:00' and `JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but ``the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.''
# Shanks writes that daylight saving in Japan during those years was as follows:

# but the only locations using it were US military bases.
# We go with Shanks and omit daylight saving in those years for Asia/Tokyo.
