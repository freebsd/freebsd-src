WEB ---- (introduction provided by jaw@riacs) -------------------------

Welcome to web2 (Webster's Second International) all 234,936 words worth.
The 1934 copyright has elapsed, according to the supplier.  The

noun and adverbial phrases.  The wordlist makes a dandy 'grep' victim.

FreeBSD Maintenance Notes ---------------------------------------------

Note that FreeBSD is not maintaining a historical document, we're
maintaining a list of current [American] English spellings.

A few words have been removed because their spellings have depreciated.
This list of words includes:
	corelation (and its derivatives) -- "correlation" is the preferred spelling
