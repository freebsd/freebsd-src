This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
  Typing "d" returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h"
  gives a primer for first-timers, "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs topic,
  etc.
  In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
  to select it.
  --- PLEASE ADD DOCUMENTATION TO THIS TREE. (See INFO topic first.) ---

* Menu: The list of major topics begins on the next line.
