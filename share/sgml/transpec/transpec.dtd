This DTD defines the format for instant(1) translation specification
files. A translation specification contains:

  * Character mappings, useful for dealing with characters that
    are magic for the formatter, such as backslash (\) is for
    TeX.

  * Sdata mappings.  For example, the ISO entity sets define
    special characters as sdata string, &ouml is [ouml  ].  These
    sdata strings are marked in the output of the sgml parser
    and the mapping turn them into something useful for the 
    formatter.

  * A set of translation rules.
  
See the transpec(5) man page for details.

A rule consists of an expression to determine if the rule should
be applied to a given element (match), and the action that should
be taken if the element matches.  Each rule can be named.  The
cmap and smap attributes can specify an alternate to the default
character and data mapping.
