<p><em>Contributed by &a.jkh; and &a.gclarkii;.</em> 

SUP is a network based software update tool developed at CMU.  The
purpose of this document is get the beginner up and running with sup.

<sect1><heading>Configuration<label id="sup:setup"></heading>

<p>SUP gets the information it needs to run from a configuration file 
called a supfile.  There are different example supfiles provided
for different source releases of FreeBSD.  The 
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/standard-supfile"> file, for example,
contains sup information for the latest standard FreeBSD source
distributions - it tells sup what collections it will be updating
and/or installing and where they go.  Someone using this particular
supfile is said to be supping <ref id="current" name="-current">.
<p>For ports, please have a look at 
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/ports-supfile">.<p>
If you are interested in obtaining the
<url url="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb" name="CVS"> files
that make up the source tree, refer to
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/cvs-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/cvs-supfile">.<p>
If you would rather track changes to the -stable branch, refer to 
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/stable-supfile"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/stable-supfile"> instead.

If you are inside the United States, you may also uncomment
the `secure' and `eBones' collection lines to grab the DES code.  
If you are outside the
U.S., you should NOT sup this code from sup.FreeBSD.ORG as this will
violate U.S. export restrictions.  Instead you should use the 
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/secure-supfile"
name="secure-supfile"> in the sup examples directory.  This will
connect you to the international sup site that contains a secure distribution.
Any distributions you do not wish to receive can be commented out
with a &num; at the beginning of the distribution line.

Please consult the file
<url url="file:/usr/share/examples/sup/README"
name="/usr/share/examples/sup/README">
for a list of alternate sup servers.  The default sup server (sup.FreeBSD.ORG)
listed in the above example files is currently overloaded and any traffic 
that can be transfered to a different host will help relieve some of 
the strain.

Once this is setup, you are ready to go.  To start sup type:
<verb>
	sup supfile
</verb>
If you wish to see what sup is doing "verbosely", give it the -v option,
like so:
<verb>
	sup -v supfile
</verb>
Thats all there is to it!  Remember that if you are running current,
which is what you will have if you sup with the standard-supfile, please 
join the &a.current .  You should also be sure to read 
<ref id="current" name="Staying current with FreeBSD">
for important information on just what we can and cannot do for you as
a -current user.    If you are using the stable-supfile, please
join the &a.stable and read
<ref id="stable" name="Staying stable with FreeBSD">.

<p>There is also a collection including all of the above:
<verb>
ports-all:	  /usr/ports		the whole ports tree
</verb>

<!-- The following is currently not available (and probably will never return)
<p>If you want to keep updated on the original source of the ports,
you can also add this to your supfile.  But note that this collection
is <em>enormous</em>, and unless you are an ftp site mirroring the
entire FreeBSD tree (but cannot use ``mirror'' for some reason), you
(and us) are much better off not using sup to collect these:
<verb>
ports-distfiles: /usr/ports/distfiles	original tarballs
</verb>
