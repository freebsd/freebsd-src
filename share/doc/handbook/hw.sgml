<chapt><heading>PC Hardware compatibility<label id="hw"></heading>

  <p>Issues of hardware compatibility are among the most
    troublesome in the computer industry today and FreeBSD is by
    no means immune to trouble.  In this respect, FreeBSD's
    advantage of being able to run on inexpensive commidity PC
    hardware is also its liability when it comes to support for
    the amazing variety of components on the market.  While it
    would be impossible to provide a exhaustive listing of
    hardware that FreeBSD supports, this section serves as a
    catalog of the device drivers included with FreeBSD and the
    hardware each drivers supports.  Where possible and
    appropriate, notes about specific products are included.

    As FreeBSD is a volunteer project without a funded testing
    department, we depend on you, the user, for much of the
    information contained in this catalog.  If you have direct
    experience of hardware that does or does not work with
    FreeBSD, please let us know by sending email to
    <tt>doc@freebsd.org</tt>.  Questions about supported hardware
    should be directed to <tt>questions@freebsd.org</tt> (see
    <ref id="eresources:mail" name="Mailing Lists"> for more
    information).  When submitting information or asking a
    question, please remember to specify exactly what version of
    FreeBSD you are using and include as many details of your
    hardware as possible.

<sect><heading>Sample Configurations<label id="hw:configs"></heading>
<p>The following list of sample hardware configurations by no means
constitutes an endorsement of a given hardware vendor or product by
<em>The FreeBSD Project</em>.  This information is provided only as a public
service and merely catalogs some of the experiences that various individuals
have had with different hardware combinations.  Your mileage may vary.
Slippery when wet.  Beware of dog.

 <sect1><heading>Jordan's Picks</heading>
    <p>I have had fairly good luck building workstation and server
    configurations with the following components.  I can't guarantee that
    you will too, nor that any of the companies here will remain "best buys"
    forever.  I will try, when I can, to keep this list up-to-date but
    cannot obviously guarantee that it will be at any given time.

  <sect2><heading>Motherboards</heading>
    <p>The <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/" name="ASUS">
    <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/FTP/ASUS/Info/Spec/pi-p55tp4xe.txt"
     name="P55TP4XE">
    motherboard appears to be a good choice for mid-to-high range Pentium
    server and workstation systems.  If you're really looking for performance,
    be also sure to get the <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/Products/TB/mem-0002.html" name="pipelined burst cache module">.  I feel that it's worth
    the extra cost.  If you're looking for a 486 class motherboard, you might
    also investigate ASUS's <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/FTP/ASUS/Info/Spec/pvi-486sp3.txt" name="486SP3G"> offering.

    NOTE:  The Intel <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/Products/TB/triton-intro.html" name="Triton"> chipset based motherboards do not offer memory
    parity logic, making it almost impossible to detect when a memory error
    has occurred.  Those wishing to build highly fault-tolerant systems may
    therefore want to wait for Intel's newest generation of motherboards
    based on the Orion chipset or investigate ASUS's SiS chipset based
    motherboard, the <htmlurl url="http://asustek.asus.com.tw/FTP/ASUS/Info/Spec/pi-p55sp4.txt" name="P55SP4">.  I have no personal experience with this
    motherboard, but have heard good things about it and will note that it
    has the advantage of being available <em>now</em>.


  <sect2><heading>Disk Controllers</heading>
    <p>This one is a bit trickier, and while I used to recommend the
    <htmlurl url="http://www.buslogic.com" name="Buslogic"> controllers
    unilaterally for everything from ISA to PCI, now I tend to lean
    towards the <htmlurl url="http://www.adaptec.com" name="Adaptec">
    1542CF for ISA, Buslogic Bt747c for EISA and Adaptec 2940 for PCI.
    I've currently heard nothing about Buslogic's new Bt-930 controller
    but would welcome any reports on its performance.

  <sect2><heading>Disk drives</heading>
    <p>In this particular game of russian roulette, I'll make few specific
    recommendations except to say "SCSI over IDE whenever you can afford it."
    Even in small desktop configurations, SCSI often makes more sense since it
    allows you to migrate drives from server to desktop as falling drive
    prices make it economical to do so.  If you have more than one machine
    to administer then think of it not simply as storage, think of it as a
    food chain.

    <p>I do not currently see SCSI WIDE drives as a necessary expense unless
    you're putting together an NFS or NEWS server that will be doing a lot
    of multiuser disk I/O.  

  <sect2><heading>Video Cards</heading>
    <p>If you can also afford to buy a commercial X server for $99 from
    <htmlurl url="http://www.xinside.com/" name="X Inside"> then I
    can heartily recommend the <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/"
    name="Matrox"> <htmlurl url="http://www.matrox.com/mgaweb/brochure.htm"
    name="Millenium"> card.  If free X servers are more to your
    liking, you certainly can't go wrong with one of <htmlurl url="http://www.nine.com/" name="Number 9's"> cards.  Their S3 Vision 868 and 968 based cards 
    (the 9FX series) are no slouches either, and are supported by
    <htmlurl url="http://www.xfree86.org" name="XFree86">'s S3 server.

  <sect2><heading>Monitors</heading>
    <p>I have had very good luck with the <htmlurl url="http://cons3.sel.sony.com/SEL/ccpg/display/ms17se2.html"
    name="Sony Multiscan 17SE monitors">, as have I with 
    the Viewsonic offering in the same (trinitron) tube.  For larger than
    17", all I can recommend at the time of this writing is to not spend
    any less than U.S. $2,500 for a 21" monitor if that's what you really
    need.  There are good monitors available in the >=20" range and there
    are also cheap monitors in the >=20" range.  Unfortunately, none are
    both cheap and good!

  <sect2><heading>Networking</heading>
    <p>I can recommend the <htmlurl url="http://www.smc.com/" name="SMC">
    Ultra 16 controller for any ISA application and the SMC EtherPower
    or Compex ENET32 cards for any serious PCI based networking.  Both of
    the PCI cards are based around DEC's DC21041 ethernet controller
    chip and other cards using it, such as the Zynx ZX342 or DEC DE435,
    will generally work as well.

    <p>If you're looking for high-speed serial networking solutions, then
    <htmlurl url="http://www.digiboard.com/" name="Digi International">
    makes the <htmlurl url="http://www.digiboard.com/prodprofiles/profiles-prices/arnetprofiles/sync570i.html" name="SYNC 570i"> series, with drivers now in
    FreeBSD-current. <htmlurl url="http://www.etinc.com"
    name="Emerging Technologies"> also manufactures a board with T1/E1
    capabilities, using software they provide.

   <sect2><heading>Audio</heading>
    <p>I currently use the <htmlurl url="http://www.gravis.com/" name="Gravis">
    Ultrasound MAX due to its high sound quality and full-duplex audio
    capabilities (dual DMA channels).  Support for Windows NT and OS/2 is
    fairly anemic, however, so I'm not sure that I can recommend it as an
    all-around card for a machine that will be running both FreeBSD and NT
    or OS/2.  In such a scenario, I might recommend the <htmlurl url="http://www.creaf.com/" name="Creative Labs"> AWE32 instead.

	  <p>Of the Intel PCI chip sets, the following list describes
	    various types of known-brokenness and the degree of
            breakage, listed from worst to best.
	    </p>

	  <p><descrip>

	      <tag>Mercury:</tag> Cache coherency problems,
		especially if there are ISA bus masters behind
		the ISA to PCI bridge chip.  Hardware flaw, only
		known work around is to turn the cache
		off.

	      <tag>Saturn-I <em>(ie, 82424ZX at rev 0, 1 or 2)</em>:</tag>
		Write back cache coherency
		problems.  Hardware flaw, only known work around
		is to set the external cache to write-through
		mode.  Upgrade to Saturn-II.

	      <tag>Saturn-II <em>(ie, 82424ZX at rev 3 or 4)</em>:</tag>
                Works fine, but many MB
		manufactures leave out the external dirty bit
		SRAM needed for write back operation.  Work
		arounds are either run it in write through mode,
		or get the dirty bit SRAM installed.  (I have
		these for the ASUS PCI/I-486SP3G rev 1.6 and
		later boards).

	      <tag>Neptune:</tag> Can not run more than 2 bus
		master devices.  Admitted Intel design flaw.
		Workarounds include do not run more than 2 bus
		masters, special hardware design to replace the
		PCI bus arbiter (appears on Intel Altair board
		and several other Intel server group MB's).  And
		of course Intel's official answer, move to the
		Triton chip set, we ``fixed it there''.

	      <tag>Triton:</tag> No known cache coherency or bus
		master problems, chip set does not implement
		parity checking.  Workaround for parity issue.
		Wait for Triton-II.

	      <tag>Triton-II:</tag> Unknown, not yet shipping.

<sect2><heading>Digiboard PC/8</heading>

	  <p><em>Contributed by &a.awebster;.<newline>26 August
	      1995.</em>

	    Here is a config snippet from a machine with
	    digiboard PC/8 with 16550.  It has 8 modems connected
	    to these 8 lines, and they work just great.  Do not
	    forget to add <tt>options "COM_MULTIPORT"</tt> or it
	    will not work very well!

<tscreen><verb>
device          sio4    at isa? port 0x100 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio5    at isa? port 0x108 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio6    at isa? port 0x110 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio7    at isa? port 0x118 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio8    at isa? port 0x120 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio9    at isa? port 0x128 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio10   at isa? port 0x130 tty flags 0xb05
device          sio11   at isa? port 0x138 tty flags 0xb05 irq 9 vector siointr
</verb></tscreen>

	  The trick in setting this up is that the MSB of the
	  flags represent the last SIO port, in this case 11 so
	  flags are 0xb05.

<sect2><heading>Boca 16</heading>

	  <p><em>Contributed by &a.whiteside;.<newline>26 August
	      1995.</em>

	    The procedures to make a Boca 16 pord board with
	    FreeBSD are pretty straighforward, but you will need
	    a couple things to make it work:

	    <enum>
	      <item>You either need the kernel sources installed
		so you can recompile the necessary options or
		you will need someone else to compile it for you.
		The 2.0.5 default kernel does <bf>not</bf> come with
		multiport support enabled and you will need to add
		a device entry for each port anyways.
	      </item>
	      <item>Two, you will need to know the interrupt and IO
		setting for your Boca Board so you can set these
		options properly in the kernel.</item>
	    </enum>

	    One important note - the actual UART chips for the
	    Boca 16 are in the connector box, not on the internal
	    board itself. So if you have it unplugged, probes of
	    those ports will fail. I have never tested booting with
	    the box unplugged and plugging it back in, and I
	    suggest you do not either.

	    If you do not already have a custom kernel
	    configuration file set up, refer to <ref
	    id="kernelconfig" name="Kernel Configuration"> for
	    general procedurs.  The following are the specifics
	    for the Boca 16 board and assume you are using the
	    kernel name MYKERNEL and editing with vi.

	    <enum>
		<item>Add the line 
<tscreen><verb>
options "COM_MULTIPORT"
</verb></tscreen>
to the config file.
</item>

	      <item>Where the current <tt>device sio
		<em>xxx</em></tt> lines are, you will need to add
		16 more devices.  <em>Only the last device
		includes the interrupt vector for the
		board</em>. (See the <tt>sio(4)</tt> manual page
		for detail as to why.) 

		The following example is for a Boca Board with an
		interrupt of 3, and a base IO address 100h.  The
		IO address for Each port is +8 hexidecimal from
		the previous port, thus the 100h, 108h, 110h...
		addresses.

<tscreen><verb>
device sio1 at isa? port 0x100 tty flags 0x1005
device sio2 at isa? port 0x108 tty flags 0x1005
device sio3 at isa? port 0x110 tty flags 0x1005
device sio4 at isa? port 0x118 tty flags 0x1005
[...]
device sio15 at isa? port 0x170 tty flags 0x1005
device sio16 at isa? port 0x178 tty flags 0x1005 irq 3 vector siointr
</verb></tscreen>

		The flags entry <em>must</em> be changed from
		this example unless you are using the exact same
		sio assignments. Flags are set according to
		0x<em>MYY</em> where <em>M</em> indicates the
		minor number of the master port (the last port on
		a Boca 16) and <em>YY</em> indicates if FIFO is
		enabled or disabled(enabled), IRQ sharing is
		used(yes) and if there is an AST/4 compatible IRQ
		control register(no).

		In this example,
<tscreen><verb>
flags 0x1005
</verb></tscreen>

		indicates that the master port is sio16. If I
		added another board and assigned sio17 through
		sio28, the flags for all 16 ports on
		<em>that</em> board would be 0x1C05, where 1C
		indicates the minor number of the master port.
		Do not change the 05 setting.</item>

	      <item>Save and complete the kernel configuration,
		recompile, install and reboot.

		Presuming you have successfully installed the
		recompiled kernel and have it set to the correct
		address and IRQ, your boot message should
		indicate the successful probe of the Boca ports
		as follows: (obviously the sio numbers, IO and
		IRQ could be different)

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

		If the messages go by too fast to see, <tt>dmesg
		  &gt; more</tt> will show you the boot
		messages.</item>

	      <item>Next, apprepriate entries in <tt>/dev</tt> for the devices
		must be made using the <tt>/dev/MAKEDEV</tt>
		script.  After becoming root:
<tscreen>
# cd /dev<newline>
# ./MAKEDEV tty1<newline>
# ./MAKEDEV cua1<newline>
<em>(everything in between)</em><newline>
# ./MAKEDEV ttyg<newline>
# ./MAKEDEV cuag
</tscreen>

		If you do not want or need callout devices for some
		reason, you can dispense with making the <tt>cua*</tt>
		devices.</item>

	      <item>If you want a quick and sloppy way to make
		sure the devices are working, you can simply plug
		a modem into each port and (as root) <tt>echo at
		&gt; ttyd*</tt> for each device you have
		made. You <em>should</em> see the RX lights flash
		for each working port.</item>
