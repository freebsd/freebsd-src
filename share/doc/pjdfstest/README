The pjdfstest test suite is normally run by kyua.  It requires kyua 0.11 or
newer. This README describes how to use pjdfstest in the default configuration
(kyua work directory), with a specific filesystem path, and with prove(1).

Method 1. Executing with default configuration (kyua work directory)

    1. Elevate privileges:
       % su -
    2. cd to the tests directory:
       % cd /usr/tests/sys/pjdfstest
    3. Run kyua:
       % kyua test

   Executing the commands as shown above will run pjdfstest in the kyua work
   directory. The kyua work directory defaults to a random generated path under
   /tmp; please see TMPDIR in kyua(1) for more details on how the temporary path
   is chosen with kyua.

Method 2. Executing with a specific filesystem path (in this case /mnt)

    1. Elevate privileges:
       % su -
    2. cd to the tests directory:
       % cd /usr/tests/sys/pjdfstest
    3. Run kyua:
       % env TMPDIR=/mnt kyua test

   Note that if HOME is undefined, this will result in kyua's logfile being
   placed in TMPDIR, which may not be what you want.  You can always use
   --logfile to explicitly select the log location.

Method 3. Executing pjdfstest with prove

    1. Elevate privileges:
       % su -
    2. cd to the temporary directory of your choice
       % cd /mnt
    3. Invoke a specific test manually
       % prove -rv /usr/tests/sys/pjdfstest/chmod/00
