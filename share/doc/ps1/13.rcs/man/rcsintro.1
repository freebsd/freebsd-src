.SH NAME
rcsintro \- introduction to RCS commands
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of text files.
RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging
of revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently, for example
programs, documentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc.
.PP
The basic user interface is extremely simple. The novice only needs
to learn two commands:
.I ci
and
.I co.
\fICi\fR, short for "checkin", deposits the contents of a
text file into an archival file called an RCS file. An RCS file
contains all revisions of a particular text file.
\fICo\fR, short for "checkout", retrieves revisions from an RCS file.
.SH SEE ALSO
ci(1), co(1), ident(1), merge(1), rcs(1), rcsdiff(1), rcsmerge(1), rlog(1), rcsfile(5).
