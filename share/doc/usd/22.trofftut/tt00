.UL troff
is a text-formatting program for
typesetting on the
.UX
operating system.
This device is capable of producing high quality
text;
this paper is an example of
.UL troff
output.
.PP
The phototypesetter itself normally runs with four fonts,
containing roman, italic and bold letters 
(as on this page),
a full greek alphabet, and a substantial number of
special characters and mathematical symbols.
Characters can be printed in a range of sizes,
and placed anywhere on the page.
.PP
.UL troff
allows the user full control over fonts,
sizes, and character positions,
as well as the usual features of a formatter _
right-margin justification, automatic hyphenation,
page titling and numbering, and so on.
It also provides macros, arithmetic variables and operations,
and conditional testing, for complicated formatting tasks.
.PP
This document is an introduction to the most basic use of
.UL troff .
It presents just enough information to enable the user
to do simple formatting
tasks like making viewgraphs,
and to make incremental changes to existing packages
of
.UL troff
commands.
In most respects, the 
.UC UNIX
formatter
.UL nroff
and a more recent version
.ul
(device-independent 
.UL troff)
are identical to
the version described here, so this document also serves as a tutorial for
them as well.

not to \f(BIgroff\fB.  This is a first cut at importing the tutorial from
4.4BSD, now that the code has been released.  It should at some time be modified
to describe \f(BIgroff\fR.\s0
