.se "Initial Installation & Parameters"

	Installation of the notesfile system requires
the following:

.bx
.ix
A working familiarity with version 7 UNIX (or later)
(and UUCP for intersystem transfers).
.ix
The notesfile distribution tape. (The distribution is already in /usr/src/new/notes,
the user-contributed software area, in 4.3BSD).
.ix
A signon for the notesfile owner.
This signon should be in its own group.  The notes
package runs set-gid; mixing the notes group with other
groups is not recommended.
.ix
An ``anonymous'' signon.
This signon should be an unused user-id.
The notesfile system prohibits this user-id from reading and
writing notes.
.ix
The ability to write into the directories where the notesfile
binaries and data base are to live.
.ex

	Appendix A (``Notesfile Installation Checklist'') is a helpful
guide for installing the notesfile system.
The distribution is made from a VAX running 4.2 Bsd.
In most cases there are only a few files that need to be
modified:
``src/parms.h'',
``src/Makefile'',
and
``src/newsgate.h'' (if you are interfacing to USENET).

	First: read in the
distribution tape.
The tape is a TAR format tape. 
This will read in several directories worth of data. 
The ``src'' directory contains all source code for the notesfile
system and the internal help files.
The ``doc'' directory contains an nroff source for the user manual and
the macros that were used to generate it.
The ``man'' directory contains the nroff sources
for the 
notesfile manual pages.
The ``Samples'' directory is a collection of various system files from our
machine;
they are included to provide examples in setting the matching files on
your system.

	After the tape has been read in, select the appropriate parameters.

.ss "Selecting Appropriate Constants"

	Before compiling the notesfile system, 
it must be configured to match your system.
The location of spooling directories and command directories,
the UNIX kernel,
and
policies on ``non-standard'' software
may require changes in the default configuration.

	Configuring the notesfile system is accomplished through
modifying two files, both in the ``src'' directory of
the distribution.
The ``parms.h'' file contains information on values for
the default archival time,
UNIX kernel type,
and
the behavior of the notesfile system such as whether
to keep core images when the notesfile system detects an
internal error.
The ``Makefile'' file contains definitions
of the spooling and command directories,
the notesfile ``owner'',
and
the ``anonymous'' user.

	The distribution is configured for a UNIX 4.2 BSD system.
The most frequently changed values,
after the kernel definition,
are the notesfile ``owner'' and the location of spooling
and command directories.

	Appendix A (``Notesfile Installation Checklist'')
details each of the options in ``parms.h'' and ``Makefile''.
It describes the meaning of the option and the effects of
changing the value.
The recommended method for choosing an appropriate configuration
is to sit at a terminal with the checklist and mark each option
as it is selected or rejected.

.ss "Compiling the Notesfile System"

	After all the appropriate parameters are set up, the next step is
to generate the notesfile system.
First, the requisite directories and files
in /usr/bin (or wherever) should be manufactured.
This procedure should be run exactly once and will probably have to be run
by the superuser.
To make these files type:

.nf
	make base
.fi

The next phase should be run while signed in as the notesfile ``owner''.
Type:

.nf
	make boot
.fi

	If all goes well, this should end with a message to the effect
that the notesfile system has been installed
(approximately 17 minutes on a VAX-11/780)
If anything goes wrong, perusal of the terminal dialogue should
point out the offending steps.
The most likely cause of errors will be a missing directory.

	To replace the notesfile software
any time after these two steps have been run, type:

.nf
	make install
.fi

	If at some time you are must change some of the internal constants
of the notesfile package (such as string lengths and blocking factors),
all the existing notesfiles on your system will be incompatible with the
new instantiation of the program.  
The ``nfdump'' and ``nfload'' programs are useful for converting
the data base from one format to another.
The ``nfdump'' program should be compiled with the old configuration
and the ``nfload'' program should be compiled with the new configuration.
Documentation on these programs can be found in the appendices.

.ss "User Subroutines"

	The notesfile package contains several routines available
to users in general.
The nfabort routine generates a core image, places it in a specified
place, logs the fact in a notesfile, and terminates.
The nfcomment routine allows users to log text in a notesfile.
These routines are useful for debugging information, and communication
between program developers and users.
Users can load these routines by specifying `-lnfcom' on 
the `cc' or `ld' command lines.

	The normal installation procedure (``make install'') will 
compile the nfcomment routine and place it in the library directory.
As distributed, the file is placed in the ``/usr/local/lib'' directory.
To change this, modify the definition of ``LIBDIR'' in `Makefile'.

.se "Installing the Man(1) Documentation"

	Install the man(1) pages for the notesfile with the following
commands.
They are best done as super-user.

.nf
.ne 2
	cd man
	make install
.fi

The nroff sources for the documentation will be installed in the
directory /usr/man in subdirectories man1, man3, and man8.

.se "Interfacing to News(I)"

	The notesfile system interfaces to the news(I)
system.
The newsinput program parses articles from the news system
and inserts them in the appropriate notesfiles.
The newsoutput program moves notes from the notesfile system
to the news system.
Neither program will move text between the two systems if the notesfile
is not enabled for networking (see section 3.1.5).
Newsoutput will not retransmit articles inserted by newsinput.
Sites sharing notesfiles can all run both newsinput and newsoutput.

	Appendix B contains instructions on how to interface
a notesfile system to a news system.
Configurations for isolated notesfiles sites, notesfile subnetworks,
mapping between notesfile and newsgroup names,
and a checklist for the gateway installation are included.

	Since the notes system stores the
entire text of a single notesfile
in a single file, a notesfile system uses less space than the
same scale news system.
The notesfile system is generally more space-efficient
than B news.

.se "Housekeeping"

	Notesfiles has a number of utilities to manage its
data base.
A number of shell scripts are included with the distribution
which invoke the archival programs and trim logging files
which otherwise grow without bounds.
These shell scripts are included in the ``Samples'' subdirectory
of the notesfile distribution and 
can be invoked automatically through cron(8).

.ss "Cleaning up Disk Space"

	When a note or response is deleted, a hole is left in that notesfile.
This makes for quick deletion but tends to leave some disk space wasted.
The compress option on the director page is one way that this space is
reclaimed.
The nfarchive program (see section 3.7.2) also returns unused space.
Have cron run the nfarchive program weekly to automate
space reclamation.

.ss "Automatic Removal of Notes"

	The nfarchive program archives notes untouched for more than
a specified number of days.
Archived notes and their responses are stored in 
an ``archive'' notesfile.
``Archive'' notesfiles are typically found in the directory
/usr/spool/oldnotes; this may vary between installations.
The archives can be accessed automatically using the ``N'' command
from the index, note and response displays or
by explicitly naming the notesfile
(notes /usr/spool/oldnotes/mynotes).
The notes are deleted after they have been archived. 
After the archival, a compression of the notesfile is performed to
recover the space formerly occupied by the archived notes.
Nfarchive assumes that all months have 30 days and all years have 12 months.
The format of the nfarchive command line is:

	nfarchive [-d] [-m+ or -m-] [-#] [-w#] [-f file] topic

	The -d option specifies that no archiving is to take place;
the notes eligible are to be deleted.

	The -m option specifies whether to check the director message
status before archiving notes.
Use ``-m+'' to archive notes which meet the age requirement and have
the director message on.
The ``-m-'' option archives notes of sufficient age with the director
message turned off.
If this option is omitted, notes are archived on the basis of age only.

	The -# option specifies the age of eligible notes. The
increment is days.
The default is determined by the value of ARCHTIME in `parms.h' and 
is distributed as fourteen days.
Each notesfile can specify a (possibly) different expiration
threshold.
Normally the notesfile will specify `default' and nfarchive
uses the time specified on its command line.
Ages specified in a notesfile override the times given on the
nfarchive command line.

	The -w# parameter specifies the working set size to
use for notesfiles which do not specify a working set size.
This determines a minimum number of notes to remain in a notesfile.
If unspecified, the default working set size is 0.
This value can be changed through the WORKSETSIZE variable
in ``parms.h''.

	Working sets and expiration thresholds work together 
in the following manner.
Nfarchive first determines a maximum number of notes to delete.
This is calculated from the number of notes in the notesfile
(total notes minus ``holes'' caused by deletions)
and the working set size.
The archival program proceeds through the notesfile deleting
notes older than the expiration threshold until it runs
out of notes or the maximum number of notes has been deleted.

	The -f option specifies a file containing a list of notesfiles
to be archived.
Multiple -f parameters are permitted and can be intermixed with
`topic' parameters.
Notesfile name pattern matching is performed on both `topic' parameters
and the entries in a file specified by the -f option.

	Mapping between an active notesfile and its archive is
listed in the file ``.utilities/net.aliases/Archive-into''.
This file contains pairs of ABSOLUTE notesfile names
(``/usr/spool/notes/mynotes'' instead of ``mynotes'').
The first entry specifies the active notesfile;
the second entry specifies the archive notesfile.
Notesfiles not appearing in the archive mapping file will
be placed in ``/usr/spool/oldnotes'' with the same
final component as the active notesfile.
Conflicts are possible.
If unmapped, the notesfiles ``/usr/spool/notes/mynotes'' and
``/some/other/place/mynotes'' will be archived into
the same archive ``/usr/spool/oldnotes/mynotes''.

.ss "Cleaning Sequencer Files"

	A tool to remove sequencer entries for deleted users will be 
included in future releases of the notesfile package. 
This tool will traverse the sequencer directory removing files
belonging to users whose signons no longer exist.
The process can be made automatic by including an entry in the cron table.

	A second sequencer related utility will traverse
the sequencer directory
and remove entries for deleted notesfiles.
A similar user program will be provided to permit users to remove
their sequencer entries for notesfiles that they no longer peruse.

.ss "Additions to System Boot"

	Since the notesfile system maintains several lock files to 
ensure mutual exclusion of each notesfile, a line similar to the following
should be added to the /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local file:

	rm -f /usr/spool/notes/.locks/*

	Make sure `/usr/spool/notes' matches the MSTDIR parameter in the
Makefile. 
This line will remove any locks left if the system has
crashed.
