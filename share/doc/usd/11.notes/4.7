.se "Modifying Access Rights for Many Notesfiles"

	It is convenient to add entries to a large number of
access lists simultaneously.
The nfaccess program adds an access specification to each of
a specified list of notesfiles.
Nfaccess functions similarly to chmod(1).
Nfaccess is invoked as:

	nfaccess <access-right> notesfile [notesfile ...]

The ``access-right'' is formatted as: ``type:name=mode''.
Type can be any of ``user'', ``group'', or ``system'';
capitalized variants are also valid.
The ``type:'' specification can be omitted.
``User'' is assumed in these cases.
The ``mode'' field consists of a sequence of the
characters ``d'', ``r'', ``w'', ``a'' and ``n''.
These indicate director, read, write, answer (respond) and null
access respectively.

	Nfaccess requires user and group entries to be valid
by looking for them in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.
System entries are not checked for validity.
Nfaccess will add the entry to the access list of the specified
notesfiles.
If an entry for that particular user, group or system exists,
the new access right replaces the old access rights.
The computed mode is an absolute mode; the previous value in
the access list (if any) is replaced with the new mode.

	Any user can run the nfaccess program.
Nfaccess refuses to modify access lists for any notesfile
where the user is not a director.
The nfaccess program is stored in the notesfile utility
directory, typically ``/usr/spool/notes/.utilities''.

	Nfaccess is often used to remedy missing permissions
in a number of notesfiles.
One example is when the notesfile administrator is replaced;
nfaccess is used to grant director access to the appropriate
notesfiles (usually most of them).
As new notesfiles are created, the access list can be tuned
by placing lists of access-rights in the file
``/usr/spool/notes/.utilities/access-template''.
These access-rights are added to the default access list
of newly created notesfiles.
