.ch "Managing Notesfiles"

	The notesfile system is installed by a user who is known as the
``owner'' of the notesfiles (UIUCDCS uses user ``notes'').
This user can create, delete, rename, and initiate networking of notesfiles.
Each notesfile is assigned a set of ``directors'' (who may or may not be
associated with owner of notesfiles).  The directors have special privileges
for managing the notesfile (see below).
The ``owner'' rarely manages the day to day aspects of a notesfile,
although he has director, read, write and response privileges to
all notesfiles for
handling emergencies and failures.

.se "Director Options"

	The director can:

.bx
.ix
Change the access permissions.
.ix
Write the policy note.
.ix
Change the notesfile title and director message.
.ix
Open or close the notesfile.
.ix
Allow the notesfile to be networked.
.ix
Permit or restrict anonymous notes.
.ix
Compress the notesfile.
.ix
Change the notesfile's archival parameters.
.ix
Delete notes and responses.
.ix
Toggle director message on any note or response.
.ex

	The director can delete notes or toggle the director message
above them while reading the notes.
Access other options
by typing ``d'' on the index page.  A display like this results:

	Options available on this page include:  access lists, policy
note writing, title and director messages, open/close notesfile,
network enabling, anonymous notes, notesfile compress, and delete
a list of notes.

.ss "Access Lists"

	The notesfile system allows directors to allow or restrict access
to each notesfile.
The access list can allow or deny read, write, respond, and director
options to any user, group, or system.
Type ``p'' (``permissions'') on the director options page
to enter the access list editor.
The system prompts for an option:
``m'' to modify an extant entry, ``d'' to delete
an entry, ``i'' to insert a new entry, ``r'' to replot the list,
``q'' to quit editing the access list, and
capital ``Q'' to quit editing the access list and IGNORE ANY CHANGES MADE.
Delete or modify entries by entry number.  Scroll the entries using ``+'' and
``-''.

	After typing ``i'' to insert a new entry,
the system prompts for a user type
(``u'' for user, ``g'' for group, ``s'' for system).
The system then prompts for the name of the user, group, or system.
(Users and groups must be valid names)
The default access options
are then displayed: read, write, answer (for responses).  Use the keys
``r'', ``w'', ``a'', and ``d'' to toggle the read, write, answer, and director
privileges respectively.  Some options automatically
enable others (e.g., ``w'' for writing automatically enables ``a'' for answering).
It is not possible to remove answer access while write access is enabled.
The ``n'' key will remove all privileges (``no access'').
Type return (or ``q'') when the correct options have been entered.
The system prompts for another user.  Press return at the prompt to exercise
other access list options.

	The access machinery checks user names before checking
group names.
If user ``john'' explicitly has no
access but his group does, he will nevertheless be denied access to the file.
If there is no explicit entry for user ``john'', a check is made for
permissions granted to his group(s).
(n.b.: an entry for user ``Other'' will match all users, 
circumventing group permissions.
The behavior typically desired can be achieved with a 
group ``Other'' just as well.)

	If no explicit user entry exists, a search for group permissions
is initiated.
Users can belong to more than one group
(although kernels such as Version 7 only allow one at a time)
and the notesfile code checks each of the user's groups.
If permissions for several of these groups exist,
the user is given the inclusive OR of the several permissions.
If none of the user's groups are given permission, a
default permission specified by group ``Other'' is usually
assigned.
The ``Other'' entry matches when none of the other group entries
have matched.
This entry can be deleted, in which case no access is granted.

	The current implementation of system access
enforcement is naive.
The network software will send to a system only if it has read permission.
Reception allows intermediaries
to pass on notes even if they are not allowed write access to the notesfile;
the access permission is determined from the originating system of each note
or response
instead of the site actually delivering the article.
The name ``Other'' (capital ``O'') matches any system name not
mentioned explicitly.

	Many notesfiles allow several users and groups to have
read/write access,
a single user to have director access
(in addition to the notesfile ``owner''),
and all other users no access.

	When a notesfile is first created, a default access 
list is created.
The notesfile ``owner'' is made director, group ``Other''
and system ``Other'' are both given read/write access
to the notesfile.
If the file ``/usr/spool/notes/.utilities/access-template''
exists, it contains a list of access-rights to add to
the new notesfile's access list.
The file contains lines of access-rights in the format used
by the nfaccess program.
Access-rights look like ``user:essick=drwa'';
for more information on the format of these entries,
see the man(I) page for nfaccess.

.ss "Policy Note"

	Type ``w'' (``write policy'') on the director option page to write a policy
note (just like writing any other note).

.ss "Title & Director Messages"

	Change the notesfile title with ``t'', the director message with ``m''.
The
system prompts for a new message.
Typing only a carriage return will not change the old message.

.ss "Open/Close"

	Type ``o'' (``open'') to toggle the availability of the notesfile (subject to
the access list).
Closed notesfiles are unavailable to non-directors.

.ss "Network Options"

	Type ``n'' (``network'') to toggle the availability of the notesfile
for networking.
Arrangements must be made with the notesfile system ``owner'' to do the network
transfers.

.ss "Anonymous Notes"

	Type ``a'' (``anonymous'') to toggle the availability of
anonymous notes in the notesfile.
The availability of the anonymous option may provoke slanderous
attacks from users
(whose anonymity is completely protected).

.ss "Compression"

	Type ``c'' (``compress'') to compress the notesfile.  As notes
are deleted, their text and index space is not reclaimed.  This command
reclaims the space.  The notesfile must be closed.  On a VAX 11/780,
20 seconds of real time (on a slightly loaded system) is required to
reclaim the space of a notesfile with 50 remaining notes
(compression time is dependent on remaining notes).
Notesfiles should be compressed whenever many of their notes have been
deleted.
The notesfile archiver ``nfarchive'' and cron(8) can be used to automate this
process.

	The director's option page displays a count of ``holes''
left by deleted notes and responses.
This can be used as an indication of how much wasted space is within
the notesfile.

.ss "Expiration Threshold"

	The `e' command allows a notesfile director to
modify the notesfile's expiration threshold.
Possible values include specific numbers of days, `default'
and `never'.
The value can be left unchanged by not specifying a 
new value.
The `default' value is assigned to new notesfiles;
directors can change it as needed.

	The notesfile archiving program (nfarchive) examines the
expiration threshold of each notesfile it processes.
This threshold determines how long a note string must be inactive
before it is eligible for archival.
The `Default' expiration threshold uses the expiration time
specified on the `nfarchive' command line; 
this is usually 2 weeks.
Specific ages can be specified.
The age specified in the notesfile overrides the value 
on the `nfarchive' command line.
The `Never' threshold tells `nfarchive' that this notesfile is
not to be archived.

.ss "Working Set Size"

	Each notesfile contains a working set of notes.
The working set is the number of notes left in the notesfile
by the nfarchive program.
When nfarchive runs, it determines a maximum number of notes
to delete.
This number is the number of notes written in the notesfile
minus the number of ``holes'' caused by deletions minus
the working set size.
Nfarchive will leave a ``working set size'' of notes in
the notesfile;
if fewer notes existed in the notesfile, no notes are
archived.

	The working set size can be changed by the `s' command
from the director page.
Possible values include ``default'' and specific numbers.
``Default'' specifies that the value supplied during
the nfarchive run is to be used;
explicit values in the notesfile always override values
specified on the nfarchive command line.

.ss "Expiration Action"

	Each notesfile can decide on the destination of expired 
notestrings.
The expiration action field takes one of the values
``Default'', ``Archive'' or ``Delete''.
Archive and delete specify that expired notes are to be
archived and deleted respectively.
The default entry specifies that the expiration action should
follow that specified on the nfarchive command line.

.ss "Expire With Director Message"

	Notesfiles can decide how to expire based on director
message status individually.
This option can assume four values:
``Default'',
``Nocare'',
``On'',
and 
``Off''.
The on and off values specify that only notes with the
director message on or off respectively are eligible for
expiration.
The nocare value specifies that the director message status
is not checked; both director and non-director marked notes
are eligible for expiration.
Select the default entry to use the value of this parameter
as specified on the nfarchive command line.

.ss "Maximum Text per Article"

	The notesfile system imposes limits on the size of
each article.  Earlier versions restricted articles to 64 kbytes;
the current version provides for articles up to 4 Gigabytes.
A constant is used to determine
the actual maximum allowed per article.

	Each notesfile can select a maximum text length per
article.
This limit is not allowed to exceed the hard-coded limit
(currently 3 Mbytes).
Articles exceeding this limit are truncated and a message
detailing the count of excess bytes and the system responsible
for truncating the text is appended.

	Initially the maximum text length is set to the 
highest permissible value.
One reason for lowering the limit is to meet restrictions
on the size of network transfers.

.ss "Deleting and Un-Deleting Many Articles"

	Type ``z'' (``zap'') to delete many notes (and their
responses) quickly.
Enter a list of note numbers or note ranges (aa-bb) separated by spaces.
Confirm the command with ``y''; other responses will abort the command.
It is economical and prudent to compress the notesfile
shortly thereafter.
Note that deleting notes in a networked notesfile makes those notes
unavailable to those who poll your system for new notes and responses.

	The ``u'' (undelete) command performs the opposite function
of the ``z'' command. 
This command allows you to specify a list of note strings to
be un-deleted.
When prompted, the director shoul supply the note numbers he wishes
to re-activate.
The specified notes are re-activated and can be viewed as before.
This command is only effective until a compression of the notesfile;
after that time the notes are no longer present in the notesfile.

.ss "Director Options for Notes"

	Directors may put a ``director message'' above any note they write.
There is one single line director message for each notesfile.  Typical
director messages
are: ``New Policy'', ``*** This problem fixed or ignored ***'',
or ``-- Eat Flaming Death Fascist Pigs --''.
Directors can also toggle the director message on
a note being
read (``d'' for ``director message'').
A director can delete a note (and all its
responses) or any response while reading the text of the note or response
by typing ``Z'' (``zap this one'') and confirming with ``y''.

.ss "Default Sequencer Lists"

	Some users never set up an ``NFSEQ'' environment variable 
specifying the notesfile they wish to see.
The file ``/usr/spool/notes/.utilities/Dflt-Seq'' contains a 
default list of notesfiles.
Users without an ``NFSEQ'' variable receive the notesfiles listed
in this file.
The file can be changed at anytime and will take effect with
the next ``autoseq'' by a user.

.se "Creation & Deletion of Notesfiles"

	Only the ``owner'' of the notesfile system can create notesfiles.
Create notesfiles with the mknf command:

	mknf [ -aon ] topic1 [ ... ]

	The created notesfiles have default status of
closed, non-networked, and
no anonymous notes permitted.
Specify -a to permit anonymous notes in the new notesfiles.
Use -o to have the notesfiles marked open for general use and
the -n option to enable the notesfiles' network availability.
These status flags can all be modified from the directors page at later
times.

	Delete notesfiles with rmnf:

	rmnf [ -f ] topic1 [ ... ]

Each notesfile to be removed must be verified with ``y'' after a
prompt -- anything else will leave that notesfile intact.
Use the -f option to blindly remove notesfiles;
the verification step is bypassed when ``rmnf'' is invoked
with the -f option.

	The file /usr/spool/notes/.utilities/avail.notes contains
a list of the public notesfiles.
The notesfile owner should update this file when he creates
new notesfiles;
this file is not automatically updated by ``mknf'' and ``rmnf''.
The contents and format of the file are at the discretion of the
notesfile system owner.

.se "Intersystem Notesfiles"

	The notesfile system provides for intersystem notesfiles
in an arbitrary connected network.
Copies of a shared notesfile must exist on each
of the systems wishing to read notes for that notesfile.
The contents are kept in synchrony through occasional exchanges
over a network (UIUCDCS uses both uucp and TCP/IP).
Notesfiles to be shared must have their ``network status'' enabled (see
director options).

	Duplication of notes and responses is prevented by the use of
unique identifiers.
Each note and response in a notesfile is assigned a unique number.
The networking software checks each note as it arrives to
see if a copy already exists.
In the event of duplication, the extra copy is discarded and
the fact is logged in the statistics and the network log.

	In the (hopefully rare) event that a response arrives at a 
system before the base note does, the network reception program will
generate a ``foster parent'' for the orphaned response.
When the true parent arrives,
the foster parent will be overwritten.
A count of orphaned responses received is kept and available 
through use of the nfstats program (see section 4.4).

.ss "Transmitting Notesfile Updates"

	The nfxmit program gathers the new notes and responses in specified
notesfiles and sends them to a specified site.
The notesfile ``owner'' must occasionally enter the following command (or
have it entered for him by cron)
to update remote notesfiles with new notes and receive new remote
notes:

	nfxmit -dsitename [-t datespec] [-r] [-a] [-f file] topic1 [...]

The ``sitename'' is the name of the remote site
to receive the new notes.
The remote site should have notesfiles matching those specified
by the topic1 parameter.
For remote notesfiles with different names, see the section below on
Name Mapping.

	The optional -t specifies that all notes and responses
since that date should be sent (normally -t is omitted and the notesfile
system sends only new notes and responses).

	The -r option specifies that the remote notes system
should not only receive the current changes but also reply in kind.
This is useful if the remote system does not automatically run the
nfxmit program.

	The -a option specifies that articles inserted
from the news(I) system
are to be sent also. Normally these articles are not sent because the 
receiver probably has them; the primary use of this switch is for sites
that do not run news(I).

	Using the -f switch tells nfxmit
to read the file specified for a list
of notesfiles to transmit;
multiple -f parameters are permitted and can be freely intermixed
with `topic' parameters.
Notesfile name pattern matching is
performed on both `topic' parameters and
the entries in a file specified by the -f option.

	Nfxmit uses uux(1) as a transport and remote execution
mechanism.  Connections using different protocols and mechanisms
can be selected in the file ``/usr/spool/notes/.utilities/net.how'';
its format is described in the section ``Non-Standard Links''.
Uux typically permits a limited set of commands to be executed
remotely.
The file /usr/lib/uucp/L.cmds contains a list of
acceptable commands; this file should be edited to include the
``nfrcv'' program.

.ss "Network Transaction Log"

	The network software maintains a log of all transactions,
including time, date, number of notes and responses transferred, direction
of transfer,
and number of notes replicated by transfer.
This log is placed in a file called `net.log' and resides in the
notesfile utility directory (by default: /usr/spool/notes/.utilities).

	This file will grow without bounds.
Occasional pruning is a good idea.
There is no vital information stored in this file;
its purpose is to provide a network audit trail.

.ss "Non-Standard Links"

	Some systems will be unable to keep the notesfile network
software in a public directory (such as /usr/bin).
Other sites will have non-uucp links.
The `net.how' file is for these cases.  `Net.how' is
kept in the notesfile utility
directory (/usr/spool/notes/.utilities)
and 
contains information on linking to remote systems.
Entries in the file are made for systems with non-standard links
and 
have the following format:

	system:direction:protocol::command string

	The system field contains the name of the remote system.
The direction field
contains either an `x' or `r' (no quotes) and specifies the direction
that the line is for. 
An `x' specifies that the command string is for sending notes to the
remote site; an `r' specifies that the command string is used in
coercing the remote system to send its new notes and responses back.
Lines beginning with a `#' are comment lines and ignored by the notesfile
code.

	The protocol field is either empty or contains an integer
value.  An empty field indicates protocol 0.
Currently only protocols 0 and 1 are supported.
The notesfile receiving programs automatically switch between
protocols.

	The command string is a printf control string (without quotes)
with two `%s'
entries.
The first is for filling in the name of the notesfile, the second is
for the local system name.
Many entries in the `net.how' file will be to place
different paths on the `nfrcv' and `nfxmit' commands.
The default command line is:

	uux -z - system\\!nfrcv %s %s

for the `x' entry and for the `r' entry:

	uux system\\!nfxmit %s -d%s

In the following sample from our net.how file, the host
``uicsovax'' is connected via UUCP and the notesfile networking
programs live in non-standard directories.
The host ``etherhost'' is reachable over a local network and the
Berkeley ``rsh'' commands can be used to ship data between
the local host and ``etherhost''.

.nf
	uicsovax:x:::uux - uicsovax!/mnt/dcs/essick/.commands/nfrcv %s %s
	uicsovax:r:::uux uicsovax!/mnt/dcs/essick/.commands/nfxmit %s -d%s
	etherhost:x:::rsh etherhost /usr/bin/nfrcv %s %s
	etherhost:r:::rsh etherhost /usr/bin/nfxmit %s -d%s
.fi


.ss "Notesfile Name Mapping"

	To provide flexibility in the naming of notesfile across systems,
the network software looks in the
directory /usr/spool/notes/.utilities/net.aliases
for mappings of local notesfile names to remote notesfile names.
Each file in the directory is named after a system (e.g., pur-ee or uicsovax).
Each of these files contains lines which specify the mapping of local
notesfiles to the particular systems notesfiles.
Lines beginning with `#' in these files are comment lines and are ignored
in the matching process.
Data lines in the files look like:

	local_nf:remote_nf

	If there is no entry for a particular notesfile or
the file for that system is missing, the local name is used.

	Mapping is performed by the transmission program ``nfxmit''.
The ``nfrcv'' program does not consult this table.
