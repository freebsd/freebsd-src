.se "Checking for New Notes"

	The checknotes program
checks the notesfiles specified by the NFSEQ environment 
variable to determine if there are new notes.
The exit code is arranged to make the program useful in shell scripts:
0 (TRUE) is there are new notes, 1 (FALSE) otherwise.

	Use the ``-q'' option to receive a message

		There are new notes

if one or more of the notesfiles have notes/responses written since
the user's last entry time into that notesfile.

	The ``-n'' option is similar to the ``-q'' option, with the exception
that it yields output when there are no new notes. The output
of checknotes with the ``-n'' option is:

		There are no new notes

	Use ``-v'' to print the name of each notesfile with new 
notes/responses.
The ``-s'' option is suitable for use in conditional
expressions in shell scripts; no output is generated by this option.
