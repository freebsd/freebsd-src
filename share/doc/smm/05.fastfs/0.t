A reimplementation of the UNIX file system is described.
The reimplementation provides substantially higher throughput
rates by using more flexible allocation policies
that allow better locality of reference and can
be adapted to a wide range of peripheral and processor characteristics.
The new file system clusters data that is sequentially accessed
and provides two block sizes to allow fast access to large files
while not wasting large amounts of space for small files.
File access rates of up to ten times faster than the traditional
UNIX file system are experienced.
Long needed enhancements to the programmers'
interface are discussed.
These include a mechanism to place advisory locks on files, 
extensions of the name space across file systems,
the ability to use long file names,
and provisions for administrative control of resource usage.
