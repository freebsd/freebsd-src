A brief overview of the major changes to
the system between \*(Ps and \*(4B are outlined.
An explanation of how to set up terminal lines and user accounts,
and how to do system-specific tailoring is provided.
A description of how to install and configure the \*(4B networking
facilities is included.
Finally, the document details system operation procedures:
