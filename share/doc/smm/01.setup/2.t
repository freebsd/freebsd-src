.Sh 1 "Bootstrap procedure"
.PP
This section explains the bootstrap procedure that can be used
to get the kernel supplied with this distribution running on your machine.
If you are not currently running \*(Ps you will
have to do a full bootstrap.
Section 3 describes how to upgrade a \*(Ps system.
An understanding of the operations used in a full bootstrap
is helpful in doing an upgrade as well.
In either case, it is highly desirable to read and understand
the remainder of this document before proceeding.
.PP
The distribution supports a somewhat wider set of machines than
those for which we have built binaries.
The architectures that are supported only in source form include:
.IP \(bu
Intel 386/486-based machines (ISA/AT or EISA bus only)
.IP \(bu
Sony News MIPS-based workstations
.IP \(bu
Omron Luna 68000-based workstations
.LP
If you wish to run one of these architectures,
you will have to build a cross compilation environment.
Note that the distribution does
.B not
include the machine support for the Tahoe and VAX architectures
found in previous BSD distributions.
Our primary development environment is the HP9000/300 series machines.
The other architectures are developed and supported by
people outside the university.
Consequently, we are not able to directly test or maintain these 
other architectures, so cannot comment on their robustness,
reliability, or completeness.
.Sh 2 "Bootstrapping from the tape"

The set of files on the distribution tape are as follows:
.IP 1)
A
.Xr dd (1)

.Xr tar (1)
(DECstation), or
.Xr dump (8)
(SPARC) image of the root filesystem
.IP 2)

The tape bootstrap procedure used to create a
working system involves the following major steps:
.IP 1)
Transfer a bootable root filesystem from the tape to a disk
and get it booted and running.
.IP 2)
Build and restore the
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /usr
filesystems from tape with
.Xr tar (1).
.IP 3)
Extract the system and utility source files as desired.
.PP
The following sections describe the above steps in detail.
The details of the first step vary between architectures.
The specific steps for the HP300, SPARC, and DECstation are
given in the next three sections respectively.
You should follow the instructions for your particular architecture.
In all sections,
commands you are expected to type are shown in italics, while that
information printed by the system is shown emboldened.

Major items that are not supported
include the 310 and 332 CPU's, 400 series machines
configured for Domain/OS, EISA and VME bus adaptors, audio, the centronics
port, 1/2" tape drives (7980), CD-ROM, and the PVRX/TVRX 3D graphics displays.
.Sh 3 "Standalone device file naming"
.LP
The standalone system device name syntax on the HP300 is of the form:
.DS
xx(a,c,u,p)
.DE
where
\fIxx\fP is the device type,
\fIa\fP specifies the adaptor to use,
\fIc\fP the controller,
\fIu\fP the unit, and
\fIp\fP a partition.
The \fIdevice type\fP differentiates the various disks and tapes and is one of:
``rd'' for HP-IB CS80 disks,
``ct'' for HP-IB CS80 cartridge tapes, or
``sd'' for SCSI-I disks
(SCSI-I tapes are currently not supported).
The \fIadaptor\fP field is a logical HP-IB or SCSI bus adaptor card number.
This will typically be
0 for SCSI disks,
0 for devices on the ``slow'' HP-IB interface (usually tapes) and
1 for devices on the ``fast'' HP-IB interface (usually disks).
To get a complete mapping of physical (select-code) to logical card numbers
just type a ^C at the standalone prompt.
The \fIcontroller\fP field is the disk or tape's target number on the
HP-IB or SCSI bus.
For SCSI the range is 0 to 6 (7 is the adaptor address) and
for HP-IB the range is 0 to 7.
The \fIunit\fP field is unused and should be 0.
The \fIpartition\fP field is interpreted differently for tapes
and disks: for disks it is a disk partition (in the range 0-7),
and for tapes it is a file number offset on the tape.
Thus, partition 2 of a SCSI disk drive at target 3 on SCSI bus 1
would be ``sd(1,3,0,2)''.
If you have only one of any type bus adaptor, you may omit the adaptor
and controller numbers;
e.g. ``sd(0,2)'' could be used instead of ``sd(0,0,0,2)''.
The following examples always use the full syntax for clarity.
.Sh 3 "The procedure"
.LP
The basic steps involved in bringing up the HP300 are as follows:
.IP 1)
Obtain a second disk and format it, if necessary.
.IP 2)
Copy a root filesystem from the
tape onto the beginning of the disk.
.IP 3)
Boot the UNIX system on the new disk.
.IP 4)
(Optional) Build a root filesystem optimized for your disk.
.IP 5)
Label the disks with the
.Xr disklabel (8)
program.
.Sh 4 "Step 1: selecting and formatting a disk"
.PP
For your first system you will have to obtain a formatted disk
of a type given in the ``supported hardware'' list above.
If you want to load an entire binary system
(i.e., everything except
.Pn /usr/src ),
on the single disk you will need a minimum of 290MB,
ruling out anything smaller than a 7959B/S disk.
The disklabel included in the bootstrap root image is laid out
to accommodate this scenario.
Note that an HP SCSI magneto-optical disk will work fine for this case.
\*(4B will boot and run (albeit slowly) using one.
If you want to load source on a single disk system,
you will need at least 640MB (at least a 2213A SCSI or 2203A HP-IB disk).
A disk as small as the 7945A (54MB) can be used for the bootstrap
procedure but will hold only the root and primary swap partitions.
If you plan to use multiple disks,
refer to section 2.5 for suggestions on partitioning.
.PP
After selecting a disk, you may need to format it.
Since most HP disk drives come pre-formatted
(except optical media)
you probably will not, but if necessary,
you can format a disk under HP-UX using the
.Xr mediainit (1m)
program.
Once you have \*(4B up and running on one machine you can use the
.Xr scsiformat (8)
program to format additional SCSI disks.
Any additional HP-IB disks will have to be formatted using HP-UX.
.Sh 4 "Step 2: copying the root filesystem from tape to disk"
.PP
Once you have a formatted second disk you can use the
.Xr dd (1)
command under HP-UX to copy the root filesystem image from
the tape to the beginning of the second disk.
For HP's, the root filesystem image is the first file on the tape.
It includes a disklabel and bootblock along with the root filesystem.
An example command to copy the image from tape to the beginning of a disk is:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=/dev/rmt/0m of=/dev/rdsk/1s0 bs=\*(Bzb
.DE
The actual special file syntax may vary depending on unit numbers and
the version of HP-UX that is running.
Consult the HP-UX
.Xr mt (7)
and
.Xr disk (7)
man pages for details.
.PP
Note that if you have a SCSI disk, you don't necessarily have to use
HP-UX (or an HP) to create the boot disk.
Any machine and operating system that will allow you to copy the
raw disk image out to block 0 of the disk will do.
.PP
If you have only a single machine with a single disk,
you may still be able to install and boot \*(4B if you have an
HP-IB cartridge tape drive.
If so, you can use a more difficult approach of booting a
standalone copy program from the tape, and using that to copy the
root filesystem image from the tape to the disk.
To do this, you need to extract the first file of the distribution tape
(the root image), copy it over to a machine with a cartridge drive
and then copy the image onto tape.
For example:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=/dev/rst0 of=bootimage bs=\*(Bzb
rcp bootimage foo:/tmp/bootimage
<login to foo>
dd if=/tmp/bootimage of=/dev/rct/0m bs=\*(Bzb
.DE
Once this tape is created you can boot and run the standalone tape
copy program from it.
The copy program is loaded just as any other program would be loaded
by the bootrom in ``attended'' mode:
reset the CPU,
hold down the space bar until the word ``Keyboard'' appears in the
installed interface list, and
enter the menu selection for SYS_TCOPY.
Once loaded and running:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fBFrom:\fP \fI^C\fP	(control-C to see logical adaptor assignments)
\fBhpib0 at sc7\fP
\fBscsi0 at sc14\fP
\fBFrom:\fP \fIct(0,7,0,0)\fP	(HP-IB tape, target 7, first tape file)
\fBTo:\fP \fIsd(0,0,0,2)\fP	(SCSI disk, target 0, third partition)
\fBCopy completed: 1728 records copied\fP
.TE
.DE
.LP
This copy will likely take 30 minutes or more.
.Sh 4 "Step 3: booting the root filesystem"
.PP
You now have a bootable root filesystem on the disk.
If you were previously running with two disks,
it would be best if you shut down the machine and turn off power on
the HP-UX drive.
It will be less confusing and it will eliminate any chance of accidentally
destroying the HP-UX disk.
If you used a cartridge tape for booting you should also unload the tape
at this point.
Whether you booted from tape or copied from disk you should now reboot
the machine and do another attended boot (see previous section),
this time with SYS_TBOOT.
Once loaded and running the boot program will display the CPU type and
prompt for a kernel file to boot:
.DS
.B
HP433 CPU
Boot
.R
\fB:\fP \fI/kernel\fP
.DE
.LP
After providing the kernel name, the machine will boot \*(4B with
output that looks about like this:
.DS

root device?
.R
.DE
.PP
The first three numbers are printed out by the bootstrap program and
are the sizes of different parts of the system (text, initialized and
uninitialized data).  The system also allocates several system data
structures after it starts running.  The sizes of these structures are
based on the amount of available memory and the maximum count of active
users expected, as declared in a system configuration description.  This
will be discussed later.
.PP
UNIX itself then runs for the first time and begins by printing out a banner
identifying the release and
version of the system that is in use and the date that it was compiled. 
.PP
Next the
.I mem
messages give the
amount of real (physical) memory and the
memory available to user programs
in bytes.
For example, if your machine has 16Mb bytes of memory, then
\fBxxx\fP will be 16777216.
.PP
The messages that come out next show what devices were found on
the current processor.  These messages are described in
.Xr autoconf (4).
The distributed system may not have
found all the communications devices you have
or all the mass storage peripherals you have, especially
if you have more than
two of anything.  You will correct this when you create
a description of your machine from which to configure a site-dependent
version of UNIX.
The messages printed at boot here contain much of the information
that will be used in creating the configuration.
In a correctly configured system most of the information
present in the configuration description
is printed out at boot time as the system verifies that each device
is present.
.PP
The \*(lqroot device?\*(rq prompt was printed by the system
to ask you for the name of the root filesystem to use.
This happens because the distribution system is a \fIgeneric\fP
system, i.e., it can be bootstrapped on a cpu with its root device
and paging area on any available disk drive.
You will most likely respond to the root device question with ``sd0''
if you are booting from a SCSI disk,
or with ``rd0'' if you are booting from an HP-IB disk.
This response shows that the disk it is running
on is drive 0 of type ``sd'' or ``rd'' respectively.
If you have other disks attached to the system,
it is possible that the drive you are using will not be configured
as logical drive 0.
Check the autoconfiguration messages printed out by the kernel to
make sure.
These messages will show the type of every logical drive
and their associated controller and slave addresses.
You will later build a system tailored to your configuration
that will not prompt you for a root device when it is bootstrapped.
.DS
\fBroot device?\fP \fI\*(Dk0\fP
\fBWARNING: preposterous time in filesystem \-\- CHECK AND RESET THE DATE!\fP
\fBerase ^?, kill ^U, intr ^C\fP
\fB#\fP
.DE
.PP
The \*(lqerase ...\*(rq message is part of the
.Pn /.profile
that was executed by the root shell when it started.  This message
tells you about the settings of the character erase,
line erase, and interrupt characters.
.PP
UNIX is now running,
and the \fIUNIX Programmer's Manual\fP applies.  The ``#'' is the prompt
from the Bourne shell, and lets you know that you are the super-user,
whose login name is \*(lqroot\*(rq.
.PP
At this point, the root filesystem is mounted read-only.
Before continuing the installation, the filesystem needs to be ``updated''
to allow writing and device special files for the following steps need
to be created.
This is done as follows:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fImount_mfs -s 1000 -T type /dev/null /tmp\fP	(create a writable filesystem)
(\fItype\fP is the disk type as determined from /etc/disktab)
\fB#\fP \fIcd /tmp\fP	(connect to that directory)
\fB#\fP \fImount \-uw /tmp/\*(Dk#a /\fP	(read-write mount root filesystem)
.TE
.DE
.Sh 4 "Step 4: (optional) restoring the root filesystem"
.PP
The root filesystem that you are currently running on is complete,
however it probably is not optimally laid out for the disk on
which you are running.
If you will be cloning copies of the system onto multiple disks for
other machines, you are advised to connect one of these disks to
this machine, and build and restore a properly laid out root filesystem
onto it.
If this is the only machine on which you will be running \*(4B
or peak performance is not an issue, you can skip this step and
proceed directly to step 5.
.PP
Connect a second disk to your machine.
If you bootstrapped using the two disk method, you can
overwrite your initial HP-UX disk, as it will no longer
be needed (assuming you have no plans to run HP-UX again).
.PP
To really create the root filesystem on drive 1
you should first label the disk as described in step 5 below.
Then run the following commands:
.DS
\fB#\fP\|\fInewfs /dev/r\*(Dk1a\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fImount /dev/\*(Dk1a /mnt\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fIcd /mnt\fP
\fB#\fP\|\fIdump 0f \- /dev/r\*(Dk0a | restore xf \-\fP
(Note: restore will ask if you want to ``set owner/mode for '.'''
to which you should reply ``yes''.)
.DE
.PP
When this completes,
you should then shut down the system, and boot on the disk that
you just created following the procedure in step (3) above.
.Sh 4 "Step 5: placing labels on the disks"
.PP
For each disk on the HP300, \*(4B places information about the geometry
of the drive and the partition layout at byte offset 1024.
This information is written with
.Xr disklabel (8).
.PP
The root image just loaded includes a ``generic'' label intended to allow
easy installation of the root and
.Pn /usr
and may not be suitable for the actual
disk on which it was installed.
In particular,
it may make your disk appear larger or smaller than its real size.
In the former case, you lose some capacity.
In the latter, some of the partitions may map non-existent sectors
leading to errors if those partitions are used.
It is also possible that the defined geometry will interact poorly with
the filesystem code resulting in reduced performance.
However, as long as you are willing to give up a little space,
not use certain partitions or suffer minor performance degradation,
you might want to avoid this step;
especially if you do not know how to use
.Xr ed (1).
.PP
If you choose to edit this label,
you can fill in correct geometry information from
.Pn /etc/disktab .
You may also want to rework the ``e'' and ``f'' partitions used for loading
.Pn /usr
and
.Pn /var .
You should not attempt to, and
.Xr disklabel
will not let you, modify the ``a'', ``b'' and ``d'' partitions.
To edit a label:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fIEDITOR=ed\fP
\fB#\fP \fIexport EDITOR\fP
\fB#\fP \fIdisklabel  -r  -e  /dev/r\fBXX#\fPd
.DE
where \fBXX\fP is the type and \fB#\fP is the logical drive number; e.g.
.Pn /dev/rsd0d
or
.Pn /dev/rrd0d .
Note the explicit use of the ``d'' partition.
This partition includes the bootblock as does ``c''
and using it allows you to change the size of ``c''.
.PP
If you wish to label any additional disks, run the following command for each:
.DS
\fB#\|\fP\fIdisklabel  -rw  \fBXX#  type\fP  \fI"optional_pack_name"\fP
.DE
where \fBXX#\fP is the same as in the previous command
and \fBtype\fP is the HP300 disk device name as listed in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
The optional information may contain any descriptive name for the
contents of a disk, and may be up to 16 characters long.  This procedure
will place the label on the disk using the information found in
.Pn /etc/disktab
for the disk type named.
If you have changed the disk partition sizes,
you may wish to add entries for the modified configuration in
.Pn /etc/disktab
before labeling the affected disks.
.PP
You have now completed the HP300 specific part of the installation.
Now proceed to the generic part of the installation
described starting in section 2.5 below.
Note that where the disk name ``sd'' is used throughout section 2.5,
you should substitute the name ``rd'' if you are running on an HP-IB disk.
Also, if you are loading on a single disk with the default disklabel,
.Pn /var
should be restored to the ``f'' partition and
.Pn /usr
to the ``e'' partition.
.Sh 2 "Booting the SPARC"

The hardware supported by \*(4B for the SPARC is as follows:

T}
.TE
.LP
Major items that are not supported include
anything VME-based,
the GX (cgsix) display,
the floppy disk, and SCSI tapes.
.Sh 3 "Limitations"
.LP
There are several important limitations on the \*(4B distribution
for the SPARC:
.IP 1)
You
.B must
have SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris to bring up \*(4B.
There is no SPARCstation bootstrap code in this distribution.  The
Sun-supplied boot loader will be used to boot \*(4B; you must copy
this from your SunOS distribution.  This imposes several
restrictions on the system, as detailed below.
.IP 2)
The \*(4B SPARC kernel does not remap SCSI IDs.  A SCSI disk at
target 0 will become ``sd0'', where in SunOS the same disk will
normally be called ``sd3''.  If your existing SunOS system is
diskful, it will be least painful to have SunOS running on the disk
on target 0 lun 0 and put \*(4B on the disk on target 3 lun 0.  Both
systems will then think they are running on ``sd0'', and you can
boot either system as needed simply by changing the EEPROM's boot
device.
.IP 3)
There is no SCSI tape driver.
You must have another system for tape reading and backups.
.IP 4)
Although the \*(4B SPARC kernel will handle existing SunOS shared
libraries, it does not use or create them itself, and therefore
requires much more disk space than SunOS does.
.IP 5)
It is currently difficult (though not completely impossible) to
run \*(4B diskless.  These instructions assume you will have a local
boot, swap, and root filesystem.
.IP 6)
When using a serial port rather than a graphics display as the console,
only port
.Pn ttya
can be used.
Attempts to use port
.Pn ttyb
will fail when the kernel tries
to print the boot up messages to the console.
.Sh 3 "The procedure"
.PP
You must have a spare disk on which to place \*(4B.
The steps involved in bootstrapping this tape are as follows:
.IP 1)
Bring up SunOS (preferably SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris 1.x, although
Solaris 2 may work \(em this is untested).
.IP 2)
Attach auxiliary SCSI disk(s).  Format and label using the
SunOS formatting and labeling programs as needed.
Note that the root filesystem currently requires at least 10 MB; 16 MB
or more is recommended.  The b partition will be used for swap;
this should be at least 32 MB.
.IP 3)
Use the SunOS
.Xr newfs
to build the root filesystem.  You may also
want to build other filesystems at the same time.  (By default, the
\*(4B
.Xr newfs
builds a filesystem that SunOS will not handle; if you
plan to switch OSes back and forth you may want to sacrifice the
performance gain from the new filesystem format for compatibility.)
You can build an old-format filesystem on \*(4B by giving the \-O
option to
.Xr newfs (8).
.Xr Fsck (8)
can convert old format filesystems to new format
filesystems, but not vice versa,
so you may want to initially build old format filesystems so that they
can be mounted under SunOS,
and then later convert them to new format filesystems when you are
satisfied that \*(4B is running properly.
In any case,
.B
you must build an old-style root filesystem
.R
so that the SunOS boot program will work.
.IP 4)
Mount the new root, then copy the SunOS
.Pn /boot
into place and use the SunOS ``installboot'' program
to enable disk-based booting.
Note that the filesystem must be mounted when you do the ``installboot'':
.DS

If you build backwards-compatible filesystems, either with the SunOS
newfs or with the \*(4B ``\-O'' option, you can mount these under
SunOS.  The SunOS fsck will, however, always think that these filesystems
are corrupted, as there are several new (previously unused)
superblock fields that are updated in \*(4B.  Running ``fsck \-b32''
and letting it ``fix'' the superblock will take care of this.

The SunOS compiler and linker should be able to produce SunOS binaries
under \*(4B, but this has not been tested.  If you plan to try it you

Diskless machines are not supported but booting kernels and bootstrapping

.Sh 3 "The procedure"
.PP
The first file on the distribution tape is a tar file that contains
four files.
The first step requires a running UNIX (or ULTRIX) system that can
be used to extract the tar archive from the first file on the tape.
The command:
.DS
.ft CW
tar xf /dev/rmt0
.DE
will extract the following four files:
.DS
A) root.image: \fIdd\fP image of the root filesystem
B) kernel.tape: \fIdd\fP image for creating boot tapes
C) kernel.net: file for booting over the network
D) root.dump: \fIdump\fP image of the root filesystem
.DE
There are three basic ways a system can be bootstrapped corresponding to the
first three files.
You may want to read the section on bootstrapping the HP300
since many of the steps are similar.
A spare, formatted SCSI disk is also useful.
.Sh 4 "Procedure A: copy root filesystem to disk"
.PP
This procedure is similar to the HP300.
If you have an extra disk, the easiest approach is to use \fIdd\fP\|(1)
under ULTRIX to copy the root filesystem image to the beginning
of the spare disk. 
The root filesystem image includes a disklabel and bootblock along with the
root filesystem.
An example command to copy the image to the beginning of a disk is:
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=root.image of=/dev/rz1c bs=\*(Bzb
.DE
The actual special file syntax will vary depending on unit numbers and
the version of ULTRIX that is running.
This system is now ready to boot. You can boot the kernel with one of the
following PROM commands. If you are booting on a 3100, the disk must be SCSI
id zero because of a bug.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:    boot \-f rz(0,0,0)kernel
DEC 5000:    boot 5/rz0/kernel
.DE
You can then proceed to section 2.5
to create reasonable disk partitions for your machine
and then install the rest of the system.
.Sh 4 "Procedure B: bootstrap from tape"
.PP
If you have only a single machine with a single disk,
you need to use the more difficult approach of booting a
kernel and mini-root from tape or the network, and using it to restore
the root filesystem.
.PP
First, you will need to create a boot tape. This can be done using
\fIdd\fP as in the following example.
.DS
.ft CW
dd if=kernel.tape of=/dev/nrmt0 bs=1b
dd if=root.dump of=/dev/nrmt0 bs=\*(Bzb
.DE
The actual special file syntax for the tape drive will vary depending on
unit numbers, tape device and the version of ULTRIX that is running.
.PP
The first file on the boot tape contains a boot header, kernel, and
mini-root filesystem that the PROM can copy into memory.
Installing from tape has only been tested
on a 3100 and a 5000/200 using a TK50 tape drive. Here are two example
PROM commands to boot from tape.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:    boot \-f tz(0,5,0) m    # 5 is the SCSI id of the TK50
DEC 5000:    boot 5/tz6 m           # 6 is the SCSI id of the TK50
.DE
The `m' argument tells the kernel to look for a root filesystem in memory.
Next you should proceed to section 2.4.3 to build a disk-based root filesystem.
.Sh 4 "Procedure C: bootstrap over the network"
.PP
You will need a host machine that is running the \fIbootp\fP server 
with the
.Pn kernel.net
file installed in the default directory defined by the
configuration file for
.Xr bootp .
Here are two example PROM commands to boot across the net:
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:	boot \-f tftp()kernel.net m
DEC 5000:	boot 6/tftp/kernel.net m
.DE
This command should load the kernel and mini-root into memory and
run the same as the tape install (procedure B).
The rest of the steps are the same except
you will need to start the network
(if you are unsure how to fill in the <name> fields below,
see sections 4.4 and 5).
Execute the following to start the networking:
.DS
.ft CW
# mount \-uw /
# echo 127.0.0.1 localhost >> /etc/hosts
# echo <your.host.inet.number> myname.my.domain myname >> /etc/hosts
# echo <friend.host.inet.number> myfriend.my.domain myfriend >> /etc/hosts
# ifconfig le0 inet myname
.DE
Next you should proceed to section 2.4.3 to build a disk-based root filesystem.
.Sh 3 "Label disk and create the root filesystem"
.LP
There are five steps to create a disk-based root filesystem.
.IP 1)
Label the disk.
.DS
.ft CW
# disklabel -W /dev/rrz?c		# This enables writing the label
# disklabel -w -r -B /dev/rrz?c $DISKTYPE
# newfs /dev/rrz?a
\&...
# fsck /dev/rrz?a
\&...
.DE
Supported disk types are listed in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
.IP 2)
Restore the root filesystem.
.DS
.ft CW
# mount \-uw /
# mount /dev/rz?a /a
# cd /a
.DE
.ti +0.4i
If you are restoring locally (procedure B), run:
.DS
.ft CW
# mt \-f /dev/nrmt0 rew
# restore \-xsf 2 /dev/rmt0
.DE
.ti +0.4i
If you are restoring across the net (procedure c), run:
.DS
.ft CW
# rrestore xf myfriend:/path/to/root.dump
.DE
.ti +0.4i
When the restore finishes, clean up with:
.DS
.ft CW
# cd /
# sync
# umount /a
# fsck /dev/rz?a
.DE
.IP 3)
Reset the system and initialize the PROM monitor to boot automatically.
.DS
.ft CW
DEC 3100:	setenv bootpath boot \-f rz(0,?,0)kernel
DEC 5000:	setenv bootpath 5/rz?/kernel -a
.DE
.IP 4)
After booting UNIX, you will need to create
.Pn /dev/mouse
to run X Window System as in the following example.
.DS
.ft CW
rm /dev/mouse
ln /dev/xx /dev/mouse
.DE
The 'xx' should be one of the following:
.DS
pm0	raw interface to PMAX graphics devices
cfb0	raw interface to TURBOchannel PMAG-BA color frame buffer
xcfb0	raw interface to maxine graphics devices
mfb0	raw interface to mono graphics devices
.DE
You can then proceed to section 2.5 to install the rest of the system.
Note that where the disk name ``sd'' is used throughout section 2.5,
you should substitute the name ``rz''.
.Sh 2 "Disk configuration"
.PP
All architectures now have a root filesystem up and running and
proceed from this point to layout filesystems to make use
of the available space and to balance disk load for better system
performance.
.Sh 3 "Disk naming and divisions"
.PP
Each physical disk drive can be divided into up to 8 partitions;
UNIX typically uses only 3 or 4 partitions.
For instance, the first partition, \*(Dk0a,
is used for a root filesystem, a backup thereof,
or a small filesystem like,
.Pn /var/tmp ;
the second partition, \*(Dk0b,
is used for paging and swapping; and
a third partition, typically \*(Dk0e,
holds a user filesystem.
.PP
The space available on a disk varies per device.
Each disk typically has a paging area of 30 to 100 megabytes
and a root filesystem of about 17 megabytes.
.\" XXX check
The distributed system binaries occupy about 150 (180 with X11R5) megabytes
.\" XXX check
while the major sources occupy another 250 (340 with X11R5) megabytes.
The
.Pn /var
filesystem as delivered on the tape is only 2Mb,
however it should have at least 50Mb allocated to it just for
normal system activity.
Usually it is allocated the last partition on the disk
so that it can provide as much space as possible to the
.Pn /var/users
filesystem.
See section 2.5.4 for further details on disk layouts.
.PP
Be aware that the disks have their sizes
measured in disk sectors (usually 512 bytes), while the UNIX filesystem
blocks are variable sized.
If
.Sm BLOCKSIZE=1k
is set in the user's environment, all user programs report
disk space in kilobytes, otherwise,
disk sizes are always reported in units of 512-byte sectors\**.
.FS
You can thank System V intransigence and POSIX duplicity for
requiring that 512-byte blocks be the units that programs report.
.FE
The
.Pn /etc/disktab
file used in labelling disks and making filesystems
specifies disk partition sizes in sectors.
.Sh 3 "Layout considerations"
.PP
There are several considerations in deciding how
to adjust the arrangement of things on your disks.
The most important is making sure that there is adequate space
for what is required; secondarily, throughput should be maximized.
Paging space is an important parameter.
The system, as distributed, sizes the configured
paging areas each time the system is booted.  Further,
multiple paging areas of different sizes may be interleaved.
.PP
Many common system programs (C, the editor, the assembler etc.)
create intermediate files in the
.Pn /tmp
directory, so the filesystem where this is stored also should be made
large enough to accommodate most high-water marks.
Typically,
.Pn /tmp
is constructed from a memory-based filesystem (see
.Xr mount_mfs (8)).
Programs that want their temporary files to persist
across system reboots (such as editors) should use
.Pn /var/tmp .
If you plan to use a disk-based
.Pn /tmp
filesystem to avoid loss across system reboots, it makes
sense to mount this in a ``root'' (i.e. first partition)
filesystem on another disk.
All the programs that create files in
.Pn /tmp
take care to delete them, but are not immune to rare events
and can leave dregs.
The directory should be examined every so often and the old
files deleted.
.PP
The efficiency with which UNIX is able to use the CPU
is often strongly affected by the configuration of disk controllers;
it is critical for good performance to balance disk load.
There are at least five components of the disk load that you can
divide between the available disks:
.IP 1)
The root filesystem.
.IP 2)
The
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /var/tmp
filesystems.
.IP 3)
The
.Pn /usr
filesystem.
.IP 4)
The user filesystems.
.IP 5)
The paging activity.
.LP
The following possibilities are ones we have used at times
when we had 2, 3 and 4 disks:
.TS
center doublebox;
l | c s s
l | lw(5) | lw(5) | lw(5).
	disks
what	2	3	4
_
root	0	0	0
var	1	2	3
usr	1	1	1
paging	0+1	0+2	0+2+3
users	0	0+2	0+2
archive	x	x	3
.TE
.PP
The most important things to consider are to
even out the disk load as much as possible, and to do this by
decoupling filesystems (on separate arms) between which heavy copying occurs.
Note that a long term average balanced load is not important; it is
much more important to have an instantaneously balanced
load when the system is busy.
.PP
Intelligent experimentation with a few filesystem arrangements can
pay off in much improved performance.  It is particularly easy to
move the root, the
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /var/tmp
filesystems and the paging areas.  Place the
user files and the
.Pn /usr
directory as space needs dictate and experiment
with the other, more easily moved filesystems.
.Sh 3 "Filesystem parameters"
.PP
Each filesystem is parameterized according to its block size,
fragment size, and the disk geometry characteristics of the
medium on which it resides.  Inaccurate specification of the disk
characteristics or haphazard choice of the filesystem parameters
can result in substantial throughput degradation or significant
waste of disk space.  As distributed,
filesystems are configured according to the following table.
.DS
.TS
center;
l l l.
Filesystem	Block size	Fragment size
_
root	8 kbytes	1 kbytes
usr	8 kbytes	1 kbytes
users	4 kbytes	512 bytes
.TE
.DE
.PP
The root filesystem block size is
made large to optimize bandwidth to the associated disk.
The large block size is important as many of the most
heavily used programs are demand paged out of the
.Pn /bin
directory.
The fragment size of 1 kbyte is a ``nominal'' value to use
with a filesystem.  With a 1 kbyte fragment size
disk space utilization is about the same
as with the earlier versions of the filesystem.
.PP
The filesystems for users have a 4 kbyte block
size with 512 byte fragment size.  These parameters
have been selected based on observations of the
performance of our user filesystems.  The 4 kbyte
block size provides adequate bandwidth while the
512 byte fragment size provides acceptable space compaction
and disk fragmentation.
.PP
Other parameters may be chosen in constructing filesystems,
but the factors involved in choosing a block
size and fragment size are many and interact in complex
ways.  Larger block sizes result in better
throughput to large files in the filesystem as
larger I/O requests will then be done by the
system.  However,
consideration must be given to the average file sizes
found in the filesystem and the performance of the
internal system buffer cache.   The system
currently provides space in the inode for
12 direct block pointers, 1 single indirect block
pointer, 1 double indirect block pointer,
and 1 triple indirect block pointer.
If a file uses only direct blocks, access time to
it will be optimized by maximizing the block size.
If a file spills over into an indirect block,
increasing the block size of the filesystem may
decrease the amount of space used
by eliminating the need to allocate an indirect block.
However, if the block size is increased and an indirect
block is still required, then more disk space will be
used by the file because indirect blocks are allocated
according to the block size of the filesystem.
.PP
In selecting a fragment size for a filesystem, at least
two considerations should be given.  The major performance
tradeoffs observed are between an 8 kbyte block filesystem
and a 4 kbyte block filesystem.  Because of implementation
constraints, the block size versus fragment size ratio can not
be greater than 8.  This means that an 8 kbyte filesystem
will always have a fragment size of at least 1 kbytes.  If
a filesystem is created with a 4 kbyte block size and a
1 kbyte fragment size, then upgraded to an 8 kbyte block size
and 1 kbyte fragment size, identical space compaction will be
observed.  However, if a filesystem has a 4 kbyte block size
and 512 byte fragment size, converting it to an 8K/1K
filesystem will result in 4-8% more space being
used.  This implies that 4 kbyte block filesystems that
might be upgraded to 8 kbyte blocks for higher performance should
use fragment sizes of at least 1 kbytes to minimize the amount
of work required in conversion.
.PP
A second, more important, consideration when selecting the
fragment size for a filesystem is the level of fragmentation
on the disk.  With an 8:1 fragment to block ratio, storage fragmentation
occurs much sooner, particularly with a busy filesystem running
near full capacity.  By comparison, the level of fragmentation in a
4:1 fragment to block ratio filesystem is one tenth as severe.  This
means that on filesystems where many files are created and
deleted, the 512 byte fragment size is more likely to result in apparent
space exhaustion because of fragmentation.  That is, when the filesystem
is nearly full, file expansion that requires locating a
contiguous area of disk space is more likely to fail on a 512
byte filesystem than on a 1 kbyte filesystem.  To minimize
fragmentation problems of this sort, a parameter in the super
block specifies a minimum acceptable free space threshold.  When
normal users (i.e. anyone but the super-user) attempt to allocate
disk space and the free space threshold is exceeded, the user is
returned an error as if the filesystem were really full.  This
parameter is nominally set to 5%; it may be changed by supplying
a parameter to
.Xr newfs (8),
or by updating the super block of an existing filesystem using
.Xr tunefs (8).
.PP
Finally, a third, less common consideration is the attributes of
the disk itself.  The fragment size should not be smaller than the
physical sector size of the disk.  As an example, the HP magneto-optical
disks have 1024 byte physical sectors.  Using a 512 byte fragment size
on such disks will work but is extremely inefficient.
.PP
Note that the above discussion considers block sizes of up to only 8k.
As of the 4.4 release, the maximum block size has been increased to 64k.
This allows an entirely new set of block/fragment combinations for which
there is little experience to date.
In general though, unless a filesystem is to be used
for a special purpose application (for example, storing
image processing data), we recommend using the
values supplied above.
Remember that the current
implementation limits the block size to at most 64 kbytes
and the ratio of block size versus fragment size must be 1, 2, 4, or 8.
.PP
The disk geometry information used by the filesystem
affects the block layout policies employed.  The file
.Pn /etc/disktab ,
as supplied, contains the data for most
all drives supported by the system.  Before constructing
a filesystem with
.Xr newfs (8)
you should label the disk (if it has not yet been labeled,
and the driver supports labels).
If labels cannot be used, you must instead
specify the type of disk on which the filesystem resides;
.Xr newfs
then reads
.Pn /etc/disktab
instead of the pack label.
This file also contains the default
filesystem partition
sizes, and default block and fragment sizes.  To
override any of the default values you can modify the file,
edit the disk label,
or use an option to
.Xr newfs .
.Sh 3 "Implementing a layout"
.PP
To put a chosen disk layout into effect, you should use the
.Xr newfs (8)
command to create each new filesystem.
Each filesystem must also be added to the file
.Pn /etc/fstab
so that it will be checked and mounted when the system is bootstrapped.
.PP
First we will consider a system with a single disk.
There is little real choice on how to do the layout;
the root filesystem goes in the ``a'' partition,
.Pn /usr
goes in the ``e'' partition, and
.Pn /var
fills out the remainder of the disk in the ``f'' partition.
This is the organization used if you loaded the disk-image root filesystem.
With the addition of a memory-based
.Pn /tmp
filesystem, its fstab entry would be as follows:
.TS
center;
lfC lfC l l n n.
/dev/\*(Dk0a	/	ufs	rw	1	1
/dev/\*(Dk0b	none	swap	sw	0	0
/dev/\*(Dk0b	/tmp	mfs	rw,-s=14000,-b=8192,-f=1024,-T=sd660	0	0
/dev/\*(Dk0e	/usr	ufs	ro	1	2
/dev/\*(Dk0f	/var	ufs	rw	1	2
.TE
.PP
If we had a second disk, we would split the load between the drives.
On the second disk, we place the
.Pn /usr
and
.Pn /var
filesystems in their usual \*(Dk1e and \*(Dk1f
partitions respectively.
The \*(Dk1b partition would be used as a second paging area,
and the \*(Dk1a partition left as a spare root filesystem
(alternatively \*(Dk1a could be used for
.Pn /var/tmp ).
The first disk still holds the
the root filesystem in \*(Dk0a, and the primary swap area in \*(Dk0b.
The \*(Dk0e partition is used to hold home directories in
.Pn /var/users .
The \*(Dk0f partition can be used for
.Pn /usr/src
or alternately the \*(Dk0e partition can be extended to cover
the rest of the disk with
.Xr disklabel (8).
As before, the
.Pn /tmp
directory is a memory-based filesystem.
Note that to interleave the paging between the two disks
you must build a system configuration that specifies:
.DS
config	kernel	root on \*(Dk0 swap on \*(Dk0 and \*(Dk1
.DE
The
.Pn /etc/fstab
file would then contain
.TS
center;
lfC lfC l l n n.
/dev/\*(Dk0a	/	ufs	rw	1	1
/dev/\*(Dk0b	none	swap	sw	0	0
/dev/\*(Dk1b	none	swap	sw	0	0
/dev/\*(Dk0b	/tmp	mfs	rw,-s=14000,-b=8192,-f=1024,-T=sd660	0	0
/dev/\*(Dk1e	/usr	ufs	ro	1	2
/dev/\*(Dk0f	/usr/src	ufs	rw	1	2
/dev/\*(Dk1f	/var	ufs	rw	1	2
/dev/\*(Dk0e	/var/users	ufs	rw	1	2
.TE
.PP
To make the
.Pn /var
filesystem we would do:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fIdisklabel -wr \*(Dk1 "disk type" "disk name"\fP
\fB#\fP \fInewfs \*(Dk1f\fP
(information about filesystem prints out)
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /var\fP
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk1f /var\fP
.DE
.Sh 2 "Installing the rest of the system"
.PP
At this point you should have your disks partitioned.
The next step is to extract the rest of the data from the tape.
At a minimum you need to set up the
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /usr
filesystems.
You may also want to extract some or all the program sources.
Since not all architectures support tape drives or don't support the
correct ones, you may need to extract the files indirectly using
.Xr rsh (1).
For example, for a directly connected tape drive you might do:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP
\fB#\fP \fItar xbpf \*(Bz /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP
.DE
The equivalent indirect procedure (where the tape drive is on machine ``foo'')
is:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fIrsh foo mt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP
\fB#\fP \fIrsh foo dd if=/dev/nr\*(Mt0 bs=\*(Bzb | tar xbpf \*(Bz -\fP
.DE
Obviously, the target machine must be connected to the local network
for this to work.
To do this:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fIecho  127.0.0.1  localhost >> /etc/hosts\fP
\fB#\fP \fIecho  \fPyour.host.inet.number  myname.my.domain  myname\fI >> /etc/hosts\fP
\fB#\fP \fIecho  \fPfriend.host.inet.number  myfriend.my.domain  myfriend\fI >> /etc/hosts\fP
\fB#\fP \fIifconfig  le0  inet  \fPmyname
.DE
where the ``host.inet.number'' fields are the IP addresses for your host and
the host with the tape drive
and the ``my.domain'' fields are the names of your machine and the tape-hosting
machine.
See sections 4.4 and 5 for more information on setting up the network.

install
.Pn /var
and
.Pn /usr :

If no disk label has been installed on the disk, the
.Xr newfs
command will require a third argument to specify the disk type,
using one of the names in
.Pn /etc/disktab .
If the tape had been rewound or positioned incorrectly before the
.Xr tar ,
to extract
.Pn /var
it may be repositioned by the following commands.

The data on the second and third tape files has now been extracted.
If you are using 6250bpi tapes, the first reel of the
distribution is no longer needed; you should now mount the second
reel instead.  The installation procedure continues from this
point on the 8mm tape.
The next step is to extract the sources.
As previously noted,
.Pn /usr/src
.\" XXX Check
requires about 250-340Mb of space.
Ideally sources should be in a separate filesystem;
if you plan to put them into your
.Pn /usr
filesystem, it will need at least 500Mb of space.
Assuming that you will be using a separate filesystem on \*(Dk0f for
.Pn /usr/src ,
you will start by creating and mounting it:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fInewfs \*(Dk0f\fP
(information about filesystem prints out)
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk0f /usr/src\fP
.DE
.LP
First you will extract the kernel source:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
(this should only be done on Exabyte distributions)
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf \*(Bz /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP	(extract the kernel sources)
(this takes about 15-30 minutes)
.TE

.LP
The next tar file contains the sources for the utilities.
It is extracted as follows:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf \*(Bz /dev/rmt12\fP 	(extract the utility source)
(this takes about 30-60 minutes)

If you are using 6250bpi tapes, the second reel of the
distribution is no longer needed; you should now mount the third

The next tar file contains the sources for the contributed software.
It is extracted as follows:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
(this should only be done on Exabyte distributions)
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf \*(Bz /dev/rmt12\fP 	(extract the contributed software source)
(this takes about 30-60 minutes)

If you received a distribution on 8mm Exabyte tape,
there is one additional tape file on the distribution tape
that has not been installed to this point; it contains the
sources for X11R5 in
.Xr tar (1)
format.  As distributed, X11R5 should be placed in
.Pn /usr/src/X11R5 .
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIcd /usr/src\fP
\fB#\fP \fImt -f /dev/nr\*(Mt0 fsf\fP	(space to end of previous tape file)
\fB#\fP \fItar xpbf \*(Bz /dev/nr\*(Mt0\fP	(extract the X11R5 source)
(this takes about 30-60 minutes)

Many of the X11 utilities search using the path
.Pn /usr/X11 ,
so be sure that you have a symbolic link that points at
the location of your X11 binaries (here, X11R5).
.PP
Having now completed the extraction of the sources, 
you may want to verify that your
.Pn /usr/src
filesystem is consistent.
To do so, you must unmount it, and run
.Xr fsck (8);
assuming that you used \*(Dk0f you would proceed as follows:
.DS
.TS
lw(2i) l.
\fB#\fP \fIcd /\fP	(change directory, back to the root)
\fB#\fP \fIumount /usr/src\fP	(unmount /usr/src)
\fB#\fP \fIfsck /dev/r\*(Dk0f\fP
.TE
.DE
The output from
.Xr fsck
should look something like:
.DS
.B
** /dev/r\*(Dk0f
** Last Mounted on /usr/src
** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes
** Phase 2 - Check Pathnames
** Phase 3 - Check Connectivity
** Phase 4 - Check Reference Counts
** Phase 5 - Check Cyl groups
23000 files, 261000 used, 39000 free (2200 frags, 4600 blocks)
.R
.DE
.PP
If there are inconsistencies in the filesystem, you may be prompted
to apply corrective action; see the
.Xr fsck (8)
or \fIFsck \(en The UNIX File System Check Program\fP (SMM:3) for more details.
.PP
To use the
.Pn /usr/src
filesystem, you should now remount it with:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk0f /usr/src\fP
.DE
or if you have made an entry for it in
.Pn /etc/fstab
you can remount it with:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImount /usr/src\fP
.DE
.Sh 2 "Additional conversion information"
.PP
After setting up the new \*(4B filesystems, you may restore the user
files that were saved on tape before beginning the conversion.
Note that the \*(4B
.Xr restore
program does its work on a mounted filesystem using normal system operations.
This means that filesystem dumps may be restored even
if the characteristics of the filesystem changed.
To restore a dump tape for, say, the
.Pn /a
filesystem something like the following would be used:
.DS
\fB#\fP \fImkdir /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fInewfs \*(Dk#p\fI
\fB#\fP \fImount /dev/\*(Dk#p /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fIcd /a\fP
\fB#\fP \fIrestore x\fP
.DE
.PP
If
.Xr tar
images were written instead of doing a dump, you should
be sure to use its `\-p' option when reading the files back.  No matter
how you restore a filesystem, be sure to unmount it and check its
integrity with
.Xr fsck (8)
when the job is complete.
