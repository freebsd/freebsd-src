APPENDIX A. CONFIGURATION FILE GRAMMAR
.sp
.R
.NL
.PP
The following grammar is a compressed form of the actual
\fIyacc\fP\|(1) grammar used by
.I config
to parse configuration files.
Terminal symbols are shown all in upper case, literals
are emboldened; optional clauses are enclosed in brackets, ``[''
and ``]'';  zero or more instantiations are denoted with ``*''.

Lexical Conventions
.LP
The terminal symbols are loosely defined as:
.IP ID
.br
One or more alphabetics, either upper or lower case, and underscore,
``_''.
.IP NUMBER
.br
Approximately the C language specification for an integer number.
That is, a leading ``0x'' indicates a hexadecimal value,
a leading ``0'' indicates an octal value, otherwise the number is
expected to be a decimal value.  Hexadecimal numbers may use either
upper or lower case alphabetics.
.IP FPNUMBER
.br
A floating point number without exponent.  That is a number of the
form ``nnn.ddd'', where the fractional component is optional.
.LP
In special instances a question mark, ``?'', can be substituted for
a ``NUMBER'' token.  This is used to effect wildcarding in device
interconnection specifications.
.LP
Comments in configuration files are indicated by a ``#'' character
at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is discarded.
.LP
A specification
is interpreted as a continuation of the previous line
if the first character of the line is tab.
