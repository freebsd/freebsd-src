The internal structure of the system is patterned
after the Xerox PUP architecture [Boggs79], while in certain
places the Internet
protocol family has had a great deal of influence in the design.
The use of software interrupts for process invocation
is based on similar facilities found in
the VMS operating system.
Many of the
ideas related to protocol modularity, memory management, and network
interfaces are based on Rob Gurwitz's TCP/IP implementation for the 
4.1BSD version of UNIX on the VAX [Gurwitz81].
Greg Chesson explained his use of trailer encapsulations in Datakit,
instigating their use in our system.
