This report describes the internal structure of the
networking facilities developed for the 4.4BSD version
of the UNIX* operating system
for the VAX\(dg.  These facilities

are based on several central abstractions which
structure the external (user) view of network communication
as well as the internal (system) implementation.
.PP
The report documents the internal structure of the networking system.
The ``Berkeley Software Architecture Manual, 4.4BSD Edition'' (PSD:5)
provides a description of the user interface to the networking facilities.
