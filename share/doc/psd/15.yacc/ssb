Appendix B: Yacc Input Syntax
.PP
This Appendix has a description of the Yacc input syntax, as a Yacc specification.
Context dependencies, etc., are not considered.
Ironically, the Yacc input specification language
is most naturally specified as an LR(2) grammar; the sticky
part comes when an identifier is seen in a rule, immediately
following an action.
If this identifier is followed by a colon, it is the start of the
next rule; otherwise
it is a continuation of the current rule, which just happens to have
an action embedded in it.
As implemented, the lexical analyzer looks
ahead after seeing an identifier, and
decide whether the next token (skipping blanks, newlines, comments, etc.)
is a colon.
If so, it returns the token C_IDENTIFIER.
Otherwise, it returns IDENTIFIER.
Literals (quoted strings) are also returned as IDENTIFIERS,
but never as part of C_IDENTIFIERs.
