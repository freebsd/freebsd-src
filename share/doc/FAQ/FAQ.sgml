      <p>
        Welcome to the FreeBSD 2.X FAQ !  

      <sect1>
        <heading>What is the purpose of this FAQ?</heading>
        <p>
          As is usual with Usenet FAQs, this document aims to cover the most
          frequently asked questions concerning the FreeBSD operating system
          (and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended to reduce
          bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked over and over
          again, FAQs have become recognised as valuable information resources.

          Every effort has been made to make this FAQ as informative as 
          possible; if you have any suggestions as to how it may be improved,
          please feel free to mail them to the 

          <url url="mailto:questions@FreeBSD.ORG" name="FreeBSD-questions
          Mailing list"> or to <url url="mailto:faq@FreeBSD.ORG"

	<heading>What is FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          Briefly, FreeBSD 2.X is a UN*X type operating system based on
          U.C. Berkeley's 4.4BSD-lite release for the i386 platform.  It is
          also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
          Net/2 to the i386, known as 386BSD.  However, a very considerable
          number of bug fixes and enhancements have been made to the original
          code base, resulting in an extremely powerful and highly sophisticated
          operating system.

          FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers,
          computer professionals, students and home users all over the world
          in their work, education and recreation.  See some of them in the 
          <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/gallery.html" name="FreeBSD Gallery."> 

          For a more detailed description of FreeBSD, see the Introduction to
          <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="FreeBSD Handbook.">

      <sect1>
        <heading>What are the goals of FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may
          be used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of us
          have a significant investment in the code (and project) and would
          certainly not mind a little financial renumeration now and then,
          but we're definitely not prepared to insist on it.  We believe
          that our first and foremost "mission" is to provide code to any
          and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
          the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
          This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
          Software and one that we enthusiastically support.

          That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU Public License
          (GPL) or GNU Library Public License (GLPL) comes with slightly more
          strings attached, though at least on the side of enforced
          access rather than the usual opposite.  Due to the additional
          complexities that can evolve in the commercial use of GPL software,
          we do, however, endeavor to replace such software with submissions
          under the more relaxed BSD copyright whenever possible.

      <sect1>
       <heading>Why is it called FreeBSD?</heading>
       <p>
         <itemize>
	   <item>It may be used free of charge, even by commercial users.
	   <item>Full source for the operating system is freely available, and
		 the minimum possible restrictions have been placed upon its
		 use, distribution and incorporation into other work (commercial
		 or non-commercial).
	   <item>Anyone who has an improvement and/or bug fix is free to submit
		 their code and have it added to the source tree (subject to
                 one or two obvious provisos).
	 </itemize>

       For those of our readers whose first language is not English, it may be
       worth pointing out that the word ``free'' is being used in two ways here,
       one meaning ``at no cost'', the other meaning ``you can do whatever you
       like''.  Apart from one or two things you <tt /cannot/ do with the
       FreeBSD code, for example pretending you wrote it, you really can do
       whatever you like with it.

      <sect1>
	<heading>What is the latest version of FreeBSD?</heading>
	<p>
	  Version 2.1.5 is the latest version; it was released in mid-July, 1996.

      <sect1>
	<heading>What is FreeBSD-current?</heading>
	<p>
	  FreeBSD-current is the development version of the operating system,
	  which will in due course become version 2.2.  As such, it is really
	  only of interest to developers working on the system.  See the section
	  ``Staying current with FreeBSD'' in the

	  <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="FreeBSD Handbook">

      <sect1>
        <heading> What are ``snapshots''?<label id="snapshots"></heading>
        <p>
          Every now and again, a ``snapshot'' is taken of the development
          code, which is prepared as if it were an official release; recently,
          CDROMs have even been cut from the snapshots. The intention is to:-

          <itemize>
            <item>Test the latest version of the installation routine.
            <item>Allow people who would like to run -current, but who don't 
                  have the time and/or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day 
                  basis, an easy way to do so.
            <item>
                  Preserve a fixed reference point as to when the code was 
                  reasonably reliable.

            <item>Ensure that a new feature in need of testing has the 
                  greatest possible number of potential testers.
          </itemize>

          The astute reader will have noticed that the last two items are 
          somewhat mutually incompatible. As snapshots are based on 
          development code, no claim is made that a snapshot is regarded as 
          being of ``production quality'' - for that, you will have to use 
          official releases.

      <sect1>
         <heading> What about FreeBSD-stable?</heading>
         <p>
           Back when FreeBSD 2.0.5 was released, we branched FreeBSD 
           development into two parts. One branch was named -stable, with the 
           intention that only well-tested bug fixes and small incremental 
           enhancements would be made to it (for Internet Service Providers 
           and other commercial enterprises for whom sudden shifts or 
           experimental features are quite undesirable).  The other branch was
           2.2-current, which essentially has been one unbroken line leading
           towards 2.2-RELEASE since 2.0 was released. If a little ASCII art
           would help, this is how it looks:
<verb>
                       2.0
                        |
                        |
                        |
                      2.0.5 ---> 2.1 ---> 2.1.5 ---> 2.1.6 ---* [-stable ends]
                        |                         (Dec 1996)
                        |
     [2.2-current]   2.2-SNAPs
                        |
                        |
                    2.2-RELEASE (scheduled for Q1 1997)
                        |
                        |
                        .
                       \|/
                        +

                [future releases]
</verb>
         <p>
           The -current branch is slowly progressing towards 2.2 and beyond, 
           whereas the -stable branch will effectively end with 2.1.6.

      <sect1> 
        <heading>Why is the -stable branch ending with 2.1.6? </heading>
        <p>
          While we'd certainly like to be able to continue both branches of
          development, we've found that the version control tools available to 
          us are not particularly well-suited for this; in fact, they quickly 
          result in a maintenance nightmare for any branch which lives much 
          beyond 2-3 months. The -stable branch has, by contrast, lasted for 
          well over a year and what little sanity the FreeBSD developers have 
          left would be in serious jeopardy if we continued in this way.  
          Perhaps in the future we'll figure out another model which gives 
          everyone what they want, and we are working on such a model, but in 
          the meantime it's probably best to think of -stable coming to an end 
          with 2.1.6-RELEASE.

      <sect1>
        <heading> When are FreeBSD releases made?</heading>
        <p>
          As a general principle, the FreeBSD core team only release a new 
          version of FreeBSD when they believe that there are sufficient new 
          features and/or bug fixes to justify one, and are satisfied that the 
          changes made have settled down sufficiently to avoid compromising the
          stability of the release. Many users regard this caution as one of 
          the best things about FreeBSD, although it can be a little 
          frustrating when waiting for all the latest goodies to become 
          available...
        <p>
          Releases are made about every 6 months on average.

      <sect1>
        <heading> Is FreeBSD only available for PCs?</heading>
        <p>
          At present, yes. If your machine has a different architecture, we 
         suggest you look at
         
         <htmlurl url="http://www.netbsd.org/" name="NetBSD">

         or 

         <htmlurl url="http://www.openbsd.org/" name="OpenBSD">.

       <sect1>
         <heading> Who is responsible for FreeBSD?</heading>
         <p>
           The key decisions concerning the FreeBSD project, such as the 
           overall direction of the project and who is allowed to add code to 
           the source tree, are made by a ``core team'' consisting of 14 
           people. There is a much larger group, of about 50 people, who can 
           make changes to the source tree.
          <p>
            However, most non-trivial changes are discussed in advance in the 
            mailing lists, and there are no restrictions on who may take part 
            in the discussion.

      <sect1>

	<heading>How can I get on the mailing lists?</heading>
        <p>
          Example:
        <p>
          To subscribe to the <tt/questions/ list, you'll to send a message
          containing the following command in the <bf/body/ of the message
          (the subject will be ignored):
          <verb>
            subscribe questions john.smith@foo.bar (John Smith)
          </verb>
        <p>
          Unsubscribing is just as easy:-
	  <verb>
	    unsubscribe questions john.smith@foo.bar (John Smith)
	  </verb>
	  Just remember to send your request
          to 
          <url url="mailto:Majordomo@FreeBSD.ORG" name="the mail administrator"> 
          and <bf/not/ to the list itself! (The last thing the subscribed
          users want to see is administrative requests...)

      <sect1>
	<heading>What FreeBSD news groups are available?</heading>
        <p>
          There are two newsgroups currently dedicated to FreeBSD:
          <descrip>
            <tag/comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.announce/ For announcements
            <tag/comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc/ General discussion
          </descrip>
          The following newsgroups may also be of interest to
          general BSD enthusiasts:
          <descrip>
            <tag><tt/comp.unix.bsd/</tag>
              General BSD topics
          </descrip>
	  <tt>/usr/ports/news</tt> contains a number of ready-ported
          programs not only for reading Usenet News, but even setting
          up and running your own News server! You'll find trn, TIN,
          Cnews, INN and others there.

          For French-speaking people, the <tt/fr.comp.os.bsd/ group is for
          you; there is also a Japanese newsgroup, <tt /fj.os.bsd.freebsd/.
          If you do not receive these newsgroups, ask your system
          administrator to get them for you.
      </sect1>
      
      <sect1>
        <heading>Is there anything about FreeBSD on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) ?</heading>
        <p>
          There are two channels about FreeBSD on IRC:
          <enum>
            <item>The main channel is &num;FreeBSD on the EFNET. You can
                  use your regular IRC server for it.
            <item>You can point your IRC client to <tt/irc.FreeBSD.org/
                  This server is on BSDnet and hosts &num;FreeBSD. This
                  is not the same channel.
          </enum>
      <sect1>
        <heading>Books on FreeBSD</heading>
        <p> 
          Greg Lehey's book ``Installing and Running FreeBSD'' is available
          from Walnut Creek and ships with the 2.1.5 CDROM.  There is also
          a larger book entitled ``The Complete FreeBSD'', which comes with
          additional printed manpages amd includes the 2.1.5 CDROM set.  It
          should be available in most good bookshops now.
 
          There is a FreeBSD Documentation Project which you may contact (or
          even better, join) on the <tt>doc</tt> mailing list:
          <url url="mailto:doc@FreeBSD.ORG" name="&lt;doc@FreeBSD.ORG&gt;">.

          A FreeBSD ``handbook'' is being created, and can be found as:
 
          <url url="../handbook/handbook.html" name="the FreeBSD Handbook"> 
          Note that this is a work in progress, and so parts may be incomplete.

          However, as FreeBSD 2.X is based upon Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite, most
          of the 4.4BSD manuals are applicable to FreeBSD 2.X.  O'Reilly
          and Associates publishes these manuals:

        <heading>Which file do I download to get FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          I'll answer that in a minute, but first a few words of explanation
          might be in order.  FreeBSD is not an application that you can
          run from inside an existing DOS/Windows setup, it is an operating
          system in its own right (in the same way as Windows NT or OS/2).

          To install it involves making a ``primary partition'' for it on
          the hard disk and arranging for it to be booted at system startup.
          (FreeBSD gives you the option of installing a boot manager, so you
          will be able to choose which operating system to use every time the
          system starts up.  Alternatively, you can use the boot managers
          provided with oher operating systems, such as OS/2 or Linux).

          Obviously, this is not as simple as using an operating system that
          those nice people you bought your PC from pre-installed for you,
          but it's not too difficult provided you read (and, if possible, print
          out) all the instructions before starting.  It may be a lot to
          read, but it's very complete.  You should also make full note of the
          exhortations to back everything up first and the legal disclaimers.
          These are not there for amusement value - we mean it!  However,
          most people find the installation goes fairly smoothly.

          If you are able to be connected to the Internet for the duration
          of the FreeBSD installation (lucky you!), the simplest way to
          install FreeBSD is to download 
          <url 
          url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.5-RELEASE/floppies/boot.flp"
          name="the boot image,"> make a boot floppy, boot with it and watch it 
          pull down all the necessary files. Depending on connection speed and 
          how much of FreeBSD you wish to install, this could take several hours
          (even the minimal installation requires downloading about 15MB of 
          compressed files).

          For people who do not have good Internet connectivity, the best
          way to install FreeBSD is to buy a CDROM (see <ref id="where-get"
          name="Where to get FreeBSD"> for details).  Unfortunately, this
          is problematic for some people, as the support for IDE CDROMs in
          FreeBSD is still in alpha (not because of some violent antipathy
          towards IDE CDROMs, but simply due to a lack of people with the
          necessary combination of skill, inclination and time).  If you have
          an IDE CDROM, you should use the 
          <url 
          url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.5-RELEASE/floppies/atapi.flp"
          name="special boot floppy for IDE CDROMs.">  If that doesn't work
          for you, the alternative is to use one of the methods in the next
          paragraph.

          Finally, if you already have a copy of the necessary files, FreeBSD 
          can be installed from floppy disks, a DOS hard disk partition or
          tape or over a network via SLIP, PPP, NFS, PLIP and Ethernet.

	<heading>What do I need to run FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          you'll need a 386 or better PC, with 4 MB or more of RAM and at
          least 60 MB of hard disk space. It can run with a low end MDA
          card but to run X11R6, a VGA or better video card is needed.

          See the section on <ref id="hardware" name="Hardware compatibility">

      <sect1>
	<heading>I have only 4 MB of RAM. Can I install FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          The latest version of FreeBSD (2.1.5) will install on a 4MB
          system, provided you use the <url 
          url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.5-RELEASE/floppies/boot4.flp"
          name="special boot floppy for 4MB systems.">

          FreeBSD 2.1.5 does not install in 4 MB.  To be exact: it does
          not install with 640 kB base + 3 MB extended memory.  If your
          motherboard can remap some of the ``lost'' memory out of the
          640kB to 1MB region, then you may still be able to get FreeBSD
          2.1.5 up.

          Try to go into your BIOS setup and look for a ``remap'' option.
          Enable it.  You may also have to disable ROM shadowing.

          It may be easier to get 4 more MB just for the install. Build a
          custom kernel with only the options you need and then get the 4
          MB out again.

          You may also install 2.0.5 and then upgrade your system to 2.1.5
          with the ``upgrade'' option of the 2.1.5 installation program.

          After the installation, if you build a custom kernel, it will run
          in 4 MB. Someone has even succeeded in booting with 2 MB (the
          system was almost unusable though :-))

      <sect1>
	<heading>Can Windows 95 co-exist with FreeBSD?</heading>

        <p>
          Install Windows 95 first, after that FreeBSD. FreeBSD's boot
          manager will then manage to boot Win95 and FreeBSD.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Can I install on an IDE disk with bad blocks?</heading>
        <p>
          FreeBSD's bad block (the ``<tt/bad144/'' command) handling is
          still not 100&percnt; (to put it charitably) and it must
          unfortunately be said that if you've got an IDE or ESDI drive
          with lots of bad blocks, then FreeBSD is probably not for you!
          That said, it does work on thousands of IDE based systems, so
          you'd do well to try it first before simply giving up.

      <sect1>
	<heading>Strange things happen when I boot the install floppy!</heading>
	<p>
	  If you're seeing things like the machine grinding to a halt or
	  spontaneously rebooting when you try to boot the install floppy,
	  here are three questions to ask yourself:-
	  <enum>
	    <item>Did you use a new, freshly-formatted, error-free floppy
		  (preferably a brand-new one straight out of the box, as
		  opposed to the magazine coverdisk that's been lying under
		  the bed for the last three years)?
	    <item>Did you download the floppy image in binary (or image) mode?
		  (don't be embarrassed, even the best of us have made this 
		  mistake at least once when FTP'ing things!)
            <item>If you're using one of these new-fangled operating systems
		  like Windows95 or Windows NT, did you shut it down and restart
		  the system in plain, honest DOS?  It seems these OS's can
		  interfere with programs that write directly to hardware, as
		  the disk creation program does; even running it inside a DOS
		  shell in the GUI can cause this problem.
          </enum>

          There have also been reports of Netscape causing problems when 
          downloading the boot floppy, so it's probably best to use a different
          FTP client if you can.

      <sect1>
	<heading>Help! I can't install from tape!</heading>
        <p> 
          If you are installing 2.1.5R from tape, you  must create the tape
          using a  tar blocksize  of  10  (5120  bytes).  The  default  tar
          blocksize is 20  (10240   bytes), and  tapes  created using  this
          default size cannot be used to  install 2.1.5R; with these tapes,
          you will get an error that complains about  the record size being
          too big.

        <heading>Which geometry should I use for a disk drive?<label id="geometry"></heading>
        <p>
          (By the "geometry" of a disk, we mean the number of cylinders,
          heads and sectors/track on a disk - I'll refer to this as
          C/H/S for convenience.  This is how the PC's BIOS works out
          which area on a disk to read/write from).
          
          This seems to cause a lot of confusion for some reason.  First
          of all, the <tt /physical/ geometry of a SCSI drive is totally
          irrelevant, as FreeBSD works in term of disk blocks.  In fact, there
          is no such thing as "the" physical geometry, as the sector density
          varies across the disk - what manufacturers claim is the "true"
          physical geometry is usually the geometry that they've worked out
          results in the least wasted space.  For IDE disks, FreeBSD does
          work in terms of C/H/S, but all modern drives will convert this
          into block references internally as well.

          All that matters is the <tt /logical/ geometry - the answer that the 
          BIOS gets when it asks "what is your geometry" and then uses to access
          the disk.  As FreeBSD uses the BIOS when booting, it's very important 
          to get this right.  In particular, if you have more than one operating
          system on a disk, they must all agree on the geometry, otherwise you 
          will have serious problems booting!

          For SCSI disks, the geometry to use depends on whether extended
          translation support is turned on in your controller (this is
          often referred to as "support for DOS disks &gt;1GB" or something 
          similar).  If it's turned off, then use N cylinders, 64 heads
          and 32 sectors/track, where 'N' is the capacity of the disk in
          MB.  For example, a 2GB disk should pretend to have 2048 cylinders,
          64 heads and 32 sectors/track.

          If it <tt /is/ turned on (it's often supplied this way to get around
          certain limitations in MSDOS) and the disk capacity is more than 1GB,
          use M cylinders, 63 heads (*not* 64), and 255 sectors per track, where
          'M' is the disk capacity in MB divided by 7.844238 (!).  So our
          example 2GB drive would have 261 cylinders, 63 heads and 32 sectors
          per track.

          If you are not sure about this, or FreeBSD fails to detect the
          geometry correctly during installation, the simplest way around
          this is usually to create a small DOS partition on the disk.  The
          correct geometry should then be detected (and you can always remove
          the DOS partition in the partition editor if you don't want to keep
          it).

          Alternatively, there is a freely available utility distributed with 
          FreeBSD called ``<tt/pfdisk.exe/'' (located in the <tt>tools</tt>
          subdirectory on the FreeBSD CDROM or on the various FreeBSD
          ftp sites) which can be used to work out what geometry the other
          operating systems on the disk are using.  You can then enter this
          geometry in the partition editor.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Any restrictions on how I divide the disk up?</heading>

        <p>
          Yes. You must make sure that your root partition is below 1024 
          cylinders so the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.  (Note that this 
          is a limitation in the PC's BIOS, not FreeBSD).  

          For a SCSI drive, this will normally imply that the root partition 
          will be in the first 1024MB (or in the first 4096MB if extended
          translation is turned on - see previous question).  For IDE, the 
          corresponding figure is 504MB.

      <sect1>
	<heading>When I boot FreeBSD I get ``Missing Operating System''.</heading>
        <p>
          This is classically a case of FreeBSD and DOS or some other OS 
          conflicting over their ideas of disk <ref id="geometry" 
          name="geometry.">  You will have to reinstall FreeBSD, but obeying the
          instructions given above will almost always get you going.

      <sect1>
	<heading>I can't get past the boot manager's `F?' prompt.</heading>

        <p>
          This is another symptom of the problem described in the preceding
          question.  Your BIOS geometry and FreeBSD geometry settings do
          not agree!  If your controller or BIOS supports cylinder
          translation (often marked as ``&gt;1GB drive support''), try
          toggling its setting and reinstalling FreeBSD.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How can I add my new hard disk to my FreeBSD system?</heading>
        <p>
          The easiest way to do this is from the installation program. You
          can start the installation program by running
          <tt>/stand/sysinstall</tt> as root.
        <p>
          Alternatively, if you still have the install floppy, you can just
          reboot from that.
        <p>
          Select the ``Express Install'' option, which will put you
          straight into the partition editor, and create a single slice on the
          disk with the (A)ll option (make sure you are editing the right
          disk!). Say ``No'' when asked if you want to remain compatible with
          other operating systems, and ``Yes'' when asked if you know what
          you're doing.  Then write it out with the (W)rite command and
          press (Q)uit to transfer to the disklabel editor. 

	<p>
          Divide up your FreeBSD slice according to taste and press `w' when
          you are happy with the way it looks. Again, say ``Yes'' when asked
          for confirmation, and press `q' to quit.

  c:  2459520        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 609)
  e:  2459520        0    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 609)
</verb>

          Make sure that the size is correct, in this case, 2459520
          sectors/unit x 512 bytes/sector / 2**20 (1 Megabyte) = 1200
          Megabytes. The rest of the stuff (b/s, t/c, s/c, interleave, etc.)
          should get suitable defaults from <tt /disklabel/, but see 
          <ref id="ESDI" name="this note"> for older disks. 'fsize' is the 
          <ref id="fsize" name="Fragment size"> for the filesystem, 
          and 'bsize' is the <ref id="bsize" name="Block size">. 'c' is 
          the partition covering the entire slice (or entire disk for a 
          non-sliced disk), and must remain as it is. <em>It should not be
          used for a filesystem</em>. The 'c' partition is magic in that it
          is faked by the kernel even if no disklabel exists.
        <p>
          In the trivial case, where you want a single filesystem spanning
          the whole slice, the entry for 'e' has to be corrected. Setting fsize
          to 1024 and bsize to 8192 (8 fragments/block), which are reasonable
          values for a filesystem, the correct entry for 'e' would be:-

<verb>
  e:  2459520        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192
</verb>

        <p>
          Now, the (slightly) harder case, where we want 2 partitions for 2
          filesystems. Following the <ref id="fsname" name="BSD naming
          conventions">, the partitions will be <tt /wd0s2e/ &amp;
          <tt /wd0s2f/. Suppose we split up the 1200 MB into 300 MB for
          'e' and the remaining 900 MB for 'f'. The partition entries would
          be:-

<verb>
8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  c:  2459520        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 609)
  e:   614400        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192
  f:  1843200   614400    4.2BSD     1024  8192

        <p>
          You're done! Time to initialise the filesystems with something

            newfs -d0 /dev/rwd0s2f
        </verb>

          Depending on the disk name and slice number, it might be
          required that you run the script <tt>/dev/MAKEDEV</tt>
          before in order to create the desired device nodes.

          And mount your new filesystems (See <tt /mount(8)/):-

            mount /dev/wd0s2e /mnt/foo
            mount /dev/wd0s2f /mnt/bar

	<heading>I have bad blocks on my hard drive!</heading>
        <p>
          With SCSI drives, the drive should be capable of re-mapping
          these automatically.  However, many drives are shipped with
          this feature disabled, for some mysterious reason...

          To enable this, you'll need to edit the first device page mode, 
          which can be done on FreeBSD by giving the command (as root)

<verb>
 scsi -f /dev/rsd0c -m 1 -e -P 3
</verb>

          and changing the values of AWRE and ARRE from 0 to 1:-
<verb>
 AWRE (Auto Write Reallocation Enbld):  1
 ARRE (Auto Read Reallocation Enbld):  1
</verb>

          For other drive types, you are dependent on support from the
          operating system.  Unfortunately, the ``bad144'' command that
	  FreeBSD supplies for this purpose needs a considerable amount
	  of work done on it...

          IDE drives are <em/supposed/ to come with built-in bad-block
          remapping; if you have documentation for your drive, you may want
          to see if this feature has been disabled on your drive.  However,
          ESDI, RLL, and ST-506 drives normally do not do this.

      <sect1>
	<heading>I have 32MB of RAM. Will this cause any problems?<label id="bigram"></heading>

        <p>
          No.  FreeBSD 2.X comes with bounce buffers which allows your bus
          mastering controller access to greater than 16MB. (Note that this
          should only be required if you are using ISA devices, although
          one or two broken EISA and VLB devices may need it as well).

      <sect1>
	<heading>I keep seeing messages like ``<tt/ed1: timeout/''.</heading>
        <p>
          This is usually caused by an interrupt conflict (e.g., two boards
          using the same IRQ).  FreeBSD prior to 2.0.5R used to be tolerant
          of this, and  the  network driver  would  still function  in  the
          presence  of IRQ conflicts.  However, with  2.0.5R and later, IRQ
          conflicts are no  longer tolerated.  Boot with the -c option and
          change the ed0/de0/... entry to match your board.
 
      <sect1>
	<heading>Do I need to install the complete sources?</heading>

        <p> In general, no.  However, we would strongly recommend that you
          install, at a minimum, the ``<tt/base/'' source kit, which
          includes several of the files mentioned here, and the
          ``<tt/sys/'' (kernel) source kit, which includes sources for the
          kernel.  There is nothing in the system which requires the
          presence of the sources to operate, however, except for the
          kernel-configuration program <tt/config(8)/.  With the exception
          of the kernel sources, our build structure is set up so that you
          can read-only mount the sources from elsewhere via NFS and still
          be able to make new binaries.  (Because of the kernel-source
          restriction, we recommend that you not mount this on
          <tt>/usr/src</tt> directly, but rather in some other location
          with appropriate symbolic links to duplicate the top-level
          structure of the source tree.)

          Having the sources on-line and knowing how to build a system with
          them will make it much easier for you to upgrade to future
          releases of FreeBSD.

	<heading>I live outside the US. Can I use DES encryption?</heading>

        <p> If it is not absolutely imperative that you use DES style
          encryption, you can use FreeBSD's default encryption for even
          <bf/better/ security, and with no export restrictions.  FreeBSD
          2.0's password default scrambler is now <bf/MD5/-based, and is
          more CPU-intensive to crack with an automated password cracker
          than DES.

          Since the DES encryption algorithm cannot legally be exported
          from the US, non-US users should not download this software (as
          part of the <tt/secrdist/ from US FTP sites.

          There is however a replacement libcrypt available, based on
          sources written in Australia by David Burren.  This code is now
          available on some non-US FreeBSD mirror sites.  Sources for the
          unencumbered libcrypt, and binaries of the programs which use it,
          can be obtained from the following FTP sites:

          <descrip>
            <tag/South Africa/
              <tt>ftp://ftp.internat.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD</tt><newline>

            <tag/Finland/
              <tt>ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/unix/FreeBSD/eurocrypt</tt>
          </descrip>

          The non-US <tt/securedist/ can be used as a direct replacement
          for the encumbered US <tt/securedist/.  This <tt/securedist/
          package is installed the same way as the US package (see
          installation notes for details).  If you are going to install DES
          encryption, you should do so as soon as possible, before
          installing other software.

          Non-US users should please not download any encryption software
          from the USA.  This can get the maintainers of the sites from
          which the software is downloaded into severe legal difficulties.

          A non-US distribution of Kerberos is also being developed, and
          current versions can generally be obtained by anonymous FTP from
          <tt>braae.ru.ac.za</tt>.

          There is a mailing list for the discussion of non-US encryption
          software.  For more information, send an email message with a
          single line saying ``<tt/help/'' in the body of your message to

          configuration file and recompile:
<verb>
device    psm0    at isa? port "IO_KBD" conflicts tty irq 12 vector psmintr
# Options for psm:
options   PSM_NO_RESET       #don't reset mouse hardware (some laptops)
</verb>

        <p>
	  See the <url url="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html"
	  name="Handbook entry on configuring the kernel">
	  if you've no experience with building kernels.

	  Once you have a kernel detecting psm0 correctly at boot time,
	  make sure that an entry for psm0 exists in /dev.  You can do this
	  by typing:
<verb>
	cd /dev; sh MAKEDEV psm0
</verb>
	  When logged in as root.
	<p>
	  Note: Some PS/2 mouse controllers have a problem
	  where the presence of the psm0 driver will cause the keyboard to
	  lock up (which is why this driver is not present by default in the
	  GENERIC kernel).  This can sometimes be fixed by bouncing the
	  NumLock key during the boot process. Also suggest going into CMOS
	  setup and toggling any value for Numlock On/Off at boot time. The
	  real fix is, of course, to merge the PS/2 mouse driver with syscons.
	  Any volunteers? :)

        <heading>I don't have a math co-processor.</heading>

        <p>
          <tt /Note/ This will only affect 386/486SX/486SLC owners - other
          machines will have one built into the CPU.
        <p>
          In general this will not cause any problems, but there are 
          circumstances where you will take a hit, either in performance or 
          accuracy of the math emulation code (see the section <ref id="emul" 
          name="on FP emulation">).  In particular, drawing arcs in X will be 
          VERY slow.  It is highly recommended that you buy a math 
          co-processor; it's well worth it.

          <bf/NOTE/ Some math co-processors are better than others.  It pains
          us to say it, but nobody ever got fired for buying Intel.  Unless
          you're sure it works with FreeBSD, beware of clones.

        <heading>FreeBSD does not recognise my Bustek 742a EISA SCSI.</heading>
        <p>
          This info is specific to the 742a but may also cover other
          Buslogic cards.  (Bustek = Buslogic)

          There are 2 general ``versions'' of the 742a card.  They are
          hardware revisions A-G, and revisions H - onwards.  The revision
          letter is located after the Assembly number on the edge of the
          card.  The 742a has 2 ROM chips on it, one is the BIOS chip and
          the other is the Firmware chip.  FreeBSD doesn't care what
          version of BIOS chip you have but it does care about what version
          of firmware chip.  Buslogic will send upgrade ROMS out if you
          call their tech support dept.  The BIOS and Firmware chips are
          shipped as a matched pair.  You must have the most current
          Firmware ROM in your adapter card for your hardware revision.

          The REV A-G cards can only accept BIOS/Firmware sets up to
          2.41/2.21.  The REV H- up cards can accept the most current
          BIOS/Firmware sets of 4.70/3.37. The difference between the
          firmware sets is that the 3.37 firmware supports ``round robin''

          The Buslogic cards also have a serial number on them.  If you
          have a old hardware revision card you can call the Buslogic RMA
          department and give them the serial number and attempt to
          exchange the card for a newer hardware revision.  If the card is
          young enough they will do so.

          FreeBSD 2.1 only supports Firmware revisions 2.21 onward.  If you
          have a Firmware revision older than this your card will not be
          recognized as a Buslogic card.  It may be recognized as an
          Adaptec 1540, however.  The early Buslogic firmware contains an
          AHA1540 ``emulation'' mode.  This is not a good thing for an EISA
          card, however.

          If you have an old hardware revision card and you obtain the 2.21
          firmware for it, you will need to check the position of jumper W1
          to B-C, the default is A-B.  

          The 742a EISA cards never had the ``> 16MB'' problem mentioned in
          the section <ref id="bigram" name="on 32 MB machines">. This is a
          problem that occurs with the Vesa-Local Buslogic SCSI cards.

        <bf/NOTE/ This section is still very sparse, though we're hoping, of
        course, that companies will add to it! :) The FreeBSD group has no
        financial interest in any of the companies listed here but simply
        lists them as a public service (and feels that commercial interest
        in FreeBSD can have very positive effects on FreeBSD's long-term
        viability).  We encourage commercial software vendors to send their
        entries here for inclusion.

          Send email to <url url="mailto:info@render.com"
          name="info@render.com">

          or call: +44(0)71-251-4411 / FAX: +44(0)71-251-0939

          This package is also for FreeBSD 1.1.5 but has been tested and
          shown to run under FreeBSD 2.0 with the ``<tt/compat1xdist/''
          installed.

          Thanks must be extended to all of these companies for showing
          enough faith in FreeBSD to port their products to it.  While we
          get no direct benefit from the sales of these products, the
          indirect benefits of FreeBSD proving itself to be a successful
          platform for such commercial interests will be immense!  We wish
          these companies every measure of success, and can only hope that
          others are encouraged to follow suit.

        <heading>I want to run X, how do I go about it?</heading>

        <p>
          First, get the XFree86(tm) distribution of X11R6 from
          <tt/XFree86.cdrom.com/ The version you want for FreeBSD 2.X and
          later is <tt/XFree86 3.1.1/.  Follow the instructions for
          installation carefully. You may then wish to read the
          documentation for the <tt/ConfigXF86/ tool, which assists you in
          configuring XFree86(tm) for your particular graphics
          card/mouse/etc.

          You may also wish to investigate the Xaccel server, which is
          available at a very reasonable price.  See section
          <ref id="xinside" name="on Xaccel"> for more details.

        <p>
          You don't have a math co-processor, right? 
          You will need to add the alternative math emulator to your kernel;
          you do this by adding the following to your kernel config file
          and it will be compiled in.

          <verb>
            options GPL_MATH_EMULATE
          </verb>

          <bf/NOTE/ You will need to remove the <tt/MATH&lowbar;EMULATE/
          option when you do this.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Is there an easy way to get hold of applications?</heading>

        <p>
          Yes.  We support the concept of a ``package'', which is
          essentially a gzipped binary distribution with a little extra
          intelligence embedded in it for doing any custom installation
          work required.  Packages can also be installed or uninstalled
          again easily without having to know the gory details.  CDROM
          people will have a <tt>packages/</tt> directory on their CD,
          others can get the currently available packages from:

          <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/packages"
            name="FreeBSD's packages"> 
 
          Note that all ports may not be available as packages, and that
          new packages are constantly being added.  It is always a good
          idea to check periodically to see which packages are available.
          A <tt/README/ file in the packages directory provides more
          details on the care and feeding of the package software, so no
          explicit details will be given here.

        <heading>When I run a SCO/iBCS2 application, it bombs on <tt/socksys/.</heading>

        <p>
          You first need to edit the <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt> in the last
          section to change the following variable to <tt/YES/:
          <code>
            # Set to YES if you want ibcs2 (SCO) emulation loaded at startup
            ibcs2=NO
          </code>
          It will load the <tt/ibcs2/ kernel module at startup.

          You'll then need to set up /compat/ibcs2/dev to look like:

          <code>
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         9 Oct 15 22:20 X0R@ -> /dev/null
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         7 Oct 15 22:20 nfsd@ -> socksys
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  wheel         0 Oct 28 12:02 null
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel         9 Oct 15 22:20 socksys@ -> /dev/null
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   41,   1 Oct 15 22:14 spx
          </code>
          You just need socksys to go to <tt>/dev/null</tt> to fake the
          open &amp; close. The code in -current will handle the rest.
          This is much cleaner than the way it was done before.  If you
          want the <tt/spx/ driver for a local socket X connection, define
          <tt/SPX&lowbar;HACK/ when you compile the system.

        <heading>Why does FreeBSD consume far more swap space than Linux?</heading>

        <p>
          It doesn't.  You might mean ``why does my swap seem full?''.  If
          that is what you really meant, it's because putting stuff in swap
          rather than discarding it makes it faster to recover than if the
          pager had to go through the file system to pull in clean
          (unmodified) blocks from an executable.

          The actual amount of dirty pages that you can have in core at
          once is not reduced; the clean pages are displaced as necessary.

        <heading>Why doesn't chmod change the permissions on symlinks?</heading>
        <p>
          You have to use either ``<tt/-H/'' or ``<tt/-L/'' together with
          the ``<tt/-R/'' option to make this work.  See the <tt/chmod(1)/
          and <tt/symlink(7)/ man pages for more info.
 
          <bf/WARNING/ the ``<tt/-R/'' option does a <bf/RECURSIVE/
          <tt/chmod/.  Be careful about specifying directories or symlinks
          to directories to <tt/chmod/.  If you want to change the
          permissions of a directory referenced by a symlink, use
          <tt/chmod(1)/ without any options and follow the symlink with a
          trailing slash (``<tt>/</tt>'').  For example, if ``<tt/foo/'' is
          a symlink to directory ``<tt/bar/'', and you want to change the
          permissions of ``<tt/foo/'' (actually ``<tt/bar/''), you would do
          something like:
          <verb>
            chmod 555 foo/
          </verb>

          With the trailing slash, <tt/chmod/ will follow the symlink,
          ``<tt/foo/'', to change the permissions of the directory,
          ``<tt/bar/''.

        <heading>When I mount a CDROM, I get ``Incorrect super block''.</heading>

          want to mount.  By default, <tt/mount(8)/ will assume the
          filesystem is of type ``<tt/ufs/''.  You want to mount a CDROM
          filesystem, and you do this by specifying the ``<tt/-t cd9660/''
          option to <tt/mount(8)/.  This does, of course, assume that the
          CDROM contains an ISO 9660 filesystem, which is what most CDROMs
          have.  As of 1.1R, FreeBSD also understands the Rock Ridge
          (long filename) extensions.

          As an example, if you want to mount the CDROM device,
          ``<tt>/dev/cd0c</tt>'', under <tt>/mnt</tt>, you would execute:

          <verb>
            mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0c /mnt
          </verb>

          Note that your device name (``<tt>/dev/cd0c</tt>'' in this
          example) could be different, depending on the CDROM interface.
          Note that the ``<tt/-t cd9660/'' option just causes the
          ``<tt/mount&lowbar;cd9660/'' command to be executed, and so the
          above example could be shortened to:
          <verb>
            mount_cd9660 /dev/cd0c /mnt
          </verb>

      <sect1>
        <heading>When I mount a CDROM, I get ``Device not configured''.</heading>
        <p>
          This generally means that there is no CDROM in the CDROM drive,
          or the drive is not visible on the bus. Feed the drive
          something, and/or check its master/slave status if it is
          IDE (ATAPI).
          
      <sect1>
        <heading>How can I use the NT loader to boot FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          The general idea is that you copy the first sector of your
          native root Linux or FreeBSD partition into a file in the DOS/NT
          partition.  Assuming you name that file something like
          <tt>c:&bsol;bootsect.lnx</tt> or <tt>c:&bsol;bootsect.bsd</tt>
          (inspired by <tt>c:&bsol;bootsect.dos</tt>) you can then edit the
          <tt>c:&bsol;boot.ini</tt> file to come up with something like
          this:
          <verb>
            [boot loader]
            timeout=30
            default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
            [operating systems]
            multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT" 
            C:\BOOTSECT.LNX="Linux"
            C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="FreeBSD"
            C:\="DOS"
          </verb>
          This procedure assumes that DOS, NT, Linux, FreeBSD, or whatever
          have been installed into their respective fdisk partitions on the
          <bf/same/ disk.  In my case DOS &amp; NT are in the first fdisk
          partition, Linux in the second, and FreeBSD in the third.  I also
          installed Linux and FreeBSD to boot from their native partitions,
          not the disk MBR, and without delay.

          Mount a DOS-formatted floppy (if you've converted to NTFS) or the
          FAT partition, under, say, <tt>/mnt</tt>.

          In Linux:
          <verb>
            dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/mnt/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1
          </verb>

          In FreeBSD:  
          <verb>
            dd if=/dev/rsd0a of=/mnt/bootsect.bsd bs=512 count=1
          </verb>

          Reboot into DOS or NT.  NTFS users copy the <tt/bootsect.lnx/
          and/or the <tt/bootsect.bsd/ file from the floppy to
          <tt/C:&bsol;/.  Modify the attributes (permissions) on
          <tt/boot.ini/ with:
 
          <verb>
            attrib -s -r c:\boot.ini
          </verb>

          Edit to add the appropriate entries from the example
          <tt/boot.ini/ above, and restore the attributes:

          <verb>
            attrib -r -s c:\boot.ini
          </verb>

          If Linux or FreeBSD are booting from the MBR, restore it with the
          DOS ``<tt>fdisk /mbr</tt>'' command after you reconfigure them to
          boot from their native partitions.

        <heading>When I boot, the screen goes black and loses sync!</heading>
        <p>
          This is a known problem with the ATI Mach 64 video card.
          The problem is that this card uses address <tt/2e8/, and
          the fourth serial port does too. Due to a bug (feature?) in the
          sio.c driver it will touch this port even if you don't have the
          fourth serial port, and <bf/even/ if you disable sio3 (the fourth
          port) which normally uses this address.

          Until the bug has been fixed, you can use this workaround:
          <enum>
            <item> Enter <tt/-c/ at the bootprompt.
              (This will put the kernel into configuration mode).
            <item> Disable <tt/sio0/, <tt/sio1/, <tt/sio2/ and <tt/sio3/
              (all of them).  This way the sio driver doesn't get activated
              -> no problems.
            <item> Type exit to continue booting.
          </enum>

          If you want to be able to use your serial ports, 
          you'll have to build a new kernel with the following
          modification: in <tt>/usr/src/sys/i386/isa/sio.c</tt> find the
          one occurrence of the string <tt/0x2e8/ and remove that string
          and the preceding comma (keep the trailing comma).  Now follow
          the normal procedure of building a new kernel.

          Even after applying these workarounds, you may still find that
          X Window does not work properly.  Some newer ATI Mach 64 video 
          cards (notably ATI Mach Xpression) do not run with the current 
          version of <tt/XFree86/; the screen goes black when you start 
          X Window, or it works with strange problems. You can get 
          a beta-version of a new X-server that works better, by looking at 
          <url url="http://www.xfree86.org" name="the XFree86 site">
          and following the links to the new beta release. Get the
          following files:

          <tt>AccelCards, BetaReport, Cards, Devices, FILES, README.ati,
            README.FreeBSD, README.Mach64, RELNOTES, VGADriver.Doc,
            X312BMa64.tgz</tt>

          Replace the older files with the new versions and make sure you
          run <tt/xf86config/ again.

	<heading>What is a virtual console?</heading>
	<p>
	  Virtual consoles, put simply, enable you to have several
	  simultaneous sessions on the same machine without doing anything
	  complicated like setting up a network or running X.
	<p>
	  When the system starts, it will display a login prompt on
	  the monitor after displaying all the boot messages. You can
	  then type in your login name and password and start working (or
	  playing!) on the first virtual console.
	<p>
	  At some point, you will probably wish to start another
	  session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program 
	  you are running or to read your mail while waiting for an
	  FTP transfer to finish. Just do Alt-F2 (hold down the Alt
	  key and press the F2 key), and you will find a login prompt
	  waiting for you on the second ``virtual console''! When you
	  want to go back to the original session, do Alt-F1.
	<p>
          The default FreeBSD installation has three virtual consoles 
	  enabled, and Alt-F1, Alt-F2, and Alt-F3 will switch between 
	  these virtual consoles.
 
      <sect1>
	<heading>How do I access the virtual consoles from X?</heading>
        <p>
          If the console is currently displaying X Window, you can use
          Ctrl-Alt-F1, etc. to switch to a virtual console.  Note, however,
          that once you've switched away from X Window to a virtual
          terminal, you use only the Alt- function key to switch to another
          virtual terminal or back to X Window.  You do not also press the
          Ctrl key; the Ctrl-Alt-function key combination is used only when
          switching from X Window to a virtual terminal.
  
      <sect1>
	<heading>How do I increase the number of virtual consoles?</heading>
        <p>
          Edit <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> and add entries for ``<tt/ttyv4/'' to
          ``<tt/ttyvc/'' after the comment on ``Virtual terminals'' (delete
          the leading whitespace in the following example):

          <verb>
            # Edit the existing entry for ttyv3 in /etc/ttys and change
            # "off" to "on".
            ttyv3   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv4   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv5   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv6   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv7   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv8   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
            ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
          </verb> 

          Use as many or as few as you want.  The more virtual terminals
          you have, the more resources that are used; this can be important
          if you have 8MB RAM or less.  You may also want to change the
          ``<tt/secure/'' to ``<tt/insecure/''.
 
          <bf/IMPORTANT NOTE/ if you want to run X Window, you <bf/MUST/
          leave a virtual terminal unused (or turned off).  For example, if
          you want to attach a virtual terminal to all of your twelve
          Alt-function keys, you can only attach virtual terminals to
          eleven of them.  The last must be left unused, because X Windows
          will use it, and you will use the last Alt-function key to switch
          back to X Window (after you have switched from X Window to a
          virtual console via a Ctrl-Alt-function key).  The easiest way to
          do this is to disable a console by turning it off.  For example,
          if you have a keyboard with twelve function keys, you would
          change settings for virtual terminal 12 from:
 
          <verb>
            ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on secure
          </verb>
          to:
          <verb>
            ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
          </verb>

          If your keyboard has only ten function keys, you would end up with:
          <verb>
            ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
            ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
            ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  off secure
          </verb>
          (You could also just delete these lines.)
 
          Once you have edited <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, the next step is to make
          sure that you have enough virtual terminal devices.  The easiest
          way to do this is:
          <verb>
            cd /dev
            ./MAKEDEV vty12                 # For 12 devices
          </verb>

          Next, the easiest (and cleanest) way to activate the virtual
          consoles is to reboot.  However, if you really don't want to
          reboot, you can just shut down X Window and execute (as
          <tt/root/):
          <verb>
            kill -HUP 1
          </verb>

          It's imperative that you completely shut down X Window if it is
          running, before running this command.  If you don't, your system
          will probably appear to hang/lock up after executing the kill
          command.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I start XDM from the <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> file ?</heading>
        <p>
          Starting xdm via /etc/ttys is a Bad Thing. I don't know why this
          crept into some README file.

          Start it from your <tt/rc.local/, and be explicit about how it
          has to start.  If this is your last action in <tt/rc.local/, put
          a ``<tt/sleep 1/'' behind, to allow <tt/xdm/ to properly
          daemonize before the <tt/rc/ shell exits.

          <tt/xdm/ should be started without any arguments (i.e., as a
          daemon).

          The Xserver config file (default:
          <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</tt>) should contain the
          line:

          <code>
            :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 vt08 -wm
          </code>

          Of course, you can omit the ``<tt/-wm/'' if you don't like it,
          but the `<tt/`vt08/'' is quite important -- it must point to a vt
          that won't be used by <tt/getty/'s about a second later.

	<heading>What is this thing called ``<tt/sup/'', and how do I use it?</heading>

        <p>
          SUP stands for Software Update Protocol, and was developed by CMU
          for keeping their development trees in sync.  We use it to keep
          remote sites in sync with our central development sources.

          Unless you have direct Internet connectivity, and don't care too
          much about the cost/duration of the sessions, you shouldn't use
          sup.  For those ``low/expensive-bandwidth'' applications, we have
          developed <tt/CTM/, see the section <ref id="ctm" name="on CTM">
          for more about that.

          To use it, you need to have direct Internet connectivity (not
          just mail or news).  First, pick up the <tt/sup.tgz/ package
          from:

            <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/packages/sup.tgz"
            name="The SUP package">

          Second, read the <url
            url="http://www.freebsd.org/How/handbook/sup.html"
            name="Handbook entry on SUP">

          This file describes how to setup sup on your machine.  You may
          also want to look at

          <tt>/usr/src/share/examples/sup/*-supfile</tt>, or you may grab
          updated supfiles from:

            <url url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/FAQ/extras"
            name="Updated SUP files"> 

          which are a set of supfiles for supping from <tt/FreeBSD.ORG/.

        <heading>How cool is FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          Q. Has anyone done any temperature testing while running FreeBSD? 
          I know Linux runs cooler than dos, but have never seen a mention of 
          FreeBSD. It seems to run really hot.
        <p>
          A. No, but we have done numerous taste tests on blindfolded
          volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of LSD-25
          administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers said that FreeBSD
          tasted sort of orange, whereas Linux tasted like purple haze.
          Neither group mentioned any particular variances in temperature
          that I can remember.  We eventually had to throw the results of
          this survey out entirely anyway when we found that too many
          volunteers were wandering out of the room during the tests, thus
          skewing the results.  I think most of the volunteers are at Apple
          now, working on their new ``scratch and sniff'' GUI.  It's a
          funny old business we're in!

          Seriously, Linux uses the ``<tt/HALT/'' instruction when the
          system is idle thus lowering its energy consumption and therefore
          the heat it generates.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Who's scratching in my memory banks??</heading>
        <p>
          Q. Is there anything "odd" that FreeBSD does when compiling the
          kernel which would cause the memory to make a scratchy sound? When 
          compiling (and for a brief moment after recognizing the floppy drive
          upon startup, as well), a strange scratchy sound emanates from what 
          appears to be the memory banks.
        <p>
          A. Yes!  You'll see frequent references to ``daemons'' in the BSD
          documentation, and what most people don't know is that this
          refers to genuine, non-corporeal entities that now possess your
          computer.  The scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
          high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as they best
          decide how to deal with various system administration tasks.

          Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD daemons, the

        <heading>How do I create customized installation disks?</heading>
        <p>
          The entire process of creating installation disks and source and
          binary archives is automated by various targets in
          <tt>/usr/src/release/Makefile</tt>.  The information there should
          be enough to get you started.  However, it should be said that this
          involves doing a ``make world'' and will therefore take up a lot of
          time and disk space.

      <sect1>
        <heading>``make world'' clobbers my existing installed binaries.</heading>

        <p>
	  Yes, this is the general idea; as its name might suggest,
	  ``make world'' rebuilds every system binary from scratch, so
	  you can be certain of having a clean and consistent
	  environment at the end (which is why it takes so long).
	<p>
          If the environment variable <tt/DESTDIR/ is defined while running
          ``<tt/make world/'' or ``<tt/make install/'', the newly-created
          binaries will be deposited in a directory tree identical to the
          installed one, rooted at <tt>&dollar;&lcub;DESTDIR&rcub;</tt>.
          Some random combination of shared libraries modifications and
          program rebuilds can cause this to fail in ``<tt/make world/'',
          however.

        <p>
          The Adaptec 1542 SCSI host adapters allow the user to configure
          their bus access speed in software.  Previous versions of the
          1542 driver tried to determine the fastest usable speed and set
          the adapter to that.  We found that this breaks some users'
          systems, so you now have to define the ``<tt/TUNE&lowbar;1542/'' kernel
          configuration option in order to have this take place.  Using it
          on those systems where it works may make your disks run faster,
          but on those systems where it doesn't, your data could be
          corrupted.

           This is because of the way console permissions are set by default.
	   On a multi-user system, one doesn't necessarily want just any user

	   to solve such problems.

        <heading>How are Plug N Play ISA cards detected and initialised?</heading>
        <p>
          By: Frank Durda IV <tt>&lt;uhclem@nemesis.lonestar.org&gt;</tt>

          In a nutshell, there a few I/O ports that all of the PnP boards
          respond to when the host asks if anyone is out there.  So when
          the PnP probe routine starts, he asks if there are any PnP boards
          present, and all the PnP boards respond with their model &num; to
          a I/O read of the same port, so the probe routine gets a wired-OR
          ``yes'' to that question.  At least one bit will be on in that
          reply.  Then the probe code is able to cause boards with board
          model IDs (assigned by Microsoft/Intel) lower than X to go
          ``off-line''.  It then looks to see if any boards are still
          responding to the query.  If the answer was ``<tt/0/'', then
          there are no boards with IDs above X.  Now probe asks if there
          are any boards below ``X''.  If so, probe knows there are boards
          with a model numbers below X.  Probe then asks for boards greater
          than X-(limit/4) to go off-line.  If repeats the query.  By
          repeating this semi-binary search of IDs-in-range enough times,
          the probing code will eventually identify all PnP boards present
          in a given machine with a number of iterations that is much lower
          than what 2^64 would take.

          The IDs are two 32-bit fields (hence 2&circ;64) + 8 bit checksum.
          The first 32 bits are a vendor identifier.  They never come out
          and say it, but it appears to be assumed that different types of
          boards from the same vendor could have different 32-bit vendor
          ids.  The idea of needing 32 bits just for unique manufacturers
          is a bit excessive.

          The lower 32 bits are a serial &num;, ethernet address, something
          that makes this one board unique.  The vendor must never produce
          a second board that has the same lower 32 bits unless the upper
          32 bits are also different.  So you can have multiple boards of
          the same type in the machine and the full 64 bits will still be
          unique.

          The 32 bit groups can never be all zero.  This allows the
          wired-OR to show non-zero bits during the initial binary search.

          Once the system has identified all the board IDs present, it will
          reactivate each board, one at a time (via the same I/O ports),
          and find out what resources the given board needs, what interrupt
          choices are available, etc.  A scan is made over all the boards
          to collect this information.

          This info is then combined with info from any ECU files on the
          hard disk or wired into the MLB BIOS.  The ECU and BIOS PnP
          support for hardware on the MLB is usually synthetic, and the
          peripherals don't really do geniune PnP.  However by examining
          the BIOS info plus the ECU info, the probe routines can cause the
          devices that are PnP to avoid those devices the probe code cannot
          relocate.

          Then the PnP devices are visited once more and given their I/O,
          DMA, IRQ and Memory-map address assignments.  The devices will
          then appear at those locations and remain there until the next
          reboot, although there is nothing that says you can't move them
          around whenever you want.

          There is a lot of oversimplification above, but you should get
          the general idea.

          Microsoft took over some of the primary printer status ports to
          do PnP, on the logic that no boards decoded those addresses for
          the opposing I/O cycles.  I found a genuine IBM printer board
          that did decode writes of the status port during the early PnP
          proposal review period, but MS said ``tough''.  So they do a
          write to the printer status port for setting addresses, plus that
          use that address + <tt/0x800/, and a third I/O port for reading
          that can be located anywhere between <tt/0x200/ and <tt/0x3ff/.

      <heading>Kernel Configuration</heading>
      <p>
      <sect1>
        <heading>I'd like to customize my kernel. Is it difficult?<label id="make-kernel"></heading>
        <p>
          Not at all! First, you need either the complete
          <tt/srcdist/ or, at the minimum, the <tt/kerndist/ loaded on your
          system.  This provides the necessary sources for building the
          kernel, as, unlike most commercial UNIX vendors, we have a policy 
          of <bf/NOT/ shipping our kernel code in binary object form.
          Shipping the source takes a bit more space, but it also means
          that you can refer to the actual kernel sources in case of
          difficulty or to further your understanding of what's
          <bf/really/ happening.

          Once you have the <tt/kerndist/ or <tt/srcdist/ loaded, do this:

          <enum>
            <item> <tt>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</tt>
            <item> <tt/cp GENERIC MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt/vi MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt/config MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt>cd ../../compile/MYKERNEL</tt>
            <item> <tt/make depend/
            <item> <tt/make all/
            <item> <tt/make install/
            <item> <tt/reboot/
          </enum>

          Step 2 may not be necessary if you already have a kernel
          configuration file from a previous release of FreeBSD 2.X. -
          simply bring your old one over and check it carefully for any
          drivers that may have changed boot syntax or been rendered
          obsolete.

          A good kernel config file to look into is <tt/LINT/, which
          contains entries for <bf/all/ possible kernel options and
          documents them fairly well.  The <tt/GENERIC/ kernel config file
          is used to build the initial release you probably loaded (unless
          you upgraded in-place) and contains entries for the most common
          configurations.  It's a pretty good place to start from.

          If you don't need to make any changes to <tt/GENERIC/, you can
          also skip step 3, where you customize the kernel for your
          configuration.  Step 8 should only be undertaken if steps 6 and 7
          succeed.  This will copy the new kernel image to
          <tt>/kernel</tt> and <bf/BACK UP YOUR OLD ONE IN/
          <tt>/kernel.old</tt>!  It's very important to remember this in
          case the new kernel fails to work for some reason - you can still
          select <tt>/kernel.old</tt> at the boot prompt to boot the old
          one.  When you reboot, the new kernel will boot by default.

          If the compile in step 7 falls over for some reason, then it's
          recommended that you start from step 4 but substitute
          <tt/GENERIC/ for <tt/MYKERNEL/.  If you can generate a
          <tt/GENERIC/ kernel, then it's likely something in your special
          configuration file that's bad (or you've uncovered a bug!).  If
          the build of the <tt/GENERIC/ kernel does <bf/NOT/ succeed, then
          it's very likely that your sources are somehow corrupted.

          Finally, if you need to see your original boot messages again to
          compile a new kernel that's better tailored to your hardware, try
          the <tt/dmesg(8)/ command.  It should print out all the boot-time
          messages printed by your old kernel, some of which may be quite
          helpful in configuring the new one.

      <sect1>
        <heading>My kernel compiles fail because <tt/&lowbar;hw&lowbar;float/ is missing.</heading>

        <p>
          Let me guess. You removed <tt/npx0/ from your kernel configuration 
          file because you don't have a math co-processor, right? Wrong! :-) 
          The <tt/npx0/ is <bf/MANDATORY/. Even if you don't have a
          mathematic co-processor, you <bf/must/ include the <tt/npx0/
          device.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Interrupt conflicts with multi-port serial code.</heading>
        <p>
           Q. When I compile a kernel with multi-port serial code, it tells me 
           that only the first port is probed and the rest skipped due to 
           interrupt conflicts.  How do I fix this?

        <p>
          A. The problem here is that FreeBSD has code built-in to keep the
          kernel from getting trashed due to hardware or software
          conflicts.  The way to fix this is to leave out the IRQ settings
          on other ports besides the first.  Here is a example:

<verb>
#
# Multiport high-speed serial line - 16550 UARTS
#
device    sio2    at isa? port 0x2a0 tty irq 5 flags 0x501 vector siointr
device    sio3    at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr 
device    sio4    at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr
device    sio5    at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr
</verb>

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I enable support for QIC-40/80 drives?</heading>

        <p>
          You need to uncomment the following line in the generic config
          file (or add it to your config file), add a ``<tt/flags 0x1/''
          on the <tt/fdc/ line and recompile.
          
<verb>
controller  fdc0  at isa? port "IO_FD1" bio irq 6 drq 2 flags 0x1 vector fdintr
disk        fd0   at fdc0 drive 0                       ^^^^^^^^^
disk        fd1   at fdc0 drive 1
#tape       ft0   at fdc0 drive 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</verb>

          Next, you create a device called <tt>/dev/ft0</tt> by going into
          <tt>/dev</tt> and run the following command:

          <verb>
            sh MAKEDEV ft0
          </verb>

          for the first device. <tt/ft1/ for a second one and so on.

          You will have a device called <tt>/dev/ft0</tt>, which you can
          write to through a special program to manage it called
          ``<tt/ft/'' - see the man page on <tt/ft/ for further details.
          Versions previous to <tt/-current/ also had some trouble dealing
          with bad tape media; if you have trouble where <tt/ft/ seems to
          go back and forth over the same spot, try grabbing the latest
          version of <tt/ft/ from <tt>/usr/src/sbin/ft</tt> in
          <tt/-current/ and try that.


      <sect1>
        <heading>Does FreeBSD support System V IPC primitives?</heading>

        <p>
          Yes, FreeBSD supports System V-style IPC.  This includes shared
          memory, messages and semaphores.  You need to add the following
          lines to your kernel config to enable them.

          <verb>
            options    SYSVSHM
            options    "SHMMAXPGS=64"   # 256Kb of sharable memory
            options    SYSVSEM          # enable for semaphores
            options    SYSVMSG          # enable for messaging
          </verb>

          Recompile and install.

      <sect1>
        <heading>I have 128 MB of RAM but the system only uses 64 MB.</heading>

        <p>
          Due to the manner in which FreeBSD gets the memory size from the
          BIOS, it can only detect 16 bits worth of Kbytes in size (65535
          Kbytes = 64MB). If you have more than 64MB, FreeBSD will only see
          the first 64MB. To work around this problem, you need to use the
          kernel option specified below. There is a way to get complete
          memory information from the BIOS, but we don't have room in the
          bootblocks to do it. Someday when lack of room in the bootblocks
          is fixed, we'll use the extended BIOS functions to get the full
          memory information...but for now we're stuck with the kernel
          option.

          <code>
            options "MAXMEM=<n>"
          </code>
          Where <tt/n/ is your memory in Kilobytes. For a 128 MB machine,
          you'd want to use <tt/131072/

      <sect1>
        <heading>FreeBSD 2.0 panics with ``kmem_map too small!''</heading>

        <p>
          <tt /Note/ The message may also be ``mb_map too small!''
        <p>
          The panic indicates that the system ran out of virtual memory for
          network buffers (specifically, mbuf clusters). You can increase
          the amount of VM available for mbuf clusters by adding:

          <code>
            options "NMBCLUSTERS=<n>"
          </code>

          to your kernel config file, where &lt;n&gt; is a number in the
          range 512-4096, depending on the number of concurrent TCP
          connections you need to support. I'd recommend trying 2048 - this
          should get rid of the panic completely. You can monitor the
          number of mbuf clusters allocated/in use on the system with
          <tt/netstat -m/.

        <p>
          As of 2.0.5R, the primary configuration file is

          Look in the <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt> file and change the value to
          match your system. This file is filled with comments to show what
          to put in there.

          The <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> is here as always and is the place to
          put additional services like <tt/INN/ or a <tt/http/ server.

          The <tt>/etc/rc.serial</tt> is for serial port initialization
          (e.g. locking the port characteristics, and so on.).

          The <tt>/etc/rc.i386</tt> is for Intel-specifics setting like the
          iBCS2 emulation.

          Starting with 2.1.0R, you can have "local" startup files in a
          directory specified in <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>:
          <verb>
            # Location of local startup files.
            local_startup=/usr/local/etc/rc.local.d
          </verb>
          Each file ending in <tt/.sh/ will be executed in alphabetic
          order.

          If you want to have a proper order without changing all the file
          names, you can use a scheme similar to the following with digits
          prepended to each file name to insure order:
          <verb>
            10news.sh
            15httpd.sh
            20ssh.sh
          </verb>
          It can be seen as ugly (or SysV :-)) but it provides a simple and
          regular scheme for locally-added packages without resorting to
          magical editing of <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>.

        <p>
          The kbdcontrol program has an option to load a keyboard map file.
          Under <tt>/usr/share/syscons/keymaps</tt> are a number of map
          files.  Choose the one relevant to your system and load it.

          Both the <tt>/usr/share/syscons/keymaps</tt> and the <tt/.kbd/

        <heading>Where can I get information on ``diskless booting''?</heading>

        <p>
          ``Diskless booting'' means that the FreeBSD box is booted over a
          network, and reads the necessary files from a server instead of
          its hard disk. For full details, please read

          <url url="http://www.FreeBSD.ORG/How/handbook/diskless.html"

      <sect1>
        <heading>Can a FreeBSD box be used as a dedicated network router?</heading>

        <p>
          Internet standards and good engineering practice prohibit us from
          providing packet forwarding by default in FreeBSD. You can
          however enable this feature by changing the following variable to
          <tt/YES/ in <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>:
          <verb>
            # If you want this host to be a gateway, set to YES.
            gateway=YES
          </verb>

          This  option will put the <tt/sysctl/ variable
          <tt/net.inet.ip.forwarding/ to <tt/1/.

          In most cases, you will also need to run a routing process to
          tell other systems on your network about your router; FreeBSD
          comes with the standard BSD routing daemon <tt/routed(8)/, or for
          more complex situations you may want to try <em/GaTeD/ (available
          by FTP from <tt/ftp.gated.Merit.EDU/) which supports FreeBSD as
          of 3_5Alpha7.

          It is our duty to warn you that, even when FreeBSD is configured
          in this way, it does not completely comply with the Internet
          standard requirements for routers; however, it comes close enough
          for ordinary usage.

        <heading>I want to recompile the latest BIND from ISC. It blows up during the compilation on some types conflicts. What can I do ? </heading>

        <p>
	  Typically, people who ask this question have two PC's at home, one
	  with FreeBSD and one with Win95; the idea is to use the FreeBSD
	  box to connect to the Internet and then be able to access the
	  Internet from the Windows95 box through the FreeBSD box. This
	  is really just a special case of the previous question.

	  FreeBSD up as a <url url="http://www.ssimicro.com/~jeremyc/ppp.html"

        <p>
          Yes.  See the man pages for <tt/slattach(8)/ and/or <tt/pppd(8)/
          if you're using FreeBSD to connect to another site.  If you're
          using FreeBSD as a server for other machines, look at the man
          page for <tt/sliplogin(8)/.  

          You can also have a look at the SLIP/PPP/Use PPP sections of the

        <p>
        A possible cause for this is IJPPPs' use of predictor1 
        compression.  One way of determining if you have this problem
        is to look at your log and if you have protocol errors then this is 
        most likely it.
        These can be shut off with:
<verb>
deny pred1
disable pred1
</verb>
        Use these two before you dial out and it should work.

          describing network administration on another BSD-related
          operating system; with few significant exceptions, administering
          networking on FreeBSD is basically the same as on SunOS 4.0 or

        <heading>Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?</heading>
        <p>
	  You will probably find that the host is actually in a different
	  domain; for example, if you are in foo.bar.edu and you wish to reach
	  a host called ``mumble'' in the bar.edu domain, you will have to
	  refer to it by the fully-qualified domain name, ``mumble.bar.edu'', 
	  instead of just ``mumble''.     
	<p>
	  Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers. However
	  the current version of <em>BIND</em> that ships with FreeBSD
	  no longer provides default abbreviations for non-fully
	  qualified domain names other than the domain you are in.
	  So an unqualified host <tt>mumble</tt> must either be found
	  as <tt>mumble.foo.bar.edu</tt>, or it will be searched for
	  in the root domain.
	<p>
	  This is different from the previous behaviour, where the
	  search continued across <tt>mumble.bar.edu</tt>, and
	  <tt>mumble.edu</tt>.  Have a look at RFC 1535 for why this
	  was considered bad practice, or even a security hole.
	<p>
	  As a good workaround, you can place the line
<p><tt>
search foo.bar.edu bar.edu
</tt><p>
	  instead of the previous

<p><tt>
domain foo.bar.edu
</tt><p>
	  into your <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>.  However, make sure
	  that the search order does not go beyond the ``boundary
	  between local and public administration'', as RFC 1535
	  calls it.

      <sect1><heading>Sendmail says ``mail loops back to myself''</heading>
	<p>
	  This is answered in the sendmail FAQ as follows:-
	  <verb>
          * I'm getting "Local configuration error" messages, such as:

          553 relay.domain.net config error: mail loops back to myself
          554 <user@domain.net>... Local configuration error

          How can I solve this problem?

          You have asked mail to the domain (e.g., domain.net) to be
          forwarded to a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net)
          by using an MX record, but the relay machine doesn't recognize
          itself as domain.net.  Add domain.net to /etc/sendmail.cw
          (if you are using FEATURE(use_cw_file)) or add "Cw domain.net"
          to /etc/sendmail.cf.
	  </verb>
	<p>
	  The sendmail FAQ is in <tt>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail</tt>
	  and is recommended reading if you want to do any
	  ``tweaking'' of your mail setup.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I use sendmail for mail delivery with UUCP?</heading>

        <p>
          The sendmail configuration that ships with FreeBSD is
          suited for sites that connect directly to the Internet.
          Sites that wish to exchange their mail via UUCP must install
          another sendmail configuration file.

        <p>
          Tweaking <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt> manually is considered
          something for purists.  Sendmail version 8 comes with a
          new approach of generating config files via some <tt>m4</tt>
          preprocessing, where the actual hand-crafted configuration
          is on a higher abstraction level.  You should use the
          configuration files under

<verb>
     /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf
</verb>

          If you didn't install your system with full sources,
          the sendmail config stuff has been
          broken out into a separate source distribution tarball just
          for you.  Assuming you've got your CD-ROM mounted, do:

<verb>
     cd /usr/src
     tar -xvzf /cdrom/dists/src/ssmailcf.aa
</verb>

          Don't panic, this is only a few hundred kilobytes in size.
          The file <tt>README</tt> in the <tt>cf</tt> directory can
          serve as a basic introduction to m4 configuration.

        <p>
          For UUCP delivery, you are best advised to use the
          <em>mailertable</em> feature.  This constitutes a database
          that sendmail can use to base its routing decision upon.

        <p>
	  First, you have to create your <tt>.mc</tt> file.  The
          directory <tt>/usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf</tt> is the
          home of these files.  Look around, there are already a few
          examples.  Assuming you have named your file <tt>foo.mc</tt>,
          all you need to do in order to convert it into a valid
          <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> is:

<verb>
     cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf
     make foo.cf
     cp foo.cf /etc/sendmail.cf
</verb>

          A typical <tt>.mc</tt> file might look like:

<verb>
     include(`../m4/cf.m4')
     VERSIONID(`Your version number')
     OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

     FEATURE(nodns)
     FEATURE(nocanonify)
     FEATURE(mailertable)

     define(`UUCP_RELAY', your.uucp.relay)
     define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)

     MAILER(local)
     MAILER(smtp)
     MAILER(uucp)

     Cw    your.alias.host.name
     Cw    youruucpnodename.UUCP
</verb>

          The <em>nodns</em> and <em>nocanonify</em> features will
          prevent any usage of the DNS during mail delivery.  The
          <em>UUCP_RELAY</em> clause is needed for bizarre reasons,
          don't ask.  Simply put an Internet hostname there that
          is able to handle .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely,
          you will enter the mail relay of your ISP there.

        <p>
          Once you've got this, you need this file called
          <tt>/etc/mailertable</tt>.  A typical example of this
          gender again:

<verb>
     #

          As you can see, this is part of a real-life file.  The first
          three lines handle special cases where domain-addressed mail
          should not be sent out to the default route, but instead to
          some UUCP neighbour in order to ``shortcut'' the delivery
          path.  The next line handles mail to the local Ethernet
          domain that can be delivered using SMTP.  Finally, the UUCP
          neighbours are mentioned in the .UUCP pseudo-domain notation,
          to allow for a ``uucp-neighbour!recipient'' override of the
          default rules.  The last line is always a single dot, matching
          everything else, with UUCP delivery to a UUCP neighbour that
          serves as your universal mail gateway to the world.  All of
          the node names behind the <tt>uucp-dom:</tt> keyword must
          be valid UUCP neighbours, as you can verify using the
          command <tt>uuname</tt>.

          Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular

          simply enter ``0 '', followed by the address you wish to
          test for the mail routing.  The last line tells you the used
          internal mail agent, the destination host this agent will be
          called with, and the (possibly translated) address.  Leave
          this mode by typing Control-D.

          If you have compiled your kernel with the <tt/IPFIREWALL/ 
          option, you need to be aware that the default policy as of
          2.1.5R (this actually changed during 2.1-STABLE development) 
          is to deny all packets that are not explicitly allowed.

        <p>
          If you had unintentionally misconfigured your system for
          firewalling, you can restore network operability by typing
          the following while logged in as root:

      <heading>Serial Communications</heading>
      <p>
        This section answers common questions about serial communications
        with FreeBSD.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I tell if FreeBSD found my serial ports?</heading>
        <p>
          As the FreeBSD kernel boots, it will probe for the serial ports
          in your system for which the kernel was configured.  You can
          either watch your system closely for the messages it prints or
          run the command
          <verb>
            dmesg | grep sio
          </verb>
          after your system's up and running.

          Here's some example output from the above command:
          <verb>
            sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
            sio0: type 16550A
            sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
            sio1: type 16550A
          </verb>

          This shows two serial ports.  The first is on irq 4, is using
          port address <tt/0x3f8/, and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The
          second uses the same kind of chip but is on irq 3 and is at port
          address <tt/0x2f8/.  Internal modem cards are treated just like
          serial ports---except that they always have a modem ``attached''
          to the port.

          The <tt/GENERIC/ kernel includes support for two serial ports
          using the same irq and port address settings in the above
          example.  If these settings aren't right for your system, or if
          you've added modem cards or have more serial ports than your
          kernel is configured for, just reconfigure your kernel.  See
          section <ref id="make-kernel" name="about building a kernel"> for
          more details.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I tell if FreeBSD found my modem cards?</heading>
        <p>
          Please refer to the answer to the previous question.

      <sect1>
        <heading>I just upgraded to 2.0.5 and my <tt/tty0X/ are missing!</heading>
        <p>
          Don't worry, they have been merged with the <tt/ttydX/ devices. 
          You'll have to change any old configuration files you have, though.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I access the serial ports on FreeBSD?</heading>
        <p>
          The third serial port, <tt/sio2/ (known as COM3 in DOS), is on
          <tt>/dev/cuaa2</tt> for dial-out devices, and on
          <tt>/dev/ttyd2</tt> for dial-in devices.  What's the difference
          between these two classes of devices?

          You use <tt/ttydX/ for dial-ins.  When opening
          <tt>/dev/ttydX</tt> in blocking mode, a process will wait for the
          corresponding <tt/cuaaX/ device to become inactive, and then wait
          for the carrier detect line to go active.  When you open the
          <tt/cuaaX/ device, it makes sure the serial port isn't already in
          use by the <tt/ttydX/ device.  If the port's available, it
          ``steals'' it from the <tt/ttydX/ device.  Also, the <tt/cuaXX/
          device doesn't care about carrier detect.  With this scheme and
          an auto-answer modem, you can have remote users log in and you
          can still dialout with the same modem and the system will take
          care of all the conflicts.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How do I enable support for a multiport serial card?</heading>
        <p>
          Again, the section on kernel configuration provides information
          about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport serial card,
          place an <tt/sio/ line for each serial port on the card in the
          kernel configuration file.  But place the irq and vector
          specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports on the
          card should share one irq.  For consistency, use the last serial
          port to specify the irq.  Also, specify the
          <tt/COM&lowbar;MULTIPORT/ option.

          The following example is for an AST 4-port serial card on irq 7:
          <verb>
            options "COM_MULTIPORT"
            device sio4 at isa? port 0x2a0 tty flags 0x781
            device sio5 at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x781
            device sio6 at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x781
            device sio7 at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x781 irq 7 vector siointr
          </verb>
          The flags indicate that the master port has minor number 7
          (<tt/0x700/), diagnostics enabled during probe (<tt/0x080/), and
          all the ports share an irq (<tt/0x001/).

      <sect1>
        <heading>Can FreeBSD handle multiport serial cards sharing irqs?</heading>
        <p>
          Not yet. You'll have to use a different irq for each card.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How can I set the default serial parameters for a port?</heading>
        <p>
          The <tt/ttydX/ (or <tt/cuaaX/) device is the regular device
          you'll want to open for your applications.  When a process opens
          the device, it'll have a default set of terminal I/O settings.
          You can see these settings with the command
          <verb>
            stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1
          </verb>

          When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in
          effect until the device is closed.  When it's reopened, it goes
          back to the default set.  To make changes to the default set, you
          can open and adjust the settings of the ``initial state'' device.
          For example, to turn on <tt/CLOCAL/ mode, 8 bits, and
          <tt>XON/XOFF</tt> flow control by default for ttyd5, do:
          <verb>
            stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff
          </verb>

          A good place to do this is in <tt>/etc/rc.serial</tt>. Now, an
          application will have these settings by default when it opens
          <tt/ttyd5/.  It can still change these settings to its liking,
          though.

          You can also prevent certain settings from being changed by an
          application by making adjustments to the ``lock state'' device.
          For example, to lock the speed of <tt/ttyd5/ to 57600 bps, do
          <verb>
            stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600
          </verb>

          Now, an application that opens <tt/ttyd5/ and tries to change the
          speed of the port will be stuck with 57600 bps.

          Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state
          devices writable only by <tt/root/. The <tt/MAKEDEV/ script does
          <bf/NOT/ do this when it creates the device entries.

      <sect1>
	<heading>How can I enable dialup logins on my modem?</heading>
        <p>
          So you want to become an Internet service provider, eh?  First,
          you'll need one or more modems that can auto-answer.  Your modem
          will need to assert carrier-detect when it detects a carrier and
          not assert it all the time.  It will need to hang up the phone
          and reset itself when the data terminal ready (<tt/DTR/) line
          goes from on to off.  It should probably use <tt>RTS/CTS</tt>
          flow control or no local flow control at all.  Finally, it must
          use a constant speed between the computer and itself, but (to be
          nice to your callers) it should negotiate a speed between itself
          and the remote modem.

          For many Hayes command-set--compatible modems, this command will
          make these settings and store them in nonvolatile memory:
          <verb>
            AT &amp;C1 &amp;D3 &amp;K3 &amp;Q6 S0=1 &amp;W
          </verb>
          See the section <ref id="direct-at" name="on sending AT
          commands"> below for information on how to make these settings
          without resorting to an MS-DOS terminal program.

          Next, make an entry in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> for the modem.  This
          file lists all the ports on which the operating system will await
          logins.  Add a line that looks something like this:
          <verb>
            ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.57600" dialup on insecure
          </verb>
          This line indicates that the second serial port
          (<tt>/dev/ttyd1</tt>) has a modem connected running at 57600 bps
          and no parity (<tt/std.57600/, which comes from the file
          <tt>/etc/gettytab</tt>). The terminal type for this port is
          ``dialup.''  The port is ``on'' and is ``insecure''---meaning
          root logins on the port aren't allowed.  For dialin ports like
          this one, use the <tt/ttydX/ entry.

          It's common practice to use ``dialup'' as the terminal type.
          Many users set up in their .profile or .login files a prompt for
          the actual terminal type if the starting type is dialup.  The
          example shows the port as insecure.  To become root on this port,
          you have to login as a regular user, then ``<tt/su/'' to
          <tt/root/.  If you use ``secure'' then <tt/root/ can login in
          directly.

          After making modifications to <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, you need to
          send a hangup or <tt/HUP/ signal to the <tt/init/ process:
          <verb>
            kill -1 1
          </verb>
          This forces the init process to reread <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>.  The
          init process will then start getty processes on all ``on'' ports.
          You can find out if logins are available for your port by typing
          <verb>
            ps -ax | grep '[t]tyd1'
          </verb>

          You should see something like:
          <verb>
            747 ??  I      0:00.04 /usr/libexec/getty std.57600 ttyd1 
          </verb>

      <sect1>
        <heading>How can I connect a dumb terminal to my FreeBSD box?</heading>
        <p>
          If you're using another computer as a terminal into your FreeBSD
          system, get a null modem cable to go between the two serial
          ports.  If you're using an actual terminal, see its accompanying
          instructions.

          Then, modify <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, like above.  For example, if
          you're hooking up a WYSE-50 terminal to the fifth serial port,
          use an entry like this:
          <verb>
            ttyd4 "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400" wyse50 on secure
          </verb>
          This example shows that the port on <tt>/dev/ttyd4</tt> has a
          wyse50 terminal connected at 38400 bps with no parity
          (<tt/std.38400/ from <tt>/etc/gettytab</tt>) and <tt/root/ logins
          are allowed (secure).

      <sect1>
	<heading>Why can't I run <tt/tip/ or <tt/cu/?</heading>
        <p>
          On your system, the programs <tt/tip/ and <tt/cu/ are probably
          executable only by <tt/uucp/ and group <tt/dialer/.  You can use
          the group <tt/dialer/ to control who has access to your modem or
          remote systems.  Just add yourself to group dialer.

          Alternatively, you can let everyone on your system run <tt/tip/
          and <tt/cu/ by typing:
          <verb>
            chmod 4511 /usr/bin/tip
          </verb>
          You don't have to run this command for <tt/cu/, since <tt/cu/ is
          just a hard link to <tt/tip/.

      <sect1>
	<heading>My stock Hayes modem isn't supported---what can I do?</heading>
        <p>
          Actually, the man page for <tt/tip/ is out of date.  There is a
          generic Hayes dialer already built in.  Just use
          ``<tt/at=hayes/'' in your <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.

          The Hayes driver isn't smart enough to recognize some of the
          advanced features of newer modems---messages like <tt/BUSY/,
          <tt/NO DIALTONE/, or <tt/CONNECT 115200/ will just confuse it.
          You should turn those messages off when you use <tt/tip/ (using
          <tt/ATX0&amp;W/).

          Also, the dial timeout for <tt/tip/ is 60 seconds.  Your modem
          should use something less, or else tip will think there's a
          communication problem.  Try <tt/ATS7=45&amp;W/.

          Actually, as shipped <tt/tip/ doesn't yet support it fully. The
          solution is to edit the file <tt/tipconf.h/ in the directory
          <tt>/usr/src/usr.bin/tip/tip</tt> Obviously you need the source
          distribution to do this.

          Edit the line ``<tt/#define HAYES 0/'' to ``<tt/#define HAYES
          1/''. Then ``<tt/make/'' and ``<tt/make install/''. Everything
          works nicely after that.

      <sect1>
        <heading>How am I expected to enter these AT commands?<label id="direct-at"></heading>
        <p>
          Make what's called a ``<tt/direct/'' entry in your
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.  For example, if your modem's hooked
          up to the first serial port, <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt>, then put in the
          following line:
          <verb>
            cuaa0:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#19200:pa=none
          </verb>
          Use the highest bps rate your modem supports in the br
          capability.  Then, type ``<tt/tip cuaa0/'' and you'll be
          connected to your modem.

          If there is no <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt> on your system, do this:
          <verb>
            cd /dev
            MAKEDEV cuaa0
          </verb>
        <p>
          Or use cu as root with the following command:
          <verb>
            cu -l``line'' -s``speed''
          </verb>
          with line being the serial port (e.g.<tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt>)
          and speed being the speed (e.g.<tt>57600</tt>).
          When you are done entering the AT commands hit <tt>~.</tt> to exit.

      <sect1>
        <heading>The <tt/@/ sign for the pn capability doesn't work!</heading>
        <p>
          The <tt/@/ sign in the phone number capability tells tip to look in
          <tt>/etc/phones</tt> for a phone number.  But the <tt/@/ sign is
          also a special character in capability files like
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt>.  Escape it with a backslash:
          <verb>
            pn=\@
          </verb>

      <sect1>
	<heading>How can I dial a phone number on the command line?</heading>
        <p>
          Put what's called a ``<tt/generic/'' entry in your
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.  For example:
          <verb>
            tip115200|Dial any phone number at 115200 bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#115200:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
            tip57600|Dial any phone number at 57600 bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
          </verb>

          Then you can things like ``<tt/tip -115200 5551234/''.  If you
          prefer <tt/cu/ over <tt/tip/, use a generic cu entry:
          <verb>
            cu115200|Use cu to dial any number at 115200bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa1:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
          </verb>
          and type ``<tt/cu 5551234 -s 115200/''.

          Put in an entry for <tt/tip1200/ or <tt/cu1200/, but go ahead and
          use whatever bps rate is appropriate with the br
          capability. <tt/tip/ thinks a good default is 1200 bps which is
          why it looks for a ``<tt/tip1200/'' entry.  You don't have to use
          1200 bps, though.

        <heading>I access a number of hosts through a terminal server.</heading>
        <p>
          Rather than waiting until you're connected and typing 
          ``<tt/CONNECT &lt;host&gt;/'' each time, use tip's <tt/cm/
          capability. For example, these entries in
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt>:
          <verb>
            pain|pain.deep13.com|Forrester's machine:\
            :cm=CONNECT pain\n:tc=deep13:
            muffin|muffin.deep13.com|Frank's machine:\
            :cm=CONNECT muffin\n:tc=deep13:
            deep13:Gizmonics Institute terminal server:\
            :dv=/dev/cua02:br#38400:at=hayes:du:pa=none:pn=5551234:
          </verb>

          will let you type ``<tt/tip pain/'' or ``<tt/tip muffin/'' to
          connect to the hosts pain or muffin; and ``<tt/tip deep13/'' to
          get to the terminal server.

      <sect1>
        <heading>Can tip try more than one line for each site?</heading>
        <p>
          This is often a problem where a university has several modem lines
          and several thousand students trying to use them...
        <p>
          Make an entry for your university in <tt>/etc/remote</tt>
          and use <tt>\@</tt> for the <tt/pn/ capability:
          <verb>
            big-university:\
            :pn=\@:tc=dialout
            dialout:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa3:br#9600:at=courier:du:pa=none:
          </verb>

          Then, list the phone numbers for the university in
          <tt>/etc/phones</tt>:
          <verb>
            big-university 5551111
            big-university 5551112
            big-university 5551113
            big-university 5551114
          </verb>

          <tt/tip/ will try each one in the listed order, then give up.  If
          you want to keep retrying, run <tt/tip/ in a while loop.

      <sect1>
	<heading>Why do I have to hit CTRL+P twice to send CTRL+P once?</heading>
        <p>
          CTRL+P is the default ``force'' character, used to tell <tt/tip/
          that the next character is literal data.  You can set the force
          character to any other character with the <tt/~s/ escape, which
          means ``set a variable.''

          Type ``<tt/~sforce=&lt;single-char&gt;/'' followed by a newline.
          <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is any single character.  If you leave
          out <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/, then the force character is the nul
          character, which you can get by typing CTRL+2 or CTRL+SPACE.  A
          pretty good value for <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is SHIFT+CTRL+6,
          which I've seen only used on some terminal servers.

          You can have the force character be whatever you want by
          specifying the following in your <tt>&dollar;HOME/.tiprc</tt>
          file:
          <verb>
            force=<single-char>
          </verb>

      <sect1>
        <heading>Suddenly everything I type is in UPPER CASE??</heading>
        <p>
          You must've pressed CTRL+A, <tt/tip/'s ``raise character,''
          specially designed for people with broken caps-lock keys. Use
          <tt/~s/ as above and set the variable ``raisechar'' to something
          reasonable.  In fact, you can set it to the same as the force
          character, if you never expect to use either of these features.

          Here's a sample .tiprc file perfect for Emacs users who need to
          type CTRL+2 and CTRL+A a lot:
          <verb>
            force=^^
            raisechar=^^
          </verb>
          The ^^ is SHIFT+CTRL+6.

	<heading>How can I do file transfers with <tt/tip/?</heading>
        <p>
          If you're talking to another UNIX system, you can send and
          receive files with <tt/~p/ (put) and <tt/~t/ (take).  These
          commands run ``<tt/cat/'' and ``<tt/echo/'' on the remote system
          to accept and send files.  The syntax is:
          <verb>
            ~p <local-file> [<remote-file>]
            ~t <remote-file> [<local-file>]
          </verb>

          There's no error checking, so you probably should use another
          protocol, like zmodem.

      <sect1>
	<heading>How can I run zmodem with <tt/tip/?</heading>
        <p>
          To receive files, start the sending program on the remote end.
          Then, type ``<tt/~C rz/'' to begin receiving them locally.

          To send files, start the receiving program on the remote end.
          Then, type ``<tt/~C sz &lt;files&gt;/'' to send them to the
          remote system.
