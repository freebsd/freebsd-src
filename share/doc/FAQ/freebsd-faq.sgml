    <sect>Preface

      <p>
        Welcome to the FreeBSD 2.0 FAQ !  This document tries to answer
        some of the most frequently asked questions about FreeBSD 2.0 (or
        later, unless specifically indicated).  If there's something you're
        having trouble with and you just don't see it here, then please
        send mail to:

        <verb>
          questions@FreeBSD.ORG
        </verb>

        This version of the FAQ use the <tt>linuxdoc-sgml</tt> utility
        written for Linux by Matt Welsh. The SGML translation was made by
        Ollivier Robert <tt/&lt;roberto@FreeBSD.ORG&gt;/

        Some of the instructions here will also refer to auxiliary
        utilities in the <tt>/usr/src/share/FAQ directory</tt>.  CDROM
        purchasers and net folks who've grabbed the FreeBSD 2.0
        ``<tt/srcdist/'' will have these files.  If you don't have the
        source distribution, then you can either grab the whole thing from:

        <verb>
          ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current
        </verb>

        Or you can grab only those files you're interested in straight out
        of the FreeBSD-current distribution in:

      <sect1>What is FreeBSD?

        <p>
          FreeBSD 2.0 is a UN*X type operating system based on
          U.C. Berkeley's 4.4BSD-lite release for the i386 platform.  It is
          also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
          Net/2 to the i386, 386BSD.  There have been many additions and
          bug fixes made throughout the entire system, some of the
          highlights of which are:


          <itemize>
            <item>More robust and extensive PC device support
            <item>System V-style IPC, messaging and semaphores
            <item>Shared Libraries
            <item>Much improved virtual memory code
            <item>Better console driver support
            <item>Network booting (diskless) support
            <item>YP support
            <item>Full support of the PCI bus
            <item>Loadable kernel modules
            <item>Too many additional utilities and applications to mention
          </itemize>

          &lt;2.X-Current&gt;
          <itemize>
            <item>Serial Console Support
            <item>Merged VM/Buffer Cache
            <item>On demand PPP
            <item>Sync PPP
            <item>Improved SCSI support
          </itemize>

    <sect>Installation

      <sect1>I want to install FreeBSD onto a SCSI disk that has more than
          1024 cylinders.  How do I do it?
          
        <p>
          This depends.  If you don't have DOS (or another operating
          system) on the system, you can just keep the drive in native mode
          and simply make sure that your root partition is below 1024 so
          the BIOS can boot the kernel from it.  It you also have DOS/some
          other OS on the drive then your best bet is to find out what
          parameters that it thinks you have before installing FreeBSD.
          When FreeBSD's installation procedure prompts you for these
          values, you should then enter them rather than simply going with
          the defaults.

          There is a freely available utility distributed with FreeBSD
          called ``<tt/pfdisk/'' (located in the <tt>tools/dos-tools</tt>
          subdirectory) which can be used for this purpose.


      <sect1>When I boot FreeBSD it says ``Missing Operating System''.

        <p>
          See question above.  This is classically a case of FreeBSD and
          DOS or some other OS conflicting over their ideas of disk
          geometry.  You will have to reinstall FreeBSD, but obeying the
          instructions given above will almost always get you going.

      <sect1>When I install the boot manager and try to boot FreeBSD for
          the first time, it just comes back with the boot manager prompt
          again.

        <p>
          This is another symptom of the problem described in the preceding
          question.  Your BIOS geometry and FreeBSD geometry settings do
          not agree!  If your controller or BIOS supports cylinder
          translation (often marked as ``&gt;1GB drive support''), try
          toggling its setting and reinstalling FreeBSD.

      <sect1>I have an IDE drive with lots of bad blocks on it and FreeBSD
          doesn't seem to install properly.

        <p>
          FreeBSD's bad block (the ``<tt/bad144/'' command) handling is
          still not 100&percnt; (to put it charitably) and it must
          unfortunately be said that if you've got an IDE or ESDI drive
          with lots of bad blocks, then FreeBSD is probably not for you!
          That said, it does work on thousands of IDE based systems, so
          you'd do well to try it first before simply giving up.

          IDE drives are <em/supposed/ to come with built-in bad-block
          remapping; if you have documentation for your drive, you may want
          to see if this feature has been disabled on your drive.  However,
          ESDI, RLL, and ST-506 drives normally do not do this.

      <sect1>I have 32MB of memory, should I expect any special problems?
          <label id="bigram">

        <p>
          No.  FreeBSD 2.0 comes with bounce buffers which allows your bus
          mastering controller access to greater than 16MB.

      <sect1>Do I need to install the complete sources? 

        <p> In general, no.  However, we would strongly recommend that you
          install, at a minimum, the ``<tt/base/'' source kit, which
          includes several of the files mentioned here, and the
          ``<tt/sys/'' (kernel) source kit, which includes sources for the
          kernel.  There is nothing in the system which requires the
          presence of the sources to operate, however, except for the
          kernel-configuration program <tt/config(8)/.  With the exception
          of the kernel sources, our build structure is set up so that you
          can read-only mount the sources from elsewhere via NFS and still
          be able to make new binaries.  (Because of the kernel-source
          restriction, we recommend that you not mount this on
          <tt>/usr/src</tt> directly, but rather in some other location
          with appropriate symbolic links to duplicate the top-level
          structure of the source tree.)

          Having the sources on-line and knowing how to build a system with
          them will make it much easier for you to upgrade to future
          releases of FreeBSD.


      <sect1>DES encryption software can not be exported from the United
          States.  If I live outside the US, how can I encrypt passwords?

        <p> If it is not absolutely imperative that you use DES style
          encryption, you can use FreeBSD's default encryption for even
          <bf/better/ security, and with no export restrictions.  FreeBSD
          2.0's password default scrambler is now <bf/MD5/-based, and is
          more CPU-intensive to crack with an automated password cracker
          than DES.

          Since the DES encryption algorithm cannot legally be exported
          from the US, non-US users should not download this software (as
          part of the <tt/secrdist/ from US FTP sites.

          There is however a replacement libcrypt available, based on
          sources written in Australia by David Burren.  This code is now
          available on some non-US FreeBSD mirror sites.  Sources for the
          unencumbered libcrypt, and binaries of the programs which use it,
          can be obtained from the following FTP sites:

          <descrip>
            <tag/South Africa/
              <tt>braae.ru.ac.za:/pub/FreeBSD/securedist/</tt><p>
              <tt>owl.und.ac.za</tt> (currently uncertain)
            <tag/Iceland/
              <tt>ftp.veda.is:/pub/crypt/FreeBSD/</tt>
          </descrip>

          The non-US <tt/securedist/ can be used as a direct replacement
          for the encumbered US <tt/securedist/.  This <tt/securedist/
          package is installed the same way as the US package (see
          installation notes for details).  If you are going to install DES
          encryption, you should do so as soon as possible, before
          installing other software.

          Non-US users should please not download any encryption software
          from the USA.  This can get the maintainers of the sites from
          which the software is downloaded into severe legal difficulties.

          A non-US distribution of Kerberos is also being developed, and
          current versions can generally be obtained by anonymous FTP from
          <tt>braae.ru.ac.za</tt>.

          There is a mailing list for the discussion of non-US encryption
          software.  For more information, send an email message with a
          single line saying ``<tt/help/'' in the body of your message to
          <tt>&lt;majordomo@braae.ru.ac.za&gt;</tt>.

    <sect>Hardware compatibility

      <sect1>What kind of hard drives does FreeBSD run on?

        <p>
          FreeBSD supports ST-506 (sometimes called ``MFM''), RLL, and ESDI
          drives, which are usually connected to WD-1002, WD-1003, or
          WD-1006 controllers (although clones should also work).

          FreeBSD also supports IDE and SCSI hard drives.

      <sect1>What SCSI controllers are supported?

        <p>
          FreeBSD supports the following SCSI controllers:

      <sect1>What CD-ROM drives are supported by FreeBSD?

        <p>
          Any SCSI drive connected to a supported controller.

          Mitsumi LU002 (8bit), LU005 (16bit) and FX001D (16bit 2x Speed).

          &lt;2.X-Current&gt; <newline>
          Sound Blaster Non-SCSI CD-ROM
 
          FreeBSD does not support any of the ``IDE'' CD-ROM interfaces.
          All non-SCSI cards are known to be extremely slow compared to
          SCSI drives.
 
      <sect1>What multi-port serial cards are supported by FreeBSD?

        <p>
          <itemize>
            <item>AST/4
            <item>BOCA 4/8/16 port cards.  
          </itemize>

          &lt;2.X-Current&gt; <newline>
          Cyclades 8/16 port &lt;Alpha&gt;

          Some unnamed clone cards have also been known to work, especially
          those that claim to be AST compatible.

          Check the <tt/sio(4)/ man page to get more information on
          configuring such cards.


      <sect1>Does FreeBSD support the AHA-27xx SCSI adapters from Adaptec?

        <p>
          Yes, though portions of the sources are currenty GPL'd (that is
          to say, distributed under the GNU Public License), so be aware of
          the fact should you wish to distribute kernel binaries compiled
          with it - you <bf/MUST/ also provide the sources to the driver
          with the kernel image to stay legal with the GPL!  This is easily
          enough done by simply including the contents of
          <tt>/usr/src/sys/gnu/&lcub;aic7770,misc&rcub;</tt> on whatever
          media you distribute the kernel.

          We are working to get the GPL restriction removed, but for now
          you should at least be aware of it.

 
      <sect1>I have a Mumbleco bus mouse.  Is it supported and if so, how
          do I set it up for XFree86?

        <p>
          FreeBSD supports the Logitech and ATI Inport bus mice.  You need
          to add the following line to the kernel config file and recompile
          for the Logitech and ATI mice:
          
          <verb>
            device        mse0    at isa? port 0x23c tty irq6 vector mseintr
          </verb>
          
      <sect1>I have a PS/2 mouse (``keyboard'' mouse) (Alternatively: I
          have a laptop with a track-ball mouse).  How do I use it?
          
      <sect1>What types of tape drives are supported under FreeBSD?
          
        <p>
          FreeBSD supports SCSI, QIC-02 and QIC-40/80 (Floppy based) tape
          drives.  This includes 8-mm (aka Exabyte) and DAT drives.
          
      <sect1>What sound cards are supported by FreeBSD?
          
        <p>
          FreeBSD supports the SoundBlaster, SoundBlaster Pro, Pro Audio
          Spectrum 16, AdLib and Gravis UltraSound sound cards. There is
          also limited support for MPU-401 and compatible MIDI cards.  The
          SoundBlaster 16 and SoundBlaster 16 ASP cards are not yet
          supported.
          
          NOTE: This is only for sound!  This driver does not support
          CD-ROMs, SCSI or joysticks on these cards.
          
          
      <sect1>What network cards does FreeBSD support?

        <p>
          There is support for the following cards:

      <sect1>I have a 386/486sx/486SLC machine without a math co-processor.
          Will this cause me any problems?

        <p>
          Generally no, but there are circumstances where you will take a
          hit, either in performance or accuracy of the math emulation code
          (see the section <ref id="emul" name="on FP emulation">).  In
          particular, drawing arcs in X will be VERY slow.  It is highly
          recommended that you lay out the &dollar;50 or so for a math
          co-processor; it's well worth it.

          NOTE: Some math co-processors are better than others.  It pains
          us to say it, but nobody ever got fired for buying Intel.  Unless
          you're sure it works with FreeBSD, beware of clones.

      <sect1>I am about to buy a new machine to run FreeBSD on and want an
          idea of what other people are running. Is there list of other

        <p>
          Yes.  Please look at the file <tt>Systems.FAQ</tt>.  This file is
          a listing of hardware that people are running in their machines.
          Please note, this is a raw listing of equipment that other users
          have sent in, and does not constitute any kind of endorsement by
          the FreeBSD Project.

      <sect1>I have a lap-top with power management.  Can FreeBSD take
          advantage of this?
        <p>
          Yes it can on certain machines.  Please look in the <tt/LINT/

    <sect>Commercial Applications

      <p>
        Note: This section is still very sparse, though we're hoping, of
        course, that companies will add to it! :) The FreeBSD group has no
        financial interest in any of the companies listed here but simply
        lists them as a public service (and feels that commercial interest
        in FreeBSD can have very positive effects on FreeBSD's long-term
        viability).  We encourage commercial software vendors to send their
        entries here for inclusion.


      <sect1>Where can I get Motif for FreeBSD?

        <p>
          You can purchase Motif 1.2.3 for FreeBSD (SWiM) from the ACC
          Bookstore, P.O. Box 3364, Westport CT. 06880.  1-800-546-7274 or
          FAX: 1-203-454-2582

          This software works flawlessly for for FreeBSD 1.1.5 but has
          shown one problem with 2.0 in that the "uil" program core dumps.
          This is apparently because of the way uil is installed, and it's
          quite possible that ACC will have a fixed version by the time you
          read this.  No other compatibility problems with the programs or
          libraries have been found, and ACC can hardly be blamed for
          failing to work perfectly with a brand-new release they haven't
          even seen yet! :)

      <sect1>Are there any commercial X servers for some of the high-end
          graphics cards like the Matrox or &num;9 I-128, or offering
          8/16/24 bit deep pallettes?
          <label id="xinside">
        <p>
          Yes, X Inside Incorporated sells their Accelerated-X product for
          FreeBSD and other Intel based systems.

          This high performance X Server offers easy configuration, support
          for multiple concurrent video boards and is distributed in binary
          form only.

          Price is &dollar;99.50 (promotional price for Linux/FreeBSD
          version) for the 1.1 version, which is available now.

          This product is for FreeBSD 1.1 and runs under 2.0 with the
          FreeBSD 1.1 compatibility libs (``<tt/compat1xdist/'').

      <sect1>Any other applications I might be interested in?

        <p>
          RenderMorphics, Ltd. sells a high-speed 3D rendering package for
          FreeBSD called ``Reality Lab'' (tm).  Send email to

          +44(0)71-251-0939

          This package is also for FreeBSD 1.1.5 but has been tested and
          shown to run under FreeBSD 2.0 with the ``<tt/compat1xdist/''
          installed.

          Thanks must be extended to all of these companies for showing
          enough faith in FreeBSD to port their products to it.  While we
          get no direct benefit from the sales of these products, the
          indirect benefits of FreeBSD proving itself to be a successful
          platform for such commercial interests will be immense!  We wish
          these companies every measure of success, and can only hope that
          others are encouraged to follow suit.

    <sect>User Applications
        
      <sect1>I want to run X, how do I go about it?

        <p>
          First, get the XFree86(tm) distribution of X11R6 from
          XFree86.cdrom.com The version you want for FreeBSD 2.X and
          later is <tt/XFree86 3.1.1/.  Follow the instructions for
          installation carefully. You may then wish to read the
          documentation for the <tt/ConfigXF86/ tool, which assists you in
          configuring XFree86(tm) for your particular graphics
          card/mouse/etc.

          You may also wish to investigate the Xaccel server, which is
          available at a very reasonable price.  See section
          <ref id="xinside" name="on Xaccel"> for more details.

      <sect1>I've been trying to run ghostscript on a 386 (or 486sx) with
          no math co-processor and I keep getting errors. What's up? <label
          id="emul">

        <p>
          You will need to add the alternate math emulator to your kernel,
          you do this by adding the following to your kernel config file
          and it will be compiled in.

          <verb>
            options GPL_MATH_EMULATE
          </verb>

          NOTE: You will need to remove the MATH_EMULATE option when you do
          this.

      <sect1>I want all this neat software, but I haven't got the space or
          CPU power to compile it all myself.  Is there any way of getting
          binaries?

        <p>
          Yes.  We support the concept of a ``package'', which is
          essentially a gzipped binary distribution with a little extra
          intelligence embedded in it for doing any custom installation
          work required.  Packages can also be installed or deinstalled
          again easily without having to know the gory details.  CDROM
          people will have a <tt>packages/</tt> directory on their CD,
          others can get the currently available packages from:

          <verb>
            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/packages
          </verb>

          Note that all ports may not be available as packages, and that
          new packages are constantly being added.  It is always a good
          idea to check periodically to see which packages are available.
          A <tt/README/ file in the packages directory provides more
          details on the care and feeding of the package software, so no
          explicit details will be given here.

    <sect>Miscellaneous Questions

      <sect1>I've heard of something called FreeBSD-current.  How do I run
          it, and where can I get more information?

        <p>
          Read the file <tt>/usr/src/share/FAQ/current-policy.FAQ</tt>,
          it will tell you all you need to know.
          
      <sect1>What is this thing called ``<tt/sup/'', and how do I use it?

        <p>
          SUP stands for Software Update Protocol, and was developed by CMU
          for keeping their development trees in sync.  We use it to keep
          remote sites in sync with our central development sources.

          Unless you have direct internet connectivity, and don't care too
          much about the cost/duration of the sessions, you shouldn't use
          sup.  For those ``low/expensive-bandwidth'' applications, we have
          developed <tt/CTM/, see the section <ref id="ctm" name="on CTM">
          for more about that.

          To use it, you need to have direct internet connectivity (not
          just mail or news).  First, pick up the <tt/sup.tgz/ package
          from:

          <verb>
            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/packages/sup.tgz
          </verb>

          Second, read the file <tt>/usr/src/share/FAQ/sup.FAQ</tt>.

          This file describes how to setup sup on your machine.  You may
          also want to look at
          <tt>/usr/src/share/FAQ/extras/*.supfile</tt>, or you may grab
          updated supfiles from:

          <verb>
            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/FAQ/extras
          </verb>

          which are a set of supfiles for supping from <tt/FreeBSD.ORG/.


      <sect1>How do I create customized installation disks that I can give
          out to other people at my site?

        <p>
          The entire process of creating installation disks and source and
          binary archives is automated by various targets in
          <tt>/usr/src/etc/Makefile</tt>.  The information there should be
          enough to get you started.

      <sect1>How do I re-build my system without clobbering the existing
          installed binaries?

        <p>
          If you define the environment variable <tt/DESTDIR/ while running
          ``<tt/make world/'' or ``<tt/make install/'', the newly-created
          binaries will be deposited in a directory tree identical to the
          installed one, rooted at <tt>&dollar;&lcub;DESTDIR&rcub;</tt>.
          Some random combination of shared libraries modifications and
          program rebuilds can cause this to fail in ``<tt/make world/'',
          however.


      <sect1>When my system booted, it told me that ``(bus speed
          defaulted)''.  What does that mean?

        <p>
          The Adaptec 1542 SCSI host adapters allow the user to configure
          their bus access speed in software.  Previous versions of the
          1542 driver tried to determine the fastest usable speed and set
          the adapter to that.  We found that this breaks some users'
          systems, so you now have to define the ``<tt/TUNE_1542/'' kernel
          configuration option in order to have this take place.  Using it
          on those systems where it works may make your disks run faster,
          but on those systems where it doesn't, your data could be
          corrupted.

      <sect1>I would like to track changes to current and do not have net
          access.  Is there any way besides downloading the whole tree?
          <label id="ctm">

        <p>
          Yes, you can use the <tt/CTM/ facility.  Check out the
          <tt/ctm.FAQ/ file or
          <verb>
            ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/CTM/README
          </verb>
          for more information.

      <sect1>How do I split up large binary files into smaller 240k files
          like the distribution does?

        <p>
          Newer BSD based systems have a ``<tt/-b/'' option to split that
          allows them to split files on arbitary byte bondaries.

          Here is an example from <tt>/usr/src/Makefile</tt>.

          <verb>
            bin-tarball:
            (cd $&lcub;DISTDIR&rcub;; \
            tar cf - . \
            gzip --no-name -9 -c | \
            split -b 240640 - \
            $&lcub;RELEASEDIR&rcub;/tarballs/bindist/bin_tgz.)
          </verb>

      <sect1>&lt;XXX&gt; I've had a couple of system panics and would like
          to be able browse the system dumps.  The normal kernel is
          stripped and I don't want to run a bloated kernel.  What can I
          do?</>

      <sect1>I just got a Perl application and it's bombing looking for
          <tt/*.ph/.  Where is it?

        <p>
          There was a minor SNAFU in the 2.0-R bindist and they got left
          out.  If you have the source, you just have to do a ``<tt/make
          install/'' from <tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/perl/lib</tt> and
          everything will be fine.  Or you may ftp to
          <tt/phoenix-gw.gbdata.com/ and grab them from
          <tt>~/pub/perl/libs.tar.gz</tt>.

      <sect1>I've got this neato kernel extension I just know everyone will
          will want.  How do I get it included into the distribution?
        <p>
          Please take a look at the FAQ for submiting code to FreeBSD at:
          <verb>
            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD/FAQ/submitters.FAQ
          </verb>
          And thanks for the thought.

      </sect1>

    <sect>Kernel Configuration
      <p>
      <sect1>Ok, so how DO I compile my own kernel, anyway? <label
            id="make-kernel">
        <p>
          Before you can compile a kernel, you need either the complete
          <tt/srcdist/ or, at the minimum, the <tt/kerndist/ loaded on your
          system.  This provides the necessary sources for building the
          kernel, as we have a policy of <bf/NOT/ shipping our kernels in
          linkable object form as most commercial UNIX vendors do.
          Shipping the source takes a bit more space, but it also means
          that you can refer to the actual kernel sources in case of
          difficulty or to further your understanding of what's
          <bf/actually/ happening.

          Anyway, to answer the question, once you have the <tt/kerndist/
          or <tt/srcdist/ loaded, do this:

          <enum>
            <item> <tt>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</tt>
            <item> <tt/cp GENERIC MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt/vi MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt/config MYKERNEL/
            <item> <tt>cd ../../compile/MYKERNEL</tt>
            <item> <tt/make all/
            <item> <tt/make install/
            <item> <tt/reboot/
          </enum>

          Step 2 may not be necessary if you already have a kernel
          configuration file from a previous release of FreeBSD 2.x. -
          simply bring your old one over and check it carefully for any
          drivers that may have changed boot syntax or been rendered
          obsolete.

          A good kernel config file to look into is <tt/LINT/, which
          contains entries for <bf/all/ possible kernel options and
          documents them fairly well.  The <tt/GENERIC/ kernel config file
          is used to build the initial release you probably loaded (unless
          you upgraded in-place) and contains entries for the most common
          configurations.  It's a pretty good place to start from.

          If you don't need to make any changes to <tt/GENERIC/, you can
          also skip step 3, where you customize the kernel for your
          configuration.  Step 7 should only be undertaken if step 6
          succeeds.  This will copy the new kernel image to
          <tt>/kernel</tt> and <bf/BACK UP YOUR OLD ONE IN/
          <tt>/kernel.old</tt>!  It's very important to remember this in
          case the new kernel fails to work for some reason - you can still
          select <tt>/kernel.old</tt> at the boot prompt to boot the old
          one.  When you reboot, the new kernel will boot by default.

          If the compile in 6 falls over for some reason, then it's
          recommended that you start from step 4 but substitute
          <tt/GENERIC/ for <tt/MYKERNEL/.  If you can generate a
          <tt/GENERIC/ kernel, then it's likely something in your special
          configuration file that's bad (or you've uncovered a bug!).  If
          the build of the <tt/GENERIC/ kernel does <bf/NOT/ succeed, then
          it's very likely that your sources are somehow corrupted.

          Finally, if you need to see your original boot messages again to
          compile a new kernel that's better tailored to your hardware, try
          the <tt/dmesg(8)/ command.  It should print out all the boot-time
          messages printed by your old kernel, some of which may be quite
          helpful in configuring the new one.

      <sect1>When I compile a kernel with multi-port serial code, it tells
          me that only the first port is probed and the rest skipped due to
          interrupt conflicts.  How do I fix this?

        <p>
          The problem here is that FreeBSD has code built-in to keep the
          kernel from getting trashed due t hardware or software
          conflicts.  The way to fix this is to leave out the IRQ settings
          on other ports besides the first.  Here is a example:

<verb>
#
# Multiport high-speed serial line - 16550 UARTS
#
device    sio2    at isa? port 0x2a0 tty irq 5 flags 0x501 vector siointr
device    sio3    at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr 
device    sio4    at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr
device    sio5    at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x501 vector siointr
</verb>

      <sect1>FreeBSD is supposed to come with support for QIC-40/80 drives
          but when I look, I can't find it.

        <p>
          You need to uncomment the following line in the generic config
          file (or add it to your config file), add a ``<tt/flags 0x1/''

          Next, you create a device called <tt>/dev/ft0</tt> by going into
          <tt>/dev</tt> and run the following command:

          <verb>
            sh MAKEDEV ft0
          </verb>

          for the first device. <tt/ft1/ for a second one and so on.

          You will have a device called <tt>/dev/ft0</tt>, which you can
          write to through a special program to manage it called
          ``<tt/ft/'' - see the man page on <tt/ft/ for further details.
          Versions previous to <tt/-current/ also had some trouble dealing
          wiht bad tape media; if you have trouble where <tt/ft/ seems to
          go back and forth over the same spot, try grabbing the latest
          version of <tt/ft/ from <tt>/usr/src/sbin/ft</tt> in
          <tt/-current/ and try that.


      <sect1>Does FreeBSD support IPC primitives like those in System V?

        <p>
          Yes, FreeBSD supports System V-style IPC.  This includes shared
          memory, messages and semaphores.  You need to add the following
          lines to your kernel config to enable them.

          <verb>
            options    SYSVSHM
            options    "SHMMAXPGS=64"   # 256Kb of sharable memory
            options    SYSVSEM          # enable for semaphores
            options    SYSVMSG          # enable for messaging
          </verb>

          Recompile and install.

      <sect1>Will FreeBSD ever support other architectures?

        <p>
          Several different groups have expressed interest in working on
          multi-architecture support for FreeBSD.  If you are interested in
          doing so, please contact the developers at
          <tt>&lt;hackers@FreeBSD.ORG&gt;</tt> for more information on our
          strategy for porting.

      <sect1>I just wrote a device driver for a Foobar Systems, Inc.
          Integrated Adaptive Gronkulator card.  How do I get the
          appropriate major numbers assigned?

        <p>
          This depends on whether or not you plan on making the driver
          publicly available.  If you do, then please send us a copy of the
          driver source code, plus the appropriate modifications to
          <tt>files.i386</tt>, a sample configuration file entry, and the
          appropriate <tt>MAKEDEV</tt> code to create any special files
          your device uses.  If you do not, or are unable to because of
          licensing restrictions, then character major number 32 and block
          major number 8 have been reserved specifically for this purpose;
          please use them.  In any case, we'd appreciate hearing about your

      <sect1>My keyboard mappings are wrong for my system. How can I fix
          them?
        <p>
          The kbdcontrol program has an option to load a keyboard map file.
          Under <tt>/usr/share/syscons/keymaps</tt> are a number of map
          files.  Choose the one relevant to your system and load it.

          <verb>
            kbdcontrol -l uk.iso
          </verb>
          Both the <tt>/usr/share/syscons/keymaps</tt> and the <tt/.kbd/
          extension are assumed by <tt/kbdcontrol(1)/.

          This could be run at boot time by adding the command to
          <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>

          <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> also has a comment at the end of it
          relating to loading fonts/keyboard examples. See
          <tt>/usr/share/examples/syscons</tt>.

          The following mappings are currently supported:
          <itemize>
            <item>Danish (both ISO and cp865),
            <item>French (ISO only),

    <sect>Networking

      <sect1>Where can I get information booting FreeBSD ``diskless'', that
          is booting and running a FreeBSD box from a server rather than
          having a local disk?

        <p>
          Please read <tt>/sys/i386/boot/netboot/netboot.doc</tt>.

      <sect1>I've heard that you can use a FreeBSD box as a dedicated
          network router - is there any easy support for this?

        <p>
          Internet standards and good engineering practice prohibit us from
          providing packet forwarding by default in FreeBSD.  You can
          enable this support by adding ``<tt/options GATEWAY/'' to your
          kernel configuration file and recompiling.  In most cases, you
          will also need to run a routing process to tell other systems on
          your network about your router; FreeBSD comes with the standard
          BSD routing daemon <tt/routed(8)/, or for more complex situations
          you may want to try <em/GaTeD/ (available by FTP from
          <tt/gated.Cornell.edu/) which supports FreeBSD as of 3_5Alpha7.

          It is our duty to warn you that, even when FreeBSD is configured
          in this way, it does not completely comply with the Internet
          standard requirements for routers; however, it comes close enough
          for ordinary usage.

      <sect1>Does FreeBSD support SLIP and PPP?</>

        <p>
          Yes.  See the man pages for <tt/slattach(8)/ and/or <tt/pppd(8)/
          if you're using FreeBSD to connect to another site.  If you're
          using FreeBSD as a server for other machines, look at the man
          page for <tt/sliplogin(8)/.  You may also want to take a look at
          the slip FAQ in:

      <sect1>How do I get my network set up? I don't see how to make my
          <tt>/dev/ed0</tt> device!

        <p>
          In the Berkeley networking framework, network interfaces are only
          directly accessible by kernel code.  Please see the
          <tt>/etc/netstart</tt> file and the manual pages for the various
          network programs mentioned there for more information.  If this
          leaves you totally confused, then you should pick up a book
          describing network administration on another BSD-related
          operating system; with few significant exceptions, administering
          networking on FreeBSD is basically the same as on SunOS 4.0 or
          Ultrix.

      <sect1>How do I get my 3C503 to use the other network port?

        <p>
          Use ``<tt/ifconfig ed0/'' to see whether the ALTPHYS flag is set,
          and then use either ``<tt/ifconfig ed0 altphys/'' if it was off,
          or ``<tt/ifconfig ed0 -altphys/'' if it was on.

      <sect1>I'm having problems with NFS to/from FreeBSD and my
          Wuffotronics Workstation / generic NFS appliance, where should I
          look first?

        <p>
          Certain PC network cards are better than others (to put it
          mildly) and can sometimes cause problems with network intensive
          applications like NFS.

          See <tt>/usr/src/share/FAQ/NFS.FAQ</tt> for more information on
          this topic.

      <sect1>I want to enable IP multicast support on my FreeBSD box, how
          do I do it?  (Alternatively: What the heck IS multicasting and
          what applications make use of it?)

        <p>
          Multicast host operations are fully supported in FreeBSD 2.0 by
          default.  If you want your box to run as a multicast router, you
          will need to load the <tt/ip_mroute_mod/ loadable kernel module
          and run <tt/mrouted/.

    <sect> Serial Communications
      <p>
        This section answers common questions about serial communications
        with FreeBSD.

      <sect1> How do I tell if FreeBSD found my serial ports or modem
          cards?
        <p>
          As the FreeBSD kernel boots, it will probe for the serial ports
          in your system for which the kernel was configured.  You can
          either watch your system closely for the messages it prints or
          run the command
          <verb>
            dmesg | grep sio
          </verb>
          after your system's up and running.

          Here's some example output from the above command:
          <verb>
            sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
            sio0: type 16550A
            sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
            sio1: type 16550A
          </verb>

          This shows two serial ports.  The first is on irq 4, is using
          port address <tt/0x3f8/, and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The
          second uses the same kind of chip but is on irq 3 and is at port
          address <tt/0x2f8/.  Internal modem cards are treated just like
          serial ports---except that they always have a modem ``attached''
          to the port.

          The <tt/GENERIC/ kernel includes support for two serial ports
          using the same irq and port address settings in the above
          example.  If these settings aren't right for your system, or if
          you've added modem cards or have more serial ports than your
          kernel is configured for, just reconfigure your kernel.  See
          section <ref id="make-kernel" name="about building a kernel"> for
          more details.

      <sect1> How do I access the serial ports once FreeBSD is running?
        <p>
          The third serial port, <tt/sio2/ (known as COM3 in DOS), is on
          <tt>/dev/tty02</tt> for directly-connected devices, on
          <tt>/dev/cuaa2</tt> for dial-out devices, and on
          <tt>/dev/ttyd2</tt> for dial-in devices.  What's the difference
          between these three classes of devices?

          You use <tt/ttyXX /for directly-connected or hardwired devices,
          like printers or terminals.

          In place of <tt/ttyXX/, you can use the pair of devices
          <tt/cuaaX/ and <tt/ttydX/.  You use <tt/ttydX/ for dial-ins.  The
          <tt/ttydX/ device acts like the <tt/ttyXX/ device, but it also
          uses the modem control lines.  When opening <tt>/dev/ttydX</tt>
          in blocking mode, a process will wait for the corresponding
          <tt/cuaaX/ device to become inactive, and then wait for the
          carrier detect line to go active.  When you open the <tt/cuaaX/
          device, it makes sure the serial port isn't already in use by the
          <tt/ttydX/ device.  If the port's available, it ``steals'' it
          from the <tt/ttydX/ device.  Also, the <tt/cuaXX/ device doesn't
          care about carrier detect.  With this scheme and an auto-answer
          modem, you can have remote users log in and you can still dialout
          with the same modem and the system will take care of all the
          conflicts.

      <sect1> How do I configure the kernel for my multiport serial card?
        <p>
          Again, the section on kernel configuration provides information
          about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport serial card,
          place an <tt/sio/ line for each serial port on the card in the
          kernel configuration file.  But place the irq and vector
          specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports on the
          card should share one irq.  For consistency, use the last serial
          port to specify the irq.  Also, specify the
          <tt/COM&lowbar;MULTIPORT/ option.

          The following example is for an AST 4-port serial card on irq 7:
          <verb>
            options "COM_MULTIPORT"
            device sio4 at isa? port 0x2a0 tty flags 0x781
            device sio5 at isa? port 0x2a8 tty flags 0x781
            device sio6 at isa? port 0x2b0 tty flags 0x781
            device sio7 at isa? port 0x2b8 tty flags 0x781 irq 7 vector siointr
          </verb>
          The flags indicate that the master port has minor number 7
          (<tt/0x700/), diagnostics enabled during probe (<tt/0x080/), and
          all the ports share an irq (<tt/0x001/).

      <sect1> I have two multiport serial cards that can share irqs. Can
          FreeBSD handle this?
        <p>
          Not yet. You'll have to use a different irq for each card.

      <sect1> What's the difference between <tt/ttyd1/, <tt/ttyid1/, and
          <tt/ttyld1/?  Or, how can I set the default serial parameters for
          a port?
        <p>
          The <tt/ttyXX/ (or <tt/cuaaX/ or <tt/ttydX/) device is the
          regular device you'll want to open for your applications.  When a
          process opens the device, it'll have a default set of terminal
          I/O settings.  You can see these settings with the command
          <verb>
            stty -a -f /dev/tty01
          </verb>

          When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in
          effect until the device is closed.  When it's reopened, it goes
          back to the default set.  To make changes to the default set, you
          can open and adjust the settings of the ``initial state'' device.
          For example, to turn on <tt/CLOCAL/ mode, 8 bits, and
          <tt>XON/XOFF</tt> flow control by default for tty05, do:
          <verb>
            stty -f /dev/ttyi05 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff
          </verb>

          A good place to do this is in <tt>/etc/rc.serial</tt>. Now, an
          application will have these settings by default when it opens
          <tt/tty05/.  It can still change these settings to its liking,
          though.

          You can also prevent certain settings from being changed by an
          application by making adjustments to the ``lock state'' device.
          For example, to lock the speed of <tt/tty05/ to 57600 bps, do
          <verb>
            stty -f /dev/ttyl05 57600
          </verb>

          Now, an application that opens <tt/tty05/ and tries to change the
          speed of the port will be stuck with 57600 bps.

          Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state
          devices writable only by <tt/root/. The <tt/MAKEDEV/ script does
          <bf/NOT/ do this when it creates the device entries.

      <sect1> How can I enable dialup logins on my modem?
        <p>
          So you want to become an Internet service provider, eh?  First,
          you'll need one or more modems that can autoanswer.  Your modem
          will need to assert carrier-detect when it detects a carrier and
          not assert it all the time.  It will need to hang up the phone
          and reset itself when the data terminal ready (<tt/DTR/) line
          goes from on to off.  It should probably use <tt>RTS/CTS</tt>
          flow control or no local flow control at all.  Finally, it must
          use a constant speed between the computer and itself, but (to be
          nice to your callers) it should negotiate a speed between itself
          and the remote modem.

          For many Hayes command-set--compatible modems, this command will
          make these settings and store them in nonvolatile memory:
          <verb>
            AT &ero;C1 &ero;D3 &ero;K3 &ero;Q6 S0=1 &ero;W
          </verb>
          See the section <ref id="direct-at" name="on sending AT
          commands"> below for information on how to make these settings
          without resorting to an MS-DOS terminal program.

          Next, make an entry in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> for the modem.  This
          file lists all the ports on which the operating system will await
          logins.  Add a line that looks something like this:
          <verb>
            ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.57600" dialup on insecure
          </verb>
          This line indicates that the second serial port
          (<tt>/dev/ttyd1</tt>) has a modem connected running at 57600 bps
          and no parity (<tt/std.57600/, which comes from the file
          <tt>/etc/gettytab</tt>). The terminal type for this port is
          ``dialup.''  The port is ``on'' and is ``insecure''---meaning
          root logins on the port aren't allowed.  For dialin ports like
          this one, use the <tt/ttydX/ entry.

          It's common practice to use ``dialup'' as the terminal type.
          Many users set up in their .profile or .login files a prompt for
          the actual terminal type if the starting type is dialup.  The
          example shows the port as insecure.  To become root on this port,
          you have to login as a regular user, then ``<tt/su/'' to
          <tt/root/.  If you use ``secure'' then <tt/root/ can login in
          directly.

          After making modifications to <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, you need to
          send a hangup or <tt/HUP/ signal to the <tt/init/ process:
          <verb>
            kill -1 1
          </verb>
          This forces the init process to reread <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>.  The
          init process will then start getty processes on all ``on'' ports.
          You can find out if logins are available for your port by typing
          <verb>
            ps -ax | grep '[t]tyd1'
          </verb>

          You should see something like:
          <verb>
            747 ??  I      0:00.04 /usr/libexec/getty std.57600 ttyd1

          my FreeBSD box?
        <p>
          If you're using another computer as a terminal into your FreeBSD
          system, get a null modem cable to go between the two serial
          ports.  If you're using an actual terminal, see its accompanying
          instructions.

          Then, modify <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>, like above.  For example, if
          you're hooking up a WYSE-50 terminal to the fifth serial port,
          use an entry like this:
          <verb>
            tty04 "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400" wyse50 on secure
          </verb>
          This example shows that the port on <tt>/dev/tty04</tt> has a
          wyse50 terminal connected at 38400 bps with no parity
          (<tt/std.38400/ from <tt>/etc/gettytab</tt>) and <tt/root/ logins
          are allowed (secure).  For directly-connected terminals, use the
          <tt/ttyXX/ entry.

      <sect1>  Why can't I run <tt/tip/ or <tt/cu/?
        <p>
          On your system, the programs <tt/tip/ and <tt/cu/ are probably
          executable only by <tt/uucp/ and group <tt/dialer/.  You can use
          the group <tt/dialer/ to control who has access to your modem or
          remote systems.  Just add yourself to group dialer.

          Alternatively, you can let everyone on your system run <tt/tip/
          and <tt/cu/ by typing:
          <verb>
            chmod 4511 /usr/bin/tip
          </verb>
          You don't have to run this command for <tt/cu/, since <tt/cu/ is
          just a hard link to <tt/tip/.

      <sect1> My stock Hayes modem isn't supported---what should I do?
        <p>
          Actually, the man page for <tt/tip/ is out of date.  There is a
          generic Hayes dialer already built in.  Just use
          ``<tt/at=hayes/'' in your <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.

          The Hayes driver isn't smart enough to recognize some of the
          advanced features of newer modems---messages like <tt/BUSY/,
          <tt/NO DIALTONE/, or <tt/CONNECT 115200/ will just confuse it.
          You should turn those messages off when you use <tt/tip/ (using
          <tt/ATX0&amp;W/).

          Also, the dial timeout for <tt/tip/ is 60 seconds.  Your modem
          should use something less, or else tip will think there's a
          communication problem.  Try <tt/ATS7=45&amp;W/.

      <sect1> How am I expected to enter these AT commands without resorting
          to some DOS-based terminal program? <label id="direct-at">
        <p>
          Make what's called a ``<tt/direct/'' entry in your
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.  For example, if your modem's hooked
          up to the first serial port, <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt>, then put in the
          following line:
          <verb>
            cuaa0:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#19200:pa=none
          </verb>
          Use the highest bps rate your modem supports in the br
          capability.  Then, type ``<tt/tip cuaa0/'' and you'll be
          connected to your modem.

          If there is no <tt>/dev/cuaa0</tt> on your system, do this:
          <verb>
            cd /dev
            MAKEDEV cuaa0
          </verb>

      <sect1> Why doesn't the <tt/@/ sign for the phone number capability
          work?
        <p>
          The <tt/@/ sign in the pn capability tells tip to look in
          <tt>/etc/phones</tt> for a phone number.  But the <tt/@/ sign is
          also a special character in capability files like
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt>.  Escape it with a backslash:
          <verb>
            pn=\@
          </verb>

      <sect1> How can I dial a phone number on the command line?
        <p>
          Put what's called a ``<tt/generic/'' entry in your
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt> file.  For example:
          <verb>
            tip115200|Dial any phone number at 115200 bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#115200:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
            tip57600|Dial any phone number at 57600 bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
          </verb>

          Then you can things like ``<tt/tip -115200 5551234/''.  If you
          prefer <tt/cu/ over <tt/tip/, use a generic cu entry:
          <verb>
            cu115200|Use cu to dial any number at 115200bps:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa1:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
          </verb>
          and type ``<tt/cu 5551234 -s 115200/''.

      <sect1> Great---but how can I do that without having to specify the
          bps rate on the command line?
        <p>
          Put in an entry for <tt/tip1200/ or <tt/cu1200/, but go ahead and
          use whatever bps rate is appropriate with the br
          capability. <tt/tip/ thinks a good default is 1200 bps which is
          why it looks for a ``<tt/tip1200/'' entry.  You don't have to use
          1200 bps, though.

      <sect1> I want separate entries for various hosts I access through a
          terminal server, but I don't want to type ``<tt/CONNECT
          &lt;host&gt;/'' each time once I'm connected. Can <tt/tip/ do
          that for me?
        <p>
          Yes. Use the <tt/cm/ capability. For example, these entries in
          <tt>/etc/remote</tt>:
          <verb>
            pain|pain.deep13.com|Forrester's machine:\
            :cm=CONNECT pain\n:tc=deep13:
            muffin|muffin.deep13.com|Frank's machine:\
            :cm=CONNECT muffin\n:tc=deep13:
            deep13:Gizmonics Institute terminal server:\
            :dv=/dev/cua02:br#38400:at=hayes:du:pa=none:pn=5551234:
          </verb>

          will let you type ``<tt/tip pain/'' or ``<tt/tip muffin/'' to
          connect to the hosts pain or muffin; and ``<tt/tip deep13/'' to
          get to the terminal server.

      <sect1> My university has 42 billion students but only 4 modem lines.
          Can tip automatically try each line?
        <p>
          Sure.  Make an entry for your university in <tt>/etc/remote</tt>
          and use <tt>\@</tt> for the <tt/pn/ capability:
          <verb>
            big-university:\
            :pn=\@:tc=dialout
            dialout:\
            :dv=/dev/cuaa3:br#9600:at=courier:du:pa=none:
          </verb>

          Then, list the phone numbers for the university in
          <tt>/etc/phones</tt>:
          <verb>
            big-university 5551111
            big-university 5551112
            big-university 5551113
            big-university 5551114
          </verb>

          <tt/tip/ will try each one in the listed order, then give up.  If
          you want to keep retrying, run <tt/tip/ in a while loop.

      <sect1> How come I have to hit CTRL+P twice to send CTRL+P once?
        <p>
          CTRL+P is the default ``force'' character, used to tell <tt/tip/
          that the next character is literal data.  You can set the force
          character to any other character with the <tt/~s/ escape, which
          means ``set a variable.''

          Type ``<tt/~sforce=&lt;single-char&gt;/'' followed by a newline.
          <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is any single character.  If you leave
          out <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/, then the force character is the nul
          character, which you can get by typing CTRL+2 or CTRL+SPACE.  A
          pretty good value for <tt/&lt;single-char&gt;/ is SHIFT+CTRL+6,
          which I've seen only used on some terminal servers.

          You can have the force character be whatever you want by
          specifying the following in your <tt>&dollar;HOME/.tiprc</tt>
          file:
          <verb>
            force=<single-char>
          </verb>

      <sect1> Suddenly everything I type is all UPPER CASE.  What gives?
        <p>
          You must've pressed CTRL+A, <tt/tip/'s ``raise character,''
          specially designed for people with broken caps-lock keys. Use
          <tt/~s/ as above and set the variable ``raisechar'' to something
          reasonable.  In fact, you can set it to the same as the force
          character, if you never expect to use either of these features.

          Here's a sample .tiprc file perfect for Emacs users who need to
          type CTRL+2 and CTRL+A a lot:
          <verb>
            force=^^
            raisechar=^^
          </verb>
          The ^^ is SHIFT+CTRL+6.

      <sect1> How can I do file transfers with <tt/tip/?
        <p>
          If you're talking to another UNIX system, you can send and
          receive files with <tt/~p/ (put) and <tt/~t/ (take).  These
          commands run ``<tt/cat/'' and ``<tt/echo/'' on the remote system
          to accept and send files.  The syntax is:
          <verb>
            ~p <local-file> [<remote-file>]
            ~t <remote-file> [<local-file>]
          </verb>

          There's no error checking, so you probably should use another
          protocol, like zmodem.

      <sect1> Okay, how can I run zmodem with <tt/tip/?
        <p>
          To receive files, start the sending program on the remote end.
          Then, type ``<tt/~C rz/'' to begin receiving them locally.

          To send files, start the receiving program on the remote end.
          Then, type ``<tt/~C sz &lt;files&gt;/'' to send them to the
          remote system.
