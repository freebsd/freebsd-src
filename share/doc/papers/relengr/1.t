Introduction
.PP
The Computer Systems Research Group (\c
.SM CSRG )
has always been a small group of software developers.
This resource limitation requires careful software-engineering management
as well as careful coordination of both
.SM CSRG
personnel and the members of the general community who
contribute to the development of the system.
.PP
Releases from Berkeley alternate between those that introduce
major new facilities and those that provide bug fixes and efficiency
improvements.
This alternation allows timely releases, while providing for refinement,
tuning, and correction of the new facilities.
The timely followup of ``cleanup'' releases reflects the importance
.SM CSRG
places on providing a reliable and robust system on which its
user community can depend.
.PP
The development of the Berkeley Software Distribution (\c
.SM BSD )
illustrates an \fIadvantage\fP of having a few
principal developers:
the developers all understand the entire system thoroughly enough
to be able to coordinate their own work with
that of other people to produce a coherent final system.
Companies with large development organizations find
this result difficult to duplicate.
This paper describes the process by which
the development effort for \*(b3 was managed.
