This paper describes how the \fIgprof\fP profiler 
accounts for the running time of called routines
in the running time of the routines that call them.
It then explains how to configure a profiling kernel on
the 4.2 Berkeley Software Distribution of 
.UX
for the VAX\(dd

and discusses tradeoffs in techniques for collecting
profile data.
\fIGprof\fP identifies problems
that severely affects the overall performance of the kernel.
Once a potential problem areas is identified
benchmark programs are devised to highlight the bottleneck.
These benchmarks verify that the problem exist and provide
a metric against which to validate proposed solutions.
Two caches are added to the kernel to alleviate the bottleneck
and \fIgprof\fP is used to validates their effectiveness.
