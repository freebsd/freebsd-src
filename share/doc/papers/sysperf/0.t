had several problems that could severely affect the overall
performance of the system.
These problems were identified with
kernel profiling and system tracing during day to day use.
Once potential problem areas had been identified
benchmark programs were devised to highlight the bottlenecks.
These benchmarks verified that the problems existed and provided
a metric against which to validate proposed solutions.
This paper examines 
the performance problems encountered and describes
modifications that have been made
to the system since the initial distribution.
.PP
The changes to the system have consisted of improvements to the
performance of the existing facilities,
as well as enhancements to the current facilities.
Performance improvements in the kernel include cacheing of path name
translations, reductions in clock handling and scheduling overhead,
and improved throughput of the network subsystem.
Performance improvements in the libraries and utilities include replacement of
linear searches of system databases with indexed lookup,
merging of most network services into a single daemon,
and conversion of system utilities to use the more efficient
facilities available in 4.2BSD.
Enhancements in the kernel include the addition of subnets and gateways,
increases in many kernel limits,
cleanup of the signal and autoconfiguration implementations,
and support for windows and system logging.
Functional extensions in the libraries and utilities include
the addition of an Internet name server,
new system management tools,
and extensions to \fIdbx\fP to work with Pascal.
The paper concludes with a brief discussion of changes made to
the system to enhance security.
All of these enhancements are present in Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD.
