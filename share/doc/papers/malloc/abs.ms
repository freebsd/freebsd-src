Malloc/free is one of the oldest parts of the C language environment
and obviously the world has changed a bit since it was first made.
The fact that most UNIX kernels have changed from swap/segment to
virtual memory/page based memory management has not been sufficiently
reflected in the implementations of the malloc/free API.
.PP
A new implementation was designed, written, tested and bench-marked
with an eye on the workings and performance characteristics of modern
Virtual Memory systems.
