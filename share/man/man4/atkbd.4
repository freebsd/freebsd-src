.Sh NAME
.Nm atkbd
.Nd the AT keyboard interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP"
.Cd "makeoptions ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=_keymap_name_"
.Cd "options KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOAD"
.Cd "device atkbd"
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.atkbd.0.at="atkbdc"
.Cd hint.atkbd.0.irq="1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver, together with the
.Nm atkbdc
driver, provides access to the AT 84 keyboard or the AT enhanced keyboard
which is connected to the AT keyboard controller.
.Pp
This driver is required for the console driver
.Xr syscons 4
or
.Xr vt 4 .
.Pp
There can be only one
.Nm
device defined in the kernel configuration file.
This device also requires the
.Nm atkbdc
keyboard controller to be present.
The
.Em irq
number must always be 1; there is no provision of changing the number.
.Ss Function Keys
The AT keyboard has a number of function keys.
They are numbered as follows and can be associated with strings
by the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
command.
You can use a keyboard map file (see
.Xr kbdmap 5 )
to map them to arbitrary keys, particularly
the functions in the range from 65 to 96
which are not used by default.

See the man page for the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
command for how to assign a string to the function key.
.Sh DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.Ss Kernel Configuration Options
The following kernel configuration options control the
.Nm
driver.
.Bl -tag -width ATKBD_DFLT
.It Em ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP
This option sets the default, built-in keymap of the
.Nm
driver to the named keymap.
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
below.
.It Em KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOAD
The keymap can be modified by the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
command.
This option will disable this feature and prevent the user from
changing key assignment.
.El
.Ss Driver Flags
The
.Nm
driver accepts the following driver flags.
They can be set either in
.Pa /boot/device.hints ,
or else from within the boot loader
(see
.Xr loader 8 ) .
.Bl -tag -width FAIL
.It bit 0 (FAIL_IF_NO_KBD)
By default the
.Nm
driver will install even if a keyboard is not actually connected to the
system.
This option prevents the driver from being installed in this situation.
.It bit 1 (NO_RESET)
When this option is given, the
.Nm
driver will not reset the keyboard when initializing it.
It may be useful for laptop computers whose function keys
have special functions and these functions are forgotten when the
keyboard is reset.
.It bit 2 (ALT_SCANCODESET)
Certain keyboards, such as those on some ThinkPad models, behave
like the old XT keyboard and require this option.
.It bit 3 (NO_PROBE_TEST)
When this option is given, the
.Nm
driver will not test the keyboard port during the probe routine.
Some machines hang during boot when this test is performed.
.El
.\".Sh FILES
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm
driver requires the keyboard controller
.Nm atkbdc .
Thus, the kernel configuration file should contain the following lines.
.Pp
.Dl "device atkbdc"
.Dl "device atkbd"
.Pp
The following example shows how to set the default, built-in keymap
to
.Pa jp.106.kbd .
.Pp
.Dl "device atkbdc"
.Dl "options ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP"
.Dl "makeoptions ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=jp.106"
.Dl "device atkbd"
.Pp
In both cases, you also need to have following lines in
.Pa /boot/device.hints .
.Pp
.Dl hint.atkbdc.0.at="isa"
.Dl hint.atkbdc.0.port="0x060"
.Dl hint.atkbd.0.at="atkbdc"
.Dl hint.atkbd.0.irq="1"
