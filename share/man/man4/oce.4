.Nd "Device driver for Emulex OneConnect 10Gb network adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device oce"
.Ed

\&.include <bsd.kmod.mk>
.Ed
.It
Replace imagename in above with UFI file name
.It
Copy Makefile and UFI file to a directory
