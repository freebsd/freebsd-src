.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_toshiba
.Nd Toshiba HCI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_toshiba"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_toshiba_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
HCI is Toshiba's
.Em "Hardware Control Interface"
which is somewhat uniform across their models.
The
.Nm
driver allows the user to manipulate HCI-controlled hardware using a number of
.Xr sysctl 8
variables.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following sysctls are currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.toshiba.force_fan
Causes active cooling to be forcibly enabled
.Pq Ql 1
or disabled
.Pq Ql 0
regardless of the current temperature.
.It Va hw.acpi.toshiba.video_output
Sets the active display to use according to a bitwise OR of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li 0
No display
.It Li 1
LCD
.It Li 2
CRT
.It Li 4
TV-Out
.El
.Pp
Only some systems (i.e., the Libretto L5) support video switching via
this hardware-specific driver.
Use the
.Xr acpi_video 4
driver for generic video output support.
.It Va hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_brightness
Makes the LCD backlight brighter or dimmer (higher values are brighter).
.It Va hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_backlight
Turns the LCD backlight on and off.
.It Va hw.acpi.toshiba.cpu_speed
Sets the CPU speed to the specified speed.
This provides functionality similar to the
.Va hw.acpi.cpu.throttle_state
variable.
Higher sysctl values mean lower CPU speeds.
.El
.Pp
Defaults for these variables can be set in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 ,
which is parsed at boot-time.
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
The
.Va hw.acpi.toshiba.enable_fn_keys
tunable enables or disables the function keys on the keyboard.
Function keys are enabled by default.
.Pp
This behaviour can be changed at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt or in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
