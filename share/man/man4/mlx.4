.Sh NAME
.Nm mlx
.Nd Mylex DAC-family RAID driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device pci
.Cd device mlx
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mylex DAC-family PCI to SCSI RAID controllers,
including versions relabelled by Digital/Compaq.  Supported controllers 
include:
.Bl -bullet
.It 
DAC960P
.It 
DAC960PD
.It
DAC960PL
.It
DAC960PJ
.It
DAC960PG
.It
AcceleRAID 150
.It
AcceleRAID 250
.It
eXtremeRAID 1100
.El
.Pp
All major firmware revisions (2.x, 3.x, 4.x and 5.x) are supported, however
it is always advisable to upgrade to the most recent firmware available for the
controller.
.Pp
Compatible Mylex controllers not listed should work, but have not been 
verified. 
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Controller initialisation phase:
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: controller initialisation in progress...
.It mlx%d: initialisation complete
.El
.Pp
The controller firmware is performing/has completed initialisation.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: physical drive %d:%d not responding
.El
.Pp
The drive at channel:target is not responding; it may have failed or
been removed.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: spinning up drives...
.El
.Pp
Drive startup is in progress; this may take several minutes.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: configuration checksum error
.El
.Pp
The array configuration has become corrupted.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: mirror race recovery in progress
.It mlx%d: mirror race on a critical system drive

.El
.Pp
These error codes are undocumented.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: physical drive %d:%d COD mismatch
.El
.Pp
Configuration data on the drive at channel:target does not match the
rest of the array.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: system drive installation aborted
.El
.Pp
Errors occured preventing one or more system drives from being configured.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: new controller configuration found
.El
.Pp
The controller has detected a configuration on disk which supersedes the
configuration in its nonvolatile memory.  It will reset and come up with
the new configuration.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: FATAL MEMORY PARITY ERROR
.El
.Pp
Firmware detected a fatal memory error; the driver will not attempt to
attach to this controller.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: unknown firmware initialisation error %x:%x:%x
.El
.Pp
An unknown error occurred during initialisation; it will be ignored.
.Pp
Driver initialisation/shutdown phase:
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: can't allocate scatter/gather DMA tag
.It mlx%d: can't allocate buffer DMA tag
.It mlx%d: can't allocate s/g table
.It mlx%d: can't make initial s/g list mapping
.It mlx%d: can't make permanent s/g list mapping
.It mlx%d: can't allocate interrupt
.It mlx%d: can't set up interrupt
.El
.Pp
A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this
controller.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: error fetching drive status
.El
.Pp
The current status of all system drives could not be fetched; attachment
of system drives will be aborted.
.Bl -diag
.It mlx%d: device_add_child failed
.It mlx%d: bus_generic_attach returned %d
.El
.Pp
Creation of the system drive instances failed; attachment of one or more
system drives may have been aborted.
.Bl -diag
.It mlxd%d: detaching...
.El
.Pp
The indicated system drive is being detached.
.Bl -diag
.It mlxd%d: still open, can't detach
