.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_fec
.Nd netgraph Fast EtherChannel node
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_fec.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fec
node implements Ethernet port trunking using Cisco Fast EtherChannel protocol.
Upon creation, node creates a network interface associated with it.
Interfaces are named
.Dq Li fec0 ,
.Dq Li fec1 ,
etc.
New node takes first available unit.
.Sh HOOKS
The
.Nm fec
node accepts any hooks.
However it does not use them.
Under normal operation, node should not have any hooks.
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
Interface membership in the FEC group is configured with the following
control messages:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NGM_FEC_ADD_IFACE Pq Dq Li add_iface
Attach interface to the FEC group.
Target interface name is passed as a string argument.
.It Dv NGM_FEC_DEL_IFACE Pq Dq Li del_iface
Remove interface from the trunk.
Target interface name is passed as a string argument.
.El
.Pp
The following control messages define forwarding method for a node:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NGM_FEC_MODE_INET Pq Dq Li set_mode_mac
Forwarding decisions will be made on destination link layer MAC addresses.
.It Dv NGM_FEC_MODE_MAC Pq Dq Li set_mode_inet
Forwarding decisions will be made on destination IP addresses.
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example script creates a
.Nm fec
node, attaches four Ethernet interfaces to it and
sets forwarding method based on IP address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/sbin/ngctl -f- <<-SEQ
	mkpeer fec dummy fec
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc0"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc1"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc2"
	msg fec0: add_iface "dc3"
	msg fec0: set_mode_inet
