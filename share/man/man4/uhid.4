.Sh NAME
.Nm uhid
.Nd USB generic HID support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uhid* at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for all HID (Human Interface Device) interfaces
in USB devices that do not have a special driver.
.Pp
The device handles the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT_ID (int)
Get the report identifier used by this HID report.
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT_DESC (struct usb_ctl_report_desc)
Get the HID report descriptor.  Using
this descriptor the exact layout and meaning of data to/from
the device can be found.  The report descriptor is delivered
without any processing.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_ctl_report_desc {
    int     size;
    u_char  data[1024];	/* filled data size will vary */
};
.Ed
.It Dv USB_SET_IMMED (int)
Sets the device in a mode where each
.Xr read 2
will return the current value of the input report.  Normally
a
.Xr read 2
will only return the data that the device reports on its
interrupt pipe.  This call may fail if the device does not support
this feature.
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT (struct usb_ctl_report)
Get a report from the device without waiting for data on
the interrupt pipe.  The
.Dv report
field indicates which report is requested.  It should be
.Dv UHID_INPUT_REPORT ,
.Dv UHID_OUTPUT_REPORT ,
or
.Dv UHID_FEATURE_REPORT .
This call may fail if the device does not support this feature.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_ctl_report {
	int report;
	u_char	data[1024];	/* used data size will vary */
};
.It Dv USB_SET_REPORT (struct usb_ctl_report)
Set a report in the device.  The
.Dv report
field indicates which report is to be set.  It should be
.Dv UHID_INPUT_REPORT ,
.Dv UHID_OUTPUT_REPORT ,
or
.Dv UHID_FEATURE_REPORT .
This call may fail if the device does not support this feature.
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Use
.Xr read 2
to get data from the device.  Data should be read in chunks of the
size prescribed by the report descriptor.
.Pp
Use
.Xr write 2
send data to the device.  Data should be written in chunks of the
size prescribed by the report descriptor.
