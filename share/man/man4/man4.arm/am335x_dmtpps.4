.Sh NAME
.Nm am335x_dmtpps
.Nd RFC 2783 Pulse Per Second API driver for AM335x systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device am335x_dmtpps"
.Pp
Optional in
.Pa /boot/loader.conf :
.Cd hw.am335x_dmtpps.input="pin name"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides a system time counter that includes precise
capture of Pulse Per Second (PPS) signals emitted by GPS receivers
and other timing devices.
The
.Nm
driver may be compiled into the kernel or loaded as a module.
.Pp
The AM335x timer hardware captures the value of the system time counter
on the leading edge of the PPS pulse.
Because the capture is done by the hardware there is no interrupt
latency in the measurement.
The time counter runs at 24Mhz, providing a measurement resolution
of 42 nanoseconds.
.Pp
To use the PPS timing information provided by this driver with
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
symlink the
.Pa /dev/dmtpps
device to
.Pa /dev/pps0
and configure server
.Va 127.127.22.0
in
.Xr ntp.conf 5
to configure a type 22 (ATOM) refclock.
.\"
.Sh DRIVER CONFIGURATION
The AM335x hardware provides four timer devices with a capture input
pin, DMTimer4 through DMTimer7.
Because it also provides the active system time counter,
only one instance of the
.Nm
driver can be active at a time.
The driver uses system pin configuration to determine which hardware
timer device to use.
Configure the timer input pin in the system's FDT data, or by
supplying the pin name using a tunable variable in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Pp
To use a standard kernel and FDT data, use
.Xr loader.conf 5
to load the
.Nm
module and set the
.Va hw.am335x_dmtpps.input
tunable variable to the name of the input pin, one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "GPMC_ADVn_ALE MMMM" -offset MMMM -compact

.Em Hardware
.It P8-7
DMTimer4; Beaglebone P8 header pin 7.
.It P8-8
DMTimer7; Beaglebone P8 header pin 8.
.It P8-9
DMTimer5; Beaglebone P8 header pin 9.
.It P8-10
DMTimer6; Beaglebone P8 header pin 10.
.It GPMC_ADVn_ALE
DMTimer4.
.It GPMC_BEn0_CLE
DMTimer5.
.It GPMC_WEn
DMTimer6.
.It GPMC_OEn_REn
DMTimer7.
.El
.Pp
To configure the
.Nm
driver using FDT data, create a new pinctrl node by referencing the standard
.Va am33xx_pinmux
driver node (which is defined in am33xx.dtsi) in your dts file.
For example:
.Bd -literal
   &am33xx_pinmux {
      timer4_pins: timer4_pins {
         pinctrl-single,pins = <0x90 (PIN_INPUT | MUX_MODE2)>;
      };
   };
.Ed
.Pp
Add pinctrl properties referencing
.Va timer4_pins
to the standard
.Va timer4
device node (also defined in am33xx.dtsi) by referencing it in
your dts file as follows:
.Bd -literal
   &timer4 {
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      pinctrl-0 = <&timer4_pins>;
   };
