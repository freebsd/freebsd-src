.Nm tdfx
.Nd Voodoo Graphics and VoodooII Memory Access GLIDE device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device tdfx
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver creates an entry in
.Pa /dev
that allows programs (mostly
.Em GLIDE-based software )
to access the device memory of the Voodoo Graphics and
VoodooII 3D accelerators created by
.Em 3Dfx, Inc .
This provides an interface
for applications based on the
.Em GLIDE API
or that simply use the API
provided by the linux
.Pa /dev/3dfx
device to use the video device.
.Pp
Supports all cards based on the following chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Em 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics
.It
.Em 3Dfx Voodoo II
.El
.Pp
Specifically, the following cards should work:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Em Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D
.It
.Em Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D II
.El
.Pp
Note that this driver does not currently have support for the Voodoo
Banshee, Voodoo3, Voodoo5, or Voodoo6 based cards.
It also does not currently support the Voodoo Rush.
It also does not yet handle the SLI feature of the Voodoo II boards.
You can only use each of them separately.

By loading the
.Nm tdfx_linux.ko
and
.Nm linux.ko
modules, you can enable the linux ioctl code for this driver, where the only supported
applications currently reside.
