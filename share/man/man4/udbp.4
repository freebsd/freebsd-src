.Sh NAME
.Nm udbp
.Nd USB Double Bulk Pipe driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device udbp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for host-to-host cables that contain at least two
bulk pipes, one for each direction, like for example the EzLink cable and
the NetChip 1080 chip.
.Pp
It requires netgraph to be avalable. This can be done either by adding
.Cd "options NETGRAPH"
to your kernel configuration file, or alternatively loading
.Nm netgraph
as a module either from
.Pa /boot/loader.conf
or from the command line, before the udbp module.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Dl options NETGRAPH
.Dl device udbp
.Pp
Add the
.Nm udbp
driver to the kernel.
.Pp
.Dl kldload netgraph
.Dl kldload udbp
.Pp
Load the
.Nm netgraph
module and then the
.Nm udbp
driver.
.Pp
.Dl ngctl mkpeer udbp0: iface data inet
.Dl ifconfig ng0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2
.Pp
Create a new network interface node node and connect it's inet hook to the data
hook of the
.Nm udbp
node. Ifconfig configures the resulting network interface ng0 with a local
IP address of 10.0.0.1 and a remote 10.0.0.2. On the remote host the two
IP addresses should of course be reversed.
