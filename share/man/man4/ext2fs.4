.Dt EXT2FS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ext2fs
.Nd "ext2/ext3/ext4 file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To link into the kernel:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options EXT2FS"
.Ed
.Pp
To load as a kernel loadable module:
.Pp
.Dl "kldload ext2fs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver will permit the
.Fx
kernel to access
ext2
file systems and its derivatives.
It currently implements most of the features required by
.Em ext3
and
.Em ext4
file systems.
Support for Extended Attributes in
.Em ext4
is experimental.
Journalling and encryption are currently not supported.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a
.Nm
volume located on
.Pa /dev/ada1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t ext2fs /dev/ada1s1 /mnt"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nmount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
kernel implementation is derived from code written,
or modified,
by
.An Godmar Back
using the UFS CSRG sources for CMU Mach.
.Pp
.An John Dyson
did the initial port to
.Fx .
.An Aditya Sarawgi
merged important parts of the allocation code from a clean-room
.Nx
implementation.
.An Zheng Liu
and
.An Fedor Uporov
implemented the read and write support respectively for
.Em ext4
filesystems.
The
.Fx
community has contributed a huge amount of modifications.
