.Nd "Intel Ethernet 800 Series Driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iflib"
.Cd "device ice"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ice_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Features
The
.Nm
driver provides support for any PCI Express adapter or LOM
(LAN On Motherboard)
in the Intel Ethernet 800 Series.
As of this writing, the series includes devices with these model numbers:

.El
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your adapter.
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9706.
This value coincides with the maximum Jumbo Frame size of 9728.
.Pp
This driver version supports VLANs.
For information on enabling VLANs, see the
.Pa README .
.Pp
Offloads are also controlled via the interface, for instance, checksumming for
both IPv4 and IPv6 can be set and unset, TSO4 and/or TSO6, and finally LRO can
be set and unset.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The associated Virtual Function (VF) driver for this driver is
.Xr iavf 4 .
.Pp
The associated RDMA driver for this driver is
.Xr irdma 4 .
.Ss Dynamic Device Personalization
The DDP package loads during device initialization.
The driver looks for the
ice_ddp
module and checks that it contains a valid DDP package file.
.Pp
If the driver is unable to load the DDP package, the device will enter Safe
Mode.
Safe Mode disables advanced and performance features and supports only
basic traffic and minimal functionality, such as updating the NVM or
downloading a new driver or DDP package.
Safe Mode only applies to the affected physical function and does not impact
any other PFs.
See the
.Em Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters and Devices User Guide
for more details on DDP and Safe Mode.
.Pp
If you encounter issues with the DDP package file, you may need to download
an updated driver or
.Em ice_ddp
module. See the log messages for more information.
.Pp
You cannot update the DDP package if any PF drivers are already loaded.
To overwrite a package, unload all PFs and then reload the driver with the
new package.
.Pp
You can only use one DDP package per driver, even if you have more than one
device installed that uses the driver.
.Pp
Only the first loaded PF per device can download a package for that device.
.Ss Additional Utilities
There are additional tools available from Intel to help configure and update
the adapters covered by this driver.
These tools can be downloaded directly from Intel at
.Lk https://downloadcenter.intel.com ,
by searching for their names:
.Bl -bullet

.Em Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Update Utility for Intel Ethernet Network Adapters E810 series - FreeBSD
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel Ethernet 800 series.
Most adapters in this series with SFP28/QSFP28 cages
have firmware that requires that Intel qualified modules are used; these
qualified modules are listed below.
This qualification check cannot be disabled by the driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports 100Gb Ethernet adapters with these QSFP28 modules:
.Pp

.Pp
Note that adapters also support all passive and active
limiting direct attach cables that comply with SFF-8431 v4.1 and
SFF-8472 v10.4 specifications.
.Pp
This is not an exhaustive list; please consult product documentation for an
up-to-date list of supported media.
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
See the
.Xr iflib 4
man page for more information on using iflib sysctl variables as tunables.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.ice.enable_health_events
Set to 1 to enable firmware health event reporting across all devices. Enabled by default.
.Pp
If enabled, when the driver receives a firmware health event message, it will
print out a description of the event to the kernel message buffer and if
applicable, possible actions to take to remedy it.
.It Va hw.ice.irdma
Set to 1 to enable the RDMA client interface, required by the
.Xr irdma 4
driver.
Enabled by default.
.It Va hw.ice.rdma_max_msix
Set the maximum number of per-device MSI-X vectors that are allocated for use by the
.Xr irdma 4
driver.
Set to 64 by default.
.It Va hw.ice.debug.enable_tx_fc_filter
Set to 1 to enable the TX Flow Control filter across all devices. Enabled by default.
.Pp
If enabled, the hardware will drop any transmitted Ethertype 0x8808 control
frames that do not originate from the hardware.
.It Va hw.ice.debug.enable_tx_lldp_filter
Set to 1 to enable the TX LLDP filter across all devices. Enabled by default.
.Pp
If enabled, the hardware will drop any transmitted Ethertype 0x88cc LLDP frames
that do not originate from the hardware.
This must be disabled in order to use LLDP daemon software such as
.Xr lldpd 8 .
.It Va hw.ice.debug.ice_tx_balance_en
Set to 1 to allow the driver to use the 5-layer Tx Scheduler tree topology if configured by the DDP package.
.Pp
Enabled by default. 
.El
.Sh SYSCTL PROCEDURES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.ice.#.fc
Allows one to set the flow control value.
A value of 0 disables flow control, 3 enables full, 1 is RX, and 2 is
TX pause.
.It Va dev.ice.#.advertise_speed
Allows one to set advertised link speeds, this will then cause a link
renegotiation.
.It Va dev.ice.#.current_speed
This is a display of the current setting.
.It Va dev.ice.#.fw_version
Displays the current firmware and NVM versions of the adapter.
.It Va dev.ice.#.ddp_version

.Sh INTERRUPT STORMS
It is important to note that 100G operation can generate high
numbers of interrupts, often incorrectly being interpreted as
a storm condition in the kernel.
It is suggested that this be resolved by setting
.Va hw.intr_storm_threshold
to 0.
