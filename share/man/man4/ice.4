.Nd "Intel Ethernet 800 Series Driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iflib"
.Cd "device ice"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ice_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Features
The
.Nm
driver provides support for any PCI Express adapter or LOM
(LAN On Motherboard)
in the Intel Ethernet 800 Series.
As of this writing, the series includes devices with these model numbers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Controller E810\-C
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Controller E810\-XXV
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Connection E822\-C
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Connection E822\-L
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Connection E823\-C
.It
Intel\(rg Ethernet Connection E823\-L
.El
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your adapter.
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9706.
This value coincides with the maximum Jumbo Frame size of 9728.
.Pp
This driver version supports VLANs.
For information on enabling VLANs, see the
.Pa README .
.Pp
Offloads are also controlled via the interface, for instance, checksumming for
both IPv4 and IPv6 can be set and unset, TSO4 and/or TSO6, and finally LRO can
be set and unset.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Ss Additional Utilities
There are additional tools available from Intel to help configure and update
the adapters covered by this driver.
These tools can be downloaded directly from Intel at
.Lk https://downloadcenter.intel.com ,
by searching for their names, or by installing certain packages:
.Bl -bullet
.It
To change the behavior of the QSFP28 ports on E810-C adapters, use the
Intel EPCT (Ethernet Port configuration tool); installed by the
.Em sysutils/intel-epct
package.
.It
To update the firmware on an adapter, use the Intel Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
Update Utility for Intel Network Adapter 800 series; installed by the
.Em sysutils/intel-nvmupdate-100g
package.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel Ethernet 800 series.
Most adapters in this series with SFP28/QSFP28 cages
have firmware that requires that Intel qualified modules are used; these
qualified modules are listed below.
This qualification check cannot be disabled by the driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports 100Gb Ethernet adapters with these QSFP28 modules:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact

.It
Intel\(rg 100G QSFP28 100GBASE-DR    SPTSLP2SLCDF
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports 25Gb and 10Gb Ethernet adapters with these SFP28 modules:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact

.It
Intel\(rg     25G SFP28 25GBASE-LR E25GSFP28LRX (Extended Temp)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports 10Gb and 1Gb Ethernet adapters with these SFP+ modules:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Intel\(rg 1G/10G SFP+ 10GBASE-SR E10GSFPSR

.It
Intel\(rg 1G/10G SFP+ 10GBASE-LR E10GSFPLR
.El
.Pp
Note that adapters also support all passive and active
limiting direct attach cables that comply with SFF-8431 v4.1 and
SFF-8472 v10.4 specifications.
.Pp
This is not an exhaustive list; please consult product documentation for an
up-to-date list of supported media.
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
See the
.Xr iflib 4
man page for more information on using iflib sysctl variables as tunables.

Allows one to set the flow control value.
A value of 0 disables flow control, 3 enables full, 1 is RX, and 2 is
TX pause.
.It Va dev.ice.#.advertise_speed
Allows one to set advertised link speeds, this will then cause a link
renegotiation.
.It Va dev.ice.#.current_speed
This is a display of the current setting.
.It Va dev.ice.#.fw_version
Displays the current firmware and NVM versions of the adapter.

.Sh INTERRUPT STORMS
It is important to note that 100G operation can generate high
numbers of interrupts, often incorrectly being interpreted as
a storm condition in the kernel.
It is suggested that this be resolved by setting
.Va hw.intr_storm_threshold
to 0.
