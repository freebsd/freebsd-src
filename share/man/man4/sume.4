.Sh NAME
.Nm sume
.Nd "NetFPGA SUME 4x10Gb Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines
in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sume"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place
the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_sume_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NetFPGA SUME Virtex-7 FPGA Development Board
with the reference NIC bitstream loaded onto it.
The HDL design for the reference NIC project uses the RIFFA based DMA
engine to communicate with the host machine over PCIe.
Every packet is transmitted to / from the board via a single DMA
transaction, taking up to two or three interrupts per one transaction
which yields low performance.
.Pp
There is no support for Jumbo frames as the hardware is capable of
dealing only with frames with maximum size of 1514 bytes.
The hardware does not support multicast filtering, provides no checksums,
and offers no other offloading.

.Sh AUTHORS
The Linux
.Nm
driver was originally written by
.An -nosplit
.An Bjoern A. Zeeb .
The
.Fx version and this manual page were written by
.An Denis Salopek
as a GSoC project.
More information about the project can be found here:

.Sh BUGS
The reference NIC hardware design provides no mechanism for quiescing
inbound traffic from interfaces configured as DOWN.
All packets from administratively disabled interfaces are transferred to
main memory, leaving the driver with the task of dropping such packets,
thus consuming PCI bandwidth, interrupts and CPU cycles in vain.
.Pp
Pre-built FPGA bitstream from the NetFPGA project may not work correctly.
At higher RX packet rates, the newly incoming packets can overwrite the
ones in an internal FIFO so the packets would arrive in main memory
corrupted, until a physical reset of the board.
.Pp
Occasionally, the driver can get stuck in a non-IDLE TX state due to
a missed interrupt.
The driver includes a watchdog function which monitors for such a
condition and resets the board automatically.
