.Dt iwlwifi 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iwlwifi
.Nd Intel IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr rc.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kld_list="${kld_list} if_iwlwifi"
.Ed
.Pp
The driver should automatically load any
.Xr iwlwififw 4
firmware needed for the particular chipset in that case.
.Pp
It is anticipated that the driver will support auto-loading via
.Xr devmatch 8
in the future and will need no configuration at all.
.Pp
It is discouraged to load the driver from
.Xr loader 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is derived from Intel's Linux iwlwifi driver and provides support for
all chipsets supported by the
.Em mvm
part of that driver.
.\" XXX-BZ find way to add full list of chipsets automatically
.Nm
will be a successor to
.Xr iwm 4
and may superseed that driver in the future.
It still complements the
.Xr iwn 4
driver which supports older chipsets.
.Pp
The driver uses the
.\" No LinuxKPI man pages so no .Xr here.
.Em linuxkpi_wlan
and
.Em linuxkpi
compat framework to bridge between the Linux and
native FreeBSD driver code as well as to the native
.Xr net80211 4
wireless stack.
.Pp
While
.Nm
supports all 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax
the compatibility code currently only supports 802.11 a/b/g modes.
Support for 802.11 n/ac is to come. 802.11ax and 6Ghz support are planned.
.Sh BUGS
Certainly.
