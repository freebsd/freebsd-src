.Sh NAME
.Nm sge
.Nd Silicon Integrated Systems SiS190/191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device sge"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_sge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for SiS190 Fast Ethernet
controllers and SiS191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controllers.
.Pp
All LOMs supported by the
.Nm
driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for transmit and receive,
TCP segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion
features.
Due to lack of documentation Wake On Lan (WOL), Jumbo frame and an
interrupt moderation mechanism are not supported yet.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
