.Sh NAME
.Nm iwm
.Nd Intel IEEE 802.11ac wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
include the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwm"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
You also need to select a firmware for your device.
Choose one from:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwm3160fw"
.Cd "device iwm3168fw"
.Cd "device iwm7260fw"
.Cd "device iwm7265fw"
.Cd "device iwm7265Dfw"
.Cd "device iwm8000Cfw"
.Cd "device iwm8265fw"
.Cd "device iwm9000fw"
.Cd "device iwm9260fw"
.Ed
.Pp
Or you can use
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwmfw"
.Ed
.Pp
to include them all.
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_iwm_load="YES"
iwm3160fw_load="YES"
iwm3168fw_load="YES"
iwm7260fw_load="YES"
iwm7265fw_load="YES"
iwm7265Dfw_load="YES"
iwm8000Cfw_load="YES"
iwm8265fw_load="YES"
iwm9000fw_load="YES"
iwm9260fw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports running most Intel Wireless AC series network devices in
.Cm station
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
This driver requires the firmware built with the
.Xr iwmfw 4
module to work.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 inet 192.0.2.20/24
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Ar my_net :
.Pp
.Dl ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 ssid my_net up
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwm%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwm%d: firmware error"
The onboard microcontroller crashed for some reason.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwm%d: timeout waiting for firmware initialization to complete"
The onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.
This should not happen.
.It "iwm%d: could not load firmware image '%s'"
The driver failed to load the firmware image using the
.Xr firmware 9
subsystem.
Verify the
.Xr iwmfw 4
firmware module is present.
.It "iwm%d: could not load boot firmware"
An attempt to upload the boot firmware image
to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
.It "iwm%d: could not load microcode"
An attempt to upload the microcode image
to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
.It "iwm%d: could not load main firmware"
An attempt to upload the main firmware image
to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.

.Sh BUGS
Currently,
.Nm
only supports 802.11a/b/g modes.
It will not associate to access points that are configured to operate
only in 802.11n/ac modes.
