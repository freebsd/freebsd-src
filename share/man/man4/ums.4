.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ums"
.Cd "device hid"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ums_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for mice that attach to the USB port.
Supported are
mice with any number of buttons and mice with a wheel.
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/ums0
device presents the mouse as a
.Ar sysmouse
or
.Ar mousesystems
type device.
See
.Xr moused 8
for an explanation of these mouse types.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.ums.debug
Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger values increase
debug message verbosity.
Default is 0.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/ums0 -compact
.It Pa /dev/ums0
blocking device node
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use the first
USB mouse on the system as your console mouse:
.Pp
.Dl moused -p /dev/ums0 -t auto
.Pp
To be able to use the USB mouse under X, change the "Pointer" section in
.Nm xorg.conf
to the following:
.Pp
.Dl Device "/dev/ums0"
.Dl Protocol "Auto"
.Pp
If you want to be able to use the mouse in both virtual consoles as well
as in X change it to:
.Pp
.Dl Device "/dev/sysmouse"
.Dl Protocol "Auto"
