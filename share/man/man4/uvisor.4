.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uvisor
.Nd "USB support for the PalmOS based PDAs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device uvisor"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uvisor_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB based PalmOS PDAs, like Handspring
Visor, Palm Mxxx series, and Sony Clie.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
The device has several ports for different purposes, each of them gets its
own
.Xr ucom 4
device.
The attach message describes the purpose of each port.
.Pp
The usual Pilot tools can be used to access the attached device on the
HotSync port.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was adopted from
.Nx 1.5
in August 2002.
This manual page was adopted from
.Nx
by
.An Tom Rhodes Aq Mt trhodes@FreeBSD.org
at that time.
.Sh BUGS
The code to provide multiple
.Xr ucom 4
instances has not yet been ported from
.Nx .
It is unclear whether this driver works in its
current state.
