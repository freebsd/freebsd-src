.Sh NAME
.Nm pccard
.Nd PC Card bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device pccard
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
This driver is scheduled for removal prior to the release of
.Fx 13.0 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver implements the PC Card bus.
The
.Nm
driver supports all PC Card bridges in the system.
.Sh TUNABLES
The driver supports the following tunable parameters, which may be
added to
.Pa /boot/loader.conf
or set via the
.Xr sysctl 8
command:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm hw.pccard.cis_debug" -compact
.It Cm hw.pccard.debug
Non-zero values cause more verbose information to be printed when a
16-bit PC Card is inserted or removed.
.It Cm hw.pccard.cis_debug
Non-zero value causes the CIS parsing of the 16-bit PC Card to be much
more verbose and include a complete CIS dump.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/pccard0.cis" -compact
.It Pa /dev/pccard0.cis
This exclusive-use device will report all the CIS chains present in a
PC Card, if a 16-bit PC Card is inserted in the slot.
Only one user at a time may access the CIS.
The CIS is presented as the relevant byte stream from the PC Card.
For CIS tuples in Attribute Memory (the default), only the even
locations are presented (the ODD locations are undefined per the
standard).
For CIS tuples in Common Memory, every byte is presented to the user.
Decoding of the CIS tuples is done via a userland program.
All tuples are presented to the user.
