.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_wmi
.Nd ACPI to WMI mapping driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.Dl Cd "device acpi_wmi"
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl acpi_wmi_load="YES"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface for vendor specific WMI implementations
.Pq e.g. HP and Acer laptops .
It creates
.Pa /dev/wmistat%d ,
which can be read to get information about GUIDs found in the system.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/wmistat%d -compact
.It Pa /dev/wmistat%d
WMI status devices.
.El
.Sh SYSCTLS
The following sysctl node is currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width "dev.acpi_wmi.%d.bmof"
.It Va dev.acpi_wmi.%d.bmof
binary Managed Object Format (MOF) buffer
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Read GUIDs from the first WMI interface found in the system:
.Bd -literal
# cat /dev/wmistat0
