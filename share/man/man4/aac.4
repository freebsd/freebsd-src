.Sh NAME
.Nm aac
.Nd Adaptec AdvancedRAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd device pci
.Cd device aac
.Cd device aacp
.Pp
To compile in debugging code:
.Cd options AAC_DEBUG=N
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
aac_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Adaptec AAC family of SCSI Ultra2, Ultra160,
and Ultra320, SATA and SAS RAID controllers.
.Pp
Access to RAID containers is available via the
.Pa /dev/aacd?
device nodes.
The
.Nm aacp
device enables the SCSI pass-thru interface and allows devices connected
to the card such as CD-ROMs to be available via the CAM
.Xr scsi 4
subsystem.
Note that not all cards allow this interface to be enabled.
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/aac?
device nodes provide access to the management interface of the controller.
One node exists per installed card.
The aliases
.Pa /dev/afa?
and
.Pa /dev/hpn?
exist for compatibility with the Dell and HP versions of management tools,
respectively.
If the
.Pa aac_linux.ko
and
.Pa linux.ko
modules are loaded, the
Linux-compatible
.Xr ioctl 2
interface for the management device will be enabled and will allow
Linux-based management applications to control the card.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Compiling with
.Dv AAC_DEBUG
set to a number between 0 and 3
will enable increasingly verbose debug messages.
.Pp
The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously
to the driver.
These messages are printed on the system console,
and are also queued for retrieval by a management application.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Mike Smith Aq Mt msmith@FreeBSD.org
.An Scott Long Aq Mt scottl@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
This driver is not compatible with Dell controllers that have version 1.x
firmware.
The firmware version is the same as the kernel version printed in the BIOS
POST and driver attach messages.
.Pp
The controller is not actually paused on suspend/resume.
