.Sh NAME
.Nm pmu
.Nd Apple PMU99 Power Management Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device adb"
.Cd "device pmu"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Power Management Unit (PMU) found in Apple
Core99 hardware.
This includes late G3 laptops, all G4 machines, early G5
desktops and all G5 XServes.
.Pp
The Apple PMU controller is a multi-purpose ASIC that provides power
management and thermal control, as well as an ADB bus for the internal
keyboard and mouse on laptops.
.Sh HARDWARE
Chips supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Apple KeyLargo PMU
.It
Apple K2-KeyLargo PMU
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The
.Nm
driver provides power management services in addition to an
.Xr adb 4
interface.
The following sysctls can be used to control the
power management behavior and to examine current system power and
thermal conditions.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.server_mode
Restart after power failure behavior (1 causes system to reboot after power
cut, 0 causes system to remain off).
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.present
Indicates whether the relevant battery is inserted.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.charging
Indicates whether the battery is currently charging.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.charge
The current battery charge, in milliamp hours.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.maxcharge
The battery's self-reported maximum charge, in milliamp hours.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.rate
The current into the battery, in milliamps.
While the battery is discharging,
this will be negative.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.voltage
Battery voltage, in millivolts.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.time
Estimated time until full battery charge (or discharge), in minutes.
.It Va dev.pmu.%d.batteries.%d.life
Current fraction of the battery's maximum charge, in percent.
