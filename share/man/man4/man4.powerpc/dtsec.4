.Nd "Freescale Datapath Acceleration Architecture-based Three-Speed Ethernet Controller device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "include ""dpaa/config.dpaa""
.Cd "device dpaa"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the DPAA-based gigabit Ethernet controller
integrated in some of the Freescale system-on-chip devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps operation
.It 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports two operating modes:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Regular
Normal mode, utilizing the full datapath acceleration, Buffer Manager, and Queue
Manager.
.It Independent
Runs disconnected from the Buffer Manager and Queue Manager.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
Gigabit Ethernet controllers built into the following Freescale
system-on-chip devices are known to work with the
.Nm
driver:
