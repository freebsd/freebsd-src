.Sh NAME
.Nm pcic
.Nd PC Card bridge driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device pcic
.Cd device pccard
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for older ISA and non-Yenta PCI PC Card bridges.
The
.Nm
driver supports most
.Tn ExCA
devices attached to the
.Tn ISA
bus or
.Tn PCI
devices that do not conform to the Yenta specification.
.Pp
The following
.Tn ISA
devices, or true clones, are supported in the current code.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Intel i82365SL Step A" -compact
.It Intel i82365SL Step A
.It Intel i82365SL Step B
.It Intel i82365SL Step C
.Tn Intel Ns 's
original 16-bit PC Card controller.
.It Intel i82365SL-DF
.Tn Intel Ns 's
last version of this device.
3.3V support was added.
.It VLSI 82C146
An older VLSI part with some issues on some machines.
.It Cirrus Logic PD-6710
.It Cirrus Logic PD-6720
.It Cirrus Logic PD-6722
Cirrus Logic's pcic controller.
Compatible with the i82365SL Step C with the addition of a different
3.3V control.
.It Ricoh RF5C296
.It Ricoh RF5C396
Ricoh's PC Card bridge chips.
These are compatible with the i82365SL Step C, but with yet another
different 3.3V control.
.It Vadem 365
.It Vadem 465
Compatible with i82365SL Step C.
.It Vadem 468
.It Vadem 469
Like the earlier Vadem models, but with Vadem's own, incompatible, 3.3V
control system.
.It IBM PCIC
.Tn IBM
clone of the original i82365SL part, with its own ID register value.
Has no 3.3V ability.
.El
.Pp
Many other vendors made parts in this arena, but most of them were
compatible with one of the above chipsets.
.Pp
The following PCI pcmcia bridges are supported:
