The

driver handles all Human Interface Devices.
Each HID device
can have several components, e.g., a keyboard and a mouse.
These components use different report identifiers (a byte) to
distinguish which one data is coming from.
The
.Nm
driver has other drivers attached that handle particular
kinds of devices and
.Nm
only dispatches data to them based on the report ID.
