.Sh NAME
.Nm isci
.Nd Intel C600 Serial Attached SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into your kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device isci"
.Ed
.Pp
Or, to load the driver as a module at boot, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isci_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Intel C600
.Tn SAS
controllers.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To force legacy interrupts for all
.Nm
driver instances, set the following tunable value in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.isci.force_legacy_interrupts=1
.Ed
.Sh DEBUGGING
To enable debugging prints from the
.Nm
driver, set the
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.isci.debug_level
.Ed
.Pp
variable to a value between 1 and 4 in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .

The hardware layer in the
.Nm
driver has extensive logging capabilities
which are disabled by default for performance reasons.
These can be enabled by adding
.Bd -literal -offset indent
options ISCI_LOGGING
