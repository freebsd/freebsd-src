.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_ubt
.Nd Netgraph node type that is also a driver for Bluetooth USB devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In ng_ubt.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ubt
node type is both a persistent Netgraph node type and a driver for
Bluetooth USB devices.
It implements a Bluetooth USB transport layer
as per chapter H2 of the Bluetooth Specification Book v1.1.
A new node is created when supported USB device is plugged.
.Pp
The node has a single hook called
.Dv hook .
Incoming bytes received on the device are re-assembled into HCI frames
(according to the length).
Full HCI frames are sent out on the hook.
The node will add HCI frame indicator if device did not send it.
HCI frames received on
.Dv hook
are transmitted out.
The node will drop HCI frame indicator unless device
requires it to be present.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv hook
single HCI frame contained in single
.Vt mbuf
structure.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_DEBUG
Returns an integer containing the current debug level for the node.
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_SET_DEBUG
This command takes an integer argument and sets current debug level
for the node.
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_QLEN
This command takes a parameter that specifies queue number and returns
current maximal length of the queue for the node.
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_SET_QLEN
This command takes two parameters that specify queue number and maximum
length of the queue and sets maximal length of the queue for the node.
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_STAT
Returns various statistic information for the node, such as: number of
bytes (frames) sent, number of bytes (frames) received and number of
input (output) errors.
.It Dv NGM_UBT_NODE_RESET_STAT
Reset all statistic counters to zero.
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down when the corresponding USB device is un-plugged.
.Sh BUGS
Isochronous USB transfers are probably broken.
It means that USB device probably will not be able to transfer SCO data (voice).
Driver does not support firmware upgrade procedure.
USB interrupt transfers are implemented as bulk-in transfers (not really a bug).

The
.Nm ubt
node type was implemented in
