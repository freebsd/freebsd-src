.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm umass
.Nd USB Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device umass"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umass_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mass Storage devices that attach to the USB
port.
.Pp
To use the
.Nm
driver,
.Xr usb 4
and one of
.Xr uhci 4
or
.Xr ohci 4
or
.Xr ehci 4
or
.Xr xhci 4
must be configured in the kernel.
Additionally, since
.Nm
uses the SCSI subsystem and sometimes acts as a SCSI device, it
requires
.Xr da 4
and
.Xr scbus 4
to be included in the kernel.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
device umass
device scbus
device da
device pass
.Ed
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
camcontrol rescan 0:0:0
camcontrol rescan 0:0:1
camcontrol rescan 0:0:2
camcontrol rescan 0:0:3
.Ed
.Pp
Rescan all slots on a multi-slot flash reader, where the slots map to separate
LUNs on a single SCSI ID.
Typically only the first slot will be enabled at boot time.
This assumes that the flash reader is the first SCSI bus in the system and has 4 slots.
