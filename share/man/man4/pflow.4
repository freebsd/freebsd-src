.Sh NAME
.Nm pflow
.Nd kernel interface for pflow data export
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pflow"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem exports
.Nm
accounting data from the kernel using
.Xr udp 4
packets.
.Nm
is compatible with netflow version 5 and IPFIX (10).
The data is extracted from the
.Xr pf 4
state table.
.Pp
Multiple
.Nm
interfaces can be created at runtime using the
.Ic pflowctl Ns Ar N Ic -c
command.
Each interface must be configured with a flow receiver IP address
and a flow receiver port number.
.Pp
Only states created by a rule marked with the
.Ar pflow
keyword are exported by
.Nm .
.Pp
.Nm
will attempt to export multiple
.Nm
records in one
UDP packet, but will not hold a record for longer than 30 seconds.
.Pp
Each packet seen on this interface has one header and a variable number of
flows.
The header indicates the version of the protocol, number of
flows in the packet, a unique sequence number, system time, and an engine
ID and type.
Header and flow structs are defined in
.In net/pflow.h .
.Pp
The
.Nm
source and destination addresses are controlled by
.Xr pflowctl 8 .
.Cm src
is the sender IP address of the UDP packet which can be used
to identify the source of the data on the
.Nm
collector.
.Cm dst
defines the collector IP address and the port.
The
.Cm dst
IP address and port must be defined to enable the export of flows.
.Pp
For example, the following command sets 10.0.0.1 as the source
and 10.0.0.2:1234 as destination:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pflowctl -s pflow0 src 10.0.0.1 dst 10.0.0.2:1234
.Ed
.Pp
The protocol is set to IPFIX with the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pflowctl -s pflow0 proto 10
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Ox 4.5
and was imported into
FreeBSD 15.0 .
.Sh BUGS
A state created by
.Xr pfsync 4
can have a creation or expiration time before the machine came up.
In this case,
.Nm
pretends such flows were created or expired when the machine came up.
.Pp
The IPFIX implementation is incomplete:
The required transport protocol SCTP is not supported.
Transport over TCP and DTLS protected flow export is also not supported.
