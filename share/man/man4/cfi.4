.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides a management interface to NOR flash devices supporting
the Common Flash Interface (CFI) specification.
Its companion device
.Nm cfid
provides a
.Xr geom 4
disk interface to the device.
.Pp
Special support for features of the Intel StrataFlash line are available
with the
.Cd CFI_SUPPORT_STRATAFLASH
kernel option.
Additional support for write-once bits to switch part of Intel StrataFlash
devices to read-only can be enabled by the
.Cd CFI_ARMEDANDDANGEROUS
kernel option.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Juniper Networks
with StrataFlash support by
.An Sam Leffler .
