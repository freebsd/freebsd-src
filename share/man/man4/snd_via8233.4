.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_via8233
.Nd "VIA Technologies VT8233 bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_via8233"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_via8233_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver,
.Xr sound 4 ,
to attach to the VIA VT8233 audio devices.
These audio chipsets are integrated in the southbridge on many VIA based
motherboards.
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available in addition to those available to all
.Xr sound 4
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va dev.pcm.%d.polling" -offset indent
.It Va dev.pcm.%d.polling
Experimental polling mode, where the driver operates by querying the device
state on each tick using
.Xr callout 9 .
Polling is disabled by default.
Do not enable it unless you are facing weird interrupt problems or if the
device cannot generate interrupts at all.

.Nm
driver supports the following audio chipsets:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was written by
.An Joel Dahl Aq Mt joel@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver
does not support S/PDIF.
There is partial support in the code, so implementing it should be fairly
easy if the right hardware is available.
