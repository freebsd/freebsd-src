.Sh NAME
.Nm cxgb
.Nd "Chelsio T3 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device firmware"
.Cd "device cxgb"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_cxgb_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Transmit/Receive checksum offload,
Jumbo Frames, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO),
VLAN hardware insertion / extraction, and VLAN checksum offload.
For further hardware information, see
.Pa http://www.chelsio.com/ .
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements,
refer to the documentation supplied with your Chelsio T3 adapter.
All hardware requirements listed apply to use with
.Fx .
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9000.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports 10 Gigabit and 1 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the T3 and T3B chipset:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Chelsio 10GBase-CX4
.It
Chelsio 10GBase-LR
.It
Chelsio 10GBase-SR
.El
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "cxgb%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "cxgb%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "cxgb%d: Could not find firmware image %s"
