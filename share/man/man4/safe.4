.Dt SAFE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm safe
.Nd SafeNet SafeXcel 1141/1741 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device cryptodev"
.Cd "device safe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
safe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 :
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd hw.safe.debug
.Cd hw.safe.dump
.Cd hw.safe.rnginterval
.Cd hw.safe.rngbufsize
.Cd hw.safe.rngmaxalarm
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards containing SafeNet crypto accelerator chips.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate AES,
SHA1-HMAC, and NULL operations for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 .
.Pp
On all models, the driver registers itself to provide random data to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
Periodically the driver will poll the hardware RNG and retrieve
data for use by the system.
If the driver detects that the hardware RNG is resonating with any local
signal, it will reset the oscillators that generate random data.
Three
.Xr sysctl 8
settings control this procedure:
.Va hw.safe.rnginterval
specifies the time, in seconds, between polling operations,
.Va hw.safe.rngbufsize
specifies the number of 32-bit words to retrieve on each poll,
and
.Va hw.safe.rngmaxalarm
specifies the threshold for resetting the oscillators.
.Pp
When the driver is compiled with
.Dv SAFE_DEBUG
defined, two
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are provided for debugging purposes:
.Va hw.safe.debug
can be set to a non-zero value to enable debugging messages to be sent
to the console for each cryptographic operation,
.Va hw.safe.dump
is a write-only variable that can be used to force driver state to be sent
to the console.
Set this variable to
.Dq Li ring
to dump the current state of the descriptor ring,
to
.Dq Li dma
to dump the hardware DMA registers,
or
to
.Dq Li int
to dump the hardware interrupt registers.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following SafeXcel chips:
.Bl -column "SafeNet 1141" "The original chipset. Supports" -offset indent
.It SafeNet 1141 Ta The original chipset.
Supports DES, Triple-DES, AES, MD5, and SHA-1
symmetric crypto operations, RNG, public key operations, and full IPsec
packet processing.
.It SafeNet 1741 Ta A faster version of the 1141.
