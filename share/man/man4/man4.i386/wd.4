This driver provides access to disks connected to controllers that emulate
the Western Digital WD100x series. This range of controllers includes WD1003
type ST412 controllers, WD1007 ESDI controllers and also the generic IDE 
controllers found on most motherboards.
.sp
Your controller documentation is usually quick to point out any WD100x 
compatibility.
