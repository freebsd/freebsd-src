.Sh NAME
.Nm sbni
.Nd Granch SBNI12 leased line modem driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device sbni"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for leased line modems of following models:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
SBNI12-02, SBNI12D-02
.It
SBNI12-04, SBNI12D-04
.It
SBNI12-05, SBNI12D-05, ISA and PCI
.It
SBNI12-10, SBNI12D-10, ISA and PCI
.El
.Pp
and a kit for data link over a voice band:
.Bl -bullet
.It
SBNI12-11, SBNI12D-11, ISA and PCI.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the standard port and IRQ specifications, the
.Nm
driver also supports a number of
.Va flags
which can set baud rate, receive level, and low three bytes of Ethernet
MAC-address (high three are always
.Li 00:ff:01 ) ,
because Granch modems are
presented to the system as Ethernet-like network cards.
.Pp
The high byte of the
.Va flags
is a bit field, it is used to specify SBNI adapter receive level/baud rate:
.Bl -tag -width "Bits 0-3:" -offset indent
.It "Bits 0-3:"
receive level (0x00..0x0f)
.It "Bits 4-5:"
baud rate number:
.Pp
.Bl -inset -compact
.It "00 -"
0 baud rate (2Mb in fast mode/500kb in slow)
.It "01 -"
1 baud rate (1Mb/250kb)
.It "10 -"
2 baud rate (500kb/125kb)
.It "11 -"
3 baud rate (250kb/62.5kb)
.El
.It "Bit 6:"
use fixed receive level
.Pp
if bit 6 is set then receive level will be set according
to bits 0-3 value, otherwise receive level will be
autodetected
.It "Bit 7:"
use fixed baud rate
.Pp
if bit 7 is set then baud rate will be set according to
bits 4-5 value, otherwise baud rate is set to 2Mb
.El
.Sh FILES
The sources for the driver reside in:
.Pp

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
device driver for
.Fx
4.x was written by
.An Denis I. Timofeev ,
partially based on
.An David Greenman Ns 's
.Xr ed 4
driver.
Earlier versions (available on
.Pa ftp.granch.com )
were written by
.An Alexey V. Zverev .
.Pp
SBNI12 hardware was designed by
.An Alexey V. Chirkov .
