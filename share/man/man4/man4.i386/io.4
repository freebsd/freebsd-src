.Sh NAME
.Nm io
.Nd I/O privilege file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The special file
.Nm /dev/io
is a controlled security hole that allows a process to gain I/O
privileges
.Pq which are normally reserved for kernel-internal code .
Any process that holds a file descriptor on
.Nm /dev/io
open will get its
.Em IOPL
bits in the flag register set, thus allowing it to perform direct
I/O operations.  This can be useful in order to write userland
programs that handle some hardware directly.
.Pp
The entire access control is handled by the file access permissions
of
.Nm /dev/io ,
so care should be taken in granting rights for this device.  Note
that even read/only access will grant the full I/O privileges.

.Sh HISTORY

file appeared in
