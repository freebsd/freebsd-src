UltraStor SCSI host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For ULTRA 24F controllers in EISA mode:
.Cd "controller uha0 at isa? bio irq ? vector uhaintr
.Cd "controller scbus0
.Pp
For ULTRA 14F and 34F controllers:
.Cd "controller uha0 at isa? port" \&"IO_UHA0\&" bio irq ? drq 5 vector uhaintr
.Cd "controller scbus0
.Pp
For each disk:
.Cd "device sd0
.Pp
For each tape device:
.Cd "device st0
.Pp
For one or more cdroms:
.Cd "device cd0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to SCSI devices connected to an UltraStor
ULTRA 14F, ULTRA 24F or ULTRA 34F hostadapter.
.Pp
Note that for an ULTRA 24F in EISA mode no I/O addresses or DMA channels 
are required in the kernel config file. If they are present, the driver
will correctly find the ULTRA 24F, but you tie up precious DMA channels
and I/O ranges which are not used by the card.
The ULTRA 24F uses EISA slot specific I/O which is configured 
automatically.
