.Sh NAME
.Nm glxsb
.Nd Geode LX Security Block crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device glxsb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
glxsb_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the security block of the Geode LX series processors.
The Geode LX is a member of the AMD Geode family
of integrated x86 system chips.
.Pp
Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator,
.Nm
supplies entropy to the
.Xr random 4
driver for common usage.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports acceleration of AES-128-CBC operations for
.Xr crypto 4 .
It also registers itself to accelerate other HMAC algorithms, although
there is no hardware acceleration for those algorithms.
This is only needed so
.Nm
can work with
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Sh CAVEAT
The
.Xr crypto 9
framework will fail to open the crypto session on the device if the AES
key's length is != 128 bits.
This prevents the use of the
.Nm
device driver with AES keys of length != 128 bits.
