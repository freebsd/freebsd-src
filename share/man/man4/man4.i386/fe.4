.Sh NAME
.Nm fe
.Nd Fujitsu MB86960A/MB86965A based Ethernet adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cm "device fe0 at isa? port 0x300 net irq ? vector feintr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fe
is a network device driver
for Ethernet adapters based on Fujitsu MB86960A, MB86965A,
or other compatible chips.
.Pp
The driver provides automatic I/O port address configuration and
automatic IRQ configuration,
when used with suitable adapter hardware.
.Pp
The driver works with program I/O data transfer technique.
It gives a fair performance.
Shared memory is never used, even if the adapter has one.
.Pp
It currently works with Fujitsu FMV-180 series for ISA,
Allied-Telesis AT1700 series and RE2000 series for ISA,
and Fujitsu MBH10302 PC card.
.Ss Parameters
On the kernel configuration file, two parameters,
.Ar port
and
.Ar irq ,
must be specified to reflect adapter hardware settings.
Another parameter
.Ar flags
can be specified to provide additional configuration as an option.
Other parameters of the device statement
must appear as described on the synopsis.
.Pp
The
.Ar port
parameter specifies a base I/O port address of the adapter.
It must match with the hardware setting of the adapter.
The
.Ar port
may be a left unspecified as
.Dq Li \&? .
In that case, the driver tries to detect the hardware setting
of the I/O address automatically.
This feature may not work with some adapter hardware.
.Pp
The
.Ar irq
parameter specifies an IRQ number used by the adapter.
It must match the hardware setting of the adapter.
.Ar Irq
may be left unspecified as
.Dq Li \&? ;
in that case, the driver tries to detect
the hardware setting of the IRQ automatically.
This feature may not work on some adapters.
.Pp
The
.Ar flags
is a numeric value which consists of a combination of various device settings.
The following flags are defined in the current version.
To specify two or more settings for a device,
use a numeric sum of each flag value.
Flag bits not specified below are reserved and must be set to 0.
Actually, each bit is either just ignored by the driver,
or tested and used to control undocumented features of the driver.
Consult the source program for undocumented features.
.Bl -tag -width "99999999"
.It Li 0x007F
These flag bits are used
to initialize DLCR6 register of MB86960A/MB86965A chip,
when the
.Li 0x0080
bit of the
.Ar flags
is set.
See below for more about DLCR6 override feature.
The
.Li 0x007F
flag bits must be 0 unless the
.Li 0x0080
bit is set,
to maintain the compatibility with future versions of the driver.
.It Li 0x0080
This flag overrides the default setting to the DLCR6 register
of MB86960A/MB86965A chip by a user supplied value,
which is taken from the lower 7 bits of the flag value.
This is a troubleshooting flag and should not be used
without understanding of the adapter hardware.
Consult the Fujitsu manual for more information
on DLCR6 settings.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm fe
driver has some private options,
which can be specified with an
.Dq option
statement in the kernel configuration file.
The following lists the private options.
The driver also accepts some other undocumented options,
all of whose names start with a fixed prefix
.Dv "FE_" .
Consult the source program for undocumented options.
.Bl -tag -width "FE_"
.It Dv "FE_DEBUG=" Ns Ar level
This option takes a numeric value
.Ar level
which controls the debugging level for the device and/or the driver.
Setting the
.Dv "FE_DEBUG"
option to a value which is not listed here
may cause undocumented behavior.
The default setting of this option is 1.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Setting
.Dv "FE_DEBUG=0"
makes most of debugging codes,
including sanity check,
be excluded from the object code of the driver.
It generates fastest and smallest object code.
Some emergency messages are logged even under this setting, though.
.It
Setting
.Dv "FE_DEBUG=1"
makes minimum debugging codes be included,
setting the amount of logged messages minimum.
Only fatal error messages are logged under this setting.
.It
Setting
.Dv "FE_DEBUG=2"
makes standard debugging codes be included,
setting the amount of logged messages middle.
Messages on lair events and/or questionable conditions
are logged under this setting.
.It
Setting
.Dv "FE_DEBUG=3"
makes all debugging codes be included,
and set the amount of legged messages maximum.
Redundant messages such as those reporting usual actions
or dumping register values
are logged under this setting.

.Sh FEATURES SPECIFIC TO HARDWARE MODELS
The
.Nm fe
driver has some features and limitations
which depend on adapter hardware models.
The following is a summary of such dependency.
.Ss Fujitsu FMV-180 series adapters
Both automatic IRQ detection and automatic I/O port address detection
is available with these adapters.
.Pp
Automatic I/O port address detection feature of
.Nm fe
works mostly fine for FMV-180 series.
It works even if there are two or more FMV-180s in a system.
However, some combination of other adapters may confuse the driver.
It is recommended not to use
.Nm port ?
when you experience some difficulties with hardware probe.
.Pp
Automatic IRQ detection feature of
.Nm fe
works reliably for FMV-180 series.
It is recommended to use
.Nm irq ?
always for FMV-180.
The hardware setting of IRQ is read
from the configuration EEPROM on the adapter,
even when the kernel config file specifies an IRQ value.
The driver will generate a warning message,
if the IRQ setting specified in the kernel config file
does not match one stored in EEPROM.
Then, it will use the value specified in the config file.
(This behavior has been changed from the previous releases.) 
.Ss Allied-Telesis AT1700 series and RE2000 series adapters
Automatic I/O port address detection
is available with Allied-Telesis AT1700 series and RE2000 series,
while it is less reliable than FMV-180 series.
Using the feature with Allied-Telesis adapters
is not recommended.
.Pp
Automatic IRQ detection is also available with some limitation.
The
.Nm fe
driver
tries to get IRQ setting from the configuration EEPROM on the board,
if
.Dq irq \&?
is specified in the configuration file.
Unfortunately,
AT1700 series and RE2000 series seems to have two types of models;
One type allows IRQ selection from 3/4/5/9,
while the other from 10/11/12/15.
Identification of the models are not well known.
Hence, automatic IRQ detection with Allied-Telesis adapters
may not be reliable.
Specify an exact IRQ number if any troubles are encountered.
.Pp
Differences between AT1700 series and RE2000 series
or minor models in those series are not recognized.
.Ss Fujitsu MBH10302 PC card
The
.Nm fe
driver supports Fujitsu MBH10302 and compatible PC cards.
It requires the PC card (PCMCIA) support package.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr ed 4 ,
.Xr crd 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr pccardd 8
.Sh BUGS
Following are major known bugs:
.Pp
Statistics on the number of collisions maintained by the
.Nm fe
driver is not accurate;
the
.Fi i
option of
.Xr netstat 1
shows slightly less value than true number of collisions.
.Pp
More mbuf clusters are used than expected.
The packet receive routine has an intended violation
against the mbuf cluster allocation policy.
The unnecessarily allocated clusters are freed within short lifetime,
and it will not affect long term kernel memory usage.
.Pp
Although XNS and IPX supports are included in the driver,
they are never be tested and must have a lot of bugs.
