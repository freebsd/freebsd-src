.Sh NAME
.Nm sr
.Nd
synchronous RISCom/N2 device driver.
.Sh SYNOPSYS
.Cd "device sr0 at isa? port 0x300 net irq 10 iomem 0xd0000 vector arintr"
.Cd "device sr1 at isa? port 0x310 net irq 11 flags 0x1 iomem 0xd0000 vector arintr"
.Pp
.Cd "pseudo-device sppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm sr
driver supports the RISCom/N2 ISA cards that is based on the
HD64570 chip.
.Pp
Line speeds of up to 2Mbps is possible. At this speed about 95% of the
bandwidth is usable with 486DX processors.
.Pp
The standard FreeBSD sppp code is used for the link level layer. The
default protocol used is PPP. The Cisco HDLC protocol can be used by
adding
.Nm link2
to
.Nm ifconfig.
.Pp
The
.Nm flags
field is optional. If it isn't specified, the driver will
assume the following:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It "The card has 2 ports."
.It "The clock for the serial ports is external and the transmitter uses"
the same clock as the receiver.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm flags
are a bit field and can be used to force a different
behaviour than the default.
.Pp
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Em 0x01
The card has only one port.
.It Em 0x10
Use sepperate external clocks for transmit and receive on port 0.
.It Em 0x40
Use sepperate external clocks for transmit and receive on port 1.
.El
.Pp
.Sh NUMBERING
Only one line for each card is needed in the kernel configuration file.
The first card's ports will be installed from sr0. The numbering of the
next card will continue where the first stopped, eg. if the first card
is a two port card it will use sr0 and sr1. The next card will then
start at sr2.
.Pp
The card only supports IRQ 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 15.
.Pp
The iomem area is a 16Kb block and must start at a 16Kb boundary.
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sr%d: Warning illegal interrupt %d."
The card cannot use the specified interrupt. Choose a different one.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /sys/i386/isa/ic/hd64570.h -compact
.It Pa /sys/i386/isa/ic/hd64570.h
.It Pa /sys/i386/isa/if_srregs.h
.It Pa /sys/i386/isa/if_sr.c
.El
.Sh BUGS
At the moment only the X.21 interface is tested. The others
may need tweaks to the clock selection code.
.Pp
The code can probably stand some optimizing.
.Pp
There must be lots because this code is still very green. Please report
them to jhay@mikom.csir.co.za
