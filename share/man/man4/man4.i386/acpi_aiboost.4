.Dt ACPI_AIBOOST 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_aiboost
.Nd ASUS AI Booster hardware monitor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_aiboost"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_aiboost_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for monitoring the hardware sensors in recent
.Tn ASUS
motherboards.
The driver uses ACPI as the backend to fetch sensor values and
descriptions and provides its data via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver typically has 7 sensors, depending on the motherboard and
chipset:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "CPU" Ta "uK" Ta "CPU Temperature"
.It Li "MB" Ta "uK" Ta "MB Temperature"
.It Li "VCC" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Core Voltage"
.It Li "+3.3V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+3.3 Voltage"
.It Li "+5V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+5 Voltage"
.It Li "+12V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+12 Voltage"
.It Li "CPU" Ta "RPM" Ta "CPU Fan"
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr sysctl.conf 5
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Takanori Watanabe .
This manual page was written by
.An Juan Romero Pardines ,
who adapted the code for
.Nx ,
and adopted back to FreeBSD by
.An Takanori Watanabe .
.Sh BUGS
It's possible to modify voltages via the ACPI methods in the DSDT,
but for now the driver only reports the sensors' values.
CPU Q-Fan is another thing that is typically specified in the ACPI
namespace, and in the future we should handle this feature (to
enable or disable automatic/manual fan mode).
