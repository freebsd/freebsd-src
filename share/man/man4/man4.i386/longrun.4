.Nd Transmeta(TM) Crusoe(TM) LongRun(TM) support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
LongRun support is a collection of power saving modes for the
Transmeta Crusoe chips, similar in scope to Intel's SpeedStep.
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
MIBs control the different CPU modes:
.Bl -column ".Va hw.crusoe.percentage" ".Vt integer" "Changeable"
.It Sy "Name	Type	Changeable	Description"
.It Va hw.crusoe.longrun Ta Vt integer Ta yes Ta "LongRun mode:"
.It Ta Ta Ta "0: minimum frequency mode"
.It Ta Ta Ta "1: power-saving mode"
.It Ta Ta Ta "2: performance mode"
.It Ta Ta Ta "3: maximum frequency mode"
.It Va hw.crusoe.frequency Ta Vt integer Ta no Ta "Current frequency (MHz)."
.It Va hw.crusoe.voltage Ta Vt integer Ta no Ta "Current voltage (mV)."
.It Va hw.crusoe.percentage Ta Vt integer Ta no Ta "Processing performance (%)."
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Print the current status:
.Pp
.Dl "% sysctl hw.crusoe"
.Pp
To set LongRun mode to performance oriented variable frequency mode
(less power savings):
.Pp
.Dl "# sysctl hw.crusoe.longrun=2"
