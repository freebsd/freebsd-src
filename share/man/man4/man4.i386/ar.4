.Sh NAME
.Nm ar
.Nd
synchronous Arnet device driver.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ar0 at isa? port 0x300 net irq 10 iomem 0xd0000 vector arintr"
.Cd "device ar1 at isa? port 0x310 net irq 11 iomem 0xd0000 vector arintr"
.Pp
.Cd "pseudo-device sppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ar
driver supports the Arnet SYNC/570i ISA cards that is based on the
HD64570 chip. Both the 2 and 4 port cards is supported and auto detected.
.Pp
Line speeds of up to 2Mbps is possible. At this speed about 85% of the
bandwidth is usable with 486DX processors.
.Pp
The standard
.Tn FreeBSD
sppp code is used for the link level layer. The
default protocol used is PPP. The Cisco HDLC protocol can be used by
adding
.Ar link2
to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh NUMBERING
Only one line for each card is needed in the kernel configuration file.
The first card's ports will be installed from ar0. The numbering of the
next card will continue where the first stopped, eg. if the first card
is a two port card it will use ar0 and ar1. The next card will then
start at ar2.
.Pp
The card only supports IRQ 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 15.
.Pp
The iomem area is a 16Kb block and must start at a 16Kb boundary.
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ar%d: Warning illegal interrupt %d."
The card cannot use the specified interrupt. Choose a different one.

.Sh BUGS
At the moment only the V.35 and X.21 interfaces is tested. The others
may need tweaks to the clock selection code.
.Pp
The code can probably stand some optimizing.
.Pp
There must be lots because this code is still very green. Please report
them to jhay@mikom.csir.co.za
