.Sh NAME
.Nm streams
.Nd System V STREAMS networking ABI support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To link System V Release 4 (SVR4) STREAMS interprocess communication ABI
support into the kernel:
.Cd device streams
.Pp
To load the SVR4 STREAMS interprocess communication ABI support kernel
module:
.Dl kldload streams
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module provides limited
System V Release 4 STREAMS interprocess communication ABI
(application binary interface) compatibility
for userland applications.
.Pp
Internally,
.Nm
provides STREAMS handles by using socket creation kernel routines, and 
adding state-tracking information to the socket to permit manipulation
by STREAMS emulation code in
.Xr svr4 4 .
Hence, opening a stream device produces a result similar to what would be 
obtained by calling
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
Applications should never use this interface directly:  STREAMS
emulation is only provided as a service to support ABI requirements in
the SVR4 environment which 
.Xr svr4 4
needs to present to client binaries.  
.Sh BUGS
This whole interface is a crude hack to produce STREAMS semantics
through emulation over sockes.  
.Pp
Programmers who hope to be able to use this interface to provide 
SVR4 STREAMS services to BSD applications will be sorely disappointed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr svr4 4 
.Sh HISTORY
System V Release 4 ABI support first appeared in FreeBSD
.Fx 4.0 .
The ABI was ported from an equivalent facility present in
NetBSD
.Fx 1.3
written by Christos Zoulas.
