.Sh NAME
.Nm vpd
.Nd "Vital Product Data kernel interface"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vpd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn IBM ThinkPad
notebooks (and most
.Tn IBM
desktop PCs) have a 48-byte
Vital Product Data (VPD) structure located in the BIOS Shadow RAM.
.Pp
The VPD provides machine type and model information, the build ID
(this is roughly the BIOS version) and serial number information.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver scans the BIOS area and claims the memory used by the VPD
structure.
It provides the
.Xr sysctl 3
branch
.Va hw.vpd
to allow this information to be accessed by the userland.
The following variables are provided, one per VPD attachment (there should
only be one):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv MACHINE_MODEL" -compact
.It Dv MACHINE_TYPE
.Pq Va machine.type
Machine type.
.It Dv MACHINE_MODEL
.Pq Va machine.model
Machine model.
.It Dv BUILD_ID
.Pq Va build.id
BIOS Build ID.
.It Dv SERIAL_BOX
.Pq Va serial.box
Box Serial Number.
.It Dv SERIAL_PLANAR
.Pq Va serial.planar
Motherboard Serial Number.
