.Sh NAME
.Nm pnpbios
.Nd support for embedded devices on the motherboard
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver enumerates embedded ISA devices on the motherboard whose BIOS
supports
.Dq "Plug and Play BIOS Specification" .
It assigns ISA bus resources (interrupt line, DMA channel, I/O ports,
and memory region) to each device and activates it.
.Pp
If it cannot assign necessary resources to a device without
causing conflict with other devices in the system,
the device will not be activated and will be unavailable
to programs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mike Smith .
.Sh CAVEATS
There is no explicit way to disable individual embedded devices.
The
.Nm
driver will find all devices reported by the
.Dq "Plug and Play (PnP)"
BIOS and try to activate them all.
.Pp
There is no way to explicitly assign particular resource to a device.
The resource assignment is fully automatic and there is
no provision for manual override.
