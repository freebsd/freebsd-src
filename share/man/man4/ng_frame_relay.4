.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_frame_relay
.Nd frame relay netgraph node type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_frame_relay.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm frame_relay
node type performs encapsulation, de-encapsulation, and multiplexing
of packets using the frame relay protocol.
It supports up to 1024 DLCI's.
The LMI protocol is handled by a separate node type (see
.Xr ng_lmi 4 ) .
.Pp
The
.Dv downstream
hook should be connected to the synchronous line, i.e., the switch.
Then hooks
.Dv dlci0 ,
.Dv dlci1 ,
through
.Dv dlci1023
are available to connect to each of the DLCI channels.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va downstream"
.It Va downstream
The connection to the synchronous line.
.It Va dlciX
Here X is a decimal number from 0 to 1023.
This hook corresponds
to the DLCI X frame relay virtual channel.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports only the generic control messages.
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message, or when all hooks have been disconnected.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netgraph 4 ,
.Xr ng_lmi 4 ,
.Xr ngctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
node type was implemented in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Julian Elischer Aq Mt julian@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
Technically, frames on DLCI X should not be transmitted to the switch
until the LMI protocol entity on both ends has configured DLCI X as active.
The
.Nm
node type ignores this restriction, and will always pass data received
on a DLCI hook to
.Dv downstream .
Instead, it should query the LMI node first.
