.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_thermal
.Nd ACPI Thermal Management support subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device acpi"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides ACPI thermal handling feature as part of the
ACPI module.
This module has the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface and the
.Xr devd 8
notification interface.
Sysctls export ACPI objects as is.
The
.Nm
driver also activates active cooling system in accordance with appropriate
ACPI object.
.Sh SYSCTLS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.active
Current active system running state.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.thermal_flags
Current thermal zone status.
These are bit-masked values.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.temperature
Current temperature.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._PSV
Temperature to start passive cooling by throttling down CPU, etc.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._HOT
Temperature to start critical suspend to disk.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._CRT
Temperature to start critical shutdown.
.It Va hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._ACx
Active cooling start values.
The earlier value means the strengest
active cooling temperature.
.El
.Pp
All temperatures are represented in tenths of Kelvins.
For example, 300.0K is represented by the integer 3000.
To convert to Centigrades,
the formula is
.Li "(x - 2731.5) / 10" .
.Sh NOTIFIES
Notifies are passed as strings beginning with
.Qq Li "!system=ACPI subsystem=Thermal" ,
the thermal zone instance is distingushed by
the ACPI object path in the
.Qq Li type=
argument.
The notify value is passed in the
.Qq Li notify=
argument.
