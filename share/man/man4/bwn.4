.Sh NAME
.Nm bwn
.Nd Broadcom BCM43xx IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device siba_bwn"
.Cd "device bwn"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_amrr"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_bwn_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Broadcom BCM43xx based
PCI/CardBus network adapters.
.Pp
It supports
.Cm station
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
The
.Pa ports/net/bwn-firmware-kmod
port needs to be installed before
.Xr ifconfig 8
will work.
Most cases you need to use bwn_v4_ucode module but if you are a
LP (low power) PHY user please uses bwn_v4_lp_ucode module.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices, including:
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Apple Airport Extreme" "BCM4306" "Mini PCI" "a/b/g" -offset 6n
.It Em "Card	Chip	Bus	Standard"
.It "Apple Airport Extreme	BCM4318	PCI	b/g"
.It "ASUS WL-138g	BCM4318	PCI	b/g"
.It "Buffalo WLI-CB-G54S	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g"
.It "Dell Wireless 1470	BCM4318	Mini PCI	b/g"
.It "Dell Truemobile 1400	BCM4309	Mini PCI	b/g"
.It "HP Compaq 6715b	BCM4312	PCI	b/g"
.It "HP nx6125	BCM4319	PCI	b/g"
.It "Linksys WPC54G Ver 3	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g"
.It "Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g"
.It "US Robotics 5411	BCM4318	CardBus	b/g"
.El
.Pp
Users of older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and BCM4306 rev 2)
must use
.Xr bwi 4
because the v4 version of the firmware does not support these chips.
The newer firmware is too big to fit into these old chips.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwn0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwn0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwn0 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.bwn.msi_disable
This tunable disables MSI support on the hardware.
The default value is 0.
.It Va hw.bwn.usedma
This tunable enables DMA operations on the hardware.
If the value is 0, PIO mode would be used.
The default value is 1.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 8.1 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some LP PHY devices have DMA operation problems that in that case try to
use PIO mode.

.\"Some card based on the BCM4306 and BCM4309 chips do not work properly
.\"on channel 1, 2 and 3.
