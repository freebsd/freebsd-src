.Sh NAME
.Nm lge
.Nd "Level 1 LXT1001 NetCellerator PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device lge"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_lge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various NICs based on the Level 1 LXT1001
NetCellerator Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.
.Pp
The LXT1001 supports fiber PHYs and also a GMII port for use with
10/100/1000 copper PHYs, however there are currently no NICs on the
market that use this feature.
.Pp
The LXT1001 supports TCP/IP checksum offload for receive and
VLAN-based filtering as well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.
It also supports jumbo frames, which can be configured
via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 1000baseSX"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000baseSX operation over fiber optic cable.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "lge%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "lge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "lge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "lge%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
