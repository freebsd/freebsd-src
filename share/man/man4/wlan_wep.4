.Sh NAME
.Nm wlan_wep
.Nd WEP crypto support for 802.11 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wlan_wep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module handles the WEP cryptographic requirements of the 802.11 protocol.
It does encapsulation and decapsulation of WEP-encoded 802.11 frames
and optionally calculates the WEP cipher.
The
.Nm
module is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin module for use by the
.Xr wlan 4
module.
This module is automatically loaded if a WEP key is configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Should the underlying network device not be capable of doing the WEP
calculations in hardware, the
.Nm
module will do the work.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wlan 4 ,
.Xr wlan_ccmp 4 ,
.Xr wlan_gcmp 4 ,
.Xr wlan_tkip 4
.Sh STANDARDS
More information can be found in the IEEE 802.11 Standard.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 6.0 .
