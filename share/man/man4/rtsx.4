.Sh NAME
.Nm rtsx
.Nd Realtek SD card reader
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following
lines in the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd device mmc
.Cd device mmcsd
.Cd device rtsx
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time,
place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Cd mmc_load="YES"
.Cd mmcsd_load="YES"
.Cd rtsx_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Realtek SD card reader.
Driver attaches mmc bus on card insertion and detaches it on card removing.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following Realtek SD card readers:

.Sh DEBUGGING INFORMATION
.Em dev.rtsx.0.debug_mask
can be set with the following masks:
.Bl -bullet
.It
0x01 - to show the basic flow of the driver,
.It
0x02 - to trace the SD commands,
.It
0x04 - to trace the tuning phase.
.El
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
RTS522A on Lenovo T470p, card detection and read-only switch are reversed.
This is solved by adding in
.Em loader.conf(5) :
.Bd -ragged
.Cd dev.rtsx.0.inversion=1
.Ed
.Pp
The driver tries to automate those exceptions.
If this automation is wrong, it can be avoided by adding in
.Em loader.conf(5) :
.Bd -ragged
.Cd dev.rtsx.0.inversion=0
.Ed
.It
Mounting a filesystem with write access on a card write protected may involve a kernel crash.
.It
Suspend/Resume do not work under MMCCAM.
.It
For some chips (e.g. RTS5260) after
.Cd devctl disable/enable
or
.Cd kldunload/kldload
the driver can't detect a card correctly.
