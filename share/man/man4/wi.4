.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd Lucent Technologies WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11 PCMCIA driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wi"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for WaveLAN/IEEE PCCARD adapters (also known
as WaveLAN II cards). Note that while Lucent sells both ISA and PCMCIA
WaveLAN/IEEE devices, the ISA product is actually a PCMCIA card in an
ISA to PCMCIA bridge adapter.
Consequently, the
.Nm
driver is required for both the ISA and PCMCIA NICs.
Both the original
2Mbps WaveLAN/IEEE cards and the newer 6Mbps WaveLAN/IEEE Turbo
adapters are supported.
.Pp
The core of the WaveLAN/IEEE is the Lucent Hermes controller.
All
host/device interaction is via programmed I/O with the Hermes.
The
Hermes supports 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS, WDS
and ad-hoc operation modes.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is
selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed or 2Mbps with auto fallback.
For WaveLAN/IEEE Turbo adapters, speeds up to 6Mbps are available.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the WaveLAN card for BSS operation.
.Pp

.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wi%d: init failed"
The WaveLAN failed to come ready after an initialization command was
issued.
.It "wi%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "wi%d: device timeout"
The WaveLAN failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.
