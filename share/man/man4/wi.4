.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd WaveLAN/IEEE, PRISM-II and Spectrum24 802.11DS wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wi"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-II, Intersil PRISM-2.5, and Symbol
Spectrum24 chipsets.
All four chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
.Pp
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O.
Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS,
IBSS, WDS and old-style Lucent ad-hoc operation modes.
Cards based on the Intersil PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chips also support a
host-based access point mode which allows a card to act as a normal access
point (with some assistance from the
.Nm
driver).
The Lucent Hermes and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets do not contain this
functionality.
PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chips do not support the WDS functionality.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed, 2Mbps
with auto fallback, 5.5Mbps, 8Mbps, or 11Mbps depending on your hardware.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Silver and Gold cards as well as the Intersil
and Symbol cards have support for WEP encryption.
The WaveLAN Gold as well as newer Intersil and Symbol cards support
104bit keys, the others only accept 40bit keys.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Bronze cards do not support WEP at all.
To enable encryption, use the
.Xr wicontrol 8
utility to set your keys, or use
.Xr ifconfig 8
as shown below.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the card for BSS operation (aka infrastructure
mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (base station).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports an point-to-point mode where the ssid is
ignored and stations can communicate amongst themselves without the
aid of an access point.
Note that there are two possible point-to-point modes.
One mode, referred to as
.Dq ad-hoc demo mode ,
or
.Dq legacy Lucent ad-hoc mode ,
predates the IEEE 802.11 specification and so may not interoperate
with cards from different vendors.
The standardized point-to-point mode, is called IBSS (or confusingly
just ad-hoc mode), but is not supported by cards with very old
firmware revisions.
If your cards supports IBSS mode, it is recommended that you use it in
preference to the
.Dq ad-hoc demo mode
in new installations.
.Pp
Cards based on the Intersil PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chips also
have a host-based access point mode which allows the card to
act as an access point (base station).
Access points are different than operating in IBSS mode.
They operate in BSS mode.
They allow for easier roaming and bridge all ethernet traffic such
that machines connected via an access point appear to be on the local
ethernet segment.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
.br
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.

The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples utilize
.Xr ifconfig 8
for simplicity, however,
.Xr wicontrol 8
can also be used to set wireless parameters.
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network (ie: connect to an access point):
.Dl # ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq my_net .
.Dl # ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net
.br
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
	wepkey 0x8736639624
.Ed
.Pp
Join a Lucent legacy demo ad-hoc network with network name
.Dq my_net .
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
	mediaopt adhoc
.Ed
.Pp
Create an IBSS network with network name
.Dq my_net .
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
	mediaopt ibss-master
.Ed
Note: The infrastructure for mediaopt ibss-master has not been
committed yet.
.Pp
Join an IBSS network with network name
.Dq my_net .
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
	mediaopt ibss
.Ed
Note: The infrastructure for mediaopt ibss has not been
committed yet.
.Pp
Create a host-based access point (Prism only):
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \e
	mediaopt hostap
.Ed
.Pp
Create a host-based access point with WEP enabled (Prism only):
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
# ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \e
	wepkey 0x1234567890 mediaopt hostap
.Ed
.Pp
Create a host-based wireless bridge to fxp0 (Prism only):
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
Add BRIDGE to the kernel config.
# ifconfig wi0 inet up ssid my_ap mediaopt hostap
# sysctl net.link.ether.bridge=1
# sysctl net.link.ether.bridge_cfg="wi0 fxp0"
# sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
.Ed
This will give you approximately the same functionality as an access
point.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wi%d: init failed"
The WaveLAN card failed to come ready after an initialization command
was issued.
.It "wi%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "wi%d: device timeout"
The WaveLAN failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.

The

driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

.Ox .
.Sh CAVEATS
The original Lucent WaveLAN cards usually default to channel 3;
newer cards use channel 10 by default.
Non-Lucent cards vary, for instance the Addtron cards use channel
11 by default.
Different regulatory domains have different default channels.
See
.Xr wicontrol 8
for information on how to change the channel.
.Pp
IBSS creation does not currently work with Symbol cards.
.Pp
Prism2 host-based access point mode has bugs for firmware versions
prior to 0.8.3.
.Pp
Lucent cards prior to firmware version 6.0.4 do not support ibss
mode.
