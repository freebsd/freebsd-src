.Sh NAME
.Nm atopcase
.Nd Apple HID-over-SPI transport driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device atopcase"
.Cd "device intelspi"
.Cd "device spibus"
.Cd "device hidbus"
.Cd "device hkbd"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
atopcase_load="YES"
hkbd_load="YES"
.Ed

.Sh BUGS
Device interrupts are not acknowledged on some hardware that results in
interrupt storm.
Installation of Darwin OSI in
.Xr acpi 4
driver fixes the issue.
To install Darwin OSI add following lines to
