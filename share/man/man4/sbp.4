.Sh NAME
.Nm sbp
.Nd Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "kldload firewire"
.Cd "kldload cam"
.Cd "kldload sbp"
.Pp
or

.Cd "device sbp"
.Cd "device firewire"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device da"
.Cd "device cd"
.Cd "device pass"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SBP-2 devices that attach to the FireWire
(IEEE 1394) port.
It should work with SBP-2 devices which the CAM layer supports, for example,
HDDs, CDROM drives and DVD drives.
.Pp
Some users familiar with
.Xr umass 4
might wonder why the device is not detached at the CAM layer when the device
is unplugged.
It is detached only if the device has not been plugged again
during several bus resets.
This is for preventing to detach an active file system
even when the device cannot be probed correctly for some reason after a bus reset
or when the device is temporary disconnected because the user changes the bus
topology.
If you want to force to detach the device, run
.Dq Nm fwcontrol Fl r
several times or set hw.firewire.hold_count=0 by
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
Some (broken) HDDs do not work well with tagged queuing.
If you have problems with such drives, try
.Dq Nm camcontrol [device id] tags -N 1
to disable tagged queuing.
