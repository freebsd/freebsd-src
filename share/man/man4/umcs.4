.Sh NAME
.Nm umcs
.Nd USB support for serial adapters based on the MCS7820 and MCS7840 chips
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device umcs"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umcs_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various multiport serial adapters based on the MosCom
MCS7820 and MCS7840 chips.
They are 2- or 4-port adapters with full-featured
16550-compatible UARTs and very flexible baud generators.
Also, these chips
support RS422/RS485 and IrDA operations.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Pp
Different ports on device are presented as sub-units, like
.Pa /dev/ttyU0.1
and
.Pa /dev/ttyU0.2 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver was tested on the following adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
ST Lab U-360 two-port serial USB adapter
.It
ST Lab U-400 four-port serial USB adapter
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/ttyU*.*.init" -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*
for callin ports
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*.init
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*.lock
corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state devices
.Pp
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*
for callout ports
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*.init
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*.lock
corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state devices
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in ports since December of 2010.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Lev Serebryakov Aq Mt lev@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
This driver doesn't support access to any fine tunes of
chip, like RS522/RS485 mode, non-standard baudrates, etc.
