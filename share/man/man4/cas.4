.Sh NAME
.Nm cas
.Nd Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device cas"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_cas_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National
Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet controllers.
.Pp
All controllers supported by the
.Nm
driver have TCP/UDP checksum offload capability for both receive and
transmit, support for the reception and transmission of extended frames
for
.Xr vlan 4
and an interrupt coalescing/moderation mechanism as well as a 512-bit
multicast hash filter.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9022 bytes), which can be
configured via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
.Sh HARDWARE

.Nm
driver are:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Fx 8.0
and
.Fx 7.3 .
It is named after the
.Nm
driver which first appeared in
.Ox 4.1
and supports the same set of controllers but is otherwise unrelated.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Marius Strobl Aq Mt marius@FreeBSD.org
based on the
.Xr gem 4
driver.
