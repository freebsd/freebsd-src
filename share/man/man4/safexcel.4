.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm safexcel
.Nd Inside Secure SafeXcel-IP-97 cryptographic offload engine
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device cryptodev"
.Cd "device safexcel"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
safexcel_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver implements
.Xr crypto 4
support for the cryptographic acceleration functions of the EIP-97 device
found on some Marvell systems-on-chip.
The driver can accelerate the following AES modes:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
AES-CBC
.It
AES-CTR
.It
AES-XTS
.It
AES-GCM
.It
AES-CCM
.El
.Pp
.Nm
also implements SHA1 and SHA2 transforms, and can combine AES-CBC and AES-CTR
with SHA1-HMAC and SHA2-HMAC for encrypt-then-authenticate operations.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the cryptographic acceleration functions of the
Inside Secure EIP-97 device found on some Marvell systems-on-chip.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 13.0 .
