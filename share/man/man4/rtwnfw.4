.Sh NAME
.Nm rtwnfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Realtek Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device rtwnfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include all firmware images inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8188eefw"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8188eufw"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwT"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192cfwU"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8192eufw"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8812aufw"
.Cd "device rtwn-rtl8821aufw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load all firmware images as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rtwn-rtl8188eefw_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8188eufw_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192cfwT_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192cfwU_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8192eufw_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8812aufw_load="YES"
rtwn-rtl8821aufw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
rtwn-rtl8192cfwE and rtl8192cfwE_B modules provide access
to firmware sets for the Realtek RTL8188CE chip based PCIe adapters.
rtwn-rtl8188ee module provides access to firmware sets for the
Realtek RTL8188EE chip based PCIe adapters.
Other modules provide access to firmware sets for the Realtek RTL8188CUS,
RTL8188CE-VAU, RTL8188EUS, RTL8188RU, RTL8192CU, RTL8192EU, RTL8812AU and
RTL8821AU chip based USB WiFi adapters.
They may be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a modules.
.Pp
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/realtek.LICENSE
must be agreed to by adding the following line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "legal.realtek.license_ack=1"
