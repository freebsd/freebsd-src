.Sh NAME
.Nm geom_linux_lvm
.Nd "GEOM based Linux LVM logical volume mapping"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options GEOM_LINUX_LVM"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
geom_linux_lvm_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides support for mapping Linux LVM volumes to GEOM providers.
.Nm
currently supports linear stripes with segments on one or more physical disks.
The parser is able to read LVM2 Text Format metadata, the logical volumes will
be assembled and made available under
.Pa /dev/linux_lvm/ .
The metadata is read-only, logical volumes cannot be allocated or resized.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To view which
.Nm
devices are available:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# geom linux_lvm list
