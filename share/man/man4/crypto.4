.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto
.Nd hardware crypto access driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm device crypto
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides userland applications access to hardware crypto support
via the kernel.
The
.Pa /dev/crypto
device node primarily operates in an
.Xr ioctl 2
based model, permitting a variety of applications to query device capabilities,
submit transactions, and get results.
.Pp
If
.Ar count
given in the specification, and is greater than 0, a maximum of one
.Nm crypto
device is created.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply only to the
.Nm crypto
devices:
.Bl -tag -width CIOCGSESSION
.It Dv CIOCGSESSION
Setup a new crypto session for a new type of operation.
.It Dv CIOCFSESSION
Free a previously established session.
.It Dv CIOCCRYPT
Perform a crypto operation against a previously setup session.
.El
.Pp
.Sh FEATURES
Depending on hardware being present, the following symmetric and
assymetric cryptographic features are potentially available from
.Pa /dev/crypto :
