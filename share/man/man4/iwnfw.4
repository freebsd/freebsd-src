.Sh NAME
.Nm iwnfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Intel Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwnfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include firmware images for all
.Xr iwn 4
devices inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwn1000fw"
.Cd "device iwn100fw"
.Cd "device iwn105fw"
.Cd "device iwn135fw"
.Cd "device iwn2000fw"
.Cd "device iwn2030fw"
.Cd "device iwn4965fw"
.Cd "device iwn5000fw"
.Cd "device iwn5150fw"
.Cd "device iwn6000fw"
.Cd "device iwn6000g2afw"
.Cd "device iwn6000g2bfw"
.Cd "device iwn6050fw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
iwn1000fw_load="YES"
iwn100fw_load="YES"
iwn105fw_load="YES"
iwn135fw_load="YES"
iwn2000fw_load="YES"
iwn2030fw_load="YES"
iwn4965fw_load="YES"
iwn5000fw_load="YES"
iwn5150fw_load="YES"
iwn6000fw_load="YES"
iwn6000g2afw_load="YES"
iwn6000g2bfw_load="YES"
iwn6050fw_load="YES"
