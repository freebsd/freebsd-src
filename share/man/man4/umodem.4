.Sh NAME
.Nm umodem
.Nd USB Communication Device Class serial (CDC ACM) driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device umodem"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umodem_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB modems and serial devices that
implement the Communication Device Class Abstract Control Model (CDC ACM).
It also provides device-side CDC ACM support.
Supported modems are basically standard serial line modems, but they are
accessed via USB instead.
They support a regular AT command set.
The commands can either be multiplexed with the data stream
or handled through separate pipes.
In the latter case the AT
commands have to be given on a device separate from the data device.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .

.Nm
driver include:

.Sh BUGS
Only modems with multiplexed commands and data are supported
at the moment.
