.Sh NAME
.Nm epair
.Nd A pair of virtual back-to-back connected Ethernet interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device epair"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_epair_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a pair of Ethernet-like software interfaces,
which are connected back-to-back with a virtual cross-over cable.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
interface pair is created at runtime using interface cloning.
This is most easily done with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm create
command or using the
.Va cloned_interfaces
variable in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
While for cloning you only give either
.Pa epair
or
.Pa epair<n>
the
.Nm
pair will be named like
.Pa epair<n>[ab] .
This means the names of the first
.Nm
interfaces will be
.Pa epair0a
and
.Pa epair0b .
.Pp
Like any other Ethernet interface, an
.Nm
needs to have a network address.
Each
.Nm
will be assigned a locally administered address by default,
that is only guaranteed to be unique within one network stack.
To change the default addresses one may use the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2) or
ifconfig(8) utility.
.Pp
The basic intent is to provide connectivity between two virtual
network stack instances.
When connected to an
.Xr if_bridge 4 ,
one end of the interface pair can also be part of another (virtual) LAN.
As with any other Ethernet interface,
.Nm epair
can have a
.Xr vlan 4
configured on top of it.
