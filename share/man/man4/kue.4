.Sh NAME
.Nm kue
.Nd "Kawasaki LSI KL5KUSB101B USB Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device kue"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_kue_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Kawasaki
LSI KL5KLUSB101B chipset.
.Pp
The KL5KLUSB101B supports a 128-entry multicast filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The Kawasaki chipset supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
are no
.Fn ifmedia
modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@ee.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not accumulate Ethernet collisions statistics because the
Kawasaki firmware does not appear to maintain any internal statistics.
