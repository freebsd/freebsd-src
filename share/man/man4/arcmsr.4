.Sh NAME
.Nm arcmsr
.Nd Areca RAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device da"
.Cd "device arcmsr"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
arcmsr_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Areca ARC-11xx, ARC-12xx, ARC-13xx,
ARC-16xx and ARC-18xx series of SAS and SATA RAID controllers.
These controllers feature RAID-0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 and
JBOD acceleration for up to 16 SATA drives.
RAID level and stripe level
migration, online capacity expansion, hot insertion/removal, automatic failover
and rebuild, and SMART are also supported.
Access to the arrays is provided
via the SCSI CAM
.Pa /dev/da?
device nodes.
A management interface is also present via the
.Pa /dev/arcmsr?
device node.
Management tools for i386 and amd64 are available from Areca.
.Sh HARDWARE

.Nm
driver supports the following cards:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by
.An Erich Chen Aq Mt erich@areca.com.tw .
.Sh BUGS
The driver has been tested on i386 and amd64.
It likely requires additional
work to function on big-endian architectures.
