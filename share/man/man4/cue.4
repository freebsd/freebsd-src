.Sh NAME
.Nm cue
.Nd "CATC USB-EL1210A USB Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device cue"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_cue_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Computer
Access Technology Corporation's USB-EL1210A chipset.
.Pp
The USB-EL1210A supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The CATC chipset supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
are no
.Fn ifmedia
modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports CATC USB-EL1210A based USB Ethernet
adapters including:
