.Cd "device cue"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB ethernet adapters based on the Computer
Access Technology Corporation's USB-EL1210A chipset, including the
CATC Netmate and Netmate II, and the Belkin F5U011/F5U111.
.Pp
The USB-EL1210A supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The CATC adapter supports only 10mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
are no

modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
