.Nd generic HID bus driver

To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device hidbus"
.Cd "device hid"
.Ed
.Pp

.Bd -literal -offset indent
hidbus_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for multiple HID driver attachments to single HID
transport backend.
See
.Xr iichid 4
or
.Xr usbhid 4 .
.Pp
Each HID device can have several components, e.g., a keyboard and
a mouse.
These components use different report identifiers (a byte) combined into
groups called collections to distinguish which one data is coming from.
The
.Nm
driver has other drivers attached that handle particular
kinds of devices and
.Nm
broadcasts data to all of them.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.hid.hidbus.debug
Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger values increase
debug message verbosity.
Default is 0.
