.Sh NAME
.Nm rtw89
.Nd Realtek IEEE 802.11ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The driver will auto-load without any user interaction using
.Xr devmatch 8
if enabled in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
Only if auto-loading is explicitly disabled, place the following
lines in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to manually load the driver as a module at boot time:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kld_list="${kld_list} if_rtw89"
.Ed
.Pp
It is not possible to load the driver from
.Xr loader 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is derived from Realtek's Linux rtw89 driver.
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
The package
.Pa wifi-firmware-rtw89-kmod
from the
.Pa ports/net/wifi-firmware-rtw89-kmod
port needs to be installed before the driver is loaded.
Otherwise no
.Xr wlan 4
interface can be created using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
One should use
.Xr fwget 8
to install the correct firmware package.
.Pp
The driver uses the
.\" No LinuxKPI man pages so no .Xr here.
.Sy linuxkpi_wlan
and
.Sy linuxkpi
compat framework to bridge between the Linux and
native
.Fx
driver code as well as to the native
.Xr net80211 4
wireless stack.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports PCIe devices with the following chipsets:

.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va compat.linuxkpi.skb.mem_limit
If you are running a 64bit system with more than 4GB of main memory
you need to set this tunable to
.Sy 1
in
.Xr loader.conf 5
and reboot once to make it effective.
This tunable will work around a problem with DMA and limit allocations
for network buffer memory to the lower 32bit of physical memory and
make the driver work.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 14.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Certainly.
.Pp
Does not seem to work (reliably) on machines with more than 4GB of
main memory.
See in the
.Sx LOADER TUNABLES
section above.
.Pp
While
.Nm
supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax modes,
the compatibility code currently only supports 802.11a/b/g modes.
Support for 802.11n/ac/ax is yet to come.
