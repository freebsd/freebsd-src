.Sh NAME
.Nm em ,
.Nm lem ,
.Nm igb
.Nd "Intel(R) PRO/1000 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iflib"
.Cd "device em"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_em_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI/PCI-X Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on
the Intel 82540, 82541ER, 82541PI, 82542, 82543, 82544, 82545, 82546,
82546EB, 82546GB, and 82547 controller chips.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet adapters
based on the Intel 82571, 82572, 82573, 82574, and 82583 Ethernet
controller chips.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Gigabit Ethernet adapters connected to I/O
Controller Hub (ICH) and Platform Controller Hub (PCH) including Intel
80003ES2LAN, 82562, 82566, 82567, 82577, 82578, 82579, i217, i218, and i219.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet adapters
based on the Intel 82575, 82576, 82580, i210, i211, and i35x.
These appear as
.Nm igb
interfaces to maintain compatibility with existing infrastructure.
.Pp
The driver supports Transmit/Receive checksum offload and Jumbo Frames
on all but 82542-based adapters.
.Pp
Furthermore it supports TCP segmentation offload (TSO) on all adapters but
those based on the 82542, 82543, 82544 and 82547 controller chips.
The identification LEDs of the adapters supported by the
.Nm
driver can be controlled via the
.Xr led 4
API for localization purposes.
For further hardware information, see the
.Pa README
included with the driver.
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the
documentation supplied with your Intel PRO/1000 adapter.
All hardware requirements listed apply to use with
.Fx .
.Pp
Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 16114.
.Pp
This driver supports hardware assisted VLANs.
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enables auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Sets 10Mbps operation.
Use the
.Cm mediaopt
option to select
.Cm full-duplex
mode.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Sets 100Mbps operation.
Use the
.Cm mediaopt
option to select
.Cm full-duplex
mode.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Sets 1000Mbps operation.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported at this speed.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Sets 1000Mbps operation.
Only
.Cm full-duplex
mode is supported at this speed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Forces full-duplex operation
.It Cm half-duplex
Forces half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
Only use
.Cm mediaopt
to set the driver to
.Cm full-duplex .
If
.Cm mediaopt
is not specified, the driver defaults to
.Cm half-duplex .
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the Intel
82540, 82541ER, 82541PI, 82542, 82543, 82544, 82545, 82546, 82546EB,
82546GB, 82547, 82571, 82572, 82573, 82574, 82575, 82576, and 82580

.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
See
.Xr iflib 4
for per-instance variables.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.em.disable_crc_stripping
Disable or enable hardware stripping of CRC field.
This is mostly useful on BMC/IPMI shared interfaces where stripping the CRC
causes remote access over IPMI to fail.
Default 0 (enabled).
.It Va hw.em.eee_setting
Disable or enable Energy Efficient Ethernet.
Default 1 (disabled).
.It Va hw.em.smart_pwr_down
Enable or disable smart power down features on newer adapters.
Default 0 (disabled).
.It Va hw.em.sbp
Show bad packets when in promiscuous mode.
Default 0 (off).
.It Va hw.em.rx_int_delay
This value delays the generation of receive interrupts in units of
1.024 microseconds.
The default value is 0, since adapters may hang with this feature
being enabled.
.It Va hw.em.rx_abs_int_delay
If
.Va hw.em.rx_int_delay
is non-zero, this tunable limits the maximum delay in which a receive
interrupt is generated.
.It Va hw.em.tx_int_delay
This value delays the generation of transmit interrupts in units of
1.024 microseconds.
The default value is 64.
.It Va hw.em.tx_abs_int_delay
If
.Va hw.em.tx_int_delay
is non-zero, this tunable limits the maximum delay in which a transmit
interrupt is generated.
.It Va hw.em.max_interrupt_rate
Maximum interrupts per second.
The default value is 8000.
.It Va hw.em.rx_process_limit
Maximum number of received packets to process at a time, -1 means unlimited.
The default value is 100.
