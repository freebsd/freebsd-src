.Sh NAME
.Nm dpms
.Nd VESA BIOS DPMS driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device dpms"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver uses the VESA BIOS to manage an external display during suspend and
resume.
When the machine suspends,
the
.Nm
driver turns the external display off.
When the machine resumes,
it restores the display to its state when the driver was first loaded.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi_video 4
.Sh BUGS
The VESA BIOS DPMS calls do not provide any way to identify a particular
display or adapter to manipulate.
As a result,
this driver may have unexpected results on systems with multiple displays
and/or adapters.
