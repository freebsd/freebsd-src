.Sh NAME
.Nm simplebus
.Nd ePAPR simple-bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options FDT"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This bus driver is dedicated for the
.Pa simple-bus
node of a flattened device tree compliant with the
.Pa ePAPR
specification.
.Pp
The
.Nm
entity does not represent any physical element by itself, it is rather an
umbrella node grouping integrated on-chip peripherals like interrupt
controller, connectivity controllers, accelerating engines and so on.
.Pp
The driver is generic and common for all flattened device tree nodes claiming
.Pa simple-bus
compatibility.
It iterates over direct descendants of the
.Pa simple-bus
node, instantiates newbus children and assigns resources to them, based on the
configuration data retrieved from the nodes properties in
.Xr fdt 4 .
.Pp
Note the
.Nm
does not manage device resources and passes through any requests to the
.Xr fdtbus 4
layer.
