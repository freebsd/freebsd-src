.Sh NAME
.Nm wsp
.Nd Wellspring touchpad driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device wsp"
.Cd "device hid"
.Cd "device usb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time,
place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
wsp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Apple Internal Trackpad
device found in many Apple laptops.
.Pp
The driver simulates a three-button mouse using multi-finger press/tap
detection.
A single-finger press generates a left button click.
A two-finger press maps to the right button; whereas a three-finger
press gets treated as a middle button click.
.Pp
The trackpad functions with presses and taps. A press is a full-forced
press which causes a physical lowering of the trackpad. A tap is a
touch of the trackpad which does not depress the physical trackpad.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports receiving evdev input device data if enabled. This data
is used for extended usage of the touchpad like multi-finger support,
pressure detection, tap support, and gestures. At least the second bit
of the
.Xr sysctl 8
tunable
.Va kern.evdev.rcpt_mask
must be set. This can be enabled with
.Va kern.evdev.rcpt_mask=3 .
.Pp
Vertical scrolling (z-axis) is enabled by default with a two-finger
tap and the movement of a finger up and down.
Horizontal scrolling (t-axis) is not natively supported by the sysmouse
protocol, therefore must be enabled with evdev data. This can be enabled
with the
.Xr sysctl 8
tunable
.Va kern.evdev.sysmouse_t_axis=3.
Horizontal scrolling can be used with a two-finger tap and the movement
of a finger from side to side. The
.Xr sysctl 8
tunable
.Va hw.usb.wsp.t_factor
must be greater than 0 for horizontal scrolling to be enabled, too.
.Pp
Horizontal swiping with a three-finger tap is registered as mouse buttons
8 and 9, depending on the direction. These buttons default to backwards
and forwards keyboard events.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as
.Xr sysctl 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.scale_factor
Controls the pointer sensitivity. Default is 12.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.enable_single_tap_clicks
Enables single-tap to register as a left-click. Default is 1 (enabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.enable_single_tap_movement
Enables movement on the trackpad follow a partially-released left-click.
Default is 1 (enabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.max_finger_diameter
Specifies the maximum finger diameter on the trackpad that is registered as a
finger (a lower value is used for palm detection). Default is 1900.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va max_scroll_finger_distance
Specifies the maximum distance between two fingers where z-axis
and t-axis movements are registered. Z-axis and T-axis movements
are vertical and horizontal movements with more than one finger
tapped (not clicked), respectively. Default is 8192.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.max_double_tap_distance
Specifies the maximum distance between two fingers that a two-finger
click will be registered as a right-click. Default is 2500.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.scr_threshold
Specifies the minimum horizontal or vertical distance required to
register as a scrolling gesture. Default is 20.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.z_factor
Z-axis sensitivity. Default is 5.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.z_invert
Z-axis inversion. Default is 0 (disabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.t_factor
T-axis sensitivity. Default is 0 (disabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.t_invert
T-axis inversion. Default is 0 (disabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.scroll_finger_count
Specifies the number of tapped fingers which registers as a scrolling
movement. Default is 2.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.horizontal_swipe_finger_count
Speifies the number of tapped fingers which registers as a swipe
gesture. Default is 3.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.pressure_touch_threshold
Specifies the threshold for a finger to be registered as a click.
Default is 50.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.pressure_untouch_threshold
Specifies the threshold for a finger to be registered as an unclick.
Default is 10.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.pressure_tap_threshold
Specifies the threadhold for a finger to be registered as a tap.
Default is 120.
.El
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.wsp.debug
Specifies the
.Nm
driver debugging level (0-3). Default is 1.
.Sh FILES
.Nm
creates a blocking pseudo-device file,
.Pa /dev/wsp0 ,
which presents the mouse as a
.Em sysmouse
or
.Em mousesystems
type device--see
.Xr moused 8
for an explanation of these mouse
types.
