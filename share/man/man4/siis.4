.Sh NAME
.Nm siis
.Nd SiliconImage Serial ATA Host Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device siis"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
siis_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
The following tunables are settable from the
.Xr loader 8 :
.Bl -ohang
.It Va hint.siis. Ns Ar X Ns Va .msi
controls Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) usage by the specified controller.
.It Va hint.siisch. Ns Ar X Ns Va .pm_level
controls SATA interface Power Management for the specified channel,
allowing some power to be saved at the cost of additional command
latency.
Possible values:
.Bl -tag -width 2n -offset indent
.It 0
interface Power Management is disabled (default);
.It 1
device is allowed to initiate PM state change, host is passive.
.El
.Pp
Note that interface Power Management is not compatible with
device presence detection.
A manual bus reset is needed on device hot-plug.
.It Va hint.siisch. Ns Ar X Ns Va .sata_rev
setting to nonzero value limits maximum SATA revision (speed).
Values 1, 2 and 3 are respectively 1.5, 3 and 6Gbps.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides the
.Xr CAM 4
subsystem with native access to the
.Tn SATA
ports of controller.
Each SATA port is represented to CAM as a separate bus with 16 targets.
Most of the bus-management details are handled by the SATA-specific
transport of CAM.
Connected ATA disks are handled by the ATA protocol disk peripheral driver
.Xr ada 4 .
ATAPI devices are handled by the SCSI protocol peripheral drivers
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr da 4 ,
.Xr sa 4 ,
etc.
.Pp
Driver features include support for Serial ATA and ATAPI devices,
Port Multipliers (including FIS-based switching), hardware command queues
(31 command per port), Native Command Queuing, SATA interface Power Management,
device hot-plug and Message Signaled Interrupts.
.Pp
The activity LEDs of the adapters supported by the
.Nm
driver can be controlled via the
.Xr led 4
API for localization or status reporting purposes.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following controller chips:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact

SiI3124 (PCI-X 133MHz/64bit, 4 ports)
.It
SiI3131 (PCIe 1.0 x1, 1 port)
