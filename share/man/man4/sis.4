.Sh NAME
.Nm sis
.Nd "SiS 900, SiS 7016 and NS DP83815 fast ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device sis"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900
and SiS 7016 fast ethernet controller chips, as well as support
for adapters based on the National Semiconductor DP83815 (MacPhyter)
PCI ethernet controller chip, including the Netgear FA311-TX and
FA312-TX.
.Pp
The SiS 900 is a 100Mbps ethernet MAC and MII-compliant transceiver
in a single package.
It uses a bus master DMA and a scatter/gather
descriptor scheme.
The SiS 7016 is similar to the SiS 900 except
that it has no internal PHY, requiring instead an external transceiver
to be attached to its MII interface.
The SiS 900 and SiS 7016 both have a 128-bit multicast hash filter
and a single perfect filter entry for the station address.
.Pp
The NS DP83815 is also a 100Mbps ethernet MAC with integrated PHY.
The NatSemi chip and the SiS 900 share many of the same features and
a fairly similar programming interface, hence both chips are supported
by the same driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10baseTXUTP
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sis%d: couldn't map ports/memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sis%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sis%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (e.g. a cable fault).
.It "sis%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "sis%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a clusisr.
.It "sis%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it will not be able to configure it
correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If
you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform a
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If you power down your system prior to booting
.Fx ,
the card should be configured correctly.
