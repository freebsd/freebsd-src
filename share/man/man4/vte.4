.Sh NAME
.Nm vte
.Nd Vortex86 RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device vte"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_vte_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet controller
which is commonly found on Vortex86 System On a Chip (SoC).
.Pp
The RDC R6040 has integrated 10/100 PHY for 10/100Mbps support in full
or half-duplex.
The controller supports interrupt moderation mechanism, a 64-bit multicast
hash filter, VLAN over-size frame and four station addresses.
The
.Nm
device driver uses three station addresses out of four as perfect
multicast filter.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for the following Ethernet controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
DM&P Vortex86 RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet controller
.El
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va hw.vte.tx_deep_copy
The RDC R6040 controller has no auto-padding support for short
frames and the controller's DMA engine does not have capability to
handle multiple buffers for a TX frame such that driver has to
create a single contiguous TX buffer.
This hardware limitation leads to poor TX performance since most of
CPU cycles are wasted on both de-fragmenting mbuf chains and padding.
This tunable enables deep copy operation for TX frames such that
driver will spend less CPU cycles in de-fragmentation with the
cost of extra TX buffer memory.
The default value is 1 to use deep copy.
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va dev.vte.%d.rx_mod
Maximum number of packets to fire RX completion interrupt.
The accepted range is 0 to 15, the default is 15.
.It Va dev.vte.%d.tx_mod
Maximum number of packets to fire TX completion interrupt.
The accepted range is 0 to 15, the default is 15.
.It Va dev.vte.%d.stats
Show hardware MAC statistics maintained in driver.
