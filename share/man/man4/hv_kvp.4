.Sh NAME
.Nm hv_kvp
.Nd Hyper-V Key Value Pair Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in
the system kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device hyperv"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the ability to store, retrieve, modify and delete
key value pairs for
.Fx
guest partitions running on Hyper-V.
Hyper-V allows administrators to store custom metadata in the form
of key value pairs inside the
.Fx
guest partition.
Administrators can use Windows Powershell scripts to add, read,
modify and delete such key value pairs.
.Pp
The driver is bare bones and merely forwards requests to its counterpart
user mode daemon,
.Xr hv_kvp_daemon 8 .
The daemon maintains pools of key value
pairs and does the actual metadata management.
.Pp
The same driver and daemon combination are also used to set and get
IP addresses from a
.Fx
guest.
.Pp
The set functionality is particularly
useful when the
.Fx
guest is assigned a static IP address and is failed over from one
Hyper-V host to another.
After failover, Hyper-V uses the set IP functionality to automatically
update the
.Fx
guest's IP address to its original static value.
.Pp
On the other hand, the get IP functionality is used to update the guest IP
address in the Hyper-V management console window.
