.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_gif_demux
.Nd demultiplexer for packets from
.Xr ng_gif 4
nodes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netgraph/ng_gif_demux.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
netgraph node type demultiplexes the output from
.Xr ng_gif 4
nodes in the
.Xr netgraph 4
networking subsystem.
.Pp
The
.Dv gif
hook is meant to be connected to the
.Dv lower
or
.Dv orphans
hook of an
.Xr ng_gif 4
node.
The
.Dv inet , inet6 , atalk , ipx , atm , natm ,
and
.Dv ns
hooks output frames of the given type when they are received on the
.Dv gif
hook.
When a frame is received on one of these hooks, it is encapsulated and
sent out the
.Dv gif
hook.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv inet6"
.It Va gif
Connection to the
.Dv lower
or
.Dv orphans
hook of an
.Xr ng_gif 4
node.
.It Va inet
Hook for input and output of IP frames.
.It Va inet6
Hook for input and output of IPv6 frames.
.It Va atalk
Hook for input and output of AppleTalk frames.
.It Va ipx
Hook for input and output of IPX frames.
.It Va atm
Hook for input and output of ATM frames.
.It Va natm
Hook for input and output of NATM frames.
.It Va ns
Hook for input and output of NS frames.
