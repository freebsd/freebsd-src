.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device isp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn FibreChannel
devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions
for
.Tn SCSI ,
Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280), and Ultra3 LVD (for the
ISP12160).
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
and utilizes Class 3 and Class 2 connections (Qlogic 2100 is Class
3 only, minor patches to the Qlogic 2200 to force Class 2 mode).
Support is available for Public and Private loops, and for
point-to-point connections (Qlogic 2200 only).
The newer 2-Gigabit cards (2300, 2312) are also supported.
Command tagging is
supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
Fabric support is enabled by default (but may
be contingent upon the correct firmware being loaded).
.Sh FIRMWARE
Firmware is available if the
.Xr ispfw 4
module is loaded during bootstrap (q.v.).
.Pp
It is very strongly recommended that you use the firmware available
from
.Xr ispfw 4
as it is the most likely to have been tested with this driver.
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp

.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.Pp
Target mode support may be enabled with the
.Pp
.Cd options ISP_TARGET_MODE
.Pp
option.
.Sh BOOT OPTIONS
The following options are switchable by setting values in
.Pa /boot/device.hints .
.Pp
They are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hint.isp.0.disable
A hint value to disable driver in kernel.
.It Va hint.isp.0.fwload_disable
A hint value to disable loading of firmware
.Cd ispfw(4) .
.It Va hint.isp.0.prefer_memmap
A hint value to use PCI Memory space instead of I/O space
access for.
.It Va hint.isp.0.prefer_iomap
A hint value to use PCI I/O space instead of Memory space
access for.
.It Va hint.isp.0.ignore_nvram
A hint value to ignore board NVRAM settings for. Otherwise
use NVRAM settings.
.It Va hint.isp.0.fullduplex
A hint value to set full duplex mode.

.Pp
.Cd lport-only
(Loopback only).
.Pp
.Cd nport-only
(Point to point only).
.Pp

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by Matthew Jacob for NASA/Ames Research Center.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently does not do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Target mode support is not completely debugged yet.
It works reasonably
well for Fibre Channel, somewhat well for Qlogic 1040 cards, but
does not yet work for the other cards (due to last minute unannounced
changes in firmware interfaces).
.Pp
Sometimes, when booting, the driver gets stuck waiting for the
Fibre Channel f/w to tell it that the loop port database is ready,
or waiting for a good loop to be seen (this does not yet support
booting without being connected to a fibre channel device).
To
unwedge the system, unplug and replug the fibre channel connection,
or otherwise cause a LIP (Loop Initialization Primitive sequence)-
this will kick the f/w into getting unstuck.
.Pp
QLogic 2322 support is limited to platforms where the BIOS can
enable firmware as there is no code yet to do the 3 stage loading
for 2322 firmware.
