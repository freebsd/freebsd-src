.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device isp"
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd device scbus0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn SCSI
or
.Tn FibreChannel
devices.
.Pp
SCSI features include support for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions
for
.Tn SCSI ,
Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080 and ISP1280), and Ultra3 LVD (for the
ISP12160).
.Pp
Fibre Channel support uses FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
and utilizes Class 3 and Class 2 connections (Qlogic 2100 is Class
3 only, minor patches to the Qlogic 2200 to force Class 2 mode).
Support is available for Public and Private loops, and for
point-to-point connections (Qlogic 2200 only).  Command tagging is
supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging). Fabric support is enabled by default (but may
be contingent upon the correct firmware being loaded).
.Sh FIRMWARE
Firmware is now available if the
.Xr ispfw 4
module is loaded during bootstrap (q.v.).
.Sh HARDWARE
Supported cards include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -offset indent
.It ISP1000

.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.Pp
.Pp
Target mode support may be enabled with the
.sp
.Cd options ISP_TARGET_MODE
.sp
option.
.Sh BOOT OPTIONS
.Pp
The following options are switchable by setting values in the loader
configuration file (see the
.Xr loader 8
manual page). They are:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width "isp_no_fwload" -compact
.It isp_disable
A bit mask of units to skip configuration for.
.It isp_mem_map
A bit mask of units to use PCI Memory space instead of I/O space
access for.
.It isp_io_map
A bit mask of units to use PCI I/O space instead of Memory space
access for.
.It isp_no_nvram
A bit mask of units that you wish to ignore board NVRAM settings
for.
.It isp_nvram
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically use board NVRAM
settings for.
.It isp_fcduplex
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically to set into full
duplex mode.
.It isp_no_fcduplex
A bit mask of units that you wish to specifically to not set into
full duplex mode.
.It isp_wwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Node Name you would like
to use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It isp_debug
This is a driver debug level- meaningful from 0 through 7.
.It isp_tdebug
This is a driver target mode debug level- meaningful from 0 through
5.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently doesn't do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Target mode support isn't completely debugged yet. It works reasonably
well for Fibre Channel, somewhat well for Qlogic 1040 cards, but
doesn't yet work for the other cards (due to last minute unnanounced
changes in firmware interfaces).
.Pp
Sometimes, when booting, the driver gets stuck waiting for the
Fibre Channel f/w to tell it that the loop port database is ready,
or waiting for a good loop to be seen (this does not yet support
booting without being connected to a fibre channel device).  To
unwedge the system, unplug and replug the fibre channel connection,
or otherwise cause a LIP (Loop Initialization Primitive sequence)-
this will kick the f/w into getting unstuck.
