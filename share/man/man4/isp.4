.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device isp"
.Cd "device ispfw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isp_load="YES"
ispfw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to
.Tn FibreChannel
SCSI devices.
.Pp
It supports initiator and target modes of FCP SCSI profile,
utilizing Class 3 and Class 2 connections.
Support is available for Public and Private loops, Point-to-Point
and Fabric connections.
.Pp
Supported FC-Tape functionality is highly recommended for connections
to tape drives that support it.
It encompasses four elements from the T-10 FCP-4 specification:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Precise Delivery of Commands
.It
Confirmed Completion of FCP I/O Operations
.It
Retransmission of Unsuccessfully Transmitted IUs
.It
Task Retry Identification
.El
.Pp
Together these features allow for link level error recovery with tape
devices.
Without it, an initiator cannot, for instance, tell whether a tape write
command that has timed out resulted in all, part or none of the data going to
the tape drive.
FC-Tape is automatically enabled when connecting controller that supports
it to a target that supports it.
It may be disabled using configuration and hint options described below.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following optical Fibre Chanel adapters:
.Bl -column "Qlogic 2690/2692/2694 (2684/2692)" "Speed" "PCI-X"
.It Model: Ta Speed: Ta Bus:
.It Qlogic QLE2874 (2814) Ta 64Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic QLE2870/QLE2872 (2812) Ta 64Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic QLE2774 (2814) Ta 32Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic QLE2770/QLE2772 (2812) Ta 32Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 2740/2742/2764 (2722/2714) Ta 32Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 2690/2692/2694 (2684/2692) Ta 16Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 267x/836x (2031/8031) FCoE Ta 16Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 256x (2532) Ta 8Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 246x (2432) Ta 4Gb Ta PCIe
.It Qlogic 2422 Ta 4Gb Ta PCI-X
.El
.Sh FIRMWARE
Firmware loading is supported and handled by
.Xr firmware 9 .
The correct firmware is either loaded automatically, if available for this
type of adapter, or by manually loading the
.Xr ispfw 4
module.
It is strongly recommended that you use the firmware available from
.Xr ispfw 4
as it is the one that most likely has been tested with this driver.
.Sh CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Target mode support for Fibre Channel adapters may be enabled with the
.Pp
.Cd options ISP_TARGET_MODE
.Pp
option.
.Pp
To disable FC-Tape, use the following configuration option:
.Pp
.Cd options ISP_FCTAPE_OFF
.Pp
Note that even if the ISP_FCTAPE_OFF option is used, it may be overridden
by the fctape hint described below.
.Sh BOOT OPTIONS
The following options are switchable by setting values in
.Pa /boot/device.hints .
.Pp
They are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .msi
Limit on number of Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) to be used.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .msix
Limit on number of Extended Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI-X) to be used.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fwload_disable
A hint value to disable loading of firmware provided by
.Xr ispfw 4 .
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fwload_force
A hint value to prefer firmware provided by
.Xr ispfw 4 ,
even if it is older than the firmware in flash on the board.
If fwload_disable is also specified, fwload_force will be ignored.
.Pp
By default, with 27XX and newer controllers, the
.Xr isp 4
driver will use the newer
firmware.
For older controllers, the
.Xr isp 4
driver will use the firmware provided by
.Xr ispfw 4
if it is available, and otherwise use the firmware in flash on the board.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .ignore_nvram
A hint value to ignore board NVRAM settings for.
Otherwise use NVRAM settings.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fullduplex
A hint value to set full duplex mode.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .topology
A hint value to select topology of connection.
Supported values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Li lport-only" -compact
.It Li lport
Prefer arbitrated loop and fallback to point to point.
.It Li nport
Prefer point to point and fallback to arbitrated loop.
.It Li lport-only
Arbitrated loop only.
.It Li nport-only
Point to point only.
.El
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .portwwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Port Name you would like
to use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .nodewwn
This should be the full 64 bit World Wide Node Name you would like
to use, overriding the value in NVRAM for the card.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .iid
A hint to override or set the Initiator ID or Loop ID.
For Fibre Channel
cards in Local Loop topologies it is
.Ar strongly
recommended that you set this value to non-zero.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .role
A hint to define default role for isp instance (0 -- none, 1 -- target,
2 -- initiator, 3 -- both).
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .debug
A hint value for a driver debug level (see the file
.Pa /usr/src/sys/dev/isp/ispvar.h
for the values.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .vports
A hint to create specified number of additional virtual ports.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .nofctape
Set this to 1 to disable FC-Tape operation on the given isp instance.
.It Va hint.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fctape
Set this to 1 to enable FC-Tape operation on the given isp instance for
targets that support it.
.El
.Sh SYSCTL OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .loop_down_limit
This value says how long to wait in seconds after loop has gone down before
giving up and expiring all of the devices that were visible.
The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
A separate (nonadjustable) timeout is used when
booting to not stop booting on lack of FC connectivity.
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .gone_device_time
This value says how long to wait for devices to reappear if they (temporarily)
disappear due to loop or fabric events.
While this timeout is running, I/O
to those devices will simply be held.
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .use_gff_id
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .use_gft_id
Setting those options to 0 allows to disable use of GFF_ID and GFT_ID SNS
requests during FC fabric scan.
It may be useful if switch does not implement them correctly,
preventing some devices from being found.
Disabling them may cause unneeded logins to ports not supporting target role
or even FCP at all.
The default is 1 (enabled).
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .wwnn
This is the readonly World Wide Node Name value for this port.
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .wwpn
This is the readonly World Wide Port Name value for this port.
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fw_version_flash
The readonly flash firmware version value in the active region of the
controller.
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fw_version_ispfw
The readonly firmware version value provided by
.Xr ispfw 4 .
.It Va dev.isp. Ns Ar N Ns Va .fw_version_run
The readonly firmware version value currently executed on the controller.
