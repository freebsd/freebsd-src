.Sh NAME
.Nm iwmfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Intel Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwmfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include firmware images for all
.Xr iwm 4
devices inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwm3160fw"
.Cd "device iwm3168fw"
.Cd "device iwm7260fw"
.Cd "device iwm7265fw"
.Cd "device iwm7265Dfw"
.Cd "device iwm8000Cfw"
.Cd "device iwm8265fw"
.Cd "device iwm9000fw"
.Cd "device iwm9260fw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place one of the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
iwm3160fw_load="YES"
iwm3168fw_load="YES"
iwm7260fw_load="YES"
iwm7265fw_load="YES"
iwm7265Dfw_load="YES"
iwm8000Cfw_load="YES"
iwm8265fw_load="YES"
iwm9000fw_load="YES"
iwm9260fw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Intel Dual Band Wireless WiFi 3160, 3165, 3168, 7260, 7265, 8000, 8260, 8265,
9000 and 9260 series of IEEE 802.11n/11ac adapters.
