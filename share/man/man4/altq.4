.Sh NAME
.Nm ALTQ
.Nd "alternate queuing of network packets"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options ALTQ
.Pp
.Cd options ALTQ_CBQ
.Cd options ALTQ_RED
.Cd options ALTQ_RIO
.Cd options ALTQ_HFSC
.Cd options ALTQ_CDNR
.Cd options ALTQ_PRIQ
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides several disciplines for queuing outgoing network packets.
This is done by modifications to the interface packet queues.
See
.Xr altq 9
for details.
.Pp
The user interface for
.Nm
is implemented by the
.Xr pfctl 8
utility, so please refer to the
.Xr pfctl 8
and the
.Xr pf.conf 5
manpages for a complete description of the
.Nm
capabilities and how to use it.
.Ss Kernel Options
The following options in the kernel configuration file are related to
.Nm
operation:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv ALTQ_DEBUG" -compact
.It Dv ALTQ
enable
.Nm
.It Dv ALTQ_CBQ
build the
.Dq "Class Based Queuing"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_RED
build the
.Dq "Random Early Detection"
extension.
.It Dv ALTQ_RIO
build
.Dq "Random Early Drop"
for input and output.
.It Dv ALTQ_HFSC
build the
.Dq "Hierarchical Packet Scheduler"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_CDNR
build the traffic conditioner.
This option is meaningless at the moment as the conditioner is not used by
any of the available disciplines or consumers.
.It Dv ALTQ_PRIQ
build the
.Dq "Priority Queuing"
discipline.
.It Dv ALTQ_NOPCC
required for SMP builds.
.It Dv ALTQ_DEBUG
enable additional debugging facilities.
.El
.Pp
Note that
.Nm Ns -disciplines
cannot be loaded as kernel modules.
In order to use a certain discipline you have to build it into a custom
kernel.
The
.Xr pf 4
interface, that is required for the configuration process of
.Nm
can be loaded as a module.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
The driver modifications described in
.Xr altq 9
are required to use a certain network card with
.Nm .
They have been applied to the following hardware drivers:
.Xr an 4 ,
.Xr ath 4 ,
.Xr awi 4 ,
.Xr bfe 4 ,
.Xr dc 4 ,
.Xr de 4 ,
.Xr ed 4 ,
.Xr em 4 ,
.Xr fxp 4 ,
.Xr hme 4 ,
.Xr lnc 4 ,
.Xr re 4 ,
.Xr rl 4 ,
.Xr sf 4 ,
.Xr sis 4 ,
.Xr sk 4 ,
.Xr vr 4 ,
.Xr wi 4 ,
and
.Xr xl 4 .
.Pp
The
.Xr ndis 4
framework also has support for
.Nm
and thus all encapsulated drivers.
.Pp
The
.Xr tun 4
pseudo driver also does support
.Nm
and includes the required modifications.
