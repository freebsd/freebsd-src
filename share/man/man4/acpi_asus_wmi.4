.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_asus_wmi
.Nd Asus Laptop WMI Extras
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_asus_wmi"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_asus_wmi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the extra WMI-controlled gadgets, such as hotkeys
and leds, found on Asus laptops.
It allows one to use the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface to manipulate the brightness of the LCD panel and keyboard backlight,
power on/off different internal components, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, camera,
cardreader, etc, read some sensors.
Hotkey events are passed to
.Xr devd 8
for easy handling in userspace with the default configuration in
.Pa /etc/devd/asus.conf .
Some hotkey events, such as keyboard backlight and touchpad control, are
handled inside the driver.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following sysctls are currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.acpi_asus_wmi.0.handle_keys
Specifies whether driver should handle some hardware keys, such as keyboard
backlight, internally.
.El
.Pp
Number of other variables under the same sysctl branch are model-specific.
.Pp
Defaults for these variables can be set in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 ,
which is parsed at boot-time.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/backlight/acpi_asus_wmi0" -compact
.It Pa /dev/backlight/acpi_asus_wmi0
