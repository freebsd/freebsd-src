.Dt FIREWIRE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm firewire
.Nd IEEE1394 High-performance Serial Bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device firewire"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewire_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DEPRECATION NOTICE
The
.Nm
driver is slated to be removed prior to
.Fx 16.0 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
provides machine-independent bus support and raw drivers for
.Nm
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver consists of two layers: the controller and the
bus layer.
The controller attaches to a physical bus
(like
.Xr pci 4 ) .
The
.Nm
bus attaches to the controller.
Additional drivers can be attached to the bus.
.Pp
Up to 63 devices, including the host itself, can be attached to
a
.Nm
bus.
The root node is dynamically assigned with a PHY device function.
Also, the other
.Nm
bus specific parameters,
e.g., node ID, cycle master, isochronous resource manager and bus
manager, are dynamically assigned, after bus reset is initiated.
On the
.Nm
bus, every device is identified by an EUI 64 address.
.Pp
Debugging over the firewire interface is possible with the
.Xr dcons 4
driver.
Please see
.Lk https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/developers-handbook/kerneldebug/#kerneldebug-dcons
for details on how to setup debugging with firewire.
