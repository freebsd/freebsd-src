.Sh NAME
.Nm firewire
.Nd IEEE1394 High-performance Serial Bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device firewire"
.Pp
.In dev/firewire/firewire.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
provides machine-independent bus support and raw drivers for
.Nm
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver consists of two layers: the controller and the
bus layer.
The controller attaches to a physical bus
(like
.Xr pci 4 ) .
The
.Nm
bus attaches to the controller.
And the additional driver can be attached to the bus.
.Pp
Up to 63 devices, including the host itself, can be attached to
a
.Nm
bus.
The root node is dynamically assigned with PHY device function.
Also, the other
.Nm
bus specific parameters,
e.g., node ID, cycle master, isochronous resource manager and bus
manager, are dynamically assigned, after bus rest is initiated.
On
.Nm
bus, every device is identified with EUI 64 address.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fwohci 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr sbp 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Katsushi Kobayashi
and
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa
for the
.Nx
project.
