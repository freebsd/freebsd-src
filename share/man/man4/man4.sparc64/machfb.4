.Sh NAME
.Nm machfb
.Nd "accelerated color frame buffer"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device machfb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn ATI Mach64
family of chips are color frame buffers with graphics acceleration.
The
.Nm
driver interfaces those frame buffers with the
.Xr syscons 4
console driver.
.Pp
.Tn ATI Mach64
chips are very common as low-end graphics chips in
.Tn PCI
based
.Tn UltraSparc
systems.
They are found on-board in
.Tn Sun Blade 100 ,
.Tn Sun Blade 150 ,
.Tn Sun Ultra 5
and
.Tn Sun Ultra 10
as well as on
.Tn Sun
OEM mainboards like the
.Tn Sun AXe .
They are also used on add-on cards like the
.Tn Sun PGX8
and
.Tn Sun PGX64 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following chips:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
