.Sh NAME
.Nm smbfs
.Nd server message block (SMB1/CIFS) file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "option NETSMB"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
smbfs_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The SMB driver is an implementation of the CIFS (Common Internet Filesystem)
network protocol.
.Pp
.Bf -symbolic
The
.Nm
filesystem driver supports only the obsolete SMBv1 protocol.
.Nm
has known bugs and likely has security vulnerabilities.
.Nm
and userspace counterparts
.Xr smbutil 1
and
.Xr mount_smbfs 8
may be removed from a future version of
.Fx .
Users are advised to evaluate the
.Pa filesystems/smbnetfs
port instead.
