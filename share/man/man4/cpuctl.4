.Dt CPUCTL 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cpuctl
.Nd cpuctl pseudo device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device cpuctl"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module
at boot time, place the following in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cpuctl_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The special device
.Pa /dev/cpuctl
presents interface to the system CPU.
It provides functionality to retrieve
CPUID information, read/write machine specific registers (MSR) and perform
CPU firmware updates.
.Pp
For each CPU present in the system, the special device
.Pa /dev/cpuctl%d
with the appropriate index will be created.
For multicore CPUs such a
special device will be created for each core.
.Pp
Currently, only i386 and amd64 processors are
supported.
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
All of the supported operations are invoked using the
.Xr ioctl 2
system call.
Currently, the following ioctls are defined:
.Bl -tag -width CPUCTL_UPDATE
.It Dv CPUCTL_RDMSR Fa cpuctl_msr_args_t *args
.It Dv CPUCTL_WRMSR Fa cpuctl_msr_args_t *args
Read/write CPU machine specific register.
The
.Vt cpuctl_msr_args_t
structure is defined in
.In sys/cpuctl.h
as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		msr;	/* MSR to read */
	uint64_t	data;
} cpuctl_msr_args_t;
.Ed
.It Dv CPUCTL_MSRSBIT Fa cpuctl_msr_args_t *args
.It Dv CPUCTL_MSRCBIT Fa cpuctl_msr_args_t *args
Set/clear MSR bits according to the mask given in the
.Va data
field.
.It Dv CPUCTL_CPUID Fa cpuctl_cpuid_args_t *args
Retrieve CPUID information.
Arguments are supplied in
the following struct:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		level;	/* CPUID level */
	uint32_t	data[4];
} cpuctl_cpuid_args_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va level
field indicates the CPUID level to retrieve information for, while the
.Va data
field is used to store the received CPUID data.
.It Dv CPUCTL_UPDATE cpuctl_update_args_t *args
Update CPU firmware (microcode).
The structure is defined in
.In sys/cpuctl.h
as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	void	*data;
	size_t	size;
} cpuctl_update_args_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va data
field should point to the firmware image of size
.Va size .
.El
.Pp
For additional information refer to
.Pa cpuctl.h .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENXIO
The operation requested is not supported by the device (e.g. unsupported
architecture or the CPU is disabled)
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Incorrect request was supplied, or microcode image is not correct.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
No physical memory was available to complete the request.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The firmware image address points outside the process address space.
.El
.Sh FILES

.Nm
module and this manual page were written by
.An Stanislav Sedov Aq stas@FreeBSD.org .
