.Sh NAME
.Nm zyd
.Nd ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device zyd"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_amrr"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_zyd_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the ZyDAS ZD1211 and ZD1211B USB chips.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
supports software WEP.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.

.Bl -diag
.It "zyd%d: could not load firmware (error=%d)"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard
microcontroller unit.
.It "zyd%d: could not send command (error=%s)"
An attempt to send a command to the firmware failed.
.It "zyd%d: sorry, radio %s is not supported yet"
Support for the specified radio chip is not yet implemented in the driver.
The device will not attach.
.It "zyd%d: device version mismatch: 0x%x (only >= 43.30 supported)"
Early revisions of the ZD1211 chipset are not supported by this driver.
The device will not attach.
.It "zyd%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
