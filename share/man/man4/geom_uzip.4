.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm geom_uzip
.Nd "GEOM based compressed disk images and partitions"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device xz"
.Cd "options zstd"
.Cd "options GEOM_UZIP"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
geom_uzip_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides support for compressed read-only
disk images.
This allows significant storage savings at the expense of
some CPU time on each read.
Data written in the GEOM label area allows
.Nm
to detect compressed images which have been created with
.Xr mkuzip 8
and presented to the kernel as a logical disk device via
.Xr md 4 .
.Nm
creates a unique
.Pa md#.uzip
device for each image.
.Pp
.Nm
is not limited to supporting only
.Xr md 4
images.
The image can also reside on a block device.
.Pq For example, a disk, USB flash drive, DVD-ROM, etc .
The appropriate device node will appear with the
.Pa .uzip
suffix.

The
.Nm
device is subsequently used by
.Fx
kernel to access the uncompressed data.
The
.Nm
driver does not allow write operations to the underlying disk image.
To check which
.Dq providers
match a given
.Nm
device:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Nm
allows mounting the root file system from a compressed disk partition by
setting the
.Dv vfs.root.mountfrom
tunable.
See
.Xr loader.conf 5
for details.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Several flags are provided for tracing
.Nm
I/O operations and TOC parsing via the following sysctls.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va kern.geom.uzip.debug
Log level.
Zero disables logging.
Higher values enable more verbose debug logging for
.Nm .
Supported levels are from 0 (no logging) to 4 (maximum amount of logging).
.It Va kern.geom.uzip.debug_block
Log operations involving compressed cluster number.
