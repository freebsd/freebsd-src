.Dt PUC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm puc
.Nd PCI
.Dq Universal
Communications driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device puc"
.Cd "device sio"
.Cd "device ppc"
.Cd "options PUC_FASTINTR"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver acts as a shim to connect PCI serial and parallel ports to the
.Xr sio 4
and
.Xr ppc 4
driver.
.Pp
The list of supported devices is in
.Pa sys/dev/puc/pucdata.c .
Support for new cards should be added there.
.Pp
If the
.Dv PUC_FASTINTR
option is used, the driver will try to use fast interrupts.
This should lower the interrupt latency and should be used if the
.Xr sio 4
driver reports
.Sy "silo overflow"
errors.
It cannot be used if the interrupt is shared.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ppc 4 ,
.Xr sio 4
.Sh HISTORY
This driver took the idea from the
.Nx
.Xr puc 4
driver and still uses the same structure to describe cards, to ease exchanging
card info.
.Sh BUGS
Only serial ports are supported through the
.Xr sio 4
driver at the moment.
