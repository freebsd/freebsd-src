.Sh NAME
.Nm sf
.Nd "Adaptec AIC-6915"
.Qq Starfire
PCI Fast Ethernet adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device sf"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_sf_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Adaptec Duralink Fast Ethernet adapters
based on the Adaptec AIC-6915 "Starfire" chipset.
.Pp
The AIC-6915 is a bus master controller with an MII interface.
It
supports high and low priority transmit and receive queues, TCP/IP
checksum offload, multiple DMA descriptor formats and both polling
and producer/consumer DMA models.
The AIC-6915 receive filtering
options include a 16 entry perfect filter, a 512-bit hash table
for multicast addresses, a 512-bit hash table for priority address
matching and VLAN filtering.
An external MII-compliant transceiver
is required for media interfacing.
.Pp
Multiport adapters consist of several AIC-6915 controllers connected
via a PCI to PCI bridge.
Each controller is treated as a separate
interface by the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sf%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
This may
happen if the PCI BIOS not configured the device, which may be because
the BIOS has been configured for a "Plug and Play" operating system.
The "Plug and Play OS" setting in the BIOS should be set to "no" or
"off" in order for PCI devices to work properly with
.Fx .
.It "sf%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
This may
happen if the PCI BIOS not configured the device, which may be because
the BIOS has been configured for a "Plug and Play" operating system.
The "Plug and Play OS" setting in the BIOS should be set to "no" or
"off" in order for PCI devices to work properly with
.Fx .
.It "sf%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sf%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "sf%d: failed to enable I/O ports/memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI I/O port or shared memory access.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sf%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
