.Nd device driver for Midway-based ATM interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device en"
.Cd "device atm"
.Cd "device utopia"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Midway-based ATM interfaces including the
Efficient Networks, Inc. ENI-155 and Adaptec ANA-59x0.
Midway is an AAL5 SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly) chip.
.Pp
For configuring the card for IP see
.Xr natmip 4 .

The following sysctls are recognized by the driver additionally to those
handled by
.Xr utopia 4 :
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Cm hw.atm.enX.istats
Contains an array of
.Vt uint32_t
with internal driver statistics.
.It Cm hw.atm.enX.debug
This is a bit map of debugging options.
This variable is only available when the driver is compiled with debugging
support.
.El
.Pp
The driver supports the media options
.Ar sdh ,
.Ar noscramb

.Ar unassigned
(see
.Xr utopia 4 ).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bd -literal
en0 <Efficient Networks ENI-155p> rev 0 int a irq 5 on pci0:16
en0: ATM midway v0, board IDs 6.0, Utopia (pipelined), 512KB on-board RAM
en0: maximum DMA burst length = 64 bytes
en0: 7 32KB receive buffers, 8 32KB transmit buffers allocated
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
The driver extensively uses DMA on PCI.
The first
