.Sh NAME
.Nm axge
.Nd "ASIX Electronics AX88178A/179/179A USB Gigabit Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device xhci"
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device axge"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_axge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88179/AX88179A USB 3.0 and AX88178A USB 2.0 chipsets.
.Pp
The AX88179, AX88179A and AX88178A contain a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with a
GMII interface for interfacing with the Gigabit Ethernet PHY.
.Pp
These devices will operate with both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, and the
AX88179/AX88179A will operate with USB 3.0 controllers.
Packets are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178 only).
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
