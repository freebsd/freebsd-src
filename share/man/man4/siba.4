.Sh NAME
.Nm siba
.Nd Sonic Inc. Silicon Backplane driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following lines to the
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device bhnd"
.Cd "device siba"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
siba_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides
.Xr bhnd 4
support for devices based on the Sonic Inc. Silicon Backplane, an
interblock communications architecture found in earlier Broadcom Home
Networking Division wireless chipsets and embedded systems.
.Pp
A common interconnect connects all of the Silicon Backplane's functional
blocks.
These functional blocks, known as cores, use the Open Core Protocol
(OCP) interface to communicate with agents attached to the Silicon
Backplane.
.Pp
Each core can have an initiator agent that passes read and write
requests onto the system backplane and a target agent that returns
responses to those requests.
Not all cores contain both an initiator and a target agent.
Initiator agents are present in cores that contain
host interfaces (PCI, PCMCIA), embedded processors (MIPS),
or DMA processors associated with communications cores.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
The driver was rewritten for
.Fx 11.0
to support the common Broadcom
.Xr bhnd 4
bus interface.
