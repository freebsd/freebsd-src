.Sh NAME
.Nm proto
.Nd Driver for prototyping and H/W diagnostics
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device proto"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
proto_load="YES"
.Ed
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver attaches to PCI devices when no other device drivers are
present and creates device special files for all resources associated
with the device.
The driver itself has no knowledge of the device it attaches to.
Programs can open these device special files and perform register-level
reads and writes.
As such, the
.Nm
device driver is nothing but a conduit or gateway between user space
programs and the hardware device.
.Pp
Examples for why this is useful include hardware diagnostics and prototyping.
In both these use cases, it is far more convenient to develop and run the
logic in user space.
Especially hardware diagnostics requires a somewhat user-friendly interface
and adequate reporting.
Neither is done easily as kernel code.
.\"
.Sh FILES
All device special files corresponding to a PCI device are located under
.Pa /dev/proto/pci<d>:<b>:<s>:<f>
with
.Pa pci<d>:<b>:<s>:<f>
representing the location of the PCI device in the PCI hierarchy.
A location includes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It <d>
The PCI domain number
.It <b>
The PCI bus number
.It <s>
The PCI slot or device number
.It <f>
The PCI function number
.El
.Pp
Every PCI device has a device special file called
.Pa pcicfg .
This device special file gives access to the PCI configuration space.
For each valid base address register (BAR), a device special file is created
that contains the BAR offset and the resource type.
A resource type can be either
.Pa io
or
.Pa mem
representing I/O port or memory mapped I/O space (resp.)
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
A single function PCI device in domain 0, on bus 1, in slot 2 and having a
single memory mapped I/O region will have the following device special files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Pa /dev/proto/pci0:1:2:0/10.mem
.It Pa /dev/proto/pci0:1:2:0/pcicfg
.El
.\"
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver and this manual page were written by
.An Marcel Moolenaar Aq marcel@xcllnt.net .
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Because programs have direct access to the hardware, the
.Nm
driver is inherently insecure.
It is not advisable to use this driver on a production machine.
.\"
.Sh MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
The
.Nm
driver does not yet support interrupts.
Since interrupts cannot be handled by the driver itself, they must be converted
into signals and delivered to the program that has registered for interrupts.
.Pp
In order to test the transmission or reception of data, some means of doing
direct memory access (DMA) by the device must be possible.
This too must be under the control of the program.
The details of how a program can set up and
initiate DMA still need to be fleshed out.
.Pp
Support for non-PCI devices has not been implemented yet.
