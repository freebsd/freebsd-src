.Sh NAME
.Nm fwe
.Nd "Ethernet emulation driver for FireWire"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device firewire"
.Cd "device fwe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_fwe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides non-standard Ethernet emulation over FireWire (IEEE 1394).
.Pp
.Xr firewire 4
and
.Xr fwohci 4
must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Pp
This driver exploits asynchronous stream over IEEE 1394 to carry Ethernet
frames.
The stream channel can be specified by
the
.Va hw.firewire.fwe.stream_ch
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
This driver supports
.Xr polling 4
as well if it is compiled with the
.Dv DEVICE_POLLING
option.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver and this manual page were written by
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
.Sh BUGS
This driver emulates Ethernet in a very adhoc way and it does not reserve a
stream channel using an isochronous manager.
Note that this driver uses a protocol which is very different from RFC 2734
(IPv4 over IEEE 1394).
