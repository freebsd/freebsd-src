.Sh NAME
.Nm umb
.Nd USB Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device umb"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umb_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
If neither of the above is done, the driver will automatically be loaded
by devd(8) when the device is connected.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB MBIM devices.
.Pp
MBIM devices establish connections via cellular networks such as
GPRS, UMTS, and LTE.
They appear as a regular point-to-point network interface,
transporting raw IP frames.
.Pp
Required configuration parameters like PIN and APN have to be set
with
.Xr umbctl 8 .
Once the SIM card has been unlocked with the correct PIN, it
will remain in this state until the MBIM device is power-cycled.
In case the device is connected to an "always-on" USB port,
it may be possible to connect to a provider without entering the
PIN again even if the system was rebooted.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver should support any USB device implementing MBIM, including
the following cellular modems:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Ericsson H5321gw and N5321gw
.It
Fibocom L831-EAU
.It
Medion Mobile S4222 (MediaTek OEM)
.It
Sierra Wireless EM7345
.It
Sierra Wireless EM7455
.It
Sierra Wireless EM8805
.It
Sierra Wireless MC8305

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.0 ,
.Nx 9.0 ,
and
.Fx 15.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Gerhard Roth Aq Mt gerhard@openbsd.org
and ported from
.Ox
by
.An Pierre Pronchery Aq Mt khorben@defora.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support IPv6.
.Pp
Devices which fail to provide a conforming MBIM implementation will
probably be attached as some other driver, such as
.Xr u3g 4 .
