.Nm tws
.Nd 3ware 9750 SATA+SAS 6Gb/s RAID controller card driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device tws"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tws_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for LSI's 3ware 9750 SATA+SAS 6Gb/s RAID controller cards.
.Pp
These controllers feature the LSISAS2108 6Gb/s SAS RAID-on-Chip (ROC)
and are available in 4- and 8-port configurations, supports RAID levels
0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 50 and single disk, with 96 SATA and/or SAS hard drives and SSDs.

.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width "hw.tws.use_32bit_sgls"
.It Va hw.tws.cam_depth
The maximum queued CAM SIM requests for one controller.
The default value is 256.
.It Va hw.tws.enable_msi
This tunable enables MSI support on the controller if set to a non-zero value.
The default value is 0.
.It Va hw.tws.queue_depth
The maximum queued requests for one controller.
.It Va hw.tws.use_32bit_sgls
Limit the driver to use only 32-bit SG elements regardless whether the operating
system is running in 64-bit mode.
The default value is 0.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Whenever the driver encounters a command failure, it prints out an error code in
the format:
.Qq Li "ERROR: (<error source>: <error code>):" ,
followed by a text description of the error.
There are other error messages and warnings that the
driver prints out, depending on the kinds of errors that it encounters.
If the driver is compiled with
.Dv TWS_DEBUG
defined, it prints out a whole bunch of debug
messages.
