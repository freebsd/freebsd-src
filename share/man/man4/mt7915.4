.Sh NAME
.Nm mt7915
.Nd MediaTek IEEE 802.11ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The driver will auto-load without any user interaction using
.Xr devmatch 8
if enabled in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
Only if auto-loading is explicitly disabled, place the following
lines in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to manually load the driver as a module at boot time:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kld_list="${kld_list} if_mt7915"
.Ed
.Pp
The driver should automatically load any
firmware needed for the particular chipset.
.Pp
It is discouraged to load the driver from
.Xr loader 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for MediaTek MT7915E wireless network devices.
.Nm
is derived from MediaTek's Linux mt76 driver.
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
The package
.Pa wifi-firmware-mt76-kmod
from the
.Pa ports/net/wifi-firmware-mt76-kmod
port needs to be installed before the driver is loaded.
Otherwise no
.Xr wlan 4
interface can be created using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
One can use
.Xr fwget 8
to install the correct firmware package.
.Pp
The driver uses the
.\" No LinuxKPI man pages so no .Xr here.
.Sy linuxkpi_wlan
and
.Sy linuxkpi
compat framework to bridge between the Linux and
native
.Fx
driver code as well as to the native
.Xr net80211 4
wireless stack.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports PCIe devices with the following chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
MediaTek MT7915E
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wlan 4 ,
.Xr networking 7 ,
.Xr fwget 8 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 14.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Certainly.
.Pp
While
.Nm
supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax modes,
the compatibility code currently only supports 802.11a/b/g modes.
Support for 802.11n/ac/ax is yet to come.
