.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_hda
.Nd "Intel High Definition Audio bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_hda"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_hda_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge device driver allows the generic audio driver,
.Xr sound 4 ,
to attach to Intel High Definition Audio devices.
The
.Nm
driver supports hardware that conforms with revision 1.0 of the Intel High
Definition Audio specification and tries to behave much like the Microsoft
Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) draft (revision 0.7b) for handling audio
devices.
HDA acts like a primary bus, similar to
.Xr miibus 4 ,
for handling various child buses such as audio, modem and HDMI (High Definition
Multimedia Interface).
Only audio is implemented in the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
The High Definition (HD) Audio specification was developed by Intel as the
logical successor of the old AC'97 specification and has several advantages,
such as higher bandwidth which allows more channels and more detailed formats,
support for several logical audio devices, and general purpose DMA channels.
.Pp
The HDA specification defines the register-level interface, physical link
characteristics, codec programming models, and codec architectural components.
This specification is intended for both device driver developers and hardware
component designers.
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available in addition to those available to all
.Xr sound 4
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va dev.pcm.%d.polling" -offset indent
.It Va dev.pcm.%d.polling
Experimental polling mode, where the driver operates by querying the device
state on each tick using
.Xr callout 9 .
Polling is disabled by default.
Do not enable it unless you are facing weird interrupt problems or if the
device cannot generate interrupts at all.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Stephane E. Potvin Aq sepotvin@videotron.ca
and
.An Ariff Abdullah Aq ariff@FreeBSD.org .
This manual page was written by
.An Joel Dahl Aq joel@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
There are a couple of missing features, such as support for Digital
S/PDIF and multichannel output.
.Pp
A few Hardware/OEM vendors tend to screw up BIOS settings, thus
rendering the
.Nm
driver useless, which usually results in a state where the
.Nm
driver seems to attach and work, but without any sound.
