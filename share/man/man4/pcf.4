.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em pcf
driver provides support to the Philips PCF8584 I2C controller for the
.Xr iicbus 4
system.
.Pp
The PCF8584 is an integrated circuit designed in CMOS technology which serves
as an interface between most standard parallel-bus
microcontrollers/microprocessors and the serial I2C-bus.
The PCF8584
provides both master and slave functions.
Communication with I2C-bus is
carried out on a byte-wise basis using interrupt or polled handshake.
It
controls all the I2C-bus specific sequences, protocol, arbitration and timing.
The PCF8584 allows parallel-bus systems to communicate bidirectionally with
the I2C-bus.
