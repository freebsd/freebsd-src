.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_hp
.Nd "ACPI extras driver for HP laptops"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_hp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_hp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for ACPI-controlled features found on HP laptops
that use a WMI enabled BIOS (e.g., HP Compaq 8510p and 6510p).
.Pp
The main purpose of this driver is to provide an interface,
accessible via
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr devd 8 and
.Xr devfs 8 ,
through which applications can determine and change the status of
various laptop components and BIOS settings.
.Ss Xr devd 8 Events
Devd events received by
.Xr devd 8
provide the following information:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "subsystem" -offset indent -compact

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Michael Gmelin Aq Mt freebsd@grem.de .
.Pp
It has been inspired by hp-wmi driver, which implements a subset of these
features (hotkeys) on Linux.

.Sh BUGS
This driver is experimental and has only been tested on i386 on an
HP Compaq 8510p which featured all supported wireless devices (WWAN/BT/WLAN).
Expect undefined results when operating on different hardware.
.Pp
Loading the driver is slow.
Reading from
.Pa /dev/hpcmi
is even slower.
.Pp
Additional features like HP specific sensor readings or writing BIOS
settings are not supported.
