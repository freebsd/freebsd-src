.Sh NAME
.Nm stf
.Nd
.Tn 6to4 tunnel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device stf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface supports
.Dq 6to4
IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation.
It can tunnel IPv6 traffic over IPv4, as specified in
.Li draft-ietf-ngtrans-6to4-03.txt .
.Pp
Due to the way 6to4 protocol is specified,
.Nm
interface requires certain configuration to work properly.
Single
.Pq no more than 1
valid 6to4 address needs to be configured to the interface.
.Dq A valid 6to4 address
is an address which has the following properties.
If any of the following properties are not satisfied,
.Nm stf
raises runtime error on packet transmission.
Read the specification for more details.
.Bl -bullet
.It
matches
.Li 2002:xxyy:zzuu::/48
where
.Li xxyy:zzuu
is a hexadecimal notation of an IPv4 address for the node.
.It
The interface identifier portion
.Pq lower 64 bits
is properly filled to avoid address collisions.
.El
.Pp
If you would like the node to behave as a relay router,
the prefix length for the IPv6 interface address needs to be 16 so that
the node would consider any 6to4 destination as
.Dq on-link .
If you would like to restrict 6to4 peers to be inside certain IPv4 prefix,
you may want to configure IPv6 prefix length as
.Dq 16 + IPv4 prefix length .
.\"(Not yet implemented on 4.0)
.\".Nm
.\"interface will check the IPv4 source address on packets,
.\"if the IPv6 prefix length is larger than 16.
.Pp
.Nm
can be configured to be ECN friendly.
This can be configured by
.Dv IFF_LINK1 .
See
.Xr gif 4
for details.
.Pp
Please note that 6to4 specification is written as
.Dq accept tunnelled packet from everyone
tunnelling device.
By enabling
.Nm
device, you are making it much easier for malicious parties to inject
fabricated IPv6 packet to your node.
Also, malicious party can inject an IPv6 packet with fabricated source address
to make your node generate improper tunnelled packet.
Administrators must take caution when enabling the interface.
It is recommended to filter/audit
incoming IPv4 packet with IP protocol number 41, as necessary.
.\"To prevent possible DoS attacks,
.\"(No check yet on 4.0, but such packets won't go through IPv4 cloud.)
.\".Nm
.\"interface filters out packets with the following property:
.\".Bl -bullet
.\".It
.\"Packets with 6to4 address based on 0.0.0.0, as inner destination/source
.\".It
.\"Packets with 6to4 address based on 255.255.255.255,
.\" as inner destination/source
.\".El
.\".Pp
You may also want to reject encapsulated IPv6 packets with
suspicious 6to4 addresses, like
.Li 2002:7f00::/24.
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
Note that
.Li 8504:0506
is equal to
.Li 133.4.5.6 ,
written in hexadecimals.
.Bd -literal
# ifconfig ne0 inet 133.4.5.6 netmask 0xffffff00
# ifconfig stf0 inet6 2002:8504:0506:0000:a00:5aff:fe38:6f86 \\
	prefixlen 16 alias
.Ed
.Pp
The following configuration sends packets to IPv4 destination 10.1.0.0/16
only
.Pq IPv6 prefix length = 32 .
.Bd -literal
# ifconfig ne0 inet 10.1.2.3 netmask 0xffff0000
# ifconfig stf0 inet6 2002:0a01:0203:0000:a00:5aff:fe38:6f86 \\
