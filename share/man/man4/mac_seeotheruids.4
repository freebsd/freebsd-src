.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_seeotheruids
.Nd "simple policy controlling whether users see other users"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the
policy into your kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options MAC"
.Cd "options MAC_SEEOTHERUIDS"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternately, to load the module at boot time, place the following line
in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options MAC"
.Ed
.Pp
and in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mac_seeotheruids_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
policy module, when enabled, denies users to see processes or sockets owned
by other users.
.Pp
To enable
.Nm ,
set the sysctl OID
.Va security.mac.seeotheruids.enabled
to 1.
To permit superuser awareness of other credentials by virtue of privilege,
set the sysctl OID
.Va security.mac.seeotheruids.suser_privileged
to 1.
.Pp
To allow users to see processes and sockets owned by the same primary group,
set the sysctl OID
.Va security.mac.seeotheruids.primarygroup_enabled
to 1.
.Pp
To allow processes with a specific group ID to be exempt from the policy,
set the sysctl OID
.Va security.mac.seeotheruids.specificgid_enabled
to 1, and
.Va security.mac.seeotheruids.specificgid
to the group ID to be exempted.
.Ss Label Format

.Sh BUGS
While the MAC Framework design is intended to support the containment of
the root user, not all attack channels are currently protected by entry
point checks.
As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied on, in isolation,
to protect against a malicious privileged user.
