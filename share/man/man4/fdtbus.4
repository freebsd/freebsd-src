.Sh NAME
.Nm fdtbus
.Nd Flattened Device Tree bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options FDT"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
abstract bus driver is the primary connection and translation layer between
.Xr fdt 4
hardware resources description and
.Fx
native newbus device drivers framework.
For an embedded system
.Nm
represents peripherals typically found on a highly integrated chip
(system-on-chip).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides generic, common infrastructure for all
.Xr fdt 4
oriented device drivers, and its main responsibilities are the
following:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Creating newbus children that reflect
.Xr fdt 4
nodes in the flattened device tree.
.It
Managing SYS_RES_IRQ resources.
.It
Managing SYS_RES_MEMORY, SYS_RES_IOPORT resources.
