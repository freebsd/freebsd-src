.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hkbd
.Nd HID keyboard driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device hkbd"
.Cd "device hid"
.Cd "device hidbus"
.Cd "device evdev"
.Cd "options EVDEV_SUPPORT"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hkbd_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for keyboards that attach to the HID transport
backend.
.Xr hid 4 ,
.Xr hidbus 4 ,
and one of
.Xr iichid 4
or
.Xr usbhid 4
must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
By default, the keyboard subsystem does not create the appropriate devices yet.
Make sure you reconfigure your kernel with the following option in the kernel
config file:
.Pp
.Dl "options KBD_INSTALL_CDEV"
.Pp
If both an AT keyboard HID keyboards are used at the same time, the
AT keyboard will appear as
.Pa kbd0
in
.Pa /dev .
The HID keyboards will be
.Pa kbd1 , kbd2 ,
etc.
You can see some information about the keyboard with the following command:
.Pp
.Dl "kbdcontrol -i < /dev/kbd1"
.Pp
or load a keymap with
.Pp
.Dl "kbdcontrol -l keymaps/pt.iso < /dev/kbd1"
.Pp
See
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
for more possible options.
.Pp
You can swap console keyboards by using the command
.Pp
.Dl "kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbd1"
.Pp
From this point on, the first HID keyboard will be the keyboard
to be used by the console.
.Pp
If you want to use a HID keyboard as your default and not use an AT keyboard at
all, you will have to remove the
.Cd "device atkbd"
line from the kernel configuration file.
Because of the device initialization order,
the HID keyboard will be detected
.Em after
the console driver
initializes itself and you have to explicitly tell the console
driver to use the existence of the HID keyboard.
This can be done in
one of the following two ways.
.Pp
Run the following command as a part of system initialization:
.Pp
.Dl "kbdcontrol -k /dev/kbd0 < /dev/ttyv0 > /dev/null"
.Pp
(Note that as the HID keyboard is the only keyboard, it is accessed as
.Pa /dev/kbd0 )
or otherwise tell the console driver to periodically look for a
keyboard by setting a flag in the kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.Dl "device sc0 at isa? flags 0x100"
.Pp
With the above flag, the console driver will try to detect any
keyboard in the system if it did not detect one while it was
initialized at boot time.
.Sh DRIVER CONFIGURATION
.D1 Cd "options KBD_INSTALL_CDEV"
.Pp
Make the keyboards available through a character device in
.Pa /dev .
.Pp
.D1 Cd options HKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP
.D1 Cd makeoptions HKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=fr.iso
.Pp
The above lines will put the French ISO keymap in the ukbd driver.
You can specify any keymap in
.Pa /usr/share/syscons/keymaps
or
.Pa /usr/share/vt/keymaps
(depending on the console driver being used) with this option.
.Pp
.D1 Cd "options KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOADING"
.Pp
Do not allow the user to change the keymap.
Note that these options also affect the AT keyboard driver,
.Xr atkbd 4 .
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.hid.hkbd.debug
Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger values increase
debug message verbosity.
Default is 0.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/input/event*" -compact
.It Pa /dev/kbd*
blocking device nodes
.It Pa /dev/input/event*
input event device nodes.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.D1 Cd "device hkbd"
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
