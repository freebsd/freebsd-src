.Sh NAME
.Nm adw
.Nd Advansys PCI 16bit SCSI Host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd controller pci
.Cd controller adw
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd controller scbus0 at adw0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the 16bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC3550 Ultra ,
and
.Tn ASC38C0800 Ultra2 ,
SCSI Host Adapter chips.
AdvanSys products incorporating these chips include the
.Tn ABP[3]940UW ,
.Tn ABP950UW ,
.Tn ABP970UW ,
.Tn ABP3940U2W ,
and
.Tn ABP3950U2W .
Both chips support, synchronous transfers
(20MHz and 40MHz max respectively),
16bit transfers, tagged queueing,
and up to 253 concurrent SCSI transactions.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, wide transfers, disconnection,
tagged queueing, and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
