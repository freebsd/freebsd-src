.Sh NAME
.Nm sk
.Nd "SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x PCI gigabit ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device sk"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x series PCI
gigabit ethernet adapters, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
SK-9521 SK-NET GE-T single port, 1000baseT adapter
.It
SK-9821 SK-NET GE-T single port, 1000baseT adapter
.It
SK-9822 SK-NET GE-T dual port, 1000baseT adapter
.It
SK-9841 SK-NET GE-LX single port, single mode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9842 SK-NET GE-LX dual port, single mode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9843 SK-NET GE-SX single port, multimode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9844 SK-NET GE-SX dual port, multimode fiber adapter
.It
3COM 3C940 single port, 1000baseT adapter
.El
.Pp
The SysKonnect adapters consist of two main components: the XaQti Corp.
XMAC II gigabit MAC and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC.
The
XMAC provides the gigabit MAC and PHY suspport while the GEnesis
provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support, packet buffering
and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The SK-982x 1000baseT adapters also include a Broadcom BCM5400 1000baseTX
PHY which is used in place of the XMAC's internal PHY.
The Broadcom PHY is connected to the XMAC via its GMII port.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each XMAC
is treated as a separate logical network interface.
Both ports can
operate indepenently of each other and can be connected to separate
networks.
The SysKonnect driver software currently only uses the
second port on dual port adapters for failover purposes: if the link
on the primary port fails, the SysKonnect driver will automatically
switch traffic onto the second port.
.Pp
Also supported is the Marvell Semiconductor 88E1000* gigabit PHY.
.Pp
The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
autonegotiation.
The XMAC also supports unlimited frame sizes.
Support for jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
This is only available
for SK-982x series adapters with 1000baseT ports.
Both
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (gigabit ethernet) operation.
Both
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports one special link option for 1000baseTX cards:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It link0
With 1000baseTX cards, establishing a link between two ports requires
that one port be configured as a master and the other a slave.
With autonegotiation,
the master/slave settings will be chosen automatically.
However when manually selecting the link state, it is necessary to
force one side of the link to be a master and the other a slave.
The
.Nm
driver configures the ports as slaves by default.
Setting the
.Ar link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will set a port as a master instead.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sk%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "sk%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "sk%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
