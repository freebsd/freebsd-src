.Sh NAME
.Nm sk
.Nd "SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device sk"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_sk_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x series PCI
Gigabit Ethernet adapters.
.Pp
The SysKonnect adapters consist of two main components: the XaQti Corp.
XMAC II gigabit MAC and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC.
The
XMAC provides the gigabit MAC and PHY support while the GEnesis
provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support, packet buffering
and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The SK-982x 1000baseT adapters also include a Broadcom BCM5400 1000baseTX
PHY which is used in place of the XMAC's internal PHY.
The Broadcom PHY is connected to the XMAC via its GMII port.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each XMAC
is treated as a separate logical network interface.
Both ports can
operate independently of each other and can be connected to separate
networks.
The SysKonnect driver software currently only uses the
second port on dual port adapters for failover purposes: if the link
on the primary port fails, the SysKonnect driver will automatically
switch traffic onto the second port.
.Pp
Also supported is the Marvell Semiconductor 88E100* gigabit PHY.
.Pp
The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
autonegotiation.
The XMAC also supports unlimited frame sizes.
Support for jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
This is only available
for SK-982x series adapters with 1000baseT ports.
Both
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.

.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Va hw.skc.jumbo_disable
Disable jumbo frame support.
Systems with less memory can set it to a non-zero value to save memory.
The default value is 0.
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variable is available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variable and
.Xr loader 8
tunable:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Va dev.skc.%d.int_mod
This variable controls interrupt moderation.
The accepted range is 10 to 10000.
The default value is 100 microseconds.
The interface has to be brought down and up again before a change takes effect.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sk%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "sk%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "sk%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
