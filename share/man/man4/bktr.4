.Sh NAME
.Nm brooktree
.Nd video capture driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device bktr
.Pp
.Cd device iicbus
.Cd device iicbb
.Cd device smbus
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm bktr
driver provides support for PCI
.Em video
capture and
.Em VBI
capture on low cost, high performance boards.  The driver based on
the Matrox Meteor driver and uses the same API.  The bktr driver should support most video cards
based on the
.Em "Brooktree Bt848/849/878/879 Video Capture Chip" .
The driver also supports
.Em FM Radio
if the Tuner supports it.
.Pp
Specifically, the following cards are known to work:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Em Hauppauge Wincast TV and WinTV/PCI
.Em STB TV PCI Television Tuner
.Em Miro PC TV
.Em Intel Smart Video Recorder III
.Em AverMedia cards
.Em Video Highway XTreme
.Em VideoLogic Captivator PCI
.Ed
.Pp
The driver currently supports the following features:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
PCI to PCI dma transfer
clipping
yuv
rgb16
rgb24
rgb32
.Ed
.Pp
On these cards, tuners and other components are interconnected with an I2C bus.
The Brooktree848 chips act as a master device on the bus to control them.
Therefore,
.Xr iicbus 4 ,
.Xr iicbb 4
and
.Xr smbus 4
controller declarations are mandatory to activate bktr support.
.Pp
The following kernel parameters may be used to further configure the driver:
.Pp
.Em options "BROOKTREE_ALLOC_PAGES=xxx"
specifies the number of contiguous pages to allocate when successfully
probed.  The default number of pages allocated by the kernel is 216.
This means that there are (216*4096) bytes available for use.
.Bd -unfilled
.Em options BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
.Em options BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC
.Ed
One of these options can be used to set the default video format for the driver.
This fixed random hangs and lockups with the VideoLogic Captivator PCI card.
.Pp
The following sysctls may be used to further configure the driver:
.Pp
.Em sysctl hw.bt848.card=nnnn
This can be used to override the card make which was detected at boot time.
.Ql nnnn
is set to an integer from 1 to 13 taken from the following table:
