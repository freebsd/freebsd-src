.Sh NAME
.Nm iwx
.Nd Intel WiFi 6 IEEE 802.11ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device iwx
.Cd device wlan
.Pp
In
.Xr rc.conf 5 :
.Cd devmatch_blocklist="if_iwlwifi"
.Cd kld_list="if_iwx"
.Pp
In
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 :
.Cd dev.iwx.?.debug=0xffffffff
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel Wi-Fi 6 series of M.2
wireless network adapters.
If the appropriate hardware is detected, and
.Xr iwlwifi 4
is blacklisted in
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
the driver will be automatically loaded with
.Xr devmatch 8 .
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or at boot with
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "monitor mode"
.It station mode
This is used when associating with an access point,
through which all traffic passes.
Background scanning is supported in this mode, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Station mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following M.2 wireless network adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200
.It
Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 CNVi
.It
Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX210
.It
Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX211 CNVi
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables:
.Bl -tag -width "hw.usb.mtw.debug"
.It Va dev.iwx.?.debug
Specify debug level as a bitmask.
Default
.Ql 0 .
.El
.Sh FILES
The
.Nm
driver requires firmware from
.Pa ports/net/wifi-firmware-iwlwifi-kmod .
This firmware package will be installed automatically with
.Xr fwget 8
if the appropriate hardware is detected at installation or runtime.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwx0: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete
in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwx0: fatal firmware error"
For some reason, the firmware crashed.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwx0: radio is disabled by hardware switch"
The radio transmitter is off and thus no packet can go out.
The driver will reset the hardware.
Make sure the laptop radio switch is on.
.It "iwx0: could not read firmware ... (error N)"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from
the filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "iwx0: firmware too short: N bytes"
The firmware image is corrupted and can't be loaded into the adapter.
.It "iwx0: could not load firmware"
An attempt to load the firmware into the adapter failed.
The driver will reset the hardware.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 15.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support hardware encryption offload.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support 802.11ax.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
