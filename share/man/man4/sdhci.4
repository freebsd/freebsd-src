.Sh NAME
.Nm sdhci
.Nd PCI SD Host Controller bridge driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device mmc"
.Cd "device mmcsd"
.Cd "device sdhci"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mmc_load="YES"
mmcsd_load="YES"
sdhci_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports PCI devices with class 8 and subclass 5 according to
SD Host Controller Specification.
Driver supports up to six high speed 4bit MMC/SD slots per controller.
Driver attaches mmc bus to the respective slot on card insertion and
detaches it on card removing.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports different specification compatible chips.
The following chips have been verified to work:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
ENE CB712
.It
ENE CB714
.It
RICOH R5C822
.It
RICOH R5CE823

.Sh BUGS
Many of existing SD controller chips have some nonstandard requirements,
proprietary registers and hardware bugs, requiring additional handling.
ENE chips are handled to work fine, while some revisions of RICOH and TI
controllers still do not see cards without some additional initialization.
