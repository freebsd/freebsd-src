.Sh NAME
.Nm armv8crypto
.Nd "driver for the AES accelerator on ARM CPUs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device armv8crypto"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
armv8crypto_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Starting with the ARMv8 architecture ARM Limited has added optional
cryptography instructions to accelerate AES, SHA-1, SHA-2, and
finite field arithmetic.
.Pp
The processor capability is reported as AES in the Instruction Set
Attributes 0 line at boot.
The
.Nm
driver does not attach on systems that lack the required CPU capability.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate AES operations for
.Xr crypto 4 .
