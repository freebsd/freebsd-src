.Sh NAME
.Nm ig4
.Nd Synopsys DesignWare I2C Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ig4"
.Cd "device iicbus"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ig4_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to peripherals attached to an I2C controller.
.Sh HARDWARE
.Nm
supports the I2C controllers based on Synopsys DesignWare IP that can be found
in Intel(R) Core(TM) processors starting from the fourth generation, Intel(R)
Bay Trail, Apollo Lake SoC families, and some AMD systems.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
These
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available:
.Bl -tag -width "debug.ig4_dump"
.It Va debug.ig4_dump
This sysctl is a zero-based bit mask.
When any of the bits are set, a register dump is printed for
every I2C transfer on an
.Nm
device with the same unit number.
