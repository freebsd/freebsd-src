.Sh NAME
.Nm enic
.Nd "VIC Ethernet NIC driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iflib"
.Cd "device enic"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at run-time,
run the following command as root:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kldload if_enic
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_enic_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Cisco Virtual Interface Card.
Support is limited to basic network connectivity.
Media is controlled by the NIC itself since there can be multiple
virtual PCI NIC devices exposed to the PCI bus.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver should supports all known Cisco VIC cards.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
network interface is configured using
.Xr ifconfig 8
and the
.Xr sysctl 8
tree at
.Dv dev.enic.<N> .
All configurable entries are also tunables, and can be put directly into the
.Xr loader.conf 5
for persistent configuration.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 14.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Cisco UCS team
based of the DPDK driver.
