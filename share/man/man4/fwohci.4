.Sh NAME
.Nm fwohci
.Nd OHCI FireWire chipset device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device firewire"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewire_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
To disable physical access (see
.Sx BUGS
section for detail), put the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.firewire.phydma_enable=0
.Ed
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI/CardBus FireWire interface cards.
The driver supports the following IEEE 1394 OHCI chipsets:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
device driver was written by
.An Katsushi Kobayashi
and
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
.Sh BUGS
The driver allows physical access from any nodes on the bus by default.
This means that any devices on the bus can read and modify any memory space
which can be accessed by an IEEE 1394 OHCI chip.
It is allowed mostly for
.Xr sbp 4
devices.
This should be changed to allow it only for specific devices.
Anyway, FireWire is a bus and not expected to be connected with
un-trustable devices because a node can monitor all the traffic.
