.Sh BUGS
The driver allows physical access from any nodes on the bus by default.
This means that any devices on the bus can read and modify any memory space
which can be accessed by IEEE 1394 OHCI chip.  It is allowed mostly
for sbp(4) devices. This should be changed to allow it only for specific
devices.  Anyway FireWire is a bus and not expected to be connected with
un-trustable devices because a node can monitor all the traffic.
