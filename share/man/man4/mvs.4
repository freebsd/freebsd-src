.Sh NAME
.Nm mvs
.Nd Marvell Serial ATA Host Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device mvs"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mvs_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
The following tunables are settable from the
.Xr loader 8 :
.Bl -ohang
.It Va hint.mvs. Ns Ar X Ns Va .msi
controls Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) usage by the specified controller.
.It Va hint.mvs. Ns Ar X Ns Va .ccc
controls Command Completion Coalescing (CCC) usage by the specified controller.
Non-zero value enables CCC and defines maximum time (in us), request can wait
for interrupt.
CCC reduces number of context switches on systems with many parallel requests,
but it can decrease disk performance on some workloads due to additional
command latency.
.It Va hint.mvs. Ns Ar X Ns Va .cccc
defines number of completed commands for CCC, which trigger interrupt without
waiting for specified coalescing timeout.
.It Va hint.mvsch. Ns Ar X Ns Va .pm_level
controls SATA interface Power Management for the specified channel,
allowing some power to be saved at the cost of additional command
latency.
Possible values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent -compact
.It 0
interface Power Management is disabled (default);
.It 1
device is allowed to initiate PM state change, host is passive;
.It 4
driver initiates PARTIAL PM state transition 1ms after port becomes idle;
.It 5
driver initiates SLUMBER PM state transition 125ms after port becomes idle.
.El
.Pp
Note that interface Power Management is not compatible with
device presence detection.
A manual bus reset is needed on device hot-plug.
.It Va hint.mvsch. Ns Ar X Ns Va .sata_rev
setting to nonzero value limits maximum SATA revision (speed).
Values 1, 2 and 3 are respectively 1.5, 3 and 6Gbps.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides the
.Xr CAM 4
subsystem with native access to the
.Tn SATA
ports of several generations (Gen-I/II/IIe) of Marvell SATA controllers.
Each SATA port found is represented to CAM as a separate bus with one
target, or, if HBA supports Port Multipliers (Gen-II/IIe), 16 targets.
Most of the bus-management details are handled by the SATA-specific
transport of CAM.
Connected ATA disks are handled by the ATA protocol disk peripheral driver
.Xr ada 4 .
ATAPI devices are handled by the SCSI protocol peripheral drivers
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr da 4 ,
.Xr sa 4 ,
etc.
.Pp
Driver features include support for Serial ATA and ATAPI devices,
Port Multipliers (including FIS-based switching, when supported),
hardware command queues (up to 31 command per port),
Native Command Queuing, SATA interface Power Management, device hot-plug
and Message Signaled Interrupts.
