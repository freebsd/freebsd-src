.Sh NAME
.Nm ctl
.Nd CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iscsi"
.Cd "device ctl"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ctl_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem provides SCSI disk and processor emulation.
It supports features such as:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Disk and processor device emulation
.It
Tagged queueing
.It
SCSI task attribute support (ordered, head of queue, simple tags)
.It
SCSI implicit command ordering support
.It
Full task management support (abort, LUN reset, target reset, etc.)
.It
Support for multiple ports
.It
Support for multiple simultaneous initiators
.It
Support for multiple simultaneous backing stores
.It
Support for VMWare VAAI: COMPARE AND WRITE, XCOPY, WRITE SAME,
and UNMAP commands
.It
Support for Microsoft ODX: POPULATE TOKEN/WRITE USING TOKEN,
WRITE SAME, and UNMAP commands
.It
Persistent reservation support
.It
Mode sense/select support
.It
Error injection support
.It
All I/O handled in-kernel, no userland context switch overhead
.El
.Pp
It also serves as a kernel component of the native iSCSI target.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.debug
Verbosity level for log messages from the kernel part of iSCSI target.
Set to 0 to disable logging or 1 to warn about potential problems.
Larger values enable debugging output.
Defaults to 1.
.It Va kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.maxcmdsn_delta
The number of outstanding commands to advertise to the iSCSI initiator.
Technically, it is the difference between ExpCmdSN and MaxCmdSN fields
in the iSCSI PDU.
.It Va kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.ping_timeout
The number of seconds to wait for the iSCSI initiator to respond to a NOP-In
PDU.
In the event that there is no response within that time the session gets
forcibly terminated.
