.Sh NAME
.Nm ispfw
.Nd "Firmware for Qlogic FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ispfw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ispfw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This trivial driver provides access to firmware sets for the Qlogic
FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters.
It may either be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.
In either
case, the
.Xr isp 4
driver will notice that firmware is available to be downloaded onto
Qlogic cards (to replace the usually out of date firmware on the cards).
This will kick the f/w into getting unstuck.

Later improvement was done by
