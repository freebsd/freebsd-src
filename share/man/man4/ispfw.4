.Sh NAME
.Nm ispfw
.Nd Firmware Module for Qlogic based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ispfw"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This trivial driver provides access to firmware sets for the Qlogic
based SCSI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters. It may either be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module. In either
case, the
.Xr isp 4
driver will notice that firmware is available to be downloaded onto
Qlogic cards (to replace the usually out of date firmware on the cards).
this will kick the f/w into getting unstuck.

This driver was written by Matthew Jacob.
