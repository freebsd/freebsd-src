.Sh NAME
.Nm nge
.Nd "National Semiconductor PCI gigabit ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device nge"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various NICs based on the National Semiconductor
DP83820 and DP83821 gigabit ethernet controller chips, including the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
SMC EZ Card 1000 (SMC9462TX)
.It
D-Link DGE-500T
.It
Asante FriendlyNet GigaNIX 1000TA and 1000TPC
.It
Addrton AEG320T
.El
.Pp
All of these NICs are capable of 10, 100 and 1000mbps speeds over CAT5
copper cable. The DP83820 supports TBI (ten bit interface) and GMII
transceivers, which means it can be used with either copper of 1000baseX
fiber applications. The DP83820 supports TCP/IP checksum offload and
VLAN tagging/insertion as well as a 2048-bit multicast hash filter
and up to 4 pattern match buffers.
.Pp
Most cards also use the DP83861 10/100/1000 copper gigabit tranceiver
chip, which supports autonegotiation of 10, 100 and 1000mbps modes in
full or half duplex.
.Pp
The DP83820 also supports jumbo frames, which can be configured
via the interface MTY setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tanges,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10baseTXUTP
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Sq full-duplex
or
.Sq half-duplex
modes.
.It 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (gigabit ethernet) operation.
Both
.Ar full-duplex
and
.Ar half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports one special link option for 1000baseTX cards:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx
.It link0
With 1000baseTX cards, establishing a link between two ports requires
that one port be configured as a master and the other a slave.
With autonegotiation,
the master/slave settings will be chosen automatically.
However when manually selecting the link state, it is necessary to
force one side of the link to be a master and the other a slave.
The
.Nm
driver configures the ports as slaves by default.
Setting the
.Ar link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will set a port as a master instead.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "nge%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "nge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "nge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "nge%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
