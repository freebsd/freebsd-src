.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device rue"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the RealTek
RTL8150 USB to Fast Ethernet controller chip.
This includes the Melco Inc. LUA-KTX and the GREEN HOUSE GH-USB100B.
.Pp
The RTL8150 contains an integrated Fast Ethernet MAC, which supports
both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
Although designed to interface with
100Mbps peripheral, the existing USB standard specifies a maximum
transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with this device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable auto selection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the auto selected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
