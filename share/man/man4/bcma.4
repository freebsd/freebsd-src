.Sh NAME
.Nm bcma
.Nd Broadcom AMBA Backplane driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following lines to the
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device bhnd"
.Cd "device bcma"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bcma_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides
.Xr bhnd 4
support for devices using the ARM AMBA-based backplane architecture found
in later Broadcom Home Networking Division's network chipsets and embedded
systems.
.Pp
A common interconnect connects all of the backplane's functional
blocks.
These functional blocks, known as cores, use the ARM AMBA AXI or
APB interface to communicate with devices attached to the interconnect.
.Pp
The IP cores used in
.Xr siba 4
devices were adapted by Broadcom for compatibility with the new
interconnect.

The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
