.Sh NAME
.Nm orm
.Nd ISA I/O space option ROM(s) driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
is automatically included on all systems that have an ISA bus.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The driver scans at boot time the ISA I/O memory space for option
ROM(s) and claims them.
Other drivers are thus precluded from using ISA I/O memory that is on
top of an option ROM.
.Sh AUTHORS
This
manual page was written by
.An Nikolai Saoukh Aq Mt nms@otdel-1.org .
.Sh BUGS
Due to the implementation of the resource manager,
other drivers cannot attach to the option ROM address range.
