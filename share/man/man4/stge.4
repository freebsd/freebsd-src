.Sh NAME
.Nm stge
.Nd Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device stge"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_stge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for various NICs based on the
Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.
.Pp
The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 is found on the D-Link DGE-550T
and the Antares Microsystems Gigabit Ethernet board.
It uses an external PHY or an external 10-bit interface.
.Pp
All NICs supported by the
.Nm
driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for both receive and
transmit, hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion features, and
receive interrupt moderation mechanism as well as a 64-bit
multicast hash filter.
The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 supports TBI (ten bit interface)
and GMII transceivers, which means it can be used with either
copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.
.Pp
The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 also supports jumbo frames, which can be
configured via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
The Sundance/Tamarack supports 1000Mbps in
.Cm autoselect
mode only.
.\" .It Cm 1000baseSX
.\" Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
.\" Both
.\" .Cm full-duplex
.\" and
.\" .Cm half-duplex
.\" modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.stge.%d.rxint_nframe
Number of frames between RxDMAComplete interrupts.
The accepted range is 1 to 255, default value is 8 frames.
The interface has to be brought down and up again before a change takes effect.
.It Va dev.stge.%d.rxint_dmawait
Maximum amount of time to wait in 1us increments before issuing
an Rx interrupt if the number of frames received is less than
.Va rxint_nframe .
The accepted range is 0 to 4194, default value is 30 microseconds.
The interface has to be brought down and up again before a change takes effect.
