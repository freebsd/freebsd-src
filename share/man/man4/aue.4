.Nd ADMtek AN986 Pegasus USB Fast Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device aue"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_aue_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Fast Ethernet adapters based on the
ADMtek AN986 Pegasus chipset.
.Pp
The LinkSys USB10T adapters that contain the AN986 Pegasus chipset
will operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.
.Pp
The Pegasus contains a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.
Although designed to interface with
100Mbps peripherals, the existing USB standard specifies a maximum
transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
The Pegasus supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to enable
.Ar full-duplex
operation.
Not specifying
.Ar full duplex
implies
.Ar half-duplex
mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
The interface will operate in
half duplex mode if this media option is not specified.
.El
.Pp

.Xr ifconfig 8 .

issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "aue%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
