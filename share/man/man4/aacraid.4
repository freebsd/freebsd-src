.Sh NAME
.Nm aacraid
.Nd Adaptec AACRAID Controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd device pci
.Cd device aacraid
.Pp
To compile in debugging code:
.Cd options AACRAID_DEBUG=N
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
aacraid_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Adaptec by PMC RAID controllers,
including Series 6/7/8 and upcoming families.
.Pp
The RAID containers are handled via the
.Nm aacraidp0
bus.
The physical buses are represented by the
.Nm aacraidp?
devices (beginning with aacraidp1).
These devices enable the
SCSI pass-passthrough interface and allows devices connected
to the card such as CD-ROMs to be available via the CAM
.Xr scsi 4
subsystem.
Note that not all cards allow this interface to be enabled.
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/aacraid?
device nodes provide access to the management interface of the controller.
One node exists per installed card.
If the
.Pa aacraid_linux.ko
and
.Pa linux.ko
modules are loaded, the
Linux-compatible
.Xr ioctl 2
interface for the management device will be enabled and will allow
Linux-based management applications to control the card.

.Nm

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Compiling with
.Dv AACRAID_DEBUG
set to a number between 0 and 3
will enable increasingly verbose debug messages.
.Pp
The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously
to the driver.
These messages are printed on the system console,
and are also queued for retrieval by a management application.
