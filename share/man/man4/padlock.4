.Sh NAME
.Nm padlock
.Nd "driver for the cryptographic functions and RNG in VIA C3, C7 and Eden processors"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device padlock"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
padlock_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The C3 and Eden processor series from VIA include hardware acceleration for
AES.
The C7 series includes hardware acceleration for AES, SHA1, SHA256 and RSA.
All of the above processor series include a hardware random number generator.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate AES operations and, if available, HMAC/SHA1
and HMAC/SHA256 for
.Xr crypto 4 .
It also registers itself to accelerate other HMAC algorithms, although
there is no hardware acceleration for those algorithms.
This is only needed so
.Nm
can work with
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Pp
The hardware random number generator supplies data for the kernel
.Xr random 4
subsystem.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox .
The first
.Fx
release to include it was
.Fx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver with AES encryption support was written by
.An Jason Wright Aq Mt jason@OpenBSD.org .
It was ported to
.Fx
and then extended to support SHA1 and SHA256
by
.An Pawel Jakub Dawidek Aq Mt pjd@FreeBSD.org .
