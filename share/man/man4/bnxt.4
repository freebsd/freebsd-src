.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
These variables must be set before loading the driver, either via
.Xr loader.conf 5
or through the use of
.Xr kenv 1 .
These are provided by the
.Xr iflib 4
framework, and might be better documented there.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.iflib.override_nrxds
Override the number of RX descriptors for each queue.
The value is a comma separated list of three positive integers: the size of the
completion ring,
the size of the receive ring, and the size of the aggregation ring respectively.
The completion ring should be at least the size of the aggregation ring plus
four times the size of the receive ring.
These numbers must be powers of two, and zero means to use the default.
Defaults to 0,0,0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.iflib.override_ntxds
Override the number of TX descriptors for each queue.
The value is a comma separated list of two positive integers: the size of the
completion ring, and the size of the transmit ring respectively.
The completion ring should be at least twice the size of the transmit ring.
These numbers must be powers of two, and zero means to use the default.
Defaults to 0,0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.iflib.override_qs_enable
When set, allows the number of transmit and receive queues to be different.
If not set, the lower of the number of TX or RX queues will be used for both.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.iflib.override_nrxqs
Set the number of RX queues.
If zero, the number of RX queues is derived from the number of cores on the
socket connected to the controller.
Defaults to 0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.iflib.override_ntxqs
Set the number of TX queues.
If zero, the number of TX queues is derived from the number of cores on the
socket connected to the controller.
.El
.Pp
These
.Xr sysctl 8
variables can be changed at any time:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.vlan_only
Require that incoming frames must have a VLAN tag on them that matches one that
is configured for the NIC.
Normally, both frames that have a matching VLAN tag and frames that have no
VLAN tag are accepted.
Defaults to 0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.vlan_strip
When non-zero the NIC strips VLAN tags on receive.
Defaults to 0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.rx_stall
Enable buffering rather than dropping frames when there are no available host
RX buffers for DMA.
Defaults to 0.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.rss_type
Comma-separated list of RSS hash types to support.
Default is all types.
Defaults to ipv4,tcp_ipv4,udp_ipv4,ipv6,tcp_ipv6,udp_ipv6.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.rss_key
Current RSS key.
Defaults to a randomly generated value which is generated for each device
during attach.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.ver.hwrm_min_ver
Minimum HWRM (HardWare Resource Manager) firmware API to support.
If the firmware implements an older version, a warning will be printed, and the
firmware should be upgraded.
Defaults to 1.2.2.
.El
.Pp
These
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are read-only:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.if_name
Current interface name of the device.
This will normally be
.Va bnxtX ,
but this can be changed using
.Cm ifconfig name .
This sysctl allows correlating an interface with a child of
.Va dev.bnxt .
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.nvram.*
Information about the NVRAM device which contains the device firmware.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.ver.*
Version-related information about the device and firmware:
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.ver.hwrm_if
Supported HWRM API version of the currently running firmware.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.ver.driver_hwrm_if
HWRM API version the driver was built to support.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.hwstats.*
Per-queue statistics tracked by the hardware.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.hwstats.port_stats.*
Per-port statistics tracked by the hardware.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.hwstats.rxq0.drop_pkts
Number of packets dropped by hardware on queue zero.
This number might seem high, but the count includes packets dropped due to
incorrect destination MAC, unsubscribed multicast address, and other normal
reasons to ignore Ethernet frames.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.hwstats.rxq0.tpa_*
statistics related to HW LRO.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.hw_lro.*
Enable / Disable HW LRO feature.
Defaults to disable.
Enabling HW LRO could cause issues when forwarding is enabled on host.
.It Va dev.bnxt.X.fc
Enable / Disable Flow Control feature.
Defaults to Enable
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "bnxt%d: %s command returned %s error."
Device firmware rejected a command from the driver.
There might be a driver/firmware HWRM API mismatch.
.It "bnxt%d: Timeout sending %s (timeout: %d) seq %d"
Device firmware unresponsive.
A PCI device reset is likely needed.
.It "bnxt%d: Timeout sending %s (timeout: %d) msg {0x%x 0x%x} len:%d v: %d"
Partial firmware response.
A PCI device reset is likely needed.
.Pp
As of this writing, the system must be rebooted to initiate a PCI device reset.
