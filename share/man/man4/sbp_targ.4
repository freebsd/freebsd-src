.Sh NAME
.Nm sbp_targ
.Nd Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Target Mode devices driver

.Cd "kldload firewire"
.Cd "kldload cam"
.Cd "kldload sbp_targ"
.Pp
or

.Cd "device sbp_targ"
.Cd "device firewire"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SBP-2 target mode.
This driver is supposed to work with cam(4), targ(4) and firewire(4).
You also need to use scsi_target(8), which can be found in
/usr/share/example/scsi_target, to provide actual devices.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mdconfig -a -t malloc -s 10m
md0
# scsi_target 0:0:0 /dev/md0
(Assuming sbp_targ0 on scbus0)
