.Sh NAME
.Nm sbp_targ
.Nd Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Target Mode devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sbp_targ"
.Cd "device firewire"
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device targ"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewire_load="YES"
cam_load="YES"
sbp_targ_load"YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SBP-2 target mode.
This driver is supposed to work with
.Xr cam 4 ,
.Xr targ 4
and
.Xr firewire 4 .
You also need to use
.Xr scsi_target 8 ,
which can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/examples/scsi_target ,
to provide actual devices.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mdconfig -a -t malloc -s 10m
md0
# scsi_target 0:0:0 /dev/md0
(Assuming sbp_targ0 on scbus0)

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cam 4 ,
.Xr firewire 4 ,
.Xr targ 4 ,
.Xr camcontrol 8 ,
.Xr fwcontrol 8 ,
.Xr kldload 8 ,
.Xr scsi_target 8
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
.Sh BUGS
This driver is
.Ud
It does not work correctly in multi-initiator environments
or after the bus topology has been changed.
