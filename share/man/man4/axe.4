.Sh NAME
.Nm axe
.Nd "ASIX Electronics AX88x7x/760 USB Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device axe"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_axe_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88172, AX88178, AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B and AX88760
USB 2.0 chipsets.
.Pp
The AX88172, AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B and AX88760 contain a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and are designed to work with both
Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.
The AX88178 has a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with GMII/RGMII interface
for interfacing with Gigabit Ethernet PHY.
.Pp
These devices will operate with
both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, however performance with 1.x
controllers will be limited since the USB 1.x standard specifies a
maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
All chipsets support a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address, all-multicast mode and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178 only).
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
