.Sh NAME
.Nm umct
.Nd Magic Control Technology USB-RS232 converter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device umct"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umct_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB to RS-232 converters based on the Magic
Control Technology USB-232 design.
These devices support most of the
standard RS-232 features including baud rates ranging from 300 to 115200
bits per second.
However, neither hardware nor software flow control
seems to be supported.
.Pp
Access to devices under this driver is via the
.Xr ucom 4
framework and device nodes.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following adapters:
