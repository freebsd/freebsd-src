.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sndstat
.Nd "nvlist-based PCM audio device enumeration interface"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in the
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ioctl interface provided by
.Pa /dev/sndstat
device allows callers to enumerate PCM audio devices available for use.
In other words, it provides means to get the list of all audio devices
available to the system.
.Sh IOCTLS
For ioctl calls that take an argument, the following structure is used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sndstioc_nv_arg {
	size_t nbytes;
	void *buf;
};
.Ed
.Pp

.Pp
The following ioctls are provided for use:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SNDSTIOC_FLUSH_USER_DEVS"
.It Dv SNDSTIOC_REFRESH_DEVS
Drop any previously fetched PCM audio devices list snapshots.
This ioctl takes no arguments.
.It Dv SNDSTIOC_GET_DEVS
Generate and/or return PCM audio devices list snapshots to callers.
This ioctl takes a pointer to
.Fa struct sndstioc_nv_arg
as the first and the only argument.
Callers need to provide a sufficiently large buffer to hold a serialized
nvlist.
If there is no existing PCM audio device list snapshot available in the
internal structure of the opened sndstat.
.Fa fd ,
a new PCM audio device list snapshot will be automatically generated.
Callers have to set
.Fa nbytes
to either 0 or the size of buffer provided.
In case
.Fa nbytes
is 0, the buffer size required to hold a serialized nvlist
stream of current snapshot will be returned in
.Fa nbytes ,
and
.Fa buf
will be ignored.
Otherwise, if the buffer is not sufficiently large,
the ioctl returns success, and
.Fa nbytes
will be set to 0.
If the buffer provided is sufficiently large,
.Fa nbytes
will be set to the size of the serialized nvlist written to the provided buffer.
Once a PCM audio device list snapshot is returned to user-space successfully,
the snapshot stored in the subsystem's internal structure of the given
.Fa fd
will be freed.
.It Dv SNDSTIOC_ADD_USER_DEVS
Add a list of PCM audio devices provided by callers to
.Pa /dev/sndstat
device.
This ioctl takes a pointer to
.Fa struct sndstioc_nv_arg
as the first and the only argument.
Callers have to provide a buffer holding a serialized nvlist.
.Fa nbytes
should be set to the length in bytes of the serialized nvlist.
.Fa buf
should be pointed to a buffer storing the serialized nvlist.
Userspace-backed PCM audio device nodes should be listed inside the serialized
nvlist.
.It Dv SNDSTIOC_FLUSH_USER_DEVS
Flush any PCM audio devices previously added by callers.
This ioctl takes no arguments.
