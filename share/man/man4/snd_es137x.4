.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_es137x
.Nd "Ensoniq AudioPCI ES137x bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_es137x"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_es137x_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver
.Xr sound 4
to attach to the Ensoniq 137x audio cards.
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available in addition to those available to all
.Xr sound 4
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va hw.snd.pcm%d.latency_timer" -offset indent
.It Va hw.snd.pcm%d.latency_timer
Controls the PCI latency timer setting.
Increasing this value will solve most popping and crackling issues
(especially on VIA motherboards).
.It Va hw.snd.pcm%d.spdif_enabled
Enables S/PDIF output on the primary playback channel.
This
.Xr sysctl 8
variable is available only if the device is known to support S/PDIF output.
.It Va dev.pcm.%d.polling
Experimental polling mode, where the driver operates by querying the device
state on each tick using
.Xr callout 9 .
Polling is disabled by default.
Do not enable it unless you are facing weird interrupt problems or if the
device cannot generate interrupts at all.
