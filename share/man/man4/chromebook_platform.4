.Sh NAME
.Nm chromebook_platform
.Nd support driver for hardware on various Chromebook models
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device chromebook_platform"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
chromebook_platform_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides automatic configuration for devices that cannot be enumerated
or safely probed.
In particular, I2C peripherals are different from model to model.
.Nm
has a model-specific information about the I2C peripherals, their drivers,
their bus attachments and slave addresses.
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
does not load driver modules for the peripherals.
Those have to be compiled into the kernel or loaded separately.
