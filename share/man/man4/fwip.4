.Sh NAME
.Nm fwip
.Nd "IP over FireWire driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device firewire"
.Cd "device fwip"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
firewire_load="YES"
if_fwip_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides standard IP over FireWire (IEEE 1394) based on the
protocols described in RFC 2734 and RFC 3146.
.Pp
The
.Xr firewire 4
and
.Xr fwohci 4
drivers
must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Pp
This driver supports
.Xr polling 4
as well if it is compiled with the
.Dv DEVICE_POLLING
option.

.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver and this manual page were written by
.An Doug Rabson ,
based on earlier work by
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
.Sh BUGS
This driver currently does not support the MCAP protocol for multicast
IP over FireWire.
Multicast packets are treated as broadcast packets which is sufficient
for most trivial uses of multicast.
