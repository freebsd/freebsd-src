.Sh NAME
.Nm ste
.Nd "Sundance Technologies ST201 Fast Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device ste"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ste_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Sundance Technologies ST201 PCI Fast
Ethernet controller chip.
.Pp
The Sundance ST201 uses bus master DMA and is designed to be a
3Com Etherlink XL workalike.
It uses the same DMA descriptor
structure and is very similar in operation, however its register
layout is different.
The ST201 has a 64-bit multicast hash filter
and a single perfect filter entry for the station address.
It supports both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex
using an MII transceiver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports Sundance Technologies ST201 based Fast Ethernet
adapters and embedded controllers including:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
D-Link DFE-530TXS
.It
D-Link DFE-550TX
.It
D-Link DFE-580TX
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va dev.ste.%d.int_rx_mod
Maximum number of time to delay RX interrupts.
The valid range is 0 to 209712 in units of 1us, the default is
150 (150us).
The value 0 effectively disables the RX interrupt moderation.
The resolution of timer is about 3.2us so finer tuning than
3.2us wouldn't be available.
The interface does not need to be brought down and up again before
a change takes effect.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ste%d: couldn't map ports/memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ste%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ste%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "ste%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "ste%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
.It "ste%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it will not be able to configure it
correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If
you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform a second
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If you power down your system prior to booting
.Fx ,
the card should be configured correctly.
