.Sh NAME
.Nm wlan_gcmp
.Nd AES-GCMP crypto support for 802.11 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device wlan_gcmp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module handles the
.Em Galois/Counter Mode Protocol
cryptographic requirements of the IEEE 802.11ad and WPA2/WPA3 protocols.
It does encapsulation and decapsulation of GCMP-encoded 802.11 frames
and optionally calculates the AES-GCMP cipher.
The
.Nm
module is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin module for use by the
.Xr wlan 4
module.
This module is automatically loaded if an AES-GCMP key is configured;
typically by a WPA supplicant program such as wpa_supplicant,
or a WPA authenticator program such as
.Nm hostapd .
Should the underlying network device not be capable of doing the AES-GCMP
calculations in hardware, the
.Nm
module will do the work.

.Sh STANDARDS
More information can be found in the IEEE 802.11, and WPA Standards.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 15.0 .
