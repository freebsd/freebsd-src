.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_test
.Nd MAC framework testing policy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the testing policy
into your kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options MAC"
.Cd "options MAC_TEST"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternately, to load the testing module at boot time, place the following line
in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options MAC"
.Ed
.Pp
and in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mac_test_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
policy module implements a testing facility for the MAC framework.
Among other things,
.Nm
will try to catch corrupt labels the system is attempting to destroy and
drop to the debugger.
Additionally, a set of statistics regarding the number of times various
MAC framework entry points have been called is stored in the
.Va security.mac.test
.Xr sysctl 8
tree.
.Ss Label Format
No labels are defined for
.Nm .

.Sh BUGS
While the MAC Framework design is intended to support the containment of
the root user, not all attack channels are currently protected by entry
point checks.
As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied on, in isolation,
to protect against a malicious privileged user.
