.Nm msk
.Nd Marvell/SysKonnect Yukon II Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device msk"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_msk_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for various NICs based on the
Marvell/SysKonnect Yukon II Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.
.Pp
All NICs supported by the
.Nm
driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for transmit, TCP
segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion
features and an interrupt moderation mechanism as well as a 64-bit
multicast hash filter.
The Yukon II supports TBI (ten bit interface) and GMII
transceivers, which means it can be used with either copper or
1000baseX fiber applications.
.Pp
The Yukon II also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9022 bytes), which can be
configured via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm 10baseT/UTP"
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseTX
Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm full-duplex"
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.msk.msi_disable
This tunable disables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.
The default value is 0.
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.mskc.%d.int_holdoff
Maximum number of time to delay interrupts.
The valid range is 0 to 34359738 for 125MHz clock in units of 1us,
the default is 100 (100us).
The interface need to be brought down and up again before a change
takes effect.
.It Va dev.mskc.%d.process_limit
Maximum amount of Rx events to be processed in the event loop before
rescheduling a taskqueue.
The accepted range is 30 to 256, the default value is 128 events.
The interface does not need to be brought down and up again before
a change takes effect.
