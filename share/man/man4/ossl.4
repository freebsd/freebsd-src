.Sh NAME
.Nm ossl
.Nd "driver using OpenSSL assembly routines"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device crypto"
.Cd "device cryptodev"
.Cd "device ossl"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ossl_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The OpenSSL distribution includes architecture-specific
implementations for some commonly used cryptographic algorithms.
This driver adds a wrapper around these routines permitting them to be
used by in-kernel cryptography consumers such as kernel TLS and IPsec.
