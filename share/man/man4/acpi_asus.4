.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_asus
.Nd Asus Laptop Extras
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_asus"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_asus_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the extra ACPI-controlled gadgets, such as hotkeys
and leds, found on recent Asus (and Medion) laptops.
It allows one to use the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface to manipulate the brightness of the LCD panel and the display output
state.
Hotkey events are passed to
.Xr devd 8
for easy handling in userspace with the default configuration in
.Pa /etc/devd/asus.conf .
.Pp
Currently, the following Asus laptops are fully supported:

Additionally,
.Nm
also supports the Asus-compatible
.Em ATK0100
interface found in
.Em Samsung P30/P35
laptops.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following sysctls are currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.asus.lcd_brightness
Makes the LCD backlight brighter or dimmer (higher values are brighter).
.It Va hw.acpi.asus.lcd_backlight
Turns the LCD backlight on or off.
.It Va hw.acpi.asus.video_output
Sets the active display to use according to a bitwise OR of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li 0
No display
.It Li 1
LCD
.It Li 2
CRT
.It Li 4
TV-Out
.El
.Pp
Some models also support video switching via the generic
.Xr acpi_video 4
driver.
Most models do not, however.
.El
.Pp
Defaults for these variables can be set in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 ,
which is parsed at boot-time.
