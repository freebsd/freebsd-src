.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vt0"
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.vt.0.at="isa"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Overview
The
.Nm
driver provides a virtual screen handling system.
Probably most important is an emulation of a wide range
of DEC
.Tn VT-220
functionality.
See
.Sx Features
for a detailed description.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver requires the keyboard driver
.Nm atkbd
to be also configured in the kernel.

.El
.Pp
What it cannot:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
No double wide/high characters
.It
No softscroll
.It
No inverse background
.It
No VT220 printer output support
.It
No VT52 support at all
.It
No 8-bit controls
.It
Only limited AT-keyboard
(84 keys)
support
.El
.Ss Scrollback
Each virtual
.Nm
virtual terminal has 8 pages of memory attached which are used as a
scrollback buffer.
By using
.Em SHIFT-PageUp
and
.Em SHIFT-PageDown
it is possible to scroll the screen back and forward.
.Ss Configuration
The
.Nm
console driver is available for the Intel-based
.Fx
operating system.
It has been designed to be highly configurable in order to satisfy
everyone's needs.
The preferred way for those configurations is to
provide appropriate
.Em options
lines within the config file, possibly overriding the built-in default
values.
.Pp
The following list gives a short overview of the available configuration
options.
Refer to the file
.Pa i386/isa/pcvt/pcvt_conf.h
in the kernel source tree for detailed documentation.
.Pp
Note: the following conventions apply to all the Boolean options.
If an option is given with no value, a value of 1
(activated)
is substituted.
If an option value is given as 0, this options is
deactivated.
Any other value is substituted by 1, too.
If an option
is omitted, a built-in default is assumed.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Em PCVT_NSCREENS
Defines the number of virtual screens.
.Pp
Default: 8
.It Em PCVT_VT220KEYB
If activated, a keyboard layout resembling a DEC VT200 (TM) is generated.
If deactivated, a mixture between VT220 and HP is used.
See the files
.Pa Keyboard.VT
and
.Pa Keyboard.HP
in the
.Nm
documentation directory for a full description.
.Pp
Default: off
.It Em PCVT_SCREENSAVER
Enables the builtin screensaver feature.
.Pp
Default: on
.It Em PCVT_PRETTYSCRNS
If enabled, a blinking-star screensaver is used.
If disabled, the screen
is simply blanked
(which might be useful for energy-saving monitors).
.Pp
Default: on
.It Em PCVT_CTRL_ALT_DEL
If enabled, the key combination
.Aq Em Ctrl
.Aq Em Alt
.Aq Em Del
invokes a CPU reset.
.Pp
Default: off
.It Em PCVT_USEKBDSEC
Do NOT override a security lock for the keyboard.
.Pp
Default: on
.It Em PCVT_24LINESDEF
If enabled, the 25-line modi
(VT emulation with 25 lines, and HP emulation with 28 lines)
default to 24 lines only to provide a better compatibility to the
original DEV VT220 (TM).
Thus it should be possible to use the
terminal information for those terminals without further changes.
Note that this is a startup option; it is possible to toggle between
the 24- and 25-lines' display by the
.Xr scon 1
utility.
.Pp
Default: off
.It Em PCVT_META_ESC
If enabled, a sequence composed of
.Aq Em esc ,
followed by the normal key code is emitted if a key is pressed with the
.Aq Em Alt
key modifier.
If disabled, then normal key code with the value
.Em 0x80
added is sent.
.Pp
Default: off
.El
.Pp
Note that there are further options available which are mainly used for
debugging purposes or as a workaround for hardware problems.
They are found in
.Pa i386/isa/pcvt/pcvt_conf.h
along with their documentation.
.Ss Internal Functions
The functionality described below may be accessed via
.Xr ioctl 2
system calls with a file descriptor opened on a device node
related to the
.Nm
driver.
To make use of them, a program should contain the following line:
.Pp
.Dl #include <machine/pcvt_ioctl.h>
.Pp
Any parameter definitions cited below can be found in that file.
.Pp
.Em Keyboard related functions
.Pp
Three functions are related to basic keyboard hardware:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDRESET
reset keyboard, set defaults;
.It KBDGTPMAT
get current typematic value, parameter is a pointer to int where
the values is stored to;
.It KBDSTPMAT
set current typematic value, similar to above command.
.El
.Pp
Symbolic values are available for the appropriate constants.
To specify the initial typematic delay time, they are
KBD_TPD250 for 250 ms through
KBD_TPD1000 for 1000 ms, in steps of 250 ms.
The typematic repeat
rates are
KBD_TPM300, specifying 30.0 characters per second through
KBD_TPM20 for 2.0 characters per second.
The intermediate values
are: 30.0, 26.7, 24.0, 21.8, 20.0, 18.5, 17.1, 16.0, 15.0, 13.3,
12.0, 10.9, 10.0, 9.2, 8.6, 8.0, 7.5, 6.7, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.6, 4.3,
4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, 2.7, 2.5, 2.3, 2.1, 2.0 characters per second.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDGREPSW
get key repetition switch, and
.It KBDSREPSW
set key repetition switch
.El
.Pp
again take a pointer to int as argument.
They manipulate the
drivers internal keyboard repetition flag, possible values are:
KBD_REPEATOFF or KBD_REPEATON.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDGLEDS
get LED state, and
.It KBDSLEDS
set LED state manipulate the keyboard indicators, but do not influence
the drivers idea of lock key state.
.El
.Pp
The int where the argument points to
may have the values
KBD_SCROLLLOCK, KBD_NUMLOCK, KBD_CAPSLOCK, which may be used in any
conjunction.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDGLOCK
gets state of SCROLL,NUM,CAPS, and
.It KBDSLOCK
sets state of SCROLL,NUM,CAPS + LEDs
.El
.Pp
should be used in a same manner to get/set the drivers internal
LED flags.
.Pp
.Em Keyboard remapping
.Pp
One important feature of the
.Nm
driver is its ability to overload the built in key definition.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDGCKEY
get current key values,
.It KBDSCKEY
set new key assignment values, and
.It KBDGOKEY
get original key assignment values
.El
.Pp
arrange those functions.
The take a pointer to a
.Em struct kbd_ovlkey
as argument as described below.
In addition,
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBDRMKEY
removes a key assignment, taking a pointer to an int as argument which
contains the affected key number;
.It KBDDEFAULT
removes all key assignments.
.El
.Bd -literal
struct kbd_ovlkey                /* complete definition of a key */
{
    u_short keynum;                      /* the key itself */
    u_short type;                        /* type of key, see below */
    u_char  subu;                        /* subtype, ignored on write */
    char    unshift[KBDMAXOVLKEYSIZE+1]; /* emitted string, unshifted */
    u_char  subs;                        /* subtype, ignored on write */
    char    shift[KBDMAXOVLKEYSIZE+1];   /* emitted string, shifted */
    u_char  subc;                        /* subtype, ignored on write */
    char    ctrl[KBDMAXOVLKEYSIZE+1];    /* emitted string, control */
    u_char  suba;                        /* subtype, ignored on write */
    char    altgr[KBDMAXOVLKEYSIZE+1];   /* emitted string, altgr */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The appropriate values for the
.Em type
field are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBD_NONE
no function, key is disabled,
.It KBD_SHIFT
keyboard shift,
.It KBD_META
alternate shift, sets bit8 to ASCII code,
.It KBD_NUM
numeric shift, keypad numeric / application mode,
.It KBD_CTL
control code generation,
.It KBD_CAPS
caps shift - swaps case of letter,
.It KBD_ASCII
ASCII code generating key,
.It KBD_SCROLL

.It KBD_ALTGR
AltGr translation feature,
.It KBD_SHFTLOCK
shift lock,
.It KBD_CURSOR
cursor keys, and
.It KBD_RETURN
.Dq Return
or
.Dq Enter
keys.
.El
.Pp
The
.Em subtype
field contains one of the values
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It KBD_SUBT_STR
key is bound to a string, or
.It KBD_SUBT_FNC
key is bound to a function.
.El
.Pp
.Em Downloadable character set interface
.Pp
EGA and VGA video adaptors provide the capability of downloadable
software fonts.
Since the
.Sq native character set
of any IBM-compatible PC video board does not allow the full interpretation
of DEC multinational character set or ISO Latin-1
(ISO 8859-1),
this might be very useful for a U**X environment.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It VGASETFONTATTR
set font attr, and
.It VGAGETFONTATTR
get font attr
.El
.Pp
are used to manipulate the drivers information about a downloaded
font.
The take a pointer to a
.Em struct vgafontattr
as argument:
.Bd -literal
struct vgafontattr {
    int character_set;          /* VGA character set */
    int font_loaded;            /* Mark font loaded or unloaded */
    int screen_size;            /* Character rows per screen */
    int character_scanlines;    /* Scanlines per character - 1 */
    int screen_scanlines;       /* Scanlines per screen - 1 byte */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Each character of each font is to be downloaded with
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It VGALOADCHAR
load vga char,
.El
.Pp
taking a pointer to
.Em struct vgaloadchar
as its argument:
.Bd -literal
struct vgaloadchar {
    int character_set;       /* VGA character set to load into */
    int character;           /* Character to load */
    int character_scanlines; /* Scanlines per character */
    u_char char_table[32];   /* VGA character shape table */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The field
.Em character_set
takes the values
CH_SET0, CH_SET1, CH_SET2, CH_SET3 on EGA's or VGA's.
Since VGA's
might have up to eight simultaneously loaded fonts, they can take
CH_SET4, CH_SET5, CH_SET6, or CH_SET7, too.
.Pp
Note that there's a dependence between the font size
and a possible screen height
(in character rows),
depending on the video adaptor used:
.Bd -literal
Screen size (rows) on:          EGA             VGA
Font size

8 x 8                           43              50
8 x 10                          35              40
8 x 14                          25              28
8 x 16                          not             25

.Pp
its parameter is a pointer to an integer containing either a value of 80,
or a value of 132.
Note that setting the number of columns to 132 is only supported on
some VGA adaptors.
Any unsupported numbers cause the ioctl to fail with
.Va errno
(see
.Xr intro 2 )
being set to
.Er EINVAL .
.Pp
.Em VGA color palette interface
.Pp
Only on VGA adaptors, there's a color palette register at the output.
It is responsible for the red, green and blue output voltage provided
for each of the 256 internal color codes, each lying in the range of
0 through 63 (with 63 representing the brightest value for a base color).
Thus, these adaptors map each color code to a color of a
.Dq palette
out of 262144 colors.
The commands

to switch between virtual screens even when
running an X server.
They are ugly with respect to the implied semantics
(i.e., they break Berkeley semantics).
