.Dt FILEMON 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm filemon
.Nd the filemon device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/filemon/filemon.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device allows a process to collect file operations data of its children.
The device
.Pa /dev/filemon
responds to two
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.
.Pp
System calls are denoted using the following single letters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Ql C
.Xr chdir 2
.It Ql D
.Xr unlink 2
.It Ql E
.Xr exec 2
.It Ql F
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr vfork 2
.It Ql L
.Xr link 2 ,
.Xr linkat 2 ,
.Xr symlink 2 ,
.Xr symlinkat 2
.It Ql M
.Xr rename 2
.It Ql R
.Xr open 2
for read
.It Ql S
.Xr stat 2
.It Ql W
.Xr open 2
for write
.It Ql X
.Xr _exit 2
.El
.Pp
Note that
.Ql R
following
.Ql W
records can represent a single
.Xr open 2
for R/W,
or two separate
.Xr open 2
calls, one for
.Ql R
and one for
.Ql W .
Note that only successful system calls are captured.
.Sh IOCTLS
User mode programs communicate with the
.Nm
driver through a number of ioctls which are described below.
Each takes a single argument.
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv FILEMON_SET_PID"
.It Dv FILEMON_SET_FD
Write the internal tracing buffer to the supplied open file descriptor.
.It Dv FILEMON_SET_PID
Child process ID to trace.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" .Rv -std ioctl
The
.Fn ioctl
function returns the value 0 if successful;
otherwise the value \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/filemon"
.It Pa /dev/filemon
.El

	} else {

		close(fm_fd);
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
Creates a file named
.Pa filemon.out
and configures the
.Nm
device to write the
.Nm
buffer contents to it.
