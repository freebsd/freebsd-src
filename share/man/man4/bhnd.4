.Sh NAME
.Nm bhnd
.Nd Broadcom Home Networking Division interconnect bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following lines to the
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device bhnd"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bhnd_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a unified kernel bus interface to the on-chip
interconnects used in Broadcom Home Networking Division (HND)
devices.
.Pp
The Broadcom HND device family consists of SoCs (System On a Chip)
and host-connected chipsets based on a common library of Broadcom IP
cores connected via an internal hardware bus architecture.
Drivers for these cores are implemented against the unified
.Nm
interface.
.Pp
The Sonic Inc. Silicon Backplane used in earlier HND devices is supported
by the
.Xr siba 4
BHND driver.
.Pp
The ARM AMBA-based interconnect used in later HND devices is supported by
the
.Xr bcma 4
BHND driver.
