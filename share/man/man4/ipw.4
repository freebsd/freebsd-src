.Sh NAME
.Nm ipw
.Nd Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 IEEE 802.11a/b driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ipw"
.Cd "device ipwfw"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_ipw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In both cases, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to acknowledge the firmware license (see below):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 802.11a/b
wireless network devices in
.Cm station ,
.Cm adhoc ,
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
.Pp
This driver requires the firmware built with the
.Nm ipwfw
module to work.
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_ipw.LICENSE
must be agreed by adding the following line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1"
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
Intel PRO/Wireless 2100a/b MiniPCI network adapter.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Pp
.Dl ifconfig wlan create wlandev ipw0 inet 192.0.2.20/24
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Ar my_net :
.Pp
.Dl ifconfig wlan create wlandev ipw0 ssid my_net up
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev ipw0 ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev ipw0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ipw%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "ipw%d: firmware error"
The onboard microcontroller crashes for some reason.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "ipw%d: timeout waiting for firmware initialization to complete"
The onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.
This should not happen.
.It "ipw%d: could not load firmware image '%s'"
The driver failed to load the firmware image using the
.Xr firmware 9
subsystem.
Verify the
.Xr ipwfw 4
firmware module is installed and the license agreement
.Xr loader 8
tunable has been set.
.It "ipw%d: could not load microcode"
An attempt to upload the microcode image to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
.It "ipw%d: could not load firmware"
An attempt to upload the firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
