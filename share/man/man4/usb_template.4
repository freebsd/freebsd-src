.Sh NAME
.
.
.Nm usb_template
.
.Nd "USB device side templates"
.
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel, place the following line in
your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb_template"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usb_template_load="YES"
.Ed
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module implements various USB templates that are needed when
programming an USB device side driver.
.
A USB template consists of an USB device descriptor, one or more USB
configuration descriptors, one or more USB interface descriptors, one
or more USB endpoint descriptors, USB strings and additional USB
descriptors.
.
USB templates are selected using the
.Va hw.usb.template
sysctl and tunable,
or by using the
.Xr usbconfig 8
.Cm set_template
subcommand.
Changing the
.Va hw.usb.template
sysctl triggers reenumeration by the USB host; changes to other sysctls
may not be visible to the host until reenumeration is performed.
.Pp
Available templates are:
.Bl -column -offset 3n "Value"
.It Em Value Ta Em Description
.It Dv 0 Ta USB Mass Storage, see
.Xr cfumass 4
.It Dv 1 Ta CDC Ethernet, see
.Xr cdce 4
.It Dv 2 Ta Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)
.It Dv 3 Ta USB serial port, see
.Xr umodem 4

.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.usb.template
Currently selected template.
Set to -1 to make the device disappear from the USB host point of view.
.It Va hw.usb.template_power
USB bus power consumption in mA at 5V.
Must be between 0 and 500.
Setting to 0 marks the device as self-powered.
Defaults to 500mA.
.It Va hw.usb.templates.N
Configuration for template number
.Va N .
.It Va hw.usb.templates.N.vendor_id
