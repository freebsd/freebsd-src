.Sh NAME
.Nm ufintek
.Nd Fintek F81232 USB to serial UART driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device ufintek"
.Pp
In
.Xr rc.conf 5 :
.Cd kld_list="ufintek"
.Pp
In
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 :
.Cd hw.usb.ufintek.debug=1
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the F81232 serial adapter from FINTEK.
If the appropriate hardware is detected,
the driver will be loaded automatically by
.Xr devmatch 8 .
To load the driver manually, add it to the
.Ic kld_list
in
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
or use
.Xr kldload 8
at runtime.
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Pp
Call out through this interface with applications like
.Xr cu 1
or
.Xr tip 1 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following USB to serial UART controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
FT82332
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
These settings can be entered in the
.Xr loader 8
prompt, set in
.Xr loader.conf 5 ,
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 ,
or changed at runtime with
.Xr sysctl 8 :
.Bl -tag -width "hw.usb.uftdi.debug"
.It Va hw.usb.uftdi.debug
Enable debugging messages, default
.Ql 0
.Ql 1
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/ttyU*.init" -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*
for callin ports
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.init
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.lock
corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state devices
.Pp
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*
for callout ports
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.init
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.lock
corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state devices
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 16.0
.Sh BUGS
This driver is limited to 9600 baud.
