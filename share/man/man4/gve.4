.Sh NAME
.Nm gve
.Nd "Ethernet driver for Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC)"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device gve"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_gve_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
gVNIC is a virtual network interface designed specifically for Google Compute Engine (GCE).
It is required to support per-VM Tier-1 networking performance, and for using certain VM shapes on GCE.
.Pp
.Nm
is the driver for gVNIC.
It supports the following features:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
RX checksum offload
.It
TX chesksum offload
.It
TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO)
.It
Large Receive Offload (LRO) in software
.It
Jumbo frames
.It
Receive Side Scaling (RSS)
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
.Nm
binds to a single PCI device ID presented by gVNIC:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
0x1AE0:0x0042
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The following messages are recorded during driver initialization:
.Bl -diag
.It "Enabled MSIX with %d vectors"
.It "Configured device resources"
.It "Successfully attached %s"
.It "Deconfigured device resources"
.El
.Pp
These messages are seen if driver initialization fails.
Global (across-queues) allocation failures:
.Bl -diag
.It "Failed to configure device resources: err=%d"
.It "No compatible queue formats"
.It "Failed to allocate ifnet struct"
.It "Failed to allocate admin queue mem"
.It "Failed to alloc DMA mem for DescribeDevice"
.It "Failed to allocate QPL page"
.El
.Pp
irq and BAR allocation failures:
.Bl -diag
.It "Failed to acquire any msix vectors"
.It "Tried to acquire %d msix vectors, got only %d"
.It "Failed to setup irq %d for Tx queue %d "
.It "Failed to setup irq %d for Rx queue %d "
.It "Failed to allocate irq %d for mgmnt queue"
.It "Failed to setup irq %d for mgmnt queue, err: %d"
.It "Failed to allocate BAR0"
.It "Failed to allocate BAR2"
.It "Failed to allocate msix table"
.El
.Pp
Rx queue-specific allocation failures:
.Bl -diag
.It "No QPL left for rx ring %d"
.It "Failed to alloc queue resources for rx ring %d"
.It "Failed to alloc desc ring for rx ring %d"
.It "Failed to alloc data ring for rx ring %d"
.El
.Pp
Tx queue-specific allocation failures:
.Bl -diag
.It "No QPL left for tx ring %d"
.It "Failed to alloc queue resources for tx ring %d"
.It "Failed to alloc desc ring for tx ring %d"
.It "Failed to vmap fifo, qpl_id = %d"
.El
.El
.Pp
The following messages are recorded when the interface detach fails:
.Bl -diag
.It "Failed to deconfigure device resources: err=%d"
.El
.Pp
If bootverbose is on, the following messages are recorded when the interface is being brought up:
.Bl -diag
.It "Created %d rx queues"
.It "Created %d tx queues"
.It "MTU set to %d"
.El
.Pp
The following messages are recorded when the interface is being brought down:
.Bl -diag
.It "Destroyed %d rx queues"
.It "Destroyed %d tx queues"
.El
.Pp
These messages are seen if errors are encountered when bringing the interface up or down:
.Bl -diag
.It "Failed to destroy rxq %d, err: %d"
.It "Failed to destroy txq %d, err: %d"
.It "Failed to create rxq %d, err: %d"
.It "Failed to create txq %d, err: %d"
.It "Failed to set MTU to %d"
.It "Invalid new MTU setting. new mtu: %d max mtu: %d min mtu: %d"
.It "Cannot bring the iface up when detached"
.It "Reached max number of registered pages %lu > %lu"
.It "Failed to init lro for rx ring %d"
.El
.Pp
These messages are seen if any admin queue command fails:
.Bl -diag
.It "AQ command(%u): failed with status %d"
.It "AQ command(%u): unknown status code %d"
.It "AQ commands timed out, need to reset AQ"
.It "Unknown AQ command opcode %d"
.El
.Pp
These messages are recorded when the device is being reset due to an error:
.Bl -diag
.It "Scheduling reset task!"
.It "Waiting until admin queue is released."
.It "Admin queue released"
.El
.Pp
If it was the NIC that requested the reset, this message is recorded:
.Bl -diag
.It "Device requested reset"
.El
.Pp
If the reset fails during the reinitialization phase, this message is recorded:
.Bl -diag
.It "Restore failed!"
.El
.Pp
These two messages correspond to the NIC alerting the driver to link state changes:
.Bl -diag
.It "Device link is up."
.It "Device link is down."
.El
.Pp
Apart from these messages, the driver exposes per-queue packet and error counters as sysctl nodes.
Global (across queues) counters can be read using
.Xr netstat 8 .
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm
does not support the transmission of VLAN-tagged packets.
All VLAN-tagged traffic is dropped.
