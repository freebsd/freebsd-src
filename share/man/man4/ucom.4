.Dt UCOM 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ucom
.Nd USB tty support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ucom"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ucom_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches to USB modems, serial ports, and other devices that need
to look like a tty.
The
.Nm
driver shows a behavior like a
.Xr tty 4 .
This means that normal programs such as
.Xr tip 1
or
.Xr ppp 8
can be used to access the device.
.Sh Pulse Per Second (PPS) Timing Interface
The
.Nm
driver can capture PPS timing information as defined in RFC 2783.
The API, accessed via
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
is available on the tty device.
To use the PPS capture feature with
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
symlink the tty device to
.Va /dev/pps0.
.Pp
The
.Va hw.usb.ucom.pps_mode
sysctl configures the PPS capture mode.
It can be set in
.Xr loader.conf 5
or
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
The following capture modes are available:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset "mmmm" -width "mmmm"
.It 0
Capture disabled (default).
.It 1
Capture pulses on the CTS line.
.It 2
Capture pulses on the DCD line.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/cuaU?"
.It Pa /dev/cuaU?
.It Pa /dev/ttyU?

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was adopted from
.Nx
in March of 2002.
This manual page was adopted from
.Nx
by
.An Tom Rhodes Aq Mt trhodes@FreeBSD.org
in April 2002.
.Sh BUGS
Prior to
.Fx 6.0
.Nm
created
.Pa /dev/ucom?
rather than the uniform device names created today.
Old scripts must be adjusted accordingly.
