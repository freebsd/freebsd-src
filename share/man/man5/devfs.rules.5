.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm devfs.rules
.Nd devfs configuration information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides an easy way to create and apply
.Xr devfs 8
rules, even for devices that are not available at boot.
.Pp
For devices available at boot, see
.Xr devfs.conf 5 .
.Pp
The format of this file is simple.
Empty lines and lines beginning with a hash sign
.Pq Ql #
are ignored.
A line between brackets denotes the start of a ruleset.
In the brackets should be the name of the ruleset and its number,
separated by an equal sign.
.Pp
Other lines are rule specifications as documented in
.Xr devfs 8 ,
in the section
.Sx "Rule Specification" .
These lines are prepended with
.Dq Li rule
and are passed to
.Xr devfs 8
by the startup scripts of the system.
It is important to put path elements that contain
.Xr glob 3
special characters between quotes.
.Pp
Rulesets should have a unique name and number.
.Pp
All rules that follow a ruleset declaration belong to that ruleset, until a
new ruleset is started.
.Pp
One custom ruleset has to be enabled in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
otherwise it will not be applied to the
.Pa /dev
file system by the default system startup process.
For example, to enable a
.Dq Li localrules
ruleset for the
.Pa /dev
file system, you would have to use something like this in your
.Pa rc.conf
file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
devfs_system_ruleset="localrules"
.Ed
.Pp
The rules are loaded at boot via the devfs service.
To load modified rules after the system has booted, run the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
service devfs restart
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width Pa
.It Pa /etc/defaults/devfs.rules
Default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/devfs.rules
Local
.Nm
configuration file.
Rulesets in here override those in
.Pa /etc/defaults/devfs.rules
with the same ruleset number, otherwise the two files are effectively merged.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To make all the partitions of
.Xr da 4
devices readable and writable by their owner and the
.Dq Li usb
group, the following rule may be used:
.Pp
.Dl "[localrules=10]"
.Dl "add path 'da*s*' mode 0660 group usb"
.Pp
The first line declares and starts a new ruleset, with the name
.Va localrules
and the number 10.
.Pp
To give
.Xr usbconfig 8
and
.Xr libusb 3
enabled applications permission to all usb devices for their owner and the
.Dq Li usb
group, a similar rule may be used:
.Pp
.Dl "add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group usb"
