.Sh NAME
.Nm devfs.rules
.Nd devfs configuration information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides an easy way to create and apply
.Xr devfs 8
rules, even for devices that are not available at boot.
.Pp
For devices available at boot, see
.Xr devfs.conf 5 .
.Pp
The format of this file is simple.
Empty lines and lines beginning with a hash sign
.Pq Ql #
are ignored.
A line between brackets denotes the start of a ruleset.
In the brackets should be the name of the ruleset and its number,
separated by an equal sign.
.Pp
Other lines are rule specifications as documented in
.Xr devfs 8 ,
in the section
.Sx "Rule Specification" .
These lines are prepended with
.Dq Li rule
and are passed to
.Xr devfs 8
by the startup scripts of the system.
It is important to put path elements that contain
.Xr glob 3
special characters between quotes.

.Pp
To make all the
.Xr uscanner 4
