.Sh NAME
.Nm make.conf
.Nd system build information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains settings that control the compilation of the
.Fx
sources
and ported applications.
The file
.Nm
is generally created by the system administrator when the values need
to be changed from their defaults.
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform compilation actions
directly.
Instead, it is included by the
various makefiles in
.Pa /usr/src ,
.Pa /usr/ports
and
.Pa /usr/doc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/make.conf
file is included from the appropriate
.Pa Makefile
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options need only be specified in
.Pa /etc/make.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
.Pp
The build procedures occur in four broad areas: the world, the kernel,
documentations and ports.
Variables set in
.Nm
may be applicable during builds in one, two, or all four of these
areas.
They may be specified for a particular build via the
.Fl D
option of
.Xr make 1 .
.Pp
The following lists provide a name and short description for each
variable you can use during the indicated builds.
The values of
variables flagged as
.Vt bool
are ignored; the variable being
set at all (even to
.Dq Li FALSE
or
.Dq Li NO )
causes it to
be treated as if it were set.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are used for all builds, or are used by the
.Pa makefiles
for things other than builds.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va ALWAYS_CHECK_MAKE
.Pq Vt bool
Instructs the top-level makefile in the source tree (normally
.Pa /usr/src )
to always check if
.Xr make 1
is up-to-date.
Normally this is only done for the world and buildworld targets to handle
upgrades from older versions of
.Fx .
.It Va CFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Controls the compiler setting when compiling C code.
Optimization levels other than
.Fl O
and
.Fl O2
are not supported.
.Va BDECFLAGS
is provided as a set of
.Xr gcc 1
settings suggested by
.An "Bruce Evans" Aq bde@FreeBSD.org
for developing and testing changes.
They can be used, if set, by:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}
.Ed
.It Va CPUTYPE
.Pq Vt str
Controls which processor should be targeted for generated
code.
This controls processor-specific optimizations in
certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying
the value of
.Va CFLAGS
and
.Va COPTFLAGS
to contain the appropriate optimization directive to
.Xr gcc 1 .
The automatic setting of
.Va CFLAGS
and
.Va COPTFLAGS
may be overridden using the
.Va NO_CPU_CFLAGS
and
.Va NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS
variables, respectively.
Refer to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf
for a list of recognized
.Va CPUTYPE
options.
.It Va NO_CPU_CFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Setting this variable will prevent CPU specific compiler flags
from being automatically added to
.Va CFLAGS
during compile time.
.It Va NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Setting this variable will prevent CPU specific compiler flags
from being automatically added to
.Va COPTFLAGS
during compile time.
.It Va CVS_UPDATE
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to use
.Xr cvs 1
to update your ports with
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va CXXFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Controls the compiler settings when compiling C++ code.
.Va CXXFLAGS
is initially set to the value of
.Va CFLAGS .
If you want to
add to the
.Va CXXFLAGS
value, use
.Dq Li +=
instead of
.Dq Li = .
.It Va INSTALL
.Pq Vt str
the default install command.
To install only files for which the target differs or does not exist, use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INSTALL="install -C"
.Ed
Note that some makefiles (including those in
.Pa /usr/share/mk )
may hardcode options for the supplied install command.
.It Va LOCAL_DIRS
.Pq Vt str
List any directories that should be entered when doing
make's in
.Pa /usr/src
in this variable.
.It Va MAKE_SHELL
.Pq Vt str
Controls the shell used internally by
.Xr make 1
to process the command scripts in makefiles.
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
and
.Xr csh 1
all currently supported.
.Pp
.Dl "MAKE_SHELL?=sh"
.It Va MTREE_FOLLOWS_SYMLINKS
.Pq Vt str
Set this to
.Dq Fl L
to cause
.Xr mtree 8
to follow symlinks.
.It Va NO_DOCUPDATE
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to not update the doc tree during
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va NO_PORTSUPDATE
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to not update the ports tree during
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va SUP_UPDATE
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to use
.Xr cvsup 1
to update your ports with
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va SUP
.Pq Vt str
The location of the
.Xr cvsup 1
command for
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va SUPFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
The flag for the
.Xr sup 1
command when doing
.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Op Fl g L Ar 2 .
.It Va SUPHOST
.Pq Vt str
The hostname of the sup server to use when doing
.Dq Li "make update" .
.It Va SUPFILE
.Pq Vt str
The first
.Ar supfile
to use when doing a
.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/cvsup/standard\-supfile .
.It Va SUPFILE1
.Pq Vt str
The second
.Ar supfile
to use when doing a
.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/cvsup/secure\-supfile .
.It Va SUPFILE2
.Pq Vt str
The third
.Ar supfile

.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/cvsup/secure\-supfile .
.It Va PORTSSUPFILE
.Pq Vt str
The ports
.Ar supfile
to use when doing a
.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/cvsup/ports\-supfile .
.It Va DOCSUPFILE
.Pq Vt str
The documentation
.Ar supfile
to use when doing a
.Dq Li "make update" .
This defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/cvsup/doc\-supfile .
.El
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are only used doing a kernel build:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va BOOT_COMCONSOLE_PORT
.Pq Vt str
The port address to use for the console if the boot blocks have
been configured to use a serial console instead of the keyboard/video card.
.It Va BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED
.Pq Vt int
The baud rate to use for the console if the boot blocks have
been configured to use a serial console instead of the keyboard/video card.
.It Va BOOTWAIT
.Pq Vt int
Controls the amount of time the kernel waits for a console keypress
before booting the default kernel.
The value is approximately milliseconds.
Keypresses are accepted by the BIOS before booting from disk,
making it possible to give custom boot parameters even when this is
set to 0.
.It Va COPTFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Controls the compiler settings when building the
kernel.
Optimization levels above
.Oo Fl O ( O2 , No ...\& ) Oc
are not guaranteed to work.
.It Va KERNCONF
.Pq Vt str
Controls which kernel configurations will be
built by
.Dq Li "${MAKE} buildkernel"
and installed by
.Dq Li "${MAKE} installkernel" .
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
KERNCONF=MINE DEBUG GENERIC OTHERMACHINE
.Ed
.Pp
will build the kernels specified by the config files
.Pa MINE , DEBUG , GENERIC ,
and
.Pa OTHERMACHINE ,
and install the kernel specified by the config file
.Pa MINE .
It defaults to
.Pa GENERIC .
.It Va LOADER_TFTP_SUPPORT
.Pq Vt bool
While not a buildkernel-affected option, there is no better place for this.
By default the
.Xr pxeboot 8
loader retrieves the kernel via NFS.
Defining this and recompiling
.Pa /usr/src/sys/boot
will cause it to retrieve the kernel via TFTP.
This allows
.Xr pxeboot 8
to load a custom BOOTP diskless kernel yet
still mount the server's
.Pa /
rather than load the server's kernel.
.It Va MODULES_OVERRIDE
.Pq Vt str
Set to a list of modules to build instead of all of them.
.It Va WITHOUT_MODULES
.Pq Vt str
Set to a list of modules to exclude from the build.
This provides a
somewhat easier way to exclude modules you are certain you will never
need than specifying
.Va MODULES_OVERRIDE .
This is applied
.Em after
.Va MODULES_OVERRIDE .
.It Va PORTS_MODULES
Set this to the list of ports you wish to rebuild every time the kernel
is built.
.It Va NO_KERNELCONFIG
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to skip running
.Xr config 8
during
.Dq Li "${MAKE} buildkernel" .
.It Va NO_KERNELDEPEND
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to skip running
.Dq Li "${MAKE} depend"
during
.Dq Li "${MAKE} buildkernel" .
.It Va NO_MODULES
.Pq Vt bool
Set to not build modules with the kernel.
.El
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are used during the world build:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va MAKE_IDEA
.Pq Vt bool
Set to build the IDEA encryption code.
This code is patented in the USA and many European countries.

.Pq Vt bool
Set this if you do not want to build Kerberos 5 (KTH Heimdal).
.It Va ENABLE_SUID_K5SU
.Pq Vt bool
Set this if you wish to use the ksu utility.
Otherwise, it will be
installed without the set-user-ID bit set.
.It Va ENABLE_SUID_NEWGRP
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to install
.Xr newgrp 1
with the set-user-ID bit set.
Otherwise,
.Xr newgrp 1
will not be able to change users' groups.

.Pq Vt bool
Set this to install
.Xr ssh 1
with the set-user-ID bit turned on.
