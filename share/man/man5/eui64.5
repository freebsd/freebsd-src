.Sh NAME
.Nm eui64
.Nd IEEE EUI-64 address database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
database contains information regarding known IEEE EUI-64s of hosts.
The data is stored in a file called
.Pa /etc/eui64
in the following format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Em EUI-64 host-name
.Ed
.Pp
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or
tab characters.
A
.Ql #
at the start of a line indicates the
beginning of a comment that extends to the end of the line.
Valid lines may also contain comments.
A
.Ql +
at the start of a line will cause the
.Xr eui64 3
library functions to use data stored in the
NIS
.Pa eui64.byname
and
.Pa eui64.byid
maps in addition to the data in the
.Pa /etc/eui64
file.
.Pp
An EUI-64 is expressed in
.Tn ASCII
form as
.Qq x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x
where
.Ar x
is a hexadecimal value between 0x00 and 0xFF.
The address values
should be in network order.
Hostnames specified in the
.Pa /etc/eui64
database should correspond to entries in the
.Xr hosts 5
file.
.\" .Pp
.\" The
.\" .Fn eui64_line
.\" function in the standard C library can be used to break individual
.\" lines in the
.\" .Pa /etc/eui64
.\" database into their individual components: a binary EUI-64 is
.\" stored as an
.\" .Pa eui64_addr
.\" structure, and a hostname stored as a character string.
