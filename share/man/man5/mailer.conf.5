.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mail/mailer.conf
contains a series of lines of the form
.Pp
.Ar name
.Ar program
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Pp
The first word of each line is the
.Ar name
of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 8 .
(For example, on a typical system
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail
would be a symbolic link to
.Xr mailwrapper 8 ,
as would
.Xr newaliases 1
and
.Xr mailq 1 .
Thus,
.Ar name
might be
.Dq Li sendmail
or
.Dq Li newaliases
etc.)
.Pp
The second word of each line is the name of the
.Ar program
to actually execute when the first name is invoked.
.Pp
The further
.Ar arguments ,
if any, are passed to the
.Ar program ,
followed by the arguments
.Xr mailwrapper 8
was called with.
.Pp
The file may also contain comment lines, denoted by a
.Ql #
mark in the first column of any line.

.Sh EXAMPLES
This example shows how to set up
.Nm
to invoke the traditional
.Xr sendmail 8
program:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Execute the "real" sendmail program located in
# /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
sendmail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq		/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
.Ed
.Pp
Using
.Nm Postfix
(from ports)
to replace
.Xr sendmail 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Emulate sendmail using postfix
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq		/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
.Ed
.Pp
Using
.Nm Exim
(from ports)
to replace
.Xr sendmail 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Emulate sendmail using exim
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/exim
mailq		/usr/local/sbin/exim -bp
newaliases	/usr/bin/true
rmail		/usr/local/sbin/exim -i -oee
.Ed
.Pp
Using
.Nm mini_sendmail
(from ports)
to replace
.Xr sendmail 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Send outgoing mail to a smart relay using mini_sendmail
sendmail	/usr/local/bin/mini_sendmail -srelayhost
.Ed
.Pp
Using
.Xr dma 8
to replace
.Xr sendmail 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Execute dma instead of sendmail
sendmail	/usr/libexec/dma
mailq		/usr/libexec/dma
newaliases	/usr/libexec/dma
rmail		/usr/libexec/dma
.Ed

.Sh BUGS
The entire reason this program exists is a crock.
Instead, a command
for how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the "behave
differently if invoked with a different name" behavior of things like
.Xr mailq 1
should go away.
