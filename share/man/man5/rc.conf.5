.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system configuration information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains descriptive information about the local host name, configuration
details for any potential network interfaces and which services should be
started up at system initial boot time.  In new installations, the
.Nm
file is generally initialized by the system installation utility:
.Pa /stand/sysinstall .
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform system startup actions
directly.  Instead, it is included by the
various generic startup scripts in
.Pa /etc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file is included from the file
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options
need only be specified in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
The file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
is used to override settings in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for historical reasons.
See the
.Dq rc_conf_files
option below.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable you can set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va swapfile
.Pq Vt str
If set to
.Ar NO
then no swapfile is installed, otherwise the value is used as the full
pathname to a file to use for additional swap space.
.It Va apm_enable
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Ar YES ,
enable support for Automatic Power Management with
the
.Xr apm 8
command.
.It Va apmd_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Run
.Xr apmd 8
to handle APM event from userland.
This also enable support for APM.
.It Va apmd_flags

.It Va local_startup
.Pq Vt str
List of directories to search for startup script files.
.It Va hostname
.Pq Vt str
The Fully Qualified Domain Name of your host on the network.
This should almost certainly be set to something meaningful, even if
you are not connected to a network.  If you are using
.Xr dhclient 8
to set your hostname via DHCP, this variable should be set to an empty string.
.It Va nisdomainname
.Pq Vt str
The NIS domainname of your host, or
.Ar NO
if you are not running NIS.
.It Va dhcp_program
.Pq Vt str

For the ISC DHCP client, see the
.Xr dhclient 8
page for a description of the command line options available.
.It Va firewall_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
if you do not want have firewall rules loaded at startup, or
.Ar YES
if you do.
If set to
.Ar YES ,
and the kernel was not built with IPFIREWALL, the ipfw
kernel module will be loaded.
See also
.Va ipfilter_enable .
.It Va firewall_script

.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
or the file which contains the local firewall ruleset.  Valid selections
from
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
are
.Dq open
- unrestricted IP access;
.Dq closed

.Dq client
- basic protection for a workstation;
.Dq simple
- basic protection for a LAN.  If a filename is specified, the full path
must be given.

.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar YES
to disable the display of ipfw rules on the console during boot.
.It Va firewall_logging
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar YES
to enable ipfw event logging.
This is equivalent to the IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE kernel option.
.It Va natd_program
.Pq Vt str
path to
.Xr natd 8 .
.It Va natd_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar YES

sockets must be enabled in your kernel.
.It Va natd_interface
This is the name of the public interface on which natd should run.  It
is mandatory if
.Va natd_enable
is set to
.Ar YES .
The interface may be given as an interface name or as an IP address.
.It Va natd_flags
Additional natd flags should be placed here.  The
.Fl n
or
.Fl a
flag is automatically added with the above
.Va natd_interface
as an argument.
.\" ----- ipfilter_enable seting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting this to
.Ar YES
enables
.Xr ipf 8
packet filtering.
Strictly speaking almost any filter could be established
"abusing" this setting and the fact that
.Va ipfilter_program ,
.Va ipfilter_rules
and
.Va ipfilter_flags
are concatenated to form a command,
as long as the file specified in
.Va ipfilter_rules
is readable.
When
.Va ipfilter_enable
and
.Va ipnat_enable
are set to
.Ar YES
and the file specified in
.Va ipnat_rules
is readable,
.Va ipnat_program ,
.Va ipnat_rules
and
.Va ipnat_flags
make up a command line to start a network address translation program.
When
.Va ipfilter_enable
and
.Va ipmon_enable
are set to
.Ar YES ,
.Va ipmon_program
and
.Va ipmon_flags
form another command line for monitoring the above actions.
See
.Pa /etc/rc.network
for details.
.Pp
Typical usage will require putting
.Bd -literal
ipfilter_enable="YES"
ipfilter_flags=""
ipnat_enable="YES"
ipmon_enable="YES"

.Ed
into
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
and editing
.Pa /etc/ipf.rules
and
.Pa /etc/ipnat.rules
appropriately.
Turning off
.Va firewall_enable
when using ipf is recommended.
Having
.Bd -literal
options  IPFILTER
options  IPFILTER_LOG
options  IPFILTER_DEFAULT_BLOCK

.Ed
in the kernel configuration file is a good idea, too.
.\" ----- ipfilter_program setting ------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_program
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar /sbin/ipf -Fa -f
by default.
This variable contains a command line
up to (but not including) the filter rule definition
(expected to live in a separate file).
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipfilter_rules setting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_rules
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar /etc/ipf.rules
by default.
This variable contains the name of the filter rule definition file.
The file is expected to be readable for the filter command to execute.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipfilter_flags setting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_flags
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar -E
by default.
This variable contains flags appended to the filter command
after the rule definition filename.
The default setting will initialize an on demand loaded ipf module.
When compiling ipfilter directly into your kernel (as is recommended)
the variable should be empty to not initialize
the code more than once.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipnat_enable setting ----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Set it to
.Ar YES
to enable
.Xr ipnat 8
network address translation.
Setting this variable needs setting
.Va ipfilter_enable ,
too.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipnat_program setting ---------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_program
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar /sbin/ipnat -CF -f
by default.
This variable contains a command line
up to (but not including) the translation rule definition
(expected to live in a separate file).
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipnat_rules setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_rules
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar /etc/ipnat.rules
by default.
This variable contains the name of the file
holding the network address translation definition.
This file is expected to be readable for the NAT command to execute.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipnat_flags setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_flags
.Pq Vt str
Empty by default.
This variable contains additional flags
appended to the ipnat command line
after the rule definition filename.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipmon_enable setting ----------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Set it to
.Ar YES
to enable
.Xr ipmon 8
monitoring (logging
.Xr ipf 8
and
.Xr ipnat 8
events).
Setting this variable needs setting
.Va ipfilter_enable ,
too.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipmon_program setting ---------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_program
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar /sbin/ipmon
by default.
This variable contains the
.Xr ipmon 8
executable filename.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- ipmon_flags setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_flags
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Ar -Ds
by default.
This variable contains flags passed to the
.Xr ipmon 8
program.
Another typical example would be
.Ar -D /var/log/ipflog
to have
.Xr ipmon 8
log directly to a file bypassing
.Xr syslogd 8 .
Make sure to adjust
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
in such case like this:
.Bd -literal
/var/log/ipflog  640  10  100  *  Z  /var/run/ipmon.pid

.Ed
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailled discussion.
.\" ----- end of added ipf hook ---------------------------------
.It Va tcp_extensions
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting this to YES enables certain TCP options as described by
.Rs
.%T RFC 1323
.Re
If you have problems with connections
randomly hanging or other weird behavior of such nature, you might
try setting this back to
.Ar NO
and seeing if that helps.  Some hardware/software out there is known
to be broken with respect to these options.
.It Va log_in_vain
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will enable logging of connection attempts to ports that
have no listening socket on them.
.It Va tcp_keepalive
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar YES
by default.
Setting to NO will disable probing idle TCP connections to verify that the
peer is still up and reachable.
.It Va tcp_drop_synfin
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to ignore TCP frames that have both
the SYN and FIN flags set.
This prevents OS fingerprinting, but may
break some legitimate applications.
This option is only available if the
kernel was built with the TCP_DROP_SYNFIN option.
.It Va icmp_drop_redirect
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to ignore ICMP REDIRECT packets.
.It Va icmp_log_redirect
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to log ICMP REDIRECT packets.
Note that
the log messages are not rate-limited, so this option should only be used
for troubleshooting your own network.
.It Va network_interfaces
.Pq Vt str
Set to the list of network interfaces to configure on this host.
For example, if you had a loopback device (standard) and an SMC Elite
Ultra NIC, you might have this set to
.Qq Ar "lo0 ed0"
for the two interfaces.  An
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable is also assumed to exist for each value of
.Em interface .
It is also possible to add IP alias entries here in cases where you
want a single interface to have multiple IP addresses registered against
it.
Assuming that the interface in question was ed0, it might look
something like this:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
And so on.  For each ifconfig_<interface>_alias<n> entry that is
found, its contents are passed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Execution stops at the first unsuccessful access, so if you
had something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.251 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.252 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias2="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias4="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
Then note that alias4 would
.Em not
be added since the search would
stop with the missing alias3 entry.
.Pp
You can bring up an interface with DHCP by setting the
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable to
.Dq DHCP .
For instance, to initialize your ed0 device via DHCP,
you might have something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0="DHCP"
.Ed
.It Va ppp_enable
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Ar YES ,
run the
.Xr ppp 8
daemon.
