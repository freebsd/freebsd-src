.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system configuration information.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains descriptive information about the local host name, configuration
details for any potential network interfaces and which services should be
started up at system initial boot time.  In new installations, the
.Nm
file is generally initialized by the system installation utility:
.Pa /stand/sysinstall .
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform system startup actions
directly.  Instead, it is included by the
various generic startup scripts in
.Pa /etc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file is included from the file
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options
need only be specified in 
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
The file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
is used to override settings in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for historical reasons.
See the
.Dq rc_conf_files
option below.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable you can set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar swapfile
(str) If set to
.Ar NO
then no swapfile is installed, otherwise the value is used as the full
pathname to a file to use for additional swap space.

.Xr pccardd 8
daemon.
.It Ar local_startup
(str) List of directories to search for startup script files.
.It Ar hostname
(str) The Fully Qualified Domain Name of your host on the network.
This should almost certainly be set to something meaningful, even if
you are not connected to a network.  If you are using
.Xr dhclient 8
to set your hostname via DHCP, this variable should be set to an empty string.
.It Ar nisdomainname
(str) The NIS domainname of your host, or
.Ar NO
if you are not running NIS.

.Xr dhclient 8
page for a description of the command line options available.
.It Ar firewall_enable
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
if you do not want have firewall rules loaded at startup, or 
.Ar YES 
if you do.
If set to
.Ar YES ,
and the kernel was not built with IPFIREWALL, the ipfw
kernel module will be loaded.
.It Ar firewall_script
(str) If you want to run a firewall script other than
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
set this variable to the full path to that script.
.It Ar firewall_type
(str) Names the firewall type from the selection in 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
or the file which contains the local firewall ruleset.  Valid selections
from 
.Pa /etc/rc.firewall ,
are 
.Dq open
- unrestricted IP access;
.Dq closed
- all IP services disabled, except via lo0;

- basic protection for a LAN.  If a filename is specified, the full path 
must be given.
.It Ar firewall_quiet
(bool) Set to 
.Ar YES
to disable the display of ipfw rules on the console during boot.
.It Ar firewall_logging
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
to enable ipfw event logging.

(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
to enable natd.
.Ar Firewall_enable
must also be set to

sockets must be enabled in your kernel.
.It Ar natd_interface
This is the name of the public interface on which natd should run.  It
is mandatory if
.Ar natd_enable
is set to
.Ar YES .
The interface may be given as an interface name or as an IP address.
.It Ar natd_flags
Additional natd flags should be placed here.  The
.Fl n
or
.Fl a
flag is automatically added with the above
.Ar natd_interface
as an argument.
.It Ar tcp_extensions
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting this to YES enables certain TCP options as described by
.Rs
.%T RFC 1323
.Re
If you have problems with connections
randomly hanging or other weird behavior of such nature, you might
try setting this back to
.Ar NO
and seeing if that helps.  Some hardware/software out there is known
to be broken with respect to these options.
.It Ar log_in_vain
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will enable logging of connection attempts to ports that
have no listening socket on them.
.It Ar tcp_keepalive
(bool) Set to
.Ar YES
by default.
Setting to NO will disable probing idle TCP connections to verify that the
peer is still up and reachable.
.It Ar tcp_drop_synfin
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to ignore TCP frames that have both
the SYN and FIN flags set.
This prevents OS fingerprinting, but may
break some legitimate applications.
This option is only available if the
kernel was built with the TCP_DROP_SYNFIN option.
.It Ar tcp_restrict_rst
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to refrain from emitting TCP RST frames
in response to invalid TCP packets (e.g. frames destined for closed ports).
This option is only available if the kernel was built with the
TCP_RESTRICT_RST option.
.It Ar icmp_drop_redirect
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to ignore ICMP REDIRECT packets.
.It Ar icmp_log_redirect
(bool) Set to
.Ar NO
by default.
Setting to YES will cause the kernel to log ICMP REDIRECT packets.
Note that
the log messages are not rate-limited, so this option should only be used
for troubleshooting your own network.
.It Ar network_interfaces
(str) Set to the list of network interfaces to configure on this host.
For example, if you had a loopback device (standard) and an SMC Elite
Ultra NIC, you might have this set to
.Qq Ar "lo0 ed0"
for the two interfaces.  An 
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable is also assumed to exist for each value of 
.Em interface .
It is also possible to add IP alias entries here in cases where you
want a single interface to have multiple IP addresses registered against
it.
Assuming that the interface in question was ed0, it might look
something like this:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff" 
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
And so on.  For each ifconfig_<interface>_alias<n> entry that is
found, its contents are passed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Execution stops at the first unsuccessful access, so if you
had something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.251 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.252 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias2="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias4="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"

.Ed
Then note that alias4 would 
.Em not
be added since the search would
stop with the missing alias3 entry.
.Pp
You can bring up an interface with DHCP by setting the
.No ifconfig_ Ns Em interface
variable to
.Dq DHCP .
For instance, to initialize your ed0 device via DHCP,
you might have something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0="DHCP"
.Ed

.It Ar moused_enable
(str) If set to
.Ar YES ,
the
.Xr moused 8
daemon is started for doing cut/paste selection on the console.
.It Ar moused_type
(str) This is the protocol type of mouse you would like to use.
This variable must be set if 
.Ar moused_enable
is set to
.Ar YES .
The
.Xr moused 8
daemon
is able to detect the appropriate mouse type automatically in many cases.
You can set this variable to 
.Ar auto
to let the daemon detect it, or
select one from the following list if the automatic detection fails.
.Pp
If your mouse is attached to the PS/2 mouse port, you should
always choose
.Ar auto
or
.Ar ps/2 ,
regardless of the brand and model of the mouse.  Likewise, if your
mouse is attached to the bus mouse port, choose
.Ar auto
or
.Ar busmouse .
All other protocols are for serial mice and will not work with 
the PS/2 and bus mice.
If you have a USB mouse,
.Ar auto
is the only protocol type which works with the USB mouse.

Even if your mouse is not in the above list, it may be compatible
with one in the list.
Refer to the man page for
.Xr moused 8
for compatibility information.
.Pp
It should also be noted that while this is enabled, any
other client of the mouse (such as an X server) should access
the mouse through the virtual mouse device:
.Pa /dev/sysmouse
and configure it as a sysmouse type mouse, since all
mouse data is converted to this single canonical format when
using
.Xr moused 8 .
If the client program does not support the sysmouse type, 
specify the mousesystems type.
It is the second prefered type.
.It Ar moused_port
(str) If
.Ar moused_enable
is set to
.Ar YES ,
this is the actual port the mouse is on.
