.Dt RC.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system configuration information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains descriptive information about the local host name, configuration
details for any potential network interfaces and which services should be
started up at system initial boot time.
In new installations, the
.Nm
file is generally initialized by the system installation utility,
.Xr sysinstall 8 .
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform system startup actions
directly.
Instead, it is included by the
various generic startup scripts in
.Pa /etc
which conditionalize their
internal actions according to the settings found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file is included from the file
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options need only be specified in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
The file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
is used to override settings in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for historical reasons.
See the
.Va rc_conf_files
variable below.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable that can be set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag -width indent-two

.Va pccard_enable
is set to
.Dq Li YES ,
these are the flags to pass to the
.Xr pccardd 8
daemon.
.It Va pccard_ether_delay
.Pq Vt str
Set the delay before starting
.Xr dhclient 8

The default is a space.
It is not necessary to change this unless there are startup scripts with names
containing spaces.
.It Va hostname
.Pq Vt str
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of this host on the network.
This should almost certainly be set to something meaningful, even if
there is no network connection.
If
.Xr dhclient 8
is used to set the hostname via DHCP,
this variable should be set to an empty string.

Flags passed to
.Xr ipfw 8
if
.Va firewall_type
specifies a filename.
.It Va natd_program
.Pq Vt str
Path to
.Xr natd 8 .
.It Va natd_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li YES
to enable
.Xr natd 8 .

and
.Xr divert 4
sockets must be enabled in the kernel.
.It Va natd_interface
.Pq Vt str
This is the name of the public interface on which
.Xr natd 8
should run.
The interface may be given as an interface name or as an IP address.
.It Va natd_flags
.Pq Vt str
Additional
.Xr natd 8
flags should be placed here.
The
.Fl n
or
.Fl a
flag is automatically added with the above
.Va natd_interface
as an argument.
.\" ----- ipfilter_enable setting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Setting this to
.Dq Li YES
enables
.Xr ipf 8
packet filtering.
.Pp
Typical usage will require putting
.Bd -literal
ipfilter_enable="YES"
ipnat_enable="YES"
ipmon_enable="YES"
ipfs_enable="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
into
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
and editing
.Pa /etc/ipf.rules
and
.Pa /etc/ipnat.rules
appropriately.
.Pp
Note that
.Va ipfilter_enable
and
.Va ipnat_enable
can be enabled independently.
.Va ipmon_enable
and
.Va ipfs_enable
both require at least one of
.Va ipfilter_enable
and
.Va ipnat_enable
to be enabled.
.Pp
Having
.Bd -literal
options IPFILTER
options IPFILTER_LOG
options IPFILTER_DEFAULT_BLOCK
.Ed
.Pp
in the kernel configuration file is a good idea, too.
.\" ----- ipfilter_program setting ------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_program
.Pq Vt str
Path to
.Xr ipf 8
(default
.Pa /sbin/ipf ) .
.\" ----- ipfilter_rules setting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_rules
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Pa /etc/ipf.rules
by default.
This variable contains the name of the filter rule definition file.
The file is expected to be readable for the
.Xr ipf 8
command to execute.
.\" ----- ipfilter_flags setting --------------------------------
.It Va ipfilter_flags
.Pq Vt str
Empty by default.
This variable contains flags passed to the
.Xr ipf 8
program.
.\" ----- ipnat_enable setting ----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Set it to
.Dq Li YES
to enable
.Xr ipnat 1
network address translation.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailed discussion.
.\" ----- ipnat_program setting ---------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_program
.Pq Vt str
Path to
.Xr ipnat 1
(default
.Pa /sbin/ipnat ) .
.\" ----- ipnat_rules setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_rules
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Pa /etc/ipnat.rules
by default.
This variable contains the name of the file
holding the network address translation definition.
This file is expected to be readable for the
.Xr ipnat 1
command to execute.
.\" ----- ipnat_flags setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipnat_flags
.Pq Vt str
Empty by default.
This variable contains flags passed to the
.Xr ipnat 1
program.
.\" ----- ipmon_enable setting ----------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Set it to
.Dq Li YES
to enable
.Xr ipmon 8
monitoring (logging
.Xr ipf 8
and
.Xr ipnat 1
events).
Setting this variable needs setting
.Va ipfilter_enable
or
.Va ipnat_enable
too.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailed discussion.
.\" ----- ipmon_program setting ---------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_program
.Pq Vt str
Path to
.Xr ipmon 8
(default
.Pa /sbin/ipmon ) .
.\" ----- ipmon_flags setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipmon_flags
.Pq Vt str
Set to
.Dq Li -Ds
by default.
This variable contains flags passed to the
.Xr ipmon 8
program.
Another typical example would be
.Dq Fl D Pa /var/log/ipflog
to have
.Xr ipmon 8
log directly to a file bypassing
.Xr syslogd 8 .
Make sure to adjust
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
in such case like this:
.Bd -literal
/var/log/ipflog  640  10  100  *  Z  /var/run/ipmon.pid
.Ed
.\" ----- ipfs_enable setting -----------------------------------
.It Va ipfs_enable
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Set it to
.Dq Li YES
to enable
.Xr ipfs 8
saving the filter and NAT state tables during shutdown
and reloading them during startup again.
Setting this variable needs setting
.Va ipfilter_enable
or
.Va ipnat_enable
to
.Dq Li YES
too.
See
.Va ipfilter_enable
for a detailed discussion.
Note that if
.Va kern_securelevel
is set to 3,
.Va ipfs_enable
cannot be used
because the raised securelevel will prevent
.Xr ipfs 8
from saving the state tables at shutdown time.
.\" ----- ipfs_program setting ----------------------------------

.Pq Vt str
Empty by default.
This variable contains flags passed to the
.Xr ipfs 8
program.
.\" ----- end of added ipf hook ---------------------------------
.It Va tcp_extensions
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li YES
by default.
Setting this to
.Dq Li NO
disables certain TCP options as described by
.Rs
.%T "RFC 1323"
.Re
Setting this to
.Dq Li NO
might help remedy such problems with connections as randomly hanging
or other weird behavior.
Some network devices are known
to be broken with respect to these options.
.It Va log_in_vain
.Pq Vt int
Set to 0 by default.
The
.Xr sysctl 8
variables,
.Va net.inet.tcp.log_in_vain
and
.Va net.inet.udp.log_in_vain ,
as described in
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr udp 4 ,
are set to the given value.
.It Va tcp_keepalive
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li YES
by default.
Setting to
.Dq Li NO
will disable probing idle TCP connections to verify that the
peer is still up and reachable.
.It Va tcp_drop_synfin
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Setting to
.Dq Li YES
will cause the kernel to ignore TCP frames that have both
the SYN and FIN flags set.
This prevents OS fingerprinting, but may
break some legitimate applications.
This option is only available if the
kernel was built with the
.Dv TCP_DROP_SYNFIN
option.
.It Va icmp_drop_redirect
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Setting to
.Dq Li YES
will cause the kernel to ignore ICMP REDIRECT packets.
.It Va icmp_log_redirect
.Pq Vt bool
Set to
.Dq Li NO
by default.
Setting to
.Dq Li YES
will cause the kernel to log ICMP REDIRECT packets.
Note that
the log messages are not rate-limited, so this option should only be used
for troubleshooting networks.
.It Va network_interfaces
.Pq Vt str
Set to the list of network interfaces to configure on this host.
For example, if the only network devices in the system are the loopback
device
.Pq Li lo0
and a NIC using the
.Xr ed 4
driver,
this could be set to
.Dq Li "lo0 ed0" .
An
.Va ifconfig_ Ns Aq Ar interface
variable is also assumed to exist for each value of
.Ar interface .
It is also possible to add IP alias entries here in cases where
multiple IP addresses registered against a single interface
are desired.
Assuming that the interface in question was
.Li ed0 ,
it might look
something like this:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"
.Ed
.Pp
And so on.
For each
.Va ifconfig_ Ns Ao Ar interface Ac Ns Va _alias Ns Aq Ar n
entry that is found,
its contents are passed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Execution stops at the first unsuccessful access, so if
something like this is present:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.251 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias1="inet 127.0.0.252 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias2="inet 127.0.0.253 netmask 0xffffffff"
ifconfig_ed0_alias4="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff"
.Ed
.Pp
Then note that alias4 would
.Em not
be added since the search would
stop with the missing alias3 entry.
.Pp
It is possible to bring up an interface with DHCP by setting the
.Va ifconfig_ Ns Aq Ar interface
variable to
.Dq Li DHCP .
For instance, to initialize the
.Li ed0
device via DHCP,
it is possible to use something like:
.Bd -literal
ifconfig_ed0="DHCP"
.Ed
.It Va cloned_interfaces
.Pq Vt str
Set to the list of clonable network interfaces to create on this host.
Entries in
.Va cloned_interfaces
are automatically appended to
.Va network_interfaces
for configuration.
.It Va gif_interfaces
.Pq Vt str
Set to the list of
.Xr gif 4
tunnel interfaces to configure on this host.
A
.Va gifconfig_ Ns Aq Ar interface
variable is assumed to exist for each value of
.Ar interface .
The value of this variable is used to configure the link layer of the
tunnel according to the syntax of the
.Cm tunnel
option to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Additionally, this option ensures that each listed interface is created
via the
.Cm create
option to
.Xr ifconfig 8
before attempting to configure it.
.It Va ppp_enable
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
run the
.Xr ppp 8

The name of the profile to use from
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.conf .
.It Va ppp_user
.Pq Vt str
The name of the user under which
.Xr ppp 8
should be started.
By
default,
.Xr ppp 8
is started as
.Dq Li root .
.It Va rc_conf_files
.Pq Vt str
This option is used to specify a list of files that will override
the settings in
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf .
The files will be read in the order in which they are specified and should
include the full path to the file.
By default, the files specified are
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
and
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
.It Va fsck_y_enable
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
.Xr fsck 8
will be run with the
.Fl y
flag if the initial preen
of the filesystems fails.
.It Va background_fsck
.Pq Vt bool
If set to
.Dq Li YES ,
the system will attempt to run
.Xr fsck 8
in the background where possible.
.It Va extra_netfs_types
.Pq Vt str
If set to something other than
.Dq Li NO
(the default),
this variable extends the list of filesystem types
for which automatic mounting at startup by
.Xr rc 8
should be delayed until the network is initialized.
It should contain
a whitespace-separated list of network filesystem descriptor pairs,
each consisting of a filesystem type as passed to
.Xr mount 8
and a human-readable, one-word description,
joined with a colon
.Pq Ql \&: .
Extending the default list in this way is only necessary
when third party filesystem types are used.
