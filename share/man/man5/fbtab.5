The

file contains a number of lines specifying a device together with a list
of devices with associated protections.
Comments start with a
.Ql #
and extend to the end of the line.
.Pp
Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.
.Pp
All other lines consist of three fields delimited by
whitespace: a login device
.Pq Pa /dev/ttyv0 ,
an octal permission number (0600), and a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
delimited list of device patterns
.Pq Pa /dev/console , /dev/dsp* .
All device patterns are absolute paths.

If the tty argument (relative path) matches a login device
name (absolute path), the permissions of the devices in the
colon-delimited list are set as specified in the second
field, and their ownership is changed to that of the UID
and GID arguments.
