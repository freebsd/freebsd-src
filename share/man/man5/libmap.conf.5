.Dt LIBMAP.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libmap.conf
.Nd "configuration file for dynamic object dependency mapping"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libmap
functionality of
.Xr ld-elf.so.1 1
allows dynamic object dependencies to be mapped to arbitrary names.
.Pp
Each line in
.Pa /etc/libmap.conf
can have one of five forms:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar origin Ar target
Whenever a dependency on
.Ar origin
is encountered while loading a dynamic object, use
.Ar target
instead of searching for
.Ar origin
in the normal library search paths.
.It Ar path1 Ar path2
When iterating through a library search path, replace any element that
matches
.Ar path1
exactly with
.Ar path2 .
.It Bq Ar constraint
Apply
.Ar constraint
to all subsequent mappings until the next constraint line or the end
of the file.
See the
.Sx Constraints
section for details.
.It Cm include Ar file
Parse the contents of
.Ar file
before continuing with the current file.
Nesting depth is limited only by available memory, but each file
encountered is processed only once, and loops are silently ignored.
.It Cm includedir Ar dir
Recurse through
.Ar dir
and parse the contents of any file that ends in
.Pa .conf
before continuing with the current file.
Nesting depth is limited only by available memory, but each directory
or file encountered is processed only once, and loops are silently
ignored.
.El
.Ss Constraints
Constrained mappings only apply when processing binaries or libraries
that satisfy the constraint.
There are three types of constraints:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Exact
The constraint is matched literally so that only an executable with an
identical fully qualified pathname will satisfy the constraint.
This means that the executable
.Pa /usr/bin/foo
will not satisfy the constraint
.Bq Pa /usr/bin/./foo ,
and vice-versa.
This is the default constraint type.
.It Basename
A constraint with no path is matched against the basename of the
executable.
For instance, the constraint
.Bq Pa foo
will match
.Pa /bin/foo ,
.Pa /usr/local/sbin/foo ,
or any other executable named
.Pa foo ,
no matter what directory it is in.
.It Directory
A constraint with a trailing slash is satisfied if the full pathname
begins with the constraint string.
For instance, the constraint
.Bq Pa /usr/bin/
will match any executable with a path starting with
.Pa /usr/bin/ .
.El
.Pp
Note that the constraints are matched against the path that was passed
as the first argument to whichever
.Xr exec 3
function was used to execute the binary in question.
Most programs executed from a shell are run without a full path, via
.Xr execvp 3
or similar, so the basename constraint type is the most useful.
.Pp
.Bf -symbolic
WARNING!
Constraints apply to all mappings until the next constraint or the end
of the file.
Hence, unconstrained mappings must be placed at the top of the file.
.Ef
.Ss ABI compatibility
On 64-bit architectures that provide 32-bit binary compatibility, the
mappings in
.Pa /etc/libmap.conf
apply only to 64-bit binaries.
Mappings for 32-bit binaries must be placed in
.Pa /etc/libmap32.conf .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/libmap32.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/libmap.conf
The libmap configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/libmap32.conf
The libmap configuration file for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit system.
