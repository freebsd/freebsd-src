.Dt TMPFS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tmpfs
.Nd "efficient memory file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "options TMPFS"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tmpfs_load="YES"
.Ed

To load as a kernel loadable module:
.Pp
.Dl "kldload tmpfs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver will permit the
.Fx
kernel to access
.Tn tmpfs
file systems.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a
.Nm
memory file system:
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nmount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
kernel implementation was written by
.An Julio M. Merino Vidal Aq jmmv@NetBSD.org
as a Google SoC project.
.Pp
.An Rohit Jalan
and others ported it from
.Nx
to
.Fx .

This manual page was written by
.An Xin LI Aq delphij@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
kernel implementation is currently considered as
an experimental feature.
Some file system mount
time options are not well supported.
