.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to general commands (tools and utilities)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Section one of the manual contains most of the commands
which comprise the

user environment.
Some of the commands included with the system in section one are
text editors, command shell interpreters,
searching and sorting tools,
file manipulation commands,
system status commands,
remote file copy commands, mail commands,
compilers and compiler tools,
formatted output tools,
and line printer commands.
.Pp
Tens of thousands of additional commands are available to be installed
with
.Xr pkg 8 ,
or compiled with the
.Xr ports 7
collection.
Some of which include web browsers, office suites, calendars,
conferencing utilities, integrated development environments,
media players, audio and video processing suites, etc.
.Pp
All commands set a status value upon exit which may be tested
to see if the command completed normally.
Traditionally, the value 0 signifies successful
completion of the command, while a value >0 indicates an error.
Some commands attempt to describe the nature of the failure by using
exit codes as defined in
.Xr sysexits 3 ,
while others simply set the status to an arbitrary value >0
.Pq typically 1 .
