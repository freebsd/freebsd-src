.Nd The C programming language
.Sh DESCRIPTION
C is a general purpose programming language, which has a strong connection
with the UNIX operating system and its derivatives, since the vast
majority of those systems were written in the C language.
The C language contains some basic ideas from the BCPL language through
the B language written by Ken Thompson in 1970 for the DEC PDP-7 machines.
The development of the UNIX operating system was started on a PDP-7
machine in assembly language, but it made very difficult to port the existing
code to other systems.
.Pp
In 1972 Dennis M. Ritchie worked out the C programming language for
further development of the UNIX operating system.
The idea was to implement only the C compiler for different
platforms, and implement most part of the operating system
in the new programming language to simplify the portability between
different architectures.
It follows that C is very eligible for (but not limited to) writing
operating systems and low-level applications.
.Pp
The C language did not have a specification or standardized version for
a long time.
It went through a lot of changes and improvements for ages.
In 1978, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie published the
first book about C under the title "The C Programming Language".
We can think of this book as the first specification of the language.
This version is often referred as K&R C after the names of the authors.
Sometimes it is referred as C78, as well, after the publishing year of
the first edition of the book.
.Pp
It is important to notice, that the instruction set of the language is
limited to the most fundamental elements for simplicity.
Handling of the standard I/O and such common functions are implemented in
the libraries shipped with the compiler.
As these functions are also widely used, it was demanded to include into
the description what requisites the library should conform to, not just
strictly the language itself.
Accordingly, the aforementioned standards cover the library elements, as well.
The elements of this standard library is still not enough for more
complicated tasks.
In this case the provided system calls of the given operating system can be
used.
To not lose the portability by using these system calls, the POSIX
(Portable Operating System Interface) standard evolved.
It describes what functions should be available to keep portability.
Note, that POSIX is not a C standard, but an operating system standard
and thus is beyond the scope of this manual.
The standards discussed below are all C standards and only cover
the C programming language and the accompanying library.
All listed improvements for each standard edition are taken from the official
standard drafts.
For further details, check the publicly available drafts or
purchase the published standards \(em from either ISO or IEC resources.
.Pp
After the publication of the book mentioned before,
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) started to work on
standardizing the language, and they announced ANSI X3.159-1989
in 1989.
It is usually referred to as ANSI C or C89.
The main difference in this standard were the function prototypes,
which is a new way of declaring functions.
With the old-style function declarations, the compiler was unable to
check the sanity of the actual parameters at a function call.
The old syntax was highly error-prone because incompatible parameters
were hard to detect in the program code and the problem only showed up
at run-time.
.Pp
In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted
the ANSI standard as ISO/IEC 9899:1990 in 1990.
This is also referred to as ISO C or C90.
It only contains negligible minor modifications against ANSI C,
so the two standards often considered to be fully equivalent.
This was a very important milestone in the history of the C language, but the
development of the language did not stop.
.Pp
The ISO C standard was later extended with an amendment as
ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1 in 1995.
This contained, for example, the wide-character support in <wchar.h> and
<wctype.h>, and also restricted character set support via diagraphs and
<iso646.h>.
This amendment is usually referred to as C95.
Two technical corrigenda were also published: Technical Corrigendum 1 as
ISO/IEC 9899/COR1 in 1994 and Technical Corrigendum 2 as ISO/IEC 9899/COR2
in 1996.
The continuous development and growth made it necessary to work out a new
standard, which contains the new features and fixes the known defects and
deficiencies of the language.
As a result, ISO/IEC 9899:1999 was born in 1999 as the second edition of the
standard.
Similarly to the other standards, this is informally named after the
publication year as C99.
The improvements include (but are not limited to) the following:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
digraphs, trigraphs, and alternative spellings for the operators that
use non-ISO646 characters in <iso646.h>
.It
extended multibyte and wide character library support in <wchar.h> and
<wctype.h>
.It
variable length arrays
.It
flexible array members
.It
complex (and imaginary) number arithmetic support in <complex.h>
.It
type-generic math macros in <tgmath.h>
.It
the long long int type and library functions
.It
remove implicit int type
.It
universal character names (\eu and \eU)
.It
compound literals
.It
remove implicit function declaration
.It
BCPL style single-line comments
.It
allow mixed declarations and code
.It
the vscanf family of functions in <stdio.h> and <wchar.h>
.It
allow trailing comma in enum declaration
.It
inline functions
.It
the snprintf family of functions in <stdio.h>
.It
boolean type and macros in <stdbool.h>
.It
empty macro arguments
.It
_Pragma preprocessing operator
.It
__func__ predefined identifier
.It
va_copy macro in <stdarg.h>
.It
additional strftime conversion specifiers
.El
.Pp
Later in 2011, the third edition of the standard, ISO/IEC 1989:2011,
commonly referred to as C11 (formerly C1x), came out and replaced the
second edition by ISO/IEC 9899:1999/COR1:2001, ISO/IEC 9899:1999/COR2:2004,
and ISO/IEC 9899:1999/COR3:2007.
The improvements include (but are not limited to) the following:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
support for multiple threads of execution and atomic operations in <threads.h>
and <stdatomic.h>
.It
additional floating-point characteristic macros in <float.h>
.It
querying and specifying alignment of objects in <stdalign.h> and <stdlib.h>
.It
Unicode character types and functions in <uchar.h>
.It
type-generic expressions
.It
static assertions in <assert.h>
.It
anonymous structures and unions
.It
remove the gets function from <stdio.h>
.It
add the aligned_alloc, at_quick_exit, and quick_exit functions in <stdlib.h>
.El
.Pp
C11 was later superseded by ISO/IEC 9899:2018, also known as C17 which was
prepared in 2017 and published in June 2018 as the fourth edition.
It incorporates the Technical Corrigendum 1 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011/COR1:2012)
which was published in 2012.
It addressed defects and deficiencies in C11 without introducing new features,
only corrections and clarifications.
Since there were no major changes in C17, the current standard for
Programming Language C, is still considered C11 \(em ISO/IEC 9899:2011, published
2011-12-08.
.Pp
The next standard, the fifth, is currently referred to as C2x and is scheduled
to be adopted by the end of 2021, with a publication date of 2022.
When published, it will cancel and replace the fourth edition, ISO/IEC
9899:2018.
.Pp
Some useful features have been provided as extensions by some compilers, but
they cannot be considered as standard features.
.Pp
ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14 committee is responsible for the ISO/IEC 9899,
C Standard.
