.Dt DEVELOPMENT 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm development
.Nd introduction to
.Fx
development process
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
development is split into three major subprojects: doc, ports, and src.
Doc is the documentation, such as the
.Fx
Handbook.
To read more, see:
.Pp
.Lk https://docs.FreeBSD.org/en/books/fdp-primer/
.Pp
Ports, described further in
.Xr ports 7 ,
are the way to build, package, and install third party software.
To read more, see:
.Pp
.Lk https://docs.FreeBSD.org/en/books/porters-handbook/
.Pp
The last one, src, revolves around the source code for the base system,
consisting of the kernel, and the libraries and utilities commonly called
the world.
.Pp
The Committer's Guide, describing topics relevant to all committers,
can be found at:
.Pp
.Lk https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/committers-guide/
.Pp
.Fx
src development takes place in the project-hosted
Git repository, located at:
.Pp
.Lk https://git.FreeBSD.org/src.git
.Pp
The push URL is:
.Pp
.Lk ssh://git@gitrepo.FreeBSD.org/src.git
.Pp
There is also a list of public, read-only Git mirrors at:
.Pp
.Lk https://docs.FreeBSD.org/en/books/handbook/mirrors/#external-mirrors
.Pp
The
.Ql main
Git branch represents CURRENT;
all changes are first committed to CURRENT and then usually cherry-picked
back to STABLE, which refers to Git branches such as
.Ql stable/13 .
Every few years a new STABLE is branched from CURRENT,
with an incremented major version number.
Releases are then branched off STABLE and numbered with consecutive minor
numbers.
.Pp
The layout of the source tree is described in its
.Pa README.md
file.
Build instructions can be found in
.Xr build 7
and
.Xr release 7 .
Kernel programming interfaces (KPIs) are documented in section 9
manual pages; use
.Ql "apropos -s 9 ."
for a list.
Regression test suite is described in
.Xr tests 7 .
For coding conventions, see
.Xr style 9 .
.Pp
To ask questions regarding development, use the mailing lists,
such as freebsd-arch@ and freebsd-hackers@:
.Pp
.Lk https://lists.FreeBSD.org
.Pp
To get your patches integrated into the main
.Fx
repository use Phabricator;
it is a code review tool that allows other developers to review the changes,
suggest improvements, and, eventually, allows them to pick up the change and
commit it:
.Pp
.Lk https://reviews.FreeBSD.org
.Pp
To check the latest
.Fx
build and test status of CURRENT and STABLE branches,
the continuous integration system is at:
.Pp
.Lk https://ci.FreeBSD.org
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Check out the CURRENT branch, build it, and install, overwriting the current
system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/src.git src
cd src
make -sj8 buildworld buildkernel installkernel
shutdown -r now
.Ed
.Pp
After reboot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src
make -j8 installworld
reboot
.Ed
.Pp
Rebuild and reinstall a single piece of userspace, in this
case
.Xr ls 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src/bin/ls
make clean all install
.Ed
.Pp
Quickly rebuild and reinstall the kernel, only recompiling the files
changed since last build; note that this will only work if the full kernel
build has been completed in the past, not on a fresh source tree:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src
make -sj8 kernel KERNFAST=1
.Ed
.Pp
To rebuild parts of
.Fx
for another CPU architecture,
first prepare your source tree by building the cross-toolchain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src
make -sj8 toolchain TARGET_ARCH=aarch64
.Ed
.Pp
Afterwards, to build and install a single piece of userspace, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src/bin/ls
make buildenv TARGET_ARCH=aarch64
make clean all install DESTDIR=/clients/arm
.Ed
.Pp
Likewise, to quickly rebuild and reinstall the kernel, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd src
make buildenv TARGET_ARCH=aarch64
make -sj8 kernel KERNFAST=1 DESTDIR=/clients/arm

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page was originally written by
.An Matthew Dillon Aq Mt dillon@FreeBSD.org
and first appeared
in
.Fx 5.0 ,
December 2002.
It was since extensively modified by
.An Eitan Adler Aq Mt eadler@FreeBSD.org
to reflect the repository conversion from
.Lk https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ CVS
to
.Lk https://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion .
It was rewritten from scratch by
.An Edward Tomasz Napierala Aq Mt trasz@FreeBSD.org
for
.Fx 12.0 .
