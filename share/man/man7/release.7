.Dt RELEASE 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm release
.Nd "release building infrastructure"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
provides a complete build environment suitable for users to make
full releases of the
.Fx
operating system.
All of the tools necessary to build a release are available from the
.Fx
source code repository in
.Pa src/release .
A complete release can be built with only a single command,
including the creation of ISO images suitable for burning to CD-ROM,
memory stick images, and a network install directory.
This command is aptly named
.Dq Li "make release" .
.Pp
For some users, it may be desirable to provide an absolutely clean
build environment, with no local modifications to the source tree or to
.Xr make.conf 5 ,
and with clean checkouts of specific versions of the doc, src, and ports
trees.
For this purpose, a script
.Pq Pa src/release/release.sh
is provided to automate these checkouts and then execute
.Dq Li "make release"
in a clean
.Xr chroot 8 .
.Pp
Before attempting to build a release, the user is expected to be
familiar with the contents of
.Xr build 7 ,
and should have experience upgrading systems from source.
.Pp
The release build process requires that
.Pa /usr/obj
be populated with the output of
.Dq Li "make buildworld"
and
.Dq Li "make buildkernel" .
This is necessary to provide the object files for the release or, when
using
.Pa release.sh ,
so that the object files for a complete system can be installed into a clean
.Xr chroot 8
environment.
.Pp
If the target release build is for a different architecture or machine type,
the
.Va TARGET
and
.Va TARGET_ARCH
variables must be used.
See the supported
.Fa release.conf
variables for more information.
.Pp
The release procedure on some architectures may also require that the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
.Pq either by being compiled in or available as a module .
.Pp
This document does not cover source code management, quality
assurance, or other aspects of the release engineering process.
.Sh CLEAN RELEASE GENERATION
Official releases of
.Fx
are produced in a clean environment to
ensure consistency between the versions of the src, ports, and doc trees
and to avoid contamination from the host system
.Po such as local patches, changes
to
.Xr make.conf 5 ,
etc.
.Pc .
This is accomplished using the wrapper script
.Pa src/release/release.sh .
.Pp
.Ic release.sh
.Op Fl c Ar release.conf
.Pp
.Ic release.sh
checks out the
.Li src/ ,
.Li ports/ ,
and
.Li doc/
trees to
.Va CHROOTDIR ,
then calls
.Dq Li "make buildworld"
and
.Dq Li "make installworld"
to generate a
.Xr chroot 8
environment.
Next,
.Dq Li "make release"
is run within the
.Xr chroot 8
environment and places the result in
.Pa $CHROOTDIR/R .
.Pp

Set to a non-null value to build OCI base images.
.El
.Sh MAKEFILE TARGETS
The release makefile
.Pq Pa src/release/Makefile
is fairly abstruse.
Most developers will only be concerned with the
.Cm release
and
.Cm install
targets.
.\" XXX: Some sort of introduction to this list?  All the others have one.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm packagesystem"
.It Cm release
Meta-target to build all release media and distributions applicable to this
platform.
.It Cm install
Copy all produced release media to
.Pa ${DESTDIR} .
.It Cm cdrom
Builds installation CD-ROM images.
This may require the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
(either by being compiled in or available as a module).
This target produces files called
.Pa disc1.iso
and
.Pa bootonly.iso
as its output.
.It Cm dvdrom
Builds installation DVD-ROM images.
This may require the
.Xr md 4
(memory disk) device driver be present in the kernel
(either by being compiled in or available as a module).
This target produces the
.Pa dvd1.iso
file as its output.
.It Cm memstick
Builds an installation memory stick image named
.Pa memstick.img .
Not applicable on all platforms.
Requires that the
.Xr md 4
.Pq memory disk
device driver be present in the kernel
.Pq either by being compiled in or available as a module .
.It Cm mini-memstick
Similar to
.Cm memstick ,
with the exception that the installation distribution sets
are not included.
.It Cm ftp
Creates a directory named
.Pa ftp
containing the distribution files used in network installations
and suitable for upload to an FTP mirror.
.It Cm vm-image
Creates virtual machine disk images in various formats.
The
.Cm vm-image
target requires the
.Va WITH_VMIMAGES
.Xr make 1
environment variable to be set to a non-null value.
.It Cm vm-cloudware
Builds
.Fx
virtual machine images for various cloud hosting providers.
See
.Qq CLOUD HOSTING MACHINE IMAGES
for implementation details.
.It Cm list-cloudware
Displays the list of valid
.Va CLOUDWARE
values.
.It Cm list-vmtargets
Displays the list of valid
.Va VMFORMATS
and
.Va CLOUDWARE
values.
.El
.Pp
Major subtargets called by targets above:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm packagesystem"
.It Cm packagesystem
Generates all the distribution archives
.Pq base, kernel, ports, doc
applicable on this platform.
.It Cm disc1
Builds a bootable installation system containing all the distribution files
packaged by the
.Cm packagesystem
target, and suitable for imaging by the
.Cm cdrom ,
.Cm dvdrom
and
.Cm memstick
targets.
.It Cm reldoc
Builds the release documentation.
This includes the release notes,
hardware guide, and installation instructions.
Other documentation, such as the Handbook,
is built during the
.Cm base.txz
target invoked by
.Cm packagesystem .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Optional variables:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev TARGET_ARCH"
.It Ev OSRELEASE
Optional base name for generated media images when invoking the
.Cm install
target
.Pq e.g., FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64 .
Defaults to the output of
.Ic `uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -p`
within the chroot.
.It Ev WORLDDIR
Location of a directory containing the src tree.
By default, the directory
above the one containing the makefile
.Pq Pa src .
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Location of a directory containing the ports tree.
By default,
.Pa /usr/ports .
If it is unset or cannot be found, ports will not be included in the release.
.It Ev NOPORTS
If defined, the Ports Collection will be omitted from the release.
.It Ev NOSRC
If set, do not include system source code in the release.
.It Ev TARGET
The target hardware platform.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl m
output.
This is necessary to cross-build some target architectures.
For example, cross-building for ARM64 machines requires
.Ev TARGET_ARCH Ns = Ns Li aarch64
and
.Ev TARGET Ns = Ns Li arm64 .
If not set,
.Ev TARGET
defaults to the current hardware platform.
.It Ev TARGET_ARCH
The target machine processor architecture.
This is analogous to the
.Dq Nm uname Fl p
output.
Set this to cross-build for a different architecture.
If not set,
.Ev TARGET_ARCH
defaults to the current machine architecture, unless
.Ev TARGET
is also set, in which case it defaults to the appropriate
value for that platform.
Typically, one only needs to set
.Ev TARGET .

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following sequence of commands can be used to build a
.Dq "-CURRENT snapshot":
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr
git clone -b main https://git.freebsd.org/src.git src
cd src
make buildworld buildkernel
cd release
make obj
make release
make install DESTDIR=/var/freebsd-snapshot
.Ed
.Pp
After running these commands, all produced distribution files (tarballs
for FTP, CD-ROM images, etc.) are available in the
.Pa /var/freebsd-snapshot
directory.
.Pp
The following sequence of commands can be used to build a
.Dq "-CURRENT snapshot"
in a clean environment, including ports and documentation:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src/release
sh release.sh
.Ed
.Pp
Optionally, a configuration file can be used to customize the release build:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src/release
sh release.sh -c $HOME/release.conf
.Ed
.Pp
Configuration files specific to various supported embedded systems, such as
the Raspberry Pi, exist in the directory corresponding to the
.Va TARGET
.Xr make 1
variable.
For example, to build an image for the Raspberry Pi:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src/release
sh release.sh -c arm/RPI-B.conf
.Ed
.Pp
To build an image for the Raspberry Pi 3:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src/release
sh release.sh -c arm64/RPI3.conf
.Ed
.Pp
After running these commands, all prepared release files are available in the
.Pa /scratch
directory.
The target directory can be changed by specifying the
.Va CHROOTDIR
variable in
.Li release.conf .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The reldoc target was removed in commit f61e92ca5a23, and
.Ev DOCDIR ,
.Ev DOCBRANCH ,
.Ev DOC_UPDATE_SKIP ,
and
.Ev NODOC
are therefore no longer supported.

.Sh HISTORY
.Fx
1.x
used a manual checklist, compiled by
.An Rod Grimes ,
to produce a release.
Apart from being incomplete, the list put a lot of specific demands on
available file systems and was quite torturous to execute.
.Pp
As part of the
.Fx 2.0
release engineering effort, significant
effort was spent getting
.Pa src/release/Makefile
into a shape where it could at least automate most of the tediousness
of building a release in a sterile environment.
.Pp
For the
.Fx 9.0
release,
.Pa src/release/Makefile
was overhauled and the wrapper script
.Pa src/release/generate-release.sh
introduced to support the introduction of a new installer.
.Pp
For the
.Fx 9.2
release,
.Pa src/release/release.sh
was introduced to support per-build configuration files.
.Pa src/release/release.sh
is heavily based on the
.Pa src/release/generate-release.sh
script.
.Pp
At near 1000 revisions spread over multiple branches, the
.Xr git 1
log of
.Pa src/release/Makefile
contains a vivid historical record of some
of the hardships release engineers go through.
.Sh AUTHORS
.Pa src/release/Makefile
was originally written by
.An -nosplit
.An Rod Grimes ,
.An Jordan Hubbard ,
and
.An Poul-Henning Kamp .

.Pp
It was updated by
.An Nathan Whitehorn Aq Mt nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org
to include the

script used for the
.Fx 9.0
release cycle.
