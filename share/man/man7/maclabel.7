.Dt MACLABEL 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm maclabel
.Nd Mandatory Access Control label format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If Mandatory Access Control, or MAC, is enabled in the kernel,
then in addition to the traditional credentials,
each subject
(typically a user or a socket)
and object
(file system object, socket, etc.\&)
is given a
.Em "MAC label" .
The MAC label specifies the necessary subject-specific or
object-specific information necessary for a MAC security policy
.\" .Pq Xr mac 9
to enforce access control on the subject/object.
.Pp
The format for a MAC label is defined as follows:
.Pp
.Sm off
.D1 Ar policy1 No / Ar qualifier1 , policy2 No / Ar qualifier2 , No ...
.Sm on
.Pp
A MAC label consists of a policy name,
followed by a forward slash,
followed by the subject or object's qualifier,
optionally followed by a comma and one or more additional policy labels.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
biba/low(low-low)
biba/high(low-high),mls/equal(equal-equal),partition/0
