.Sh NAME
.Nm Q_FRAWMASK ,
.Nm Q_GFRAW ,
.Nm Q_GFABSVAL ,
.Nm Q_GFVAL ,
.Nm Q_SFVAL
.Nd fixed-point math functions which manipulate the fractional data bits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/qmath.h
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_FRAWMASK "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GFRAW "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GFABSVAL "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GFVAL "QTYPE q"
.Ft QTYPE
.Fn Q_SFVAL "QTYPE q" "ITYPE fv"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Q_FRAWMASK
returns a
.Fa q Ns -specific
bit mask for
.Fa q Ap s
fractional data bits.
.Pp
.Fn Q_GFRAW
returns
.Fa q Ap s
raw masked fractional data bits.
.Pp
.Fn Q_GFABSVAL
and
.Fn Q_GFVAL
return the absolute and real values of
.Fa q Ap s
fractional data bits respectively.
.Pp
.Fn Q_SFVAL
sets
.Fa q Ap s
fractional data bits to the value
.Fa fv .
.Pp
All of those functions operate on
the following data types:
.Vt s8q_t ,
.Vt u8q_t ,
.Vt s16q_t ,
.Vt u16q_t ,
.Vt s32q_t ,
.Vt u32q_t ,
.Vt s64q_t ,
and
.Vt u64q_t ,
which are referred to generically as
.Fa QTYPE .
The
.Fa ITYPE
refers to the
.Xr stdint 7
integer types.
.Pp
For more details, see
.Xr qmath 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn Q_FRAWMASK ,
.Fn Q_GFRAW ,
.Fn Q_GFABSVAL
and
.Fn Q_GFVAL
return their respective values as integers of the same underlying ITYPE as
.Fa q .
.Pp
.Fn Q_SFVAL
returns the value of
.Fa q
post set.
