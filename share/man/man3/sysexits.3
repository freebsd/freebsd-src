.Sh NAME
.Nm sysexits
.Nd legacy exit status codes for system programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sysexits.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some commands attempt to describe the nature of a failure condition
by using these pre-defined exit codes.
This interface has been deprecated and is retained only for compatibility.
Its use is discouraged.
.Sh ERRORS
The successful exit is always indicated by a status of 0, or
.Sy EX_OK .
Error numbers begin at
.Sy EX__BASE
to reduce the possibility of clashing with other exit statuses that
random programs may already return.
The meaning of the codes is
approximately as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "EX_UNAVAILABLEXX(XX)"
.It Sy EX_USAGE Pq 64
The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of
arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
.It Sy EX_DATAERR Pq 65
The input data was incorrect in some way.
This should only be used
for user's data and not system files.
.It Sy EX_NOINPUT Pq 66
An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable.
This could also include errors like
.Dq \&No message
to a mailer (if it cared to catch it).
.It Sy EX_NOUSER Pq 67
The user specified did not exist.
This might be used for mail
addresses or remote logins.
.It Sy EX_NOHOST Pq 68
The host specified did not exist.
This is used in mail addresses or
network requests.
.It Sy EX_UNAVAILABLE Pq 69
A service is unavailable.
This can occur if a support program or file
does not exist.
This can also be used as a catchall message when
something you wanted to do does not work, but you do not know why.
.It Sy EX_SOFTWARE Pq 70
An internal software error has been detected.
This should be limited
to non-operating system related errors as possible.
.It Sy EX_OSERR Pq 71
An operating system error has been detected.
This is intended to be
used for such things as
.Dq cannot fork ,
.Dq cannot create pipe ,
or the like.
It includes things like getuid returning a user that
does not exist in the passwd file.
.It Sy EX_OSFILE Pq 72
Some system file (e.g.,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Pa /var/run/utx.active ,
etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some sort of error
(e.g., syntax error).
.It Sy EX_CANTCREAT Pq 73
A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
.It Sy EX_IOERR Pq 74
An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
.It Sy EX_TEMPFAIL Pq 75
Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an error.
In sendmail, this means that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a
connection, and the request should be reattempted later.
.It Sy EX_PROTOCOL Pq 76
The remote system returned something that was
.Dq not possible
during a protocol exchange.
.It Sy EX_NOPERM Pq 77
You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation.
This is not intended for file system problems, which should use
.Sy EX_NOINPUT
or
.Sy EX_CANTCREAT ,
but rather for higher level permissions.
.It Sy EX_CONFIG Pq 78
Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.

The numerical values corresponding to the symbolical ones are given in
parenthesis for easy reference.
