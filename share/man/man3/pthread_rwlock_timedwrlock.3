.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
.Nd "acquire a read-write lock for writing or give up after a specified period"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock "pthread_rwlock_t *restrict rwlock" "const struct timespec *restrict abs_timeout"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function acquires a write lock on the read-write lock
.Fa rwlock .
However, if the lock cannot be
acquired without waiting for another thread to
unlock the lock,
this wait shall be terminated when
.Fa abs_timeout
expires.
.Pp
If the thread should be interrupted by a signal,
the
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
function will be automatically restarted after the thread returns from
the signal handler.
.Pp
The calling thread may deadlock if
at the time the call is made it holds
.Fa rwlock .
The results are undefined if this function is called with
an uninitialized read-write lock.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
To prevent writer starvation, writers are favored over readers.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
function will return zero.
Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Pp
This function shall not return an error code of
.Er EINTR .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
function shall fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ETIMEDOUT
The lock could not be acquired before the specified timeout expired.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EDEADLK
The calling thread already holds
.Fa rwlock .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa rwlock
does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object,
or the
.Fa abs_timeout
nanosecond value is less than zero or
greater than or equal to 1 billion.
