.Sh NAME
.Nm Q_IRAWMASK ,
.Nm Q_GIRAW ,
.Nm Q_GIABSVAL ,
.Nm Q_GIVAL ,
.Nm Q_SIVAL
.Nd fixed-point math functions which manipulate the integer data bits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/qmath.h
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_IRAWMASK "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GIRAW "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GIABSVAL "QTYPE q"
.Ft ITYPE
.Fn Q_GIVAL "QTYPE q"
.Ft QTYPE
.Fn Q_SIVAL "QTYPE q" "ITYPE iv"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Q_IRAWMASK
returns a
.Fa q Ns -specific
bit mask for
.Fa q Ap s
integer data bits.
.Pp
.Fn Q_GIRAW
returns
.Fa q Ap s
raw masked integer data bits.
.Pp
.Fn Q_GIABSVAL
and
.Fn Q_GIVAL
return the absolute and real values of
.Fa q Ap s
integer data bits respectively.
.Pp
.Fn Q_SIVAL
sets
.Fa q Ap s
integer data bits to the value
.Fa iv .
.Pp
All of those functions operate on
the following data types:
.Vt s8q_t ,
.Vt u8q_t ,
.Vt s16q_t ,
.Vt u16q_t ,
.Vt s32q_t ,
.Vt u32q_t ,
.Vt s64q_t ,
and
.Vt u64q_t ,
which are referred to generically as
.Fa QTYPE .
The
.Fa ITYPE
refers to the
.Xr stdint 7
integer types.
.Pp
For more details, see
.Xr qmath 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn Q_IRAWMASK ,
.Fn Q_GIRAW ,
.Fn Q_GIABSVAL
and
.Fn Q_GIVAL
return their respective values as integers of the same underlying ITYPE as
.Fa q .
.Pp
.Fn Q_SIVAL
returns the value of
.Fa q
post change.
