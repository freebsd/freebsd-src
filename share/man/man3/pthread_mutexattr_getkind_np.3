.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread_np.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np "pthread_mutexattr_t attr"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np "pthread_mutexattr_t *attr" "int kind"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
These functions are deprecated and non-portable implementation of
the mutex type manipulation.
.Ef
.Pp
It is recommended to use the
.Xr pthread_mutexattr_gettype 3
and
.Xr pthread_mutexattr_settype 3
functions instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Fn pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np
function returns a positive value representing the
.Dq kind
of the mutex attribute
.Fa attr
if successful; otherwise the value \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Rv -std pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np
.Sh ERRORS
