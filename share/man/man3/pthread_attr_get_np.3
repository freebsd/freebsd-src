.Dt PTHREAD_ATTR_GET_NP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_attr_get_np
.Nd get attributes of existent thread
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc_r
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread_np.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_attr_get_np "pthread_t *pid" "pthread_attr_t *dst"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_attr_get_np
function is used to get existent thread's attributes.
Value returned as
.Fa dst
is supposed to be used in conjunction with
.Fn pthread_attr_get*
functions to retrive individual values from
.Vt pthread_attr_t
structure.
Parameter
.Fa dst
should point to allocated memory area big enough to fit this structure.
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use
.Xr pthread_attr_init 3
function to allocate attribute storage.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
size_t
my_thread_stack_size(pthread_t pid)
{
    pthread_attr_t attr;
    size_t size;

    pthread_attr_init(&attr);
    pthread_attr_get_np(&pid, &attr);
    pthread_attr_getstacksize(&attr, &size);
    pthread_attr_destroy(&attr);
    return(size);
}
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn pthread_attr_get_np
function returns 0.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_attr_get_np
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Invalid value for one of given parameters.
.It Bq Er ESRC
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID.
