.Nm
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device.
There are two special devices,
.Dq std

The former creates the standard devices for the architecture.
The latter is for devices specific to the local site, and
executes the shell file
.Dq Pa MAKEDEV.local .

The Alpha supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash sign (
.Dq #
),
the hash sign
must be replaced by a unit number.
