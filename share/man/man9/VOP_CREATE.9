.Nd create a file, socket, fifo, device, directory or symlink
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h

.Ft int

.Ft int
.Fn VOP_SYMLINK "struct vnode *dvp" "struct vnode **vpp" "struct componentname *cnp" "struct vattr *vap" "char *target"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These entry points create a new file, socket, fifo, device, directory or symlink
in a given directory.
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width target
.It Fa dvp
the locked vnode of the directory
.It Fa vpp
the address of a variable where the resulting locked vnode should be stored
.It Fa cnp
the pathname component created
.It Fa vap
the attributes that the new object should be created with
.It Fa target
the pathname of the target of the symlink
.El
.Pp
These entry points are called after
.Xr VOP_LOOKUP 9
when an object is being created.
.Sh LOCKS
The directory,
.Fa dvp
will be locked on entry and must remain locked on return.
If the call is successful, the new object will be returned locked.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the vnode for the new object is placed in
.Fa *vpp
and zero is returned.
Otherwise, an appropriate error is returned.
