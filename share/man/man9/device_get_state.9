.Nd manipulate device state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft device_state_t
.Fn device_get_state "device_t dev"
.Ft void
.Fn device_busy "device_t dev"
.Ft void
.Fn device_unbusy "device_t dev"
.Ft int
.Fn device_is_alive "device_t dev"
.Ft int
.Fn device_is_attached "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The current state of a device is accessed by calling
.Fn device_get_state
which returns
.Dv DS_NOTPRESENT ,
.Dv DS_ALIVE ,
.Dv DS_ATTACHED
or
.Dv DS_BUSY
(described in
.Xr device 9 ) .
To test see if a device was successfully probed, call
.Fn device_is_alive
which simply returns if the state is greater or equal to
.Dv DS_ALIVE .
To test see if a device was successfully attached, call
.Fn device_is_attached
which simply returns if the state is greater or equal to
.Dv DS_ATTACHED .
.Pp
Each device has a busy count which is incremented when
.Fn device_busy
is called and decremented when
.Fn device_unbusy
is called.
Both routines return an error if the device state is less than
.Dv DS_ATTACHED .
.Pp
When
.Fn device_busy
is called on a device in the
.Dv DS_ATTACHED
state, the device changes to the
.Dv DS_BUSY
state.
When
.Fn device_unbusy
is called and after decrementing, the busy count for the device is
zero, the device changes to the
.Dv DS_ATTACHED
state.
