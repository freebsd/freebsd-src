.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft void
.Fn binuptime "struct bintime *bt"
.Ft void
.Fn getbinuptime "struct bintime *bt"
.Ft void
.Fn microuptime "struct timeval *tv"
.Ft void
.Fn getmicrouptime "struct timeval *tv"
.Ft void
.Fn nanouptime "struct timespec *ts"
.Ft void
.Fn getnanouptime "struct timespec *tsp"
.Ft sbintime_t
.Fn sbinuptime "void"
.Ft sbintime_t
.Fn getsbinuptime "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn binuptime
and
.Fn getbinuptime
functions store the time elapsed since boot as a
.Vt "struct bintime"
at the address specified by
.Fa bt .
The
.Fn microuptime
and
.Fn getmicrouptime
functions perform the same utility, but record the elapsed time as a
.Vt "struct timeval"
instead.
Similarly the
.Fn nanouptime
and
.Fn getnanouptime
functions store the elapsed time as a
.Vt "struct timespec" .
The
.Fn sbinuptime
and
.Fn getsbinuptime
functions return the time elapsed since boot as a
.Vt "sbintime_t" .
.Pp
The
.Fn binuptime ,
.Fn microuptime ,
.Fn nanouptime ,
and
.Fn sbinuptime
functions
always query the timecounter to return the current time as precisely as
possible.
Whereas
.Fn getbinuptime ,
.Fn getmicrouptime ,
.Fn getnanouptime ,
and
.Fn getsbinuptime
functions are abstractions which return a less precise, but
faster to obtain, time.
.Pp
The intent of the
.Fn getbinuptime ,
.Fn getmicrouptime ,
.Fn getnanouptime ,
and
.Fn getsbinuptime
functions is to enforce the user's preference for timer accuracy versus
execution time.
