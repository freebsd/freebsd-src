.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/vm_map.h
.Ft int
.Fo vm_map_insert
.Fa "vm_map_t map" "vm_object_t object" "vm_ooffset_t offset"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vm_map_insert
function inserts a mapping for the entire vm_object
.Fa object
into the target map
.Fa map .
.Pp
The
.Fa offset
argument specifies the offset into the
.Fa object
at which to begin mapping.
The object's size should match that of the specified address range.
.Pp
The
.Fa start
and
.Fa end
arguments specify the bounds of the mapped object's window in the
address space of
.Fa map .
.Pp
The
.Fa cow
argument specifies the flags which should be propagated to the new entry,
for example, to indicate that this is a copy-on-write mapping.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This function implicitly creates a new
.Vt vm_map_entry
by calling the internal function
.Fn vm_map_entry_create .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn vm_map_insert
function returns
.Dv KERN_SUCCESS
if the mapping could be made successfully.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Dv KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS
will be returned if the start of the range could not be found, or
.Dv KERN_NO_SPACE
if the range was found to be part of an existing entry or if it
overlaps the end of the map.
