.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto
.Nd API for cryptographic services in the kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In opencrypto/cryptodev.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a framework for in-kernel cryptography.
It permits in-kernel consumers to encrypt and decrypt data
and also enables userland applications to use cryptographic hardware
through the
.Pa /dev/crypto
device.
.Pp
.Nm
supports encryption and decryption operations
using block and stream ciphers as well as computation and verification
of message authentication codes (MACs).
Consumers allocate sessions to describe a transform as discussed in
.Xr crypto_session 9 .
Consumers then allocate request objects to describe each transformation
such as encrypting a network packet or decrypting a disk sector.
Requests are described in
.Xr crypto_request 9 .
.Pp
Device drivers are responsible for processing requests submitted by
consumers.
.Xr crypto_driver 9
describes the interfaces drivers use to register with the framework,
helper routines the framework provides to facilitate request processing,
and the interfaces drivers are required to provide.
.Ss Callbacks
Since the consumers may not be associated with a process, drivers may
not
.Xr sleep 9 .
The same holds for the framework.
Thus, a callback mechanism is used
to notify a consumer that a request has been completed (the
callback is specified by the consumer on a per-request basis).
The callback is invoked by the framework whether the request was
successfully completed or not.
Errors are reported to the callback function.
.Pp
Session initialization does not use callbacks and returns errors
synchronously.
.Ss Session Migration
Operations may fail with a specific error code,
.Er EAGAIN ,
to indicate that a session handle has changed and that the
request may be re-submitted immediately with the new session.
The consumer should update its saved copy of the session handle
to the value of
.Fa crp_session
so that future requests use the new session.
.Ss Supported Algorithms
More details on some algorithms may be found in
.Xr crypto 7 .

.Sh HISTORY
The cryptographic framework first appeared in
.Ox 2.7
and was written by
.An Angelos D. Keromytis Aq Mt angelos@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The framework needs a mechanism for determining which driver is
best for a specific set of algorithms associated with a session.
Some type of benchmarking is in order here.
