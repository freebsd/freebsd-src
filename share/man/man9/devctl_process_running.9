.Dt DEVCTL_PROCESS_RUNNING 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm devctl_process_running
.Nd Returns true when devctl has a consumer process running
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/devctl.h
.Ft bool
.Fn devctl_process_running "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
call returns
.Vt true
when a process has the devctl device open for
reading, and
.Vt false
otherwise.
One can assume from this that the default
.Xr devd 8
or similar is running when
.Vt true
is returned.
Some subsystems will send a message and allow userland to do something
before proceeding with a default action if there's a timeout.
This call allows those subsystems to do the default action right away
when no process is running.
