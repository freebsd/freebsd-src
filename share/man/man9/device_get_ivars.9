.Sh NAME
.Nm device_get_ivars ,
.Nm device_set_ivars
.Nd access bus private variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft "void *"
.Fn device_get_ivars "device_t dev"
.Ft void
.Fn device_set_ivars "device_t dev" "void *ivar"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn device_get_ivars
function returns the bus-specific instance variables of a device.
.Pp
The
.Fn device_set_ivars
function sets the bus-specific instance variables of a device.
.Pp
Typically, only bus drivers will use these functions.
The kernel assumes that the bus driver will manage this memory, and no
automatic memory allocation or deallocation happens.
Client drivers should access ivars through the
.Xr BUS_READ_IVAR 9
interface instead.
