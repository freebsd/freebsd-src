.Sh NAME
.Nm uidinfo ,
.Nm uihashinit ,
.Nm uifind ,
.Nm uihold ,
.Nm uifree
.Nd "functions for managing UID information"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/proc.h
.In sys/resourcevar.h
.Ft void
.Fn uihashinit void
.Ft "struct uidinfo *"
.Fn uifind "uid_t uid"
.Ft void
.Fn uihold "struct uidinfo *uip"
.Ft void
.Fn uifree "struct uidinfo *uip"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
family of functions
is used to manage
.Vt uidinfo
structures.
Each
.Vt uidinfo
structure maintains per uid resource consumption counts, including the
process count and socket buffer space usage.
.Pp
The
.Fn uihashinit
function initializes the
.Vt uidinfo
hash table and its mutex.
This function should only be called during system initialization.
.Pp
The
.Fn uifind
function looks up and returns the
.Vt uidinfo
structure for
.Fa uid .
If no
.Vt uidinfo
structure exists for
.Fa uid ,
a new structure will be allocated and initialized.
The
.Nm
hash mutex is acquired and released.
.Pp
The
.Fn uihold
function increases the reference count on
.Fa uip .
.Fa uip Ns 's
lock is acquired and released.
.Pp
The
.Fn uifree
function decreases the reference count on
.Fa uip ,
and if the count reaches 0
.Fa uip
is freed.
.Fa uip Ns 's
lock is acquired and release and the uidinfo hash mutex may be
acquired and released.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn uifind
returns a pointer to an initialized
.Vt uidinfo
structure, and should not fail.
