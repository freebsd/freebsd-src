.Dt ACCF_DNS 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm accf_dns
.Nd buffer incoming DNS requests until the whole first request is present
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm options INET
.Nm options ACCEPT_FILTER_DNS
.Nm kldload accf_dns
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a filter to be placed on a socket that will be using
.Fn accept
to receive incoming connections.
.Pp
It prevents the application from receiving the connected descriptor via
.Fn accept
until a whole DNS request is available on the socket.
It does this by reading the first two bytes of the request,
to determine its size,
and waiting until the required amount of data is available to be read.
.Pp
The
.Fa ACCEPT_FILTER_DNS
kernel option is also a module that can be enabled at runtime via
.Xr kldload 8
if the INET option has been compiled into the kernel.
.Sh EXAMPLES
If the
.Nm
module is available in the kernel,
the following code will enable the DNS accept filter
on a socket
.Fa sok .
.Bd -literal -offset 0i
	struct accept_filter_arg afa;

	bzero(&afa, sizeof(afa));
	strcpy(afa.af_name, "dnsready");
	setsockopt(sok, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ACCEPTFILTER, &afa, sizeof(afa));
