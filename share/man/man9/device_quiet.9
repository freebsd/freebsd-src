.Nd manipulate device quiet flag
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft void
.Fn device_quiet "device_t dev"
.Ft void
.Fn device_verbose "device_t dev"

.Fn device_is_quiet "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each device has a quiet flag associated with it.
A device is
verbose by default when it is created but may be quieted to prevent
printing of the device identification string during attach
and printing of a message during detach.
To quiet a device, call
.Fn device_quiet
during a device driver probe routine.
To re-enable probe messages,
call
.Fn device_verbose .
To test to see if a device is quieted, call
.Fn device_is_quiet .
.Pp
Devices are implicitly marked verbose after a driver detaches.
