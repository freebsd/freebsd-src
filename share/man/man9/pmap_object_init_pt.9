.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/pmap.h
.Ft void
.Fo pmap_object_init_pt

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pmap_object_init_pt
function preloads the page table entries into the specified physical map
.Fa pmap ,
for the given
.Fa object
at the virtual address
.Fa addr ,
for
.Fa size
bytes, beginning at the page index
.Fa pindex
within the object.
The map bits
.Fa limit
are heeded when creating the mapping.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This function is not strictly required by an architecture's
.Xr pmap 9
implementation, but it does provide performance benefits if implemented.
.Pp
It is intended to eliminate the blast of soft faults on process
startup, and immediately following a call to
.Xr mmap 2 .
