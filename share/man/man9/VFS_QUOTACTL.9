.Sh NAME
.Nm VFS_QUOTACTL
.Nd manipulate file system quotas
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn VFS_QUOTACTL "struct mount *mp" "int cmds" "uid_t uid" "void *arg" "bool *mp_busy"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Implement file system quotas.
.Pp
The
.Fa mp_busy
argument is an input/output parameter.
.Fn VFS_QUOTACTL
must be called with
.Fa mp
marked busy through
.Xr vfs_busy 9
and
.Fa *mp_busy
set to true.
The filesystem implementation of
.Fn VFS_QUOTACTL
may then unbusy
.Fa mp
using
.Xr vfs_unbusy 9
prior to performing quota file I/O.
In this case the implementation must set
.Fa *mp_busy
to false to indicate that the caller must not unbusy
.Fa mp
upon completion of
.Fn VFS_QUOTACTL .
.Pp
See
.Xr quotactl 2
for a description of the remaining arguments.
