.Sh NAME
.Nm MODULE_DEPEND
.Nd set kernel module dependencies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/module.h
.Fn MODULE_DEPEND "name" "moddepend" "int minversion" "int prefversion" "int maxversion"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn MODULE_DEPEND
macro sets a dependency on another kernel module with name
.Fa moddepend ,
which has registered
its version with
.Fn MODULE_VERSION .
.Pp
The
.Fn MODULE_DEPEND
macro provides hints to the kernel
.Xr loader 8
and to the kernel linker to ensure that the named dependency is loaded
prior to the existing module.
It does not change or dictate the order in which modules are
initialized at runtime.
.Pp
Three versions must be specified for
.Fa moddepend :
.Bl -tag -width ".Fa prefversion"
.It Fa minversion
The minimum version on which the current module can depend.
.It Fa maxversion
The maximum version on which the current module can depend.
.It Fa prefversion
The preferred version on which the current module can depend.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
