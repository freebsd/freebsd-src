.Nm cd
.Nd device driver for SCSI subsystem
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides the 
.Tn SCSI
subsystem a way to handle type 5
.Pq Dv T_READONLY
media.  Some drives don't behave as the driver expects.  See the section
QUIRKS for info on possible flags.
.Sh QUIRKS
Each
.Tn CD-ROM
device can have different interpretations of the
.Tn SCSI
spec.  This can lead to drives requiring special handling in the driver.  The
following is a list of quirks that the driver recognize.  See
.Xr scsiconf 9
for more information on how to add quirk entries.
.Bl -tag -width CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
.It Dv CD_Q_NO_TOUCH
This flag tell the driver not to probe the drive at attach time to see if
there is a disk in the drive and find out what size it is.
.It Dv CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
This flag is for broken drives that return the track numbers in packed BCD
instead of straight decimal.  If the drive seems to skip tracks
.Pq tracks 10-15 are skipped
then you have a drive that is in need of this flag.
