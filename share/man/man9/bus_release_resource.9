.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bus_release_resource
.Nd release resources on a bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Pp
.In machine/bus.h
.In sys/rman.h
.In machine/resource.h
.Ft int
.Fn bus_release_resource "device_t dev" "struct resource *r"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Free a resource allocated by
.Xr bus_alloc_resource 9 .
The resource must not be in use on release, i.e., call an appropriate function
before (e.g.\&
.Xr bus_teardown_intr 9
for IRQs).
.Bl -item
.It
.Fa dev
is the device that owns the resource.
.It
.Fa r
is the pointer to
.Va struct resource ,
i.e., the resource itself,
returned by
.Xr bus_alloc_resource 9 .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Er EINVAL
is returned, if the device
.Fa dev
has no parent,
.Dv 0
otherwise.
The kernel will panic, if it cannot release the resource.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
	/* deactivate IRQ */
	bus_teardown_intr(dev, foosoftc->irqres, foosoftc->irqid);

	/* release IRQ resource */
	bus_release_resource(dev, foosoftc->irqres);

	/* release I/O port resource */
	bus_release_resource(dev, foosoftc->portres);
