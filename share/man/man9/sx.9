.Sh DESCRIPTION
Shared/exclusive locks are used to protect data that are read far more often
than they are written.
Mutexes are inherently more efficient than shared/exclusive locks, so
shared/exclusive locks should be used prudently.
.Pp
Shared/exclusive locks are created with
.Fn sx_init ,
where
.Fa sx
is a pointer to space for a
.Vt struct sx ,
and
.Fa description
is a pointer to a null-terminated character string that describes the
shared/exclusive lock.
Shared/exclusive locks are destroyed with
.Fn sx_destroy .
Threads acquire and release a shared lock by calling
.Fn sx_slock
or
.Fn sx_try_slock
and
.Fn sx_sunlock .
Threads acquire and release an exclusive lock by calling
.Fn sx_xlock
or
.Fn sx_try_xlock
and
.Fn sx_xunlock .
A thread can attempt to upgrade a currently owned shared lock to an exclusive
lock by calling
.Fn sx_try_upgrade .
A thread that owns an exclusive lock can downgrade it to a shared lock by
calling
.Fn sx_downgrade .
.Pp
.Fn sx_try_slock
and
.Fn sx_try_xlock
will return 0 if the shared/exclusive lock cannot be acquired immediately;
otherwise the shared/exclusive lock will be acquired and a non-zero value will
be returned.
.Pp
.Fn sx_try_upgrade
will return 0 if the shared lock cannot be upgraded to an exclusive lock
immediately; otherwise the exclusive lock will be acquired and a non-zero value
will be returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn sx_assert
function tests specified conditions and panics if they are not met and the
kernel is compiled with
.Dv INVARIANTS .
The following assertions are supported:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SX_XLOCKED"
.It Dv SX_LOCKED
Assert that the current thread has either a shared or an exclusive lock on the
.Vt sx
lock pointed to by the first argument.
.It Dv SX_SLOCKED
Assert that the current thread has a shared lock on the
.Vt sx
lock pointed to by
the first argument.
.It Dv SX_XLOCKED
Assert that the current thread has an exclusive lock on the
.Vt sx
lock pointed to
by the first argument.
.El
.Pp
A thread may not own a shared lock and an exclusive lock simultaneously;
attempting to do so will result in deadlock.

.Xr condvar 9 ,
.Xr mutex 9 ,
.Xr sema 9
.Sh BUGS
Currently there is no way to assert that a lock is not held.
This is not possible in the non-WITNESS case for asserting that this thread
does not hold a shared lock.
In the non-WITNESS case, the
.Dv SX_LOCKED
and
.Dv SX_SLOCKED
assertions merely check that some thread holds a shared lock.
They do not ensure that the current thread holds a shared lock.
