.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates uninitialized memory in kernel address space for an
object whose size is specified by
.Fa size .
.Pp
.Fn free
releases memory at address
.Fa addr
that was previously allocated by
.Fn malloc
for re-use.
The memory is not zeroed.
If
.Fa addr
is
.Dv NULL ,
then
.Fn free
does nothing.
.Pp
The
.Fn realloc
function changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.Fa addr
to
.Fa size
bytes.
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and
old sizes.
Note that the returned value may differ from
.Fa addr .
If the requested memory cannot be allocated,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the memory referenced by
.Fa addr
is valid and unchanged.
If
.Fa addr
is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fn realloc
function behaves identically to
.Fn malloc
for the specified size.
.Pp
The
.Fn reallocf
function call is identical to the realloc function call, except that it
will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be allocated.
.Pp
The
.Fn MALLOC
macro variant is functionally equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(space) = (cast)malloc((u_long)(size), type, flags)
.Ed
.Pp
and the
.Fn FREE
macro variant is equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
free((addr), type)
.Ed
.Pp
Unlike its standard C library counterpart
.Pq Xr malloc 3 ,
the kernel version takes two more arguments.  The
.Fa flags
argument further qualifies
.Fn malloc Ns 's
operational characteristics as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv M_ZERO
Causes the allocated memory to be set to all zeros.
.It Dv M_NOWAIT
Causes
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn realloc ,
or
.Fn reallocf
to return
.Dv NULL
if the request cannot be immediately fulfilled due to resource shortage.
Otherwise, the current process may be put to sleep to wait for
resources to be released by other processes.
If this flag is set,
.Fn malloc
will return
.Dv NULL
rather then block.
Note that
.Dv M_WAITOK
is defined to be 0, meaning that blocking operation is the default.
Also note that 
.Dv M_NOWAIT
is required when running in an interrupt context.
.It Dv M_WAITOK
Indicates that it is Ok to wait for resources.  It is unconveniently
defined as 0 so care should be taken never to compare against this value
directly or try to AND it as a flag.  The default operation is to block
until the memory allocation succeeds.
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn realloc ,
and
.Fn reallocf
can only return
.Dv NULL
if
.Dv M_NOWAIT
is specified.
.It Dv M_USE_RESERVE
Indicates that the system can dig into its reserve in order to obtain the
requested memory.  This option used to be called M_KERNEL but has been
renamed to something more obvious.  This option has been deprecated and is
slowly being removed from the kernel, and so should not be used with any new
programming.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument is used to perform statistics on memory usage, and for
basic sanity checks.
The statistics can be examined by
.Sq vmstat -m .
.Pp
A
.Fa type
is defined using the
.Va malloc_type_t
typedef via the
.Fn MALLOC_DECLARE
and
.Fn MALLOC_DEFINE
macros.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/* sys/something/foo_extern.h */

MALLOC_DECLARE(M_FOOBUF);

/* sys/something/foo_main.c */

MALLOC_DEFINE(M_FOOBUF, "foobuffers", "Buffers to foo data into the ether");

/* sys/something/foo_subr.c */

\&...
MALLOC(buf, struct foo_buf *, sizeof *buf, M_FOOBUF, M_NOWAIT);

.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn realloc ,
and
.Fn reallocf 
return a kernel virtual address that is suitably aligned for storage of
any type of object, or
.Dv NULL
if the request could not be satisfied (implying that
.Dv M_NOWAIT
was set).
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The memory allocator allocates memory in chunks that have size a power
of two for requests up to the size of a page of memory.
For larger requests, one or more pages is allocated.
While it should not be relied upon, this information may be useful for
optimizing the efficiency of memory use.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vmstat 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A kernel compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
configuration option attempts to detect memory corruption caused by
such things as writing outside the allocated area and imbalanced calls to the
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn free
functions.
Failing consistency checks will cause a panic or a system console
message:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
