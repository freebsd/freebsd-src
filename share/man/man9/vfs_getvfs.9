.Nd "returns a mount point given its file system identifier"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft "struct mount *"
.Fn vfs_getvfs "fsid_t *fsid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vfs_getvfs
function returns the mount point structure for a file system given its file system
identifier.
The file system ID should have been allocated by calling
.Xr vfs_getnewfsid 9 ;
otherwise, it will not be found.
.Pp
A major user of
.Fn vfs_getvfs
is NFS, which uses the
.Vt fsid
as part of file handles in order to determine the
file system a given RPC is for.
If
.Fn vfs_getvfs
fails to find the mount point related to
.Fa fsid ,
the file system is considered stale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa fsid
is found, the mount point for the ID is returned; otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
.Bd -literal
if ((mp = vfs_getvfs(&fhp->fh_fsid)) == NULL) {
	error = ESTALE;
	goto out;
}
