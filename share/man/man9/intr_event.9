.Sh DESCRIPTION
Interrupt threads are kernel threads that run a list of handlers when
triggered by either a hardware or software interrupt.
Each interrupt handler has a name, handler function, handler argument,
priority, and various flags.
Each interrupt thread maintains a list of handlers sorted by priority.
This results in higher priority handlers being executed prior to lower
priority handlers.
Each thread assumes the priority of its highest priority handler for its
process priority, or
.Dv PRIO_MAX
if it has no handlers.
Interrupt threads are also associated with a single interrupt source,
represented as a vector number.
.Pp
The
.Fn intr_event_create
function creates a new interrupt thread.
The
.Fa source
argument points to a
.Vt struct intr_event event
pointer that will point to the newly created thread upon success.
The
.Fa flags
argument is a mask of properties of this thread.
The only valid flag currently for
.Fn intr_event_create
is
.Dv IE_SOFT
to specify that this interrupt thread is a software interrupt.
The
.Fa enable
and
.Fa disable
arguments specify optional functions used to enable and disable this
interrupt thread's interrupt source.
The functions receive the vector corresponding to the thread's interrupt
source as their only argument.
The remaining arguments form a
.Xr printf 9
argument list that is used to build the base name of the new interrupt thread.
The full name of an interrupt thread is formed by concatenating the base
name of the interrupt thread with the names of all of its interrupt handlers.
.Pp
The
.Fn intr_event_destroy
function destroys a previously created interrupt thread by releasing its
resources and arranging for the backing kernel thread to terminate.
An interrupt thread can only be destroyed if it has no handlers remaining.
.Pp
The
.Fn intr_event_add_handler
function adds a new handler to an existing interrupt thread specified by
.Fa ithread .
The
.Fa name
argument specifies a name for this handler.
The
.Fa handler
and
.Fa arg
arguments provide the function to execute for this handler and an argument
to pass to it.
The
.Fa pri
argument specifies the priority of this handler and is used both in sorting
it in relation to the other handlers for this thread and to specify the
priority of the backing kernel thread.
The
.Fa flags
argument can be used to specify properties of this handler as defined in
.In sys/bus.h .
If
.Fa cookiep
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then it will be assigned a cookie that can be used later to remove this
handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn intr_event_remove_handler
removes a handler from an interrupt thread.
The
.Fa cookie
argument specifies the handler to remove from its thread.
.Pp
The
.Fn intr_priority
function translates the
.Dv INTR_TYPE_*
interrupt flags into interrupt thread scheduling priorities.
.Pp
The interrupt flags not related to the type of a particular interrupt
.Pq Dv INTR_TYPE_*
can be used to specify additional properties of both hardware and software
interrupt handlers.
The
.Dv INTR_EXCL
flag specifies that this handler cannot share an interrupt thread with
another handler.
The
.Dv INTR_MPSAFE
flag specifies that this handler is MP safe in that it does not need the
Giant mutex to be held while it is executed.
The
.Dv INTR_ENTROPY
flag specifies that the interrupt source this handler is tied to is a good
source of entropy, and thus that entropy should be gathered when an interrupt
from the handler's source triggers.
Presently, the
.Dv INTR_ENTROPY
flag is not valid for software interrupt handlers.
.Pp
It is not permitted to sleep in an interrupt thread; hence, any memory
or zone allocations in an interrupt thread should be specified with the
.Dv M_NOWAIT
flag set.
Any allocation errors must be handled thereafter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn intr_event_add_handler ,
.Fn intr_event_create ,
.Fn intr_event_destroy ,
and
.Fn intr_event_remove_handler
functions return zero on success and non-zero on failure.
The
.Fn intr_priority
function returns a process priority corresponding to the passed in interrupt
flags.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Fn swi_add
function demonstrates the use of
.Fn intr_event_create
and
.Fn intr_event_add_handler .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int
swi_add(struct ithd **ithdp, const char *name, driver_intr_t handler,
	    void *arg, int pri, enum intr_type flags, void **cookiep)
{
	struct proc *p;
	struct ithd *ithd;
	int error;

	if (flags & INTR_ENTROPY)
		return (EINVAL);

	ithd = (ithdp != NULL) ? *ithdp : NULL;

	if (ithd != NULL) {
		if ((ithd->it_flags & IT_SOFT) == 0)
			return(EINVAL);
	} else {
		error = ithread_create(&ithd, pri, IT_SOFT, NULL, NULL,
		    "swi%d:", pri);
		if (error)
			return (error);

		if (ithdp != NULL)
			*ithdp = ithd;
	}
	return (ithread_add_handler(ithd, name, handler, arg, pri + PI_SOFT,
		    flags, cookiep));
}
