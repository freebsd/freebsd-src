.Sh NAME
.Nm pfind , zpfind
.Nd locate a process by number
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/proc.h
.Ft "struct proc *"
.Fn pfind "pid_t pid"
.Ft "struct proc *"
.Fn pfind_any "pid_t pid"
.Ft "struct proc *"
.Fn pfind_any_locked "pid_t pid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn pfind
takes a
.Fa pid
as its argument and returns a pointer to the
.Vt proc
structure whose PID is specified in the argument only if the
.Fa pid
is on the
.Va allproc
list.
.Pp
.Fn pfind_any
takes a
.Fa pid
as its argument.
.Fn pfind_any
searches the
.Va allproc
list and returns the first process whose PID matches and whose state is
.Va PRS_ZOMBIE .
.Pp
.Fn pfind_any_locked
is similar to
.Fn pfind_any
,but it does not lock the process hash bucket
for the given
.Vt pid .
Instead, it asserts the corresponding process hash bucket is already locked.
All three functions
.Fn pfind ,
.Fn pfind_any ,
and
.Fn pgfind_any_locked
lock the
.Vt proc
structure before returning.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn pfind ,
.Fn pfind_any ,
and
.Fn pfind_any_locked
return pointer to a
.Vt proc
structure on success or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
