.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h

function sets the system's battery-backed clock based on the contents
of the system
.Va time
variable.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr time 9
.Sh BUGS
On many systems,

to a time expressed in terms of year, month, day, hours, minutes,
and seconds.
Many of the implementations could share code, but do not.
