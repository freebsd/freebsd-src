.Sh NAME
.Nm DEVICE_ATTACH
.Nd attach a device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft int
.Fn DEVICE_ATTACH "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Attach a device to the system after the
.Fn DEVICE_PROBE
method has been called and has indicated that
the device exists.
The
.Fn DEVICE_ATTACH
method should initialize the hardware and allocate other
system resources (such as
.Xr devfs 4
entries).
.Pp
Devices which implement buses should use this method to probe for
the existence of devices attached to the bus and add them as
children.
If this is combined with the use of
.Xr bus_attach_children 9
the child devices will be automatically probed and attached.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
