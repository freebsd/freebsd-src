.Fd #include <sys/bus.h>
.Ft int
.Fn BUS_SETUP_INTR "device_t dev" "device_t child" "struct resource *irq" "int flags" "driver_intr_t *intr" "void *arg" "void **cookiep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The method
.Nm
will create and attach an interrupt handler to an interrupt
previously allocated by the resource manager's

method.
The handler

will be called with the value
.Fa arg
as its only argument.

.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR .
The cookie needs to be passed to
.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR
in order to tear down the correct interrupt handler.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
