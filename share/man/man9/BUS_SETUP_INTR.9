.Sh DESCRIPTION
The method
.Nm
will create and attach an interrupt handler to an interrupt
previously allocated by the resource manager's
.Xr BUS_ALLOC_RESOURCE 9
method.
The
.Fa flags
are found in
.In sys/bus.h ,
and give the broad category of interrupt.
The
.Fa flags
also tell the interrupt handlers about certain
device driver characteristics.
.Dv INTR_FAST
means the handler is for a timing-critical function.
Extra care is take to speed up these handlers.
Use of this implies
.Dv INTR_EXCL .
.Dv INTR_EXCL
marks the handler as being
an exclusive handler for this interrupt.
.Dv INTR_MPSAFE
tells the scheduler that the interrupt handler
is well behaved in a preemptive environment
(``SMP safe''),
and does not need
to be protected by the ``Giant Lock'' mutex.
.Dv INTR_ENTROPY
marks the interrupt as being a good source of entropy -
this may be used by the entropy device
.Pa /dev/random .
The handler
.Fa intr
will be called with the value
.Fa arg
as its only argument.
.Pp
The
.Fa cookiep
argument is a pointer to a
.Vt "void *"
that
.Nm
will write a cookie for the parent bus' use to if it is successful in
establishing an interrupt.
Driver writers may assume that this cookie will be non-zero.
The nexus driver will write 0 on failure to
.Fa cookiep .
.Pp
The interrupt handler will be detached by
.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR .
The cookie needs to be passed to
.Fn BUS_TEARDOWN_INTR
in order to tear down the correct interrupt handler.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Zero is returned on success,
otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
