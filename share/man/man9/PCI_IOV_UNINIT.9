.Sh NAME
.Nm PCI_IOV_UNINIT
.Nd disable SR-IOV on a PF device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/bus.h
.In dev/pci/pci_iov.h
.Ft void
.Fn PCI_IOV_UNINIT "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn PCI_IOV_UNINIT
method is called by the PCI Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
infrastructure when the user requests that SR-IOV be disabled on a Physical
Function (PF).
When this method is called, the PF driver must release any SR-IOV-related
resources that it has allocated and disable any device-specific SR-IOV
configuration in the device.
.Pp
This method will only be called following a successful call to
.Xr PCI_IOV_INIT 9 .
It is not guaranteed that
.Xr PCI_IOV_ADD_VF 9
will have been called for any Virtual Function (VF) after the call to
.Xr PCI_IOV_INIT 9
and before the call to
.Nm .
