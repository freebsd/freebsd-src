.Dt DEVCLASS 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm devclass
.Nd object representing a class of devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Vt typedef struct devclass *devclass_t ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt devclass
object has two main functions in the system.
The first is to manage
the allocation of unit numbers for device instances and the second is
to hold the list of device drivers for a particular bus type.
Each
.Vt devclass
has a name and there cannot be two devclasses with the same name.
This ensures that unique unit numbers are allocated to device
instances.
All instances with the same name are treated as being the same.
.Pp
When no specific unit number is needed,
.Vt DEVICE_UNIT_ANY
is used.
