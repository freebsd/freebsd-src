.Sh NAME
.Nm VFS_FHTOVP
.Nd turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft int
.Fn VFS_FHTOVP "struct mount *mp" "struct fid *fhp" "struct vnode **vpp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is used by the NFS server to turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width vpp
.It Ar mp
The filesystem.
.It Ar fhp
The filehandle to convert.
.It Ar vpp
Return parameter for the new locked vnode.
.El
.Pp
The contents of the filehandle are defined by the filesystem and are
not examined by any other part of the system.  It should contain
enough information to uniquely identify a file within the filesystem
as well as noticing when a file has been removed and the filesystem
resources have been reused for a new file.  For instance, UFS
filesystem stores the inode number and inode generation counter in its
filehandle.
.Pp
A call to this function should generally be preceded by a call to 
.Xr VFS_CHECKEXP 9
to check if the file is accessible to the client.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The locked vnode for the file will be returned in
.Fa *vpp .
