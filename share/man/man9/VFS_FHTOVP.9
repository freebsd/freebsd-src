.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm VFS_FHTOVP
.Nd turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn VFS_FHTOVP "struct mount *mp" "struct fid *fhp" "int flags" "struct vnode **vpp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn VFS_FHTOVP
macro is used by the NFS server to turn an NFS filehandle into a vnode.
.Pp
The arguments it expects are:
.Bl -tag -width flags
.It Fa mp
The file system.
.It Fa fhp
The filehandle to convert.
.It Fa flags
Additional locking flags to pass through to
.Xr vget 9 .
File systems are allowed to ignore
.Ar flags
and use
.Dv LK_EXCLUSIVE
instead.
.It Fa vpp
Return parameter for the new locked vnode.
.El
.Pp
The contents of the filehandle are defined by the file system and are
not examined by any other part of the system.
It should contain
enough information to uniquely identify a file within the file system
as well as noticing when a file has been removed and the file system
resources have been reused for a new file.
For instance, UFS
file system stores the inode number and inode generation counter in its
filehandle.
.Pp
A call to
.Fn VFS_FHTOVP
should generally be preceded by a call to
.Xr VFS_CHECKEXP 9
to check if the file is accessible to the client.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The locked vnode for the file will be returned in
.Fa *vpp .
