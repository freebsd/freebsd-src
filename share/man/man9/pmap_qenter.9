.Sh NAME
.Nm pmap_qenter ,
.Nm pmap_qremove
.Nd manage temporary kernel space mappings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/pmap.h
.Ft void
.Fn pmap_qenter "vm_offset_t sva" "vm_page_t *m" "int count"
.Ft void
.Fn pmap_qremove "vm_offset_t sva" "int count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pmap_qenter
function accepts a linear array of
.Fa count
pointers to wired pages
.Fa *m ,
and enters each of these pages into the kernel virtual address (KVA) space,
beginning at the address
.Fa sva .
The pages are mapped non-executable, if possible.
(For example, non-PAE i386 has no capability to map pages non-executable.)
.Pp
The
.Fn pmap_qremove
function tears out a mapping from the kernel virtual address space,
beginning at
.Fa sva
and for
.Fa count
pages.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fn pmap_qenter
function is intended for temporary mappings that do not require page
modification or reference counting.
Old mappings are simply overwritten.
The pages
.Em must
be wired into physical memory.
.Pp
The corresponding
.Fn pmap_qremove
function is intended to remove such temporary mappings.
