.Dt VSLOCK 9
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm vslock ,
.Nm vsunlock
.Nd lock/unlock user space addresses in memory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <vm/vm.h>
.Fd #include <vm/vm_extern.h>
.Ft void
.Fn vslock "caddr_t addr" "u_int len"
.Ft void
.Fn vsunlock "caddr_t addr" "u_int len" "int dirtied"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vslock
and
.Fn vsunlock
functions respectively lock and unlock a range of
addresses belonging to the currently running process into memory.
The actual amount of memory locked is a multiple of the machine's page size.
The starting page number is computed by truncating
.Fa addr
to the nearest preceding page boundary, and by rounding up
.Fa addr +
.Fa len
to the next page boundary.
The process context to use for this operation is taken from the
global variable
.Va curproc .

The process pointer should be passed in as an argument.
