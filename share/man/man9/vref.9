the vnode to increment
.El
.Pp
Each vnode maintains a reference count of how many parts of the system
are using the vnode.
This allows the system to detect when a vnode is
no longer being used and can be safely recycled for a different file.
.Pp
Any code in the system which is using a vnode (e.g.\& during the
operation of some algorithm or to store in a data structure) should
call
.Fn vref
or
.Fn vrefl .
.Pp
.Fn vref
locks the vnode interlock while
.Fn vrefl
expects the interlock to already be held.
