.Sh DESCRIPTION
These entry points manipulate various attributes of a file or directory,
including file permissions, owner, group, size,
access time and modification time.
.Pp
.Fn VOP_STAT
returns data in a format suitable for the
.Xr stat 2
system call and by default is implemented as a wrapper around
.Fn VOP_GETATTR .
Filesystems may want to implement their own variant for performance reasons.
.Pp
For
.Fn VOP_GETATTR
and
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
the arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width cred
.It Fa vp
The vnode of the file.
.It Fa vap
The attributes of the file.
.It Fa cred
The user credentials of the calling thread.
.El
.Pp
For
.Fn VOP_STAT
the arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width active_cred
.It Fa vp
The vnode of the file.
.It Fa sb
The attributes of the file.
.It Fa active_cred
The user credentials of the calling thread.
.It Fa file_cred
The credentials installed on the file description pointing to the vnode or NOCRED.
.El
.Pp
Attributes which are not being modified by
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
should be set to the value
.Dv VNOVAL ;
.Fn VATTR_NULL
may be used to clear all the values, and should generally be used to reset
the contents of
.Fa *vap
prior to setting specific values.
.Sh LOCKS
Both
.Fn VOP_GETATTR
and
.Fn VOP_STAT
expect the vnode to be locked on entry and will leave the vnode locked on
return.
The lock type can be either shared or exclusive.
.Pp
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
expects the vnode to be locked on entry and will leave the vnode locked on
return.
The lock type must be exclusive.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn VOP_GETATTR
returns 0 if it was able to retrieve the attribute data via
.Fa *vap ,
otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
.Fn VOP_SETATTR
returns zero if the attributes were changed successfully, otherwise an
appropriate error is returned.
.Fn VOP_STAT
returns 0 if it was able to retrieve the attribute data
.Fa *sb ,
otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The file is immutable.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The caller does not have permission to modify the file or directory attributes.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system is read-only.
