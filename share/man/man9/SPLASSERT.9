.Sh NAME
.Nm SPLASSERT
.Nd kernel spl level verification macro
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd options INVARIANTS
.Fd options INVARIANT_SUPPORT
.Fn SPLASSERT "char *level, char *msg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In a kernel compiled with both "options INVARIANTS"
and "options INVARIANT_SUPPORT",
the 
.Fn SPLASSERT
macro compares the current spl level of the kernel with the spl
.Ar level
specified in the macro
.Fn SPLASSERT .
If the specified
.Ar level
is not active
.Fn SPLASSERT
calls the 
.Fn KASSERT
macro with the
.Ar msg,
terminating the running system.
.Pp
In a kernel that does not have both "options INVARIANTS"
and "options INVARIANT_SUPPORT",
the 
.Fn SPLASSERT
macro is defined to be a no-op.  
.Sh EXAMPLE
The kernel function
.Fn rtredirect
must be called at
.Fn splnet :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
rtalloc(ro)
	register struct route *ro;
{
	SPLASSERT(net, "rtalloc()");
	rtalloc_ign(ro, 0UL);
}
