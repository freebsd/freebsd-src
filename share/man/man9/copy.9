.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy contiguous data from one address space
to another.
.Pp
.Fn copystr
is deprecated and should be replaced with
.Xr strlcpy 9 .
It will be removed from
.Fx 13 .
.Pp
The
.Fn copyin
and
.Fn copyin_nofault
functions copy
.Fa len
bytes of data from the user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
.Pp
The
.Fn copyout
and
.Fn copyout_nofault
functions copy
.Fa len
bytes of data from the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr
to the user-space address
.Fa uaddr .
.Pp
The
.Fn copyin_nofault
and
.Fn copyout_nofault
functions require that the kernel-space and user-space data be
accessible without incurring a page fault.
The source and destination addresses must be physically mapped for
read and write access, respectively, and neither the source nor
destination addresses may be pageable.
.Pp
The
.Fn copystr
function copies a NUL-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from kernel-space address
.Fa kfaddr
to kernel-space address
.Fa kdaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating
NUL, is returned in
.Fa *done
(if
.Fa done
is
.No non- Ns Dv NULL ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn copyinstr
function copies a NUL-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating
NUL, is returned in
.Fa *done
(if
.Fa done
is
.No non- Ns Dv NULL ) .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success.
All but
.Fn copystr
return
.Er EFAULT
if a bad address is encountered.
The
.Fn copyin_nofault
and
.Fn copyout_nofault
functions return
.Er EFAULT
if a page fault occurs.
The
.Fn copystr
and
.Fn copyinstr
functions return
.Er ENAMETOOLONG
if the string is longer than
.Fa len
bytes.

.Xr store 9
