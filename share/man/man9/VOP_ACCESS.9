.Fn VOP_ACCESSX "struct vnode *vp" "accmode_t accmode" "struct ucred *cred" "struct thread *td"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This entry point checks the access permissions of the file against the
given credentials.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width accmode
.It Fa vp

The
.Fa accmode
is a mask which can contain flags described in <sys/vnode.h>, e.g.
.Dv VREAD ,
.Dv VWRITE
or
.Dv VEXEC .

the only flags that may be set in
.Fa accmode
are
.Dv VEXEC ,
.Dv VWRITE ,
.Dv VREAD ,

To check for other flags, one has to use
.Fn VOP_ACCESSX
instead.
.Sh LOCKS

.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the file is accessible in the specified way, then zero is returned,
otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
