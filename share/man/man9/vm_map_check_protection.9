.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vm_map_check_protection
function asserts that the target
.Fa map
allows the specified privilege
.Fa protection
over the entire address range from
.Fa start
to
.Fa end .
The region MUST be contiguous; no holes are allowed.

This code does not and SHOULD not check whether the contents of
the region are accessible.
For example, a small file may be mapped into an address space which
is significantly larger in size.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn vm_map_check_protection
function returns TRUE if the privilege is allowed; if it is not allowed,
or if any other error occurred, the value FALSE is returned.
