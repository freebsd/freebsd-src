.Sh NAME
.Nm pmap_unwire
.Nd unwire a range of virtual pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/pmap.h
.Ft void
.Fo pmap_unwire
.Fa "pmap_t pmap" "vm_offset_t start" "vm_offset_t end"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn pmap_unwire
removes the wired attribute from each of the virtual-to-physical page mappings
within the virtual address range from
.Fa start
to
.Fa end
of the physical map
.Fa pmap .
Every valid mapping within that range is required to have the wired attribute
set.
Invalid mappings are ignored, since they cannot have the wired attribute set.
.Sh NOTES
Only the function
.Xr pmap_enter 9
can be used to set the wired attribute of a virtual-to-physical page mapping.
