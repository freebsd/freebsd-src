.Dt DEVCTL_NOTIFY 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm devctl_notify
.Nd Send a message, via devctl, to userland
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/devctl.h
.Ft void
.Fn devctl_notify "const char *system" "const char *subsystem" "const char *type" "const char *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Send a notification to user land via
.Xr devctl 4 .
See
.Xr devctl 4
for the format of these messages.
.Pp
The
.Nm
function creates a string using the following template:
.Bd -literal
snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "!system=%s subsystem=%s type=%s",
   system, subsystem, type);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va system ,
.Va subsystem ,
and
.Va type
pointers cannot be NULL.
.Pp
The
.Va data
argument may be NULL (for no additions) or a message formatted
properly for
.Xr devctl 4 .
A space will be added to the above template and this argument copied
verbatim to form the message passed to userland.
Senders should balance between only passing data that userland can not
discover itself and sending all the data userland will want to use to
decide what to do with the message.
.Pp
The current total message length limit is just under 1kb.
Senders should try to remain well below this limit.
