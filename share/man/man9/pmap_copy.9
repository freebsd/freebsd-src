.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/pmap.h
.Ft void
.Fo pmap_copy
.Fa "pmap_t dst_pmap" "pmap_t src_pmap" "vm_offset_t dst_addr"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pmap_copy
function copies the range specified by
.Fa src_addr
and
.Fa len
from the source physical map
.Fa src_pmap
to the destination physical map
.Fa dst_pmap
at the address
.Fa dst_addr .
.Pp
The
.Fn pmap_copy_page
function
copies the physical page
.Fa src
to the physical page
.Fa dst ,
by mapping the page into kernel virtual address space (KVA), and using
.Fn bcopy
to copy the page.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Fn pmap_copy
routine is only advisory and need not do anything.
Actually implementing it may seriously reduce system performance.
.Pp
The
.Fn pmap_copy_page
routine only operates upon a single page.
