.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each symmetric cryptographic operation in the kernel is described by
an instance of
.Vt struct cryptop
and is associated with an active session.
.Pp
Requests can either be allocated dynamically or use caller-supplied
storage.
Dynamically allocated requests should be allocated by either
.Fn crypto_getreq
or
.Fn crypto_clonereq ,
and freed by
.Fn crypto_freereq
once the request has completed.
Requests using caller-supplied storage should be initialized by
.Fn crypto_initreq
at the start of each operation and destroyed by
.Fn crypto_destroyreq
once the request has completed.
.Pp
For
.Fn crypto_clonereq ,
.Fn crypto_getreq ,
and
.Fn crypto_initreq ,
.Fa cses
is a reference to an active session.
For
.Fn crypto_clonereq
and
.Fn crypto_getreq ,
.Fa how
is passed to
.Xr malloc 9
and should be set to either
.Dv M_NOWAIT
or
.Dv M_WAITOK .
.Pp
.Fn crypto_clonereq
allocates a new request that inherits request inputs such as request buffers
from the original
.Fa crp
request.
However, the new request is associated with the
.Fa cses
session rather than inheriting the session from
.Fa crp .
.Fa crp
must not be a completed request.
.Pp
Once a request has been initialized,
the caller should set fields in the structure to describe
request-specific parameters.
Unused fields should be left as-is.
.Pp
The
.Fn crypto_dispatch ,
.Fn crypto_dispatch_async ,
and
.Fn crypto_dispatch_batch
functions pass one or more crypto requests to the driver attached to the
request's session.
If there are errors in the request's fields, these functions may return an
error to the caller.
If errors are encountered while servicing the request, they will instead
be reported to the request's callback function
.Pq Fa crp_callback
via
.Fa crp_etype .
.Pp
Note that a request's callback function may be invoked before
.Fn crypto_dispatch
returns.
.Pp
Once a request has signaled completion by invoking its callback function,
it should be freed via
.Fn crypto_destroyreq
or
.Fn crypto_freereq .
.Pp
Cryptographic operations include several fields to describe the request.
.Ss Request Buffers
Requests can either specify a single data buffer that is modified in place
.Po
.Fa crp_buf
.Pc
or separate input
.Po
.Fa crp_buf
.Pc
and output
.Po
.Fa crp_obuf
.Pc
buffers.
Note that separate input and output buffers are not supported for compression
mode requests.
.Pp
All requests must have a valid
.Fa crp_buf
initialized by one of the following functions:
.Bl -tag -width "Fn crypto_use_vmpage"
.It Fn crypto_use_buf
Uses an array of
.Fa len
bytes pointed to by
.Fa buf
as the data buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_mbuf
Uses the network memory buffer
.Fa m
as the data buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_uio
Uses the scatter/gather list
.Fa uio
as the data buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_vmpage
Uses the array of
.Vt vm_page_t
structures as the data buffer.
.El
.Pp
One of the following functions should be used to initialize
.Fa crp_obuf
for requests that use separate input and output buffers:
.Bl -tag -width "Fn crypto_use_output_vmpage"
.It Fn crypto_use_output_buf
Uses an array of
.Fa len
bytes pointed to by
.Fa buf
as the output buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_output_mbuf
Uses the network memory buffer
.Fa m
as the output buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_output_uio
Uses the scatter/gather list
.Fa uio
as the output buffer.
.It Fn crypto_use_output_vmpage
Uses the array of
.Vt vm_page_t
structures as the output buffer.
.El
.Ss Request Regions
Each request describes one or more regions in the data buffers.
Each region is described by an offset relative to the start of a
data buffer and a length.
The length of some regions is the same for all requests belonging to
a session.
Those lengths are set in the session parameters of the associated
session.
All requests must define a payload region.
Other regions are only required for specific session modes.
.Pp
For requests with separate input and output data buffers,
the AAD, IV, and payload regions are always defined as regions in the
input buffer,
and a separate payload output region is defined to hold the output of
encryption or decryption in the output buffer.
The digest region describes a region in the input data buffer for
requests that verify an existing digest.
For requests that compute a digest,
the digest region describes a region in the output data buffer.
Note that the only data written to the output buffer is the encryption
or decryption result and any computed digest.
AAD and IV regions are not copied from the input buffer into the output
buffer but are only used as inputs.
.Pp
The following regions are defined:
.Bl -column "Payload Output" "Input/Output"
.It Sy Region Ta Sy Buffer Ta Sy Description
.It AAD Ta Input Ta
Embedded Additional Authenticated Data
.It IV Ta Input Ta
Embedded IV or nonce
.It Payload Ta Input Ta
Data to encrypt, decrypt, compress, or decompress
.It Payload Output Ta Output Ta
Encrypted or decrypted data
.It Digest Ta Input/Output Ta
Authentication digest, hash, or tag
.El
.Bl -column "Payload Output" ".Fa crp_payload_output_start"
.It Sy Region Ta Sy Start Ta Sy Length
.It AAD Ta Fa crp_aad_start Ta Fa crp_aad_length
.It IV Ta Fa crp_iv_start Ta Fa csp_ivlen
.It Payload Ta Fa crp_payload_start Ta Fa crp_payload_length
.It Payload Output Ta Fa crp_payload_output_start Ta Fa crp_payload_length
.It Digest Ta Fa crp_digest_start Ta Fa csp_auth_mlen
.El
.Pp
Requests are permitted to operate on only a subset of the data buffer.
For example,
requests from IPsec operate on network packets that include headers not
used as either additional authentication data (AAD) or payload data.
.Ss Request Operations
All requests must specify the type of operation to perform in
.Fa crp_op .
Available operations depend on the session's mode.
.Pp
Compression requests support the following operations:
.Bl -tag -width CRYPTO_OP_DECOMPRESS
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_COMPRESS
Compress the data in the payload region of the data buffer.
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_DECOMPRESS
Decompress the data in the payload region of the data buffer.
.El
.Pp
Cipher requests support the following operations:
.Bl -tag -width CRYPTO_OP_DECRYPT
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_ENCRYPT
Encrypt the data in the payload region of the data buffer.
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_DECRYPT
Decrypt the data in the payload region of the data buffer.
.El
.Pp
Digest requests support the following operations:
.Bl -tag -width CRYPTO_OP_COMPUTE_DIGEST
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_COMPUTE_DIGEST
Calculate a digest over the payload region of the data buffer
and store the result in the digest region.
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_VERIFY_DIGEST
Calculate a digest over the payload region of the data buffer.
Compare the calculated digest to the existing digest from the digest region.
If the digests match,
complete the request successfully.
If the digests do not match,
fail the request with
.Er EBADMSG .
.El
.Pp
AEAD and Encrypt-then-Authenticate requests support the following
operations:
.Bl -tag -width CRYPTO_OP
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_ENCRYPT | Dv CRYPTO_OP_COMPUTE_DIGEST
Encrypt the data in the payload region of the data buffer.
Calculate a digest over the AAD and payload regions and store the
result in the data buffer.
.It Dv CRYPTO_OP_DECRYPT | Dv CRYPTO_OP_VERIFY_DIGEST
Calculate a digest over the AAD and payload regions of the data buffer.
Compare the calculated digest to the existing digest from the digest region.
If the digests match,
decrypt the payload region.
If the digests do not match,
fail the request with
.Er EBADMSG .
.El
.Ss Request AAD
AEAD and Encrypt-then-Authenticate requests may optionally include
Additional Authenticated Data.
AAD may either be supplied in the AAD region of the input buffer or
as a single buffer pointed to by
.Fa crp_aad .
In either case,
.Fa crp_aad_length
always indicates the amount of AAD in bytes.
.Ss Request ESN
IPsec requests may optionally include Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN).
ESN may either be supplied in
.Fa crp_esn
or as part of the AAD pointed to by
.Fa crp_aad .
.Pp
If the ESN is stored in
.Fa crp_esn ,
.Dv CSP_F_ESN
should be set in
.Fa csp_flags .
This use case is dedicated for encrypt and authenticate mode, since the
high-order 32 bits of the sequence number are appended after the Next Header
(RFC 4303).
.Pp
AEAD modes supply the ESN in a separate AAD buffer (see e.g. RFC 4106, Chapter 5
AAD Construction).
.Ss Request IV and/or Nonce
Some cryptographic operations require an IV or nonce as an input.
An IV may be stored either in the IV region of the data buffer or in
.Fa crp_iv .
By default,
the IV is assumed to be stored in the IV region.
If the IV is stored in
.Fa crp_iv ,
.Dv CRYPTO_F_IV_SEPARATE
should be set in
.Fa crp_flags
and
.Fa crp_iv_start
should be left as zero.
.Pp
Requests that store part, but not all, of the IV in the data buffer should
store the partial IV in the data buffer and pass the full IV separately in
.Fa crp_iv .
.Ss Request and Callback Scheduling
The crypto framework provides multiple methods of scheduling the dispatch
of requests to drivers along with the processing of driver callbacks.
The
.Fn crypto_dispatch ,
.Fn crypto_dispatch_async ,
and
.Fn crypto_dispatch_batch
functions can be used to request different dispatch scheduling policies.
.Pp
.Fn crypto_dispatch
synchronously passes the request to the driver.
The driver itself may process the request synchronously or asynchronously
depending on whether the driver is implemented by software or hardware.
.Pp
.Fn crypto_dispatch_async
dispatches the request asynchronously.
If the driver is inherently synchronous, the request is queued to a taskqueue
backed by a pool of worker threads.
This can increase througput by allowing requests from a single producer to be
processed in parallel.
By default the pool is sized to provide one thread for each CPU.
Worker threads dequeue requests and pass them to the driver asynchronously.
.Fn crypto_dispatch_async
additionally takes a
.Va flags
parameter.
The
.Dv CRYPTO_ASYNC_ORDERED
flag indicates that completion callbacks for requests must be called in the
same order as requests were dispatched.
If the driver is asynchronous, the behavior of
.Fn crypto_dispatch_async
is identical to that of
.Fn crypto_dispatch .
.Pp
.Fn crypto_dispatch_batch
allows the caller to collect a batch of requests and submit them to the driver
at the same time.
This allows hardware drivers to optimize the scheduling of request processing
and batch completion interrupts.
A batch is submitted to the driver by invoking the driver's process method on
each request, specifying
.Dv CRYPTO_HINT_MORE
with each request except for the last.
The
.Fa flags
parameter to
.Fn crypto_dispatch_batch
is currently ignored.
.Pp
Callback function scheduling is simpler than request scheduling.
Callbacks can either be invoked synchronously from
.Fn crypto_done ,
or they can be queued to a pool of worker threads.
This pool of worker threads is also sized to provide one worker thread
for each CPU by default.
Note that a callback function invoked synchronously from
.Fn crypto_done
must follow the same restrictions placed on threaded interrupt handlers.
.Pp
By default,
callbacks are invoked asynchronously by a worker thread.
If
.Dv CRYPTO_F_CBIMM
is set,
the callback is always invoked synchronously from
.Fn crypto_done .
If
.Dv CRYPTO_F_CBIFSYNC
is set,
the callback is invoked synchronously if the request was processed by a
software driver or asynchronously if the request was processed by a
hardware driver.
.Pp
If a request was scheduled to the taskqueue with
.Dv CRYPTO_ASYNC_ORDERED ,
callbacks are always invoked asynchronously ignoring
.Dv CRYPTO_F_CBIMM
and
.Dv CRYPTO_F_CBIFSYNC .
This flag is used by IPsec to ensure that decrypted network packets are
passed up the network stack in roughly the same order they were received.
.Ss Other Request Fields
In addition to the fields and flags enumerated above,
.Vt struct cryptop
includes the following:
.Bl -tag -width crp_payload_length
.It Fa crp_session
A reference to the active session.
This is set when the request is created by
.Fn crypto_getreq
and should not be modified.
Drivers can use this to fetch driver-specific session state or
session parameters.
.It Fa crp_etype
Error status.
Either zero on success, or an error if a request fails.
Set by drivers prior to completing a request via
.Fn crypto_done .
.It Fa crp_flags
A bitmask of flags.
.It Fa crp_cipher_key
Pointer to a request-specific encryption key.
If this value is not set,
the request uses the session encryption key.
.It Fa crp_auth_key
Pointer to a request-specific authentication key.
If this value is not set,
the request uses the session authentication key.
.It Fa crp_opaque
An opaque pointer.
This pointer permits users of the cryptographic framework to store
information about a request to be used in the callback.
.It Fa crp_callback
Callback function.
This must point to a callback function of type
.Vt void (*)(struct cryptop *) .
The callback function should inspect
.Fa crp_etype
to determine the status of the completed operation.
It should also arrange for the request to be freed via
.Fn crypto_freereq .
.It Fa crp_olen
Used with compression and decompression requests to describe the updated
length of the payload region in the data buffer.
.Pp
If a compression request increases the size of the payload,
then the data buffer is unmodified, the request completes successfully,
and
.Fa crp_olen
is set to the size the compressed data would have used.
Callers can compare this to the payload region length to determine if
the compressed data was discarded.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn crypto_dispatch
returns an error if the request contained invalid fields,
or zero if the request was valid.
.Fn crypto_getreq
returns a pointer to a new request structure on success,
or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Dv NULL
can only be returned if
.Dv M_NOWAIT
was passed in
.Fa how .

.Sh BUGS
Not all drivers properly handle mixing session and per-request keys
within a single session.
Consumers should either use a single key for a session specified in
the session parameters or always use per-request keys.
