.Nd reclaim file system resources for a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int

The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Fa vp
The vnode being reclaimed.
.El
.Pp
.Fn VOP_INACTIVE
is usually called when the kernel is no longer using the vnode.
However, there is no guarantee that it will be called at all, for example if
the last reference was dropped while the vnode lock could not be upgraded
to exclusive without sleeping.
This may be
because the reference count reaches zero or it may be that the
file system is being forcibly unmounted while there are open files.
It can be used to reclaim space on the last close of an
.Sq open but deleted
file.
.Pp
.Fn VOP_RECLAIM
is called when a vnode is being reused for a different file system.
Any file system specific resources associated with the vnode should be
freed.
.Sh LOCKS
For both
.Fn VOP_INACTIVE
and
.Fn VOP_RECLAIM ,
the
.Fa vp
will be exclusively locked on entry, and must be left exclusively
locked on return.
