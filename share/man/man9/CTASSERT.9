.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/systm.h

at compile time and causes a compiler error if it is false.
.Pp
The
.Fn CTASSERT
macro is useful for asserting the size or alignment of important
data structures and variables during compilation, which would
otherwise cause the code to fail at run time.
.Pp
The
.Fn CTASSERT
macro is not usable in userland.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Assert that the size of the
.Vt uuid
structure is 16 bytes.
.Pp
.Dl "CTASSERT(sizeof(struct uuid) == 16);"
