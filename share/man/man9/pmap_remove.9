.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pmap_remove
function removes the range of addresses between
.Fa sva
and
.Fa eva
from the physical map
.Fa pmap .
If
.Fa eva
is less than
.Fa sva ,
then the result is undefined.
It is assumed that both
.Fa sva
and
.Fa eva
are page-aligned addresses.
.Pp
The
.Fn pmap_remove_all
removes the physical page
.Fa m
from all physical maps in which it resides, and reflects back the modify
bits to the appropriate pager.
.Pp
The
.Fn pmap_remove_pages
function removes all user pages from the physical map
.Fa pmap .
This function is called when a process exits to run down its address space
more quickly than would be the case for calling
.Fn pmap_remove .
