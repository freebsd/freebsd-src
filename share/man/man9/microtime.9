.Sh NAME
.Nm bintime ,
.Nm getbintime ,
.Nm microtime ,
.Nm getmicrotime ,
.Nm nanotime ,
.Nm getnanotime
.Nd get the current time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft void
.Fn bintime "struct bintime *bt"
.Ft void
.Fn getbintime "struct bintime *bt"
.Ft void
.Fn microtime "struct timeval *tv"
.Ft void
.Fn getmicrotime "struct timeval *tv"
.Ft void
.Fn nanotime "struct timespec *ts"
.Ft void
.Fn getnanotime "struct timespec *tsp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn bintime
and
.Fn getbintime
functions store the system time as a
.Vt "struct bintime"
at the addresses specified by
.Fa bt .
The
.Fn microtime
and
.Fn getmicrotime
functions perform the same utility, but record the time as a
.Vt "struct timeval"
instead.
Similarly the
.Fn nanotime
and
.Fn getnanotime
functions store the time as a
.Vt "struct timespec" .
.Pp
The
.Fn bintime ,
.Fn microtime ,
and
.Fn nanotime
functions
always query the timecounter to return the current time as precisely as
possible.
Whereas
.Fn getbintime ,
.Fn getmicrotime ,
and
.Fn getnanotime
functions are abstractions which return a less precise, but
faster to obtain, time.
.Pp
The intent of the
.Fn getbintime ,
.Fn getmicrotime ,
and
.Fn getnanotime
functions is to enforce the user's preference for timer accuracy versus
execution time.

.Sh HISTORY
The

The
.Nm microtime
and
.Nm nanotime
functions first appeared in
.Fx 3.0
but have existed in other incarnations since
.Bx 4.4 .
