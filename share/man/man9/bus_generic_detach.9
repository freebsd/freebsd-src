.Dt BUS_GENERIC_DETACH 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bus_generic_detach
.Nd generic implementation of
.Dv DEVICE_DETACH
for buses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft int
.Fn bus_generic_detach "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function provides an implementation of the
.Xr DEVICE_DETACH 9
method
which can be used by most bus code.
It uses
.Xr bus_detach_children 9
to detach drivers from all child devices giving them a chance to veto the
detach request.
If
.Fn bus_detach_children
succeeds,
.Fn bus_generic_detach
calls
.Xr device_delete_children 9
to delete all child devices.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bus_detach_children 9 ,
.Xr device 9 ,
.Xr device_delete_children 9 ,
.Xr driver 9
