.Sh DESCRIPTION
Manipulate the verbose description of a device.
This description (if
present) is printed as part of the message when it is attached during
autoconfiguration.
The variation
.Fn device_set_desc_copy
is used to set the description if the string passed is a temporary
buffer which will be overwritten.
In this case, the system will copy
the string, otherwise the pointer passed will be used directly.
.Fn device_set_descf
is a printf-like version of
.Fn device_set_desc .
