.Sh NAME
.Nm ieee80211_ddb
.Nd 802.11 ddb support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -ragged
.Cd options DDB
.Ed
.Bd -ragged
.Cd show vap [addr]
.Cd show all vaps
.Cd show com [addr]
.Cd show sta [addr]
.Cd show statab [addr]

.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm net80211
layer includes
.Xr ddb 4
support for displaying important data structures.
This is especially important because wireless applications are often
built for embedded environments where cross-machine or post-mortem
debugging facilities like
.Xr kgdb 1 Pq Pa ports/devel/gdb
are infeasible.
.Pp
The most commonly used command is
.Bd -literal -offset indent
show all vaps/a
.Ed
.Pp
which dumps the contents of all
.Vt ieee80211vap ,
.Vt ieee80211com ,
and
.Vt ieee80211_node
data structures in the system.
