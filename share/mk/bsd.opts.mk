# Option file for bmake builds. These options are available to all users of
# bmake (including the source tree userland and kernel builds). They generally
# control how binaries are made, shared vs dynamic, etc and some general options
# relevant for all build environments.
#
# Users define WITH_FOO and WITHOUT_FOO on the command line or in /etc/src.conf
# and /etc/make.conf files. These translate in the build system to MK_FOO={yes,no}
# with (usually) sensible defaults.
#
# Makefiles must include bsd.opts.mk after defining specific MK_FOO options that
# are applicable for that Makefile (typically there are none, but sometimes there
# are exceptions). Recursive makes usually add MK_FOO=no for options that they wish
# to omit from that make.
#
# Makefiles must include bsd.mkopt.mk before they test the value of any MK_FOO
# variable.
#
# Makefiles may also assume that this file is included by bsd.own.mk should it
# need variables defined there prior to the end of the Makefile where
# bsd.{subdir,lib.bin}.mk is traditionally included.
#
# The old-style YES_FOO and NO_FOO are being phased out. No new instances of them
# should be added. Old instances should be removed since they were just to
# bridge the gap between FreeBSD 4 and FreeBSD 5.
#
# Makefiles should never test WITH_FOO or WITHOUT_FOO directly (although an
# exception is made for _WITHOUT_SRCONF which turns off this mechanism
# completely).

# All other variables used to build /usr/src live in src.opts.mk
# and variables from both files are documented in src.conf(5).
