# would point at ${TESTSBASE}/bin/cp/.

# Tell bsd.test.mk that we are providing a hand-crafted Kyuafile in this

# bsd.test.mk auto-generate one for you based on the PLAIN_TESTS_*

# The basic semantics of this are the same as FILES in bsd.progs.mk, e.g. the
# installation of the files can be manipulated via ${PACKAGE}FILESDIR,
# ${PACKAGE}FILESMODE, etc.

# Please see comment above about ${PACKAGE}. Feel free to omit the ${PACKAGE}
# namespace if release package support isn't needed.
