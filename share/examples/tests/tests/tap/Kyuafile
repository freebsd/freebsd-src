-- All tests provided by the FreeBSD base system should set the test_suite
-- property to FreeBSD.  This creates a namespace in the configuration file
-- in which specific run-time properties can be passed to the tests below.
test_suite('FreeBSD')

-- Register the various test programs into the test suite defined in this
-- directory.

-- Because plain test programs cannot define metadata in their code (they
-- have no mechanism to communicate that to Kyua), we can instead define
-- any metadata properties in here.  These have the exact same meaning as
-- their ATF counterparts.  These properties are often useful to define
-- prerequisites for the execution of the tests.
