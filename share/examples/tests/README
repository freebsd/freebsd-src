This directory contains sample test programs along the Makefile and
Kyuafile logic to get them build and installed.

The goal of these test programs is to illustrate, via simple and
heaviliy-commented code, how to construct test programs using all the
supported interfaces in the system.

If you use any files in here as templates for your own code, please
remove all comments while doing so and then write your own if necessary.

The subdirectories here contain:

* tests/: Regular directory containing the tests code.  Note that the
  apparently-redundant tests/tests/ path component here is expected for
  consistency reasons and required to get the right layout under
  /usr/tests/.

* tests/atf/: Tests that use the ATF libraries, including atf-c, atf-c++
  and atf-sh.  See kyua-atf-interface(1) for details.

* tests/plain/: Tests that do not use any testing framework.  See
  kyua-plain-interface(1) for details.

To inspect the available sample test cases from an installed system:

    $ kyua list -k /usr/tests/share/examples/tests/Kyuafile

To run the full suite of sample test cases:

    $ kyua test -k /usr/tests/share/examples/tests/Kyuafile

And to debug a specific failing test case, if any:

    $ kyua debug -k /usr/tests/share/examples/tests/Kyuafile \
      atf/cp_test:simple
