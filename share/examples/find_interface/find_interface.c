/*
 * This is a simple program which demonstrates how to query the kernel
 * routing mechanism using only a UDP socket.  Pass it a hostname on
 * the command line (sorry, it doesn't parse dotted decimal) and it will
 * print out an IP address which names the interface over which UDP
 * packets intended for that destination would be sent.
 * A more sophisticated program might use the list obtained from SIOCGIFCONF
 * to match the address with an interface name, but applications programmers
 * much more often need to know the address of the interface rather than
 * the name.
