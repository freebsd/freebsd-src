#
# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that comprise the FreeBSD
# cvs development tree.  CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download
# the latest cvs tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your
# system easily and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup
# is aimed at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows to
# keep your CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup cvs-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 cvs-supfile
#
# If your network link is ISDN or slower, you'll save time by using
# compression.  Either add the "-z" option to the cvsup command line,
# or add the "compress" keyword to each collection in this supfile.
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# base=/usr	
#		base specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.
#
# prefix=/home/ncvs
#		prefix specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/home/ncvs" will place all of the files
#		requested in /home/ncvs (ie /home/ncvs/src/bin, 
#		/home/ncvs/ports archivers). The directory that is the
#		prefix must exist in order for CVSup to transfer files
#		successfully.

## Ports Collection
#
# There are two ways to CVSup the latest ports.  One is to use the individual
# collections, and the other is to use the "ports-all" mega-collection,
# which includes all the ports-* collections.

# If you want to specify individual collections, don't forget to comment
# out ports-all above.
