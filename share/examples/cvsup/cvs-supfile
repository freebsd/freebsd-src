# $FreeBSD$
#
# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that make up the
# CVS development tree of the FreeBSD system.
#
# CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest CVS
# tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your system easily
# and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed
# at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows
# to keep your CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup cvs-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 cvs-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=CHANGE_THIS.FreeBSD.org
#		This specifies the server host which will supply the
#		file updates.  You must change it to one of the CVSup
#		mirror sites listed in the FreeBSD Handbook at
#		http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors.html.
#		You can	override this setting on the command line
#		with cvsup's "-h host" option.
#
# base=/usr
#		This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.  You can override the
#		"base" setting on the command line with cvsup's "-b base"
#		option.  This directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/home/ncvs
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/home/ncvs" will place all of the files
#		requested in /home/ncvs (e.g., "/home/ncvs/src/bin",
#		"/home/ncvs/ports/archivers").  The prefix directory
#		must exist in order to run CVSup.

# Defaults that apply to all the collections
#
# IMPORTANT: Change the next line to use one of the CVSup mirror sites
# listed at http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mirrors.html.
*default host=CHANGE_THIS.FreeBSD.org
*default base=/usr
*default prefix=/home/ncvs
*default release=cvs
*default delete use-rel-suffix

# If you seem to be limited by CPU rather than network or disk bandwidth, try
# commenting out the following line.  (Normally, today's CPUs are fast enough
# that you want to run compression.)

## Main Source Tree.
#
# The easiest way to get the main source tree is to use the "src-all"
# mega-collection.  It includes all of the individual "src-*" collections.
src-all

# These are the individual collections that make up "src-all".  If you
# use these, be sure to comment out "src-all" above.
#src-base
#src-bin
#src-contrib
#src-etc
#src-games
#src-gnu
#src-include
#src-kerberos5
#src-kerberosIV
#src-lib
#src-libexec
#src-release
#src-sbin
#src-share
#src-sys
#src-tools
#src-usrbin
#src-usrsbin
# These are the individual collections that make up FreeBSD's crypto
# collection. They are no longer export-restricted and are a part of
# src-all
#src-crypto
#src-eBones
#src-secure
#src-sys-crypto

## Ports Collection.
#
# The easiest way to get the ports tree is to use the "ports-all"
# mega-collection.  It includes all of the individual "ports-*"
# collections,
ports-all

# These are the individual collections that make up "ports-all".  If you
# use these, be sure to comment out "ports-all" above and always include
# "ports-base" if you use any of the other individual collections below.
# Your ports may not build correctly without an up-to-date "ports-base".
#
#ports-base
#
#ports-arabic
#ports-archivers
#ports-astro
#ports-audio
#ports-benchmarks
#ports-biology

## Documentation
#
# The easiest way to get the doc tree is to use the "doc-all"
# mega-collection.  It includes all of the individual "doc-*"
# collections,
doc-all

## CVSROOT control files
#
# This is to get the control files that cvs(1) needs and the commit logs.
cvsroot-all

# These are the individual collections that make up "cvsroot-all"  If you
# use these, be sure to comment out "cvsroot-all" above.  "cvsroot-common"
# is a synthetic CVSROOT that has all the modules from the other CVSROOT-*
# directories merged into one, and merged commitlogs via symlinks.
#cvsroot-common
#cvsroot-src
#cvsroot-ports
#cvsroot-doc
