This directory contains sample "supfiles" for obtaining and updating
the FreeBSD sources via the Internet.  These supfiles will work
with CVSup version 14.0 or later.  For general information on CVSup
itself, please see http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/cvsup.html

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-current release, use these files:

    standard-supfile		Main source tree

    secure-supfile		International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

    ports-supfile		Ports collection

To maintain the sources for the FreeBSD-stable release, use these files:

    stable-supfile		Main source tree

    secure-stable-supfile	International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

To maintain a copy of the CVS repository containing all versions of
FreeBSD, use these files:

    cvs-supfile			Main source tree and ports collection

    secure-cvs-supfile		International secure distribution
				(outside USA and Canada)

To maintain a copy of the FreeBSD bug database, use the file:

    gnats-supfile               FreeBSD bug database

IMPORTANT: Before you use any of the supfiles in this directory,
you will need to edit in an appropriate "host" setting.  See:

    http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/mirrors.html

for an up-to-date list of public CVSup mirror sites.
