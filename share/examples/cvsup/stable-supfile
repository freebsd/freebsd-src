# This file contains all of the "CVSup collections" that make up the
# FreeBSD-stable source tree.
#
# CVSup (CVS Update Protocol) allows you to download the latest CVS
# tree (or any branch of development therefrom) to your system easily
# and efficiently (far more so than with sup, which CVSup is aimed
# at replacing).  If you're running CVSup interactively, and are
# currently using an X display server, you should run CVSup as follows
# to keep your CVS tree up-to-date:
#
#	cvsup stable-supfile
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 stable-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=cvsup.FreeBSD.org
#		This specifies the server host which will supply the
#		file updates.  Please change this to one of the mirror
#		sites if possible.  (See the "README" file.)  You can
#		override this setting on the command line with cvsup's
#		"-h host" option.
#
# base=/usr
#		This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.  You can override the
#		"base" setting on the command line with cvsup's "-b base"
#		option.  This directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/usr
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr" will place all of the files requested
#		in "/usr/src" (e.g., "/usr/src/bin", "/usr/src/lib").
#		The prefix directory must exist in order to run CVSup.

# DANGER!  WARNING!  LOOK OUT!  VORSICHT!
#
# If you add any of the ports collections to this file, be sure to
# specify them like this:
#
#   ports-all tag=.
#
# If you leave out the "tag=." portion, CVSup will delete all of
# the files in your ports tree.  That is because "RELENG_2_1_0" and
# "RELENG_2_2" are not valid tags for the ports portion of the CVS
# repository.

## Main Source Tree.
#
# The easiest way to get the main source tree is to use the "src-all"
# mega-collection.  It includes all of the individual "src-*" collections,
# except "src-crypto",  "src-eBones", and "src-secure".
src-all

# These are the individual collections that make up "src-all".  If you
# use these, be sure to comment out "src-all" above.
#src-base
#src-bin
#src-contrib
#src-etc
#src-games
#src-gnu
#src-include
#src-kerberosIV
#src-lib
#src-libexec
#src-release
#src-sbin
#src-share
#src-sys
#src-tools
#src-usrbin
#src-usrsbin

## Export-restricted collections.
#
# Only people in the USA and Canada may fetch these collections.  If
# you are not in the USA or Canada, please use the collections in the
# "secure-supfile" instead.
#src-crypto
#src-eBones
#src-secure
