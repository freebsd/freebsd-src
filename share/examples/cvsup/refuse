#This is an example "refuse file".  CVSup will not touch anything listed
#in the refuse file.
#
#You can copy this file to your sup directory and uncomment or add
#whatever you would like.  If you are using the default setting for the
#CVSup "base" directory, your sup directory is /usr/sup.  If you have
#changed your base directory, your sup directory is /path/to/base/sup.
#
#Use this example if you have modified /usr/src/etc/sendmail/freebsd.mc
#to reflect your local configuration, and you do not want CVSup to
#overwrite it:
#
#etc/sendmail/freebsd.mc
#
#If you list a directory, changes to any files beneath that directory
#will be rejected.  For example, if you are an English speaker and are
#not tracking the foreign-language ports, you can uncomment the following.
#
#ports/chinese
#ports/german
#ports/japanese
#ports/korean
#ports/russian
#ports/vietnamese
#
#Use this feature with care -- many parts of the src distribution depend
#on files in completely different parts.
