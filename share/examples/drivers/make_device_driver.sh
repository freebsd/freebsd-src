# cd /usr/src; make buildkernel KERNCONF=FOO
#
# More interestingly, it creates a modules/foo directory
# which it populates, to allow you to compile a FOO module
# which can be linked with your presently running kernel (if you feel brave).
# To do so:
# cd /sys/modules/foo; make depend; make; make install; kldload foo

# arg1 to this script is expected to be lowercase "foo"
# arg2 path to the kernel sources, "/sys" if omitted

 *
 * For NON-PNP "dumb" devices:

 * loadable with the driver.
 * In the 'dumb' case we end up with more children than needed but
 * some (or all) of them will fail probe() and only waste a little memory.
 *
 * For NON-PNP "Smart" devices:
 * If the device has a NON-PNP way of being detected and setting/sensing
 * the card, then do that here and add a child for each set of
 * hardware found.
 *
 * For PNP devices:
 * If the device is always PNP capable then this function can be removed.
 * The ISA PNP system will have automatically added it to the system and
 * so your identify routine needn't do anything.
 *
 * If the device is mentioned in the 'hints' file then this
 * function can be removed. All devices mentioned in the hints
 * file get added as children for probing, whether or not the
 * driver is linked in. So even as a module it MAY still be there.
