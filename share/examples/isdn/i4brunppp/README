BEWARE: HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!
---------------------------

This program is used in conjunction with an isdnd.rc entry similar to

	regexpr = "ULPPP.*call active"   # look for matches in log messages
	regprog = i4brunppp              # execute program when match is found

this one (see also i4brunppp-isdnd.rc).

i4brunppp _must_ be put into /etc/isdn!

When an active call is detected, isdnd fires off i4brunppp, which attaches
the rbch device used to stdin/stdout and then runs ppp which is given the
"-direct" command and the string "inc_rbchX" (where X is the i4brbch unit
number) as arguments.
