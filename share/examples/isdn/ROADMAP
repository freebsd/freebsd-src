1.	Documentation
---------------------

	The command "apropos isdn" will list all manpages available for 
	isdn4bsd. Two more manual pages of interest to syncronous PPP 
	over ISDN users are the pages for sppp and spppcontrol.

	Under directory /usr/share/examples/isdn, you will find:

	FAQ		- isdn4bsd Frequently Asked Questions
	Overview	- short technical overview (a bit outdated)
	README		- the original isdn4bsd README file
	ROADMAP		- this file
	Resources	- some more information about ISDN
	isdnd_acct	- perl script to produce accounting reports


2.	Configuration
---------------------

	Configuration of the isdn4bsd package consists of:

	- configuring a kernel suitable for running isdn4bsd. An
	  example kernel configuration can be found in the file
	  /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT. The options available for
	  isic device driver in the kernel configuration file are
	  described in the output of "man isic".

	- configuring the network interfaces iprX and/or ispX; the
	  former are used for "IP over raw HDLC" and the latter are
	  used for "sync PPP over ISDN". To configure the ipr-
	  interfaces, read the output of "man i4bipr", to configure
	  the isp-interfaces, read the output of "man i4bisppp",
	  "man sppp" and "man spppcontrol" carefully.
	  Most of this configuration is now available thru the ISDN
	  and spppcontrol sections in /etc/rc.conf.

	- writing a configuration file /etc/isdn/isdnd.rc for the
	  isdn daemon isdnd(8) which is responsible for the ISDN
	  call control mechanisms such as: dial on demand, dial
	  retry, dial recovery, timeout and short hold operation.
	  A sample (!) file can be found in /etc/isdn. Please read
	  the output of "man isdnd" and "man isdnd.rc" carefully.


2.	Userland programs
-------------------------

	The userland programs can be found in the sourcetree under
	/usr/src/usr.sbin/i4b and get installed under /usr/sbin.

	Isdntest will not be installed by default.


3.	Kernel part
-------------------

	The kernel part of isdn4bsd can be found at /usr/src/sys/i4b.


4.	Answering machine messages
----------------------------------

	Messages to be used by the answering machine can be found in
	/usr/share/isdn, you'll find the numbers 0 to 9, a beep and
	a short announcement message here.
