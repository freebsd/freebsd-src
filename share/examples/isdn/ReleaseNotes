ReleaseNotes for isdn4bsd             last edit-date: [Sun Aug 11 17:39:06 2002]
================================================================================

release 1.03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add support for Data over Voice (DoV) outgoing calls, see entry keywork 
  bcap in isdnd.rc(5).
  based on patches received from Guy Ellis (guy@traverse.com.au),
  Chris Collins (xfire@xware.cx) and Phillip Musumeci (phillip@cs.jcu.edu.au).

release 1.02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add support for ISDN subaddressing written by Steve Looman

- made ELSA PCC16 attach correctly (again ?)

- fixed bug in CAPI support (patch from Juha-Matti Liukkonen <jml@cubical.fi>)

- add support written by Steve Looman for the Compaq Microcom 610 ISDN card 
  (also known as Compaq series PSB2222I).

release 1.01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - add experimental support to send messages via the keypad facility to the
   PBX or exchange office. The messages - if supported - may be used to 
   configure and maintain optional services offered by the PBX or exchange
   office such as call deflection mailbox services. Please consult the
   nice documentation for the exchange you are connected to.

   Currently keypad messages can be send by using the isdnphone utilities
   "-k" switch on the command line. Don't forget to properly quote the
   message in case it contains shell meta characters!

 - add keyword "maxconnecttime" to isdnd to prevent a potential telco bill
   desaster. Caution: use only in conjunction with budgets to limit the number
   of dials per timeunit otherwise you will get endless redials and reconnects!

release 1.00
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - CAPI interface driver and AVM B1/T1 driver added. Both were written and
   contributed by Juha-Matti Liukkonen <jml@cubical.fi> of Cubical Solutions 
   Ltd, Finnland. To support this, two new keywords were added to isdnd.rc:
   "firmware" to be used in the controller section and "clone" to be used
   in the entry section.


beta release 0.96
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - it is now possible to mark an entry as valid for a specified day of week
   and a specific time range only to take advantage of some new tariff models.
   Please see the new keywords "valid" and "holidayfile" in isdnd.rc(5).
   This feature is considered experimental, use at your own risk!

 - keywords budget-callbacksfile and budget-calloutsfile added to isdnd's
   entry section to write statistics information to a file

 - a driver for the Dynalink IS64PH is now available for FreeBSD 4.x and up


beta release 0.95
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - ITK ix1 micro ISA non-PnP card should now work for FreeBSD >= 4.0

 - setting "dialretries = -1" in isdnd.rc gives an unlimited number
   of dial retries for that entry.

 - the ELSA PCFpro ISDN card should now work for FreeBSD >= 4.0

 - added new keywords (patch from Stefan Esser) to configure isppp
   from within isdnd.rc. Documented in isdnd.rc(5), grep for "ppp-"

 - isppp VJ compression negotiation now run-time configurable using
   keywords "enable-vj" / "disable-vj" with ispppcontrol

 - added new keywords to specify "budgets" for outbound calls in isdnd
   to limit the number of possible calls within a given time period.
   Runtime budget information and statistics are available in the isdnd
   fullscreen menu display.

 - added new "ifpnp" AVM Fritz!Card PnP driver for FreeBSD >= 4.0
   contributed by Udo Schweigert.

 - added experimental hardware driver from Hans Petter Selasky for the
   Teles 16.3c card based on the Cologne Chip Designs HFC-S 2BDS0 chip
   called "ihfc".
   notes for Teles 16.3c PnP and AcerISDN P10: For optimal performance:
   	-> please connect the card to the S0-bus before booting the computer.
   	-> do not change the cable you're using when first booted.
   Other notes if the card does not work at all:
   	-> disconnect other isdn equipment on your S0-bus and
   	   reboot your computer.
   	-> try changing the CLKDEL/stdel value for your card: 
   	../i4b/layer1-nb/ihfc/i4b_ihfc_pnp.c or
   	../i4b/layer1/ihfc/i4b_ihfc_pnp.c
   	around line 100. The value can be in the range 0x0-0xf.

 - the FreeBSD >= 4.0 AVM Fritz PCI driver was moved to a separate layer 1 
   driver called "ifpi".

 - the sppp subsystem was integrated into the i4bisppp/isp driver. There
   is no need to include something like "option sppp" into your kernel
   config file anymore. The spppcontrol utility is no longer usable to
   configure the i4bisppp/isp driver, instead use the new ispppcontrol
   utility!

 - FreeBSD >= 4.0: "iwic" driver for Winbond PCI ISDN chipset (W6692) 
   added, used i.e. in ASUSCOM P-IN100-ST-D and Dynalink IS64PPH.

 - added more protocol decoding to isdntrace

 - isntrace now adds a time/datestamp to the trace filename, signal USR1
   behaviour has changed, see manpage.
 
 - ispppcontrol now has a new option of setting the LCP timeout value

 - add directory mpd which contains docs and files on howto interface
   i4b by using the netgraph subsystem to the multilink ppp daemon, mpd.

 - add i4bing, a raw HDLC B-channel interface to the NetGraph subsystem
 
 - add a V.21 modem emulator written by Poul-Henning Kamp
 
 - a new system configuration keyword "extcallattr" was added to isdnd
   which allows to configure the display of the extended caller
   attributes "screening indicator" and "presentation indicator" in
   isdnd's log file.


beta release 0.90
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - the following cards are no longer supported for FreeBSD 4.0 and up:

	AVM Fritz!Card PnP
	AVM Fritz!Card PCMCIA
	Dynalink IS64PH
	ITK ix1 Micro
	USRobotics Sportster ISDN TA intern

   The AVM cards, the USR card and perhaps one of the ITK cards are likely
   to be resurrected in the future, we just ran out of time, docs and/or
   into programming problems for this release.

 - the rbch driver was enhanced to support the generation of accounting 
   information in HDLC mode. The bytecount and bps fields in isdnd
   fullscreen mode now show meaningful information.

 - most of the layer1 drivers have been rewritten to support the new bus 
   and driver architecture for FreeBSD 4.0.

 - the ipr interfaces now support logging of some of the first ip packets
   of a new connection and displaying them in the isdnd logs. To enable
   this, add a line like: "options IPR_LOG=32" to your kernel config
   file. The parameter to IPR_LOG specifies the number of packets to be
   logged.

 - support for FreeBSD 2.x and FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE has been removed. 
   The last beta release which supports this OS versions is i4b-0.83.

 - isdnd now recognizes two new keywords in the system section, mailto
   and mailer. mailer is used to configure a mail program and is typically
   set to /usr/bin/mail and mailto is set to the address of the isdnd
   administrator. If both are set and a fatal error inside isdnd
   happenes, mail is sent to the address in mailto with the error 
   message before isdnd terminates.

 - isdnd.rc now has an optional new "controller" section. This will be 
   used to specify different D-channel protocols in the future. It looks
   like this:

	controller
	protocol = dss1	# dss1 (default) or d64s (leased line)

   Please note that leased line support (d64s) is NOT yet functional!

 - isdnmonitor is now able to be used like isdnd in fullscreen mode from
   a remote machine.
