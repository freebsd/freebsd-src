Note: This is a modified README from the isdn4bsd 0.71.00 ftp-distribution. 

      In December 1998, i4b was integrated into the FreeBSD sourcetree
      and so the following parts about FreeBSD may not apply completely
      anymore. 

      For information of how isdn4bsd is integrated into FreeBSD now, please
      read the file ROADMAP in this directory.

1. Disclaimer:
--------------

  It may be illegal in your country to connect an ISDN4BSD based machine 
  using a passive ISDN card to the ISDN at your site because the protocol 
  stack of ISDN4BSD, which is necessary to run passive cards, has not been 
  approved by the telecommunication certification authority of your country. 
  If in doubt, please contact your local ISDN provider !

2. What is ISDN4BSD ?
---------------------

ISDN4BSD (or in short i4b) is a package for interfacing a computer running
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD or BSD/OS to the ISDN.

The only ISDN protocol currently supported is the BRI protocol specified in
I.430, Q.921 and Q.931; better known as DSS1 or Euro-ISDN.  

ISDN4BSD allows you to make IP network connections by using either IP packets
sent in raw HDLC frames on the B channel or by using synchronous PPP. 

For telephony, ISDN4BSD can answer incoming phone calls like an answering 
machine.


3. Which BSD's are supported ?
------------------------------

FreeBSD:
	I4B was integrated into FreeBSD in January 1999, so it is part
	of FreeBSD-current and FreeBSD 3.1 (stable).

	FreeBSD 2.2.x is no longer supported by i4b, this release might
	still run on 2.2 but upcoming i4b releases will not!

	Please take the time to read the file FreeBSD/INSTALLATION (and 
	the other available documentation) carefully. Thank you!


NetBSD/i386:

	Important note for i4b users on NetBSD/i386:
	============================================

	While the previous releases of i4b mainly supported the latest
	official releases, this new release now depends on NetBSD-current
	(1.3G or newer). The old stuff is still there, just in case you
	are running an older version, but you need to read the installation
	instructions in NetBSD/INSTALLATION carefully!
	This step was necessary as installation now differs a lot since i4b
	has some prerequisites officially included in -current.

	---------

	The NetBSD specific support and the Diehl driver was written by 
	Martin Husemann, (martin@rumolt.teuto.de). Since i do not intend
	to run NetBSD and/or Diehl cards, i suggest contacting him in 
	case of problems in this two areas. 
	Martin has NetBSD/i386 1.3 running and is supporting ISDN4BSD for
	that platform as his time permits it.

NetBSD/Amiga:
	The NetBSD/Atari 1.3F specific support was done by Ignatios Souvatzis,
	(is@netbsd.org).

NetBSD/Atari:
	The NetBSD/Atari 1.3 specific support was done by Leo Weppelman,
	(leo@wau.mis.ah.nl).

OpenBSD/i386:
	The OpenBSD/i386 2.2 specific support was done by Bas Oude Nijeweme
	(bon@serious.xs4all.nl). He reports that it is also running fine 
	under OpenBSD 2.3. Known to work under OpenBSD is currently the 
	Teles 16.3 and the Teles S0/16, reports for other cards welcome!

	NOTICE:
	Isdn4bsd version 0.70 has not been tested with OpenBSD at all,
	it would be great to have someone who likes to work on i4b under
	OpenBSD regularly and takes over the maintenance for that OS!

BSD/OS
	The BSD/OS 4.0 specific support was done by Bert Driehuis. The
	support is not yet complete. Please contact Bert directly in case
	of questions regarding this at bert_driehuis@nl.compuware.com.

Note 1:	Only the ISA, non-PnP AVM Fritz!Card (also now known as "Fritz!Card
	callsic") is supported; the PnP version is unsupported! 
	The "Teledat 150" sold by the german Telekom seems to be an AVM 
	Fritz!Card classic.

Note 2:	FreeBSD
		This is a PnP card. To run it under FreeBSD, you need
		FreeBSD 2.2.6 RELEASE or higher.
	NetBSD
		The NetBSD version has not been verified to work yet.

Note 3: Due to its design, this card produces 128 IRQs/sec. This can be
	reportedly stopped by disconnecting pin 12 of the 7474 and wiring
	it to pin 15 of the 74175. Be careful! This procedure has not been
	verified and doing this will immediately terminate your warranty !!
	The card will not function anymore with drivers for other OSes and
	you may not get any further support from the manufacturer! YMMV!

Note 4: Only the 16.3 is supported; the 16.3c and the 16.3 PnP are currently
	unsupported !

Note 5: The card has not been verified to work yet.

Note 6: This driver is currently under development by Gary Jennejohn who
	develops under FreeBSD only.

Note 7: This driver is currently under construction by Martin Husemann who
	develops under NetBSD only.

Note 8: This driver is currently under development by Hellmuth Michaelis who
	develops under FreeBSD only.

Note 9: This driver was developed by German Tischler, tanis@gaspode.franken.de.
	Please contact him in case of trouble. The "Teledat 100" sold by the 
	german Telekom is identical with this card.
	
Note 10: This driver is developed by Matthias Apitz, matthias.apitz@sisis.de.
	FreeBSD
		Please contact him in case of trouble.
		Please read the file README.PCCARD in the i4b distribution for
		additional installation instructions.
	NetBSD
		Experimental driver support by Martin Husemann.

Note 11: This driver was developed by Martijn Plak (tigrfhur@xs4all.nl)
	Please contact him in case of trouble. This driver might also work 
	for Asuscom cards. (Andrew Gordon wrote: Just to let you know that
	I've now tried the i4b "dynalink" driver with the ASUSCOM 
	I-IN100-ST-DV card, and it appears to work fine.)

Note 12: This driver was developed by Ignatios Souvatzis (is@netbsd.org)
	Please contact him in case of trouble.
	This driver is supposed to work on the ISDN Master versions and
	lookalikes, like the ISDN Blaster.

Note 13: This driver was developed by Martin Husemann under NetBSD and has
	not been tested under FreeBSD yet. Feedback welcome!

Note 14: This driver was developed by Gary Jennejohn who develops under
	FreeBSD only. In case of problems with this driver, please contact
	him directly at garyj@muc.de.


5. Where do i find documentation for ISDN4BSD ?
-----------------------------------------------

- For installation instructions have a look under the the FreeBSD, NetBSD
  and OpenBSD directories, each of these contains a file "INSTALLATION"
  which describes the installation procedure for isdn4bsd on those operating
  systems.

- Every program has a man page in the respective subdirectory and every 
  driver has a man page in the "man" subdirectory. All the man pages are 
  installed by running "make install" so its very easy to access them
  (hint: try "apropos isdn4bsd" after you installed isdn4bsd, it displays
   all available manual pages).

- misc/Overview contains a short technical overview of the inner workings 
  of isdn4bsd.

- misc/Resources contains URL's and ISBN's to more interesting ISDN related
  stuff.

- handbook/i4b.ps contains a handbook for isdn4bsd.


6. How do i install ISDN4BSD ?
------------------------------

Read the instructions in the file {FreeBSD|NetBSD|OpenBSD}/INSTALLATION. 

In case they are incomplete, unclear, wrong or outdated, please send me an 
update for inclusion into a future distribution!


7. Where do i get support for ISDN4BSD ?
----------------------------------------

I will support and help with ISDN4BSD as my time permits it. Please 
keep in mind that in this case support is given on a voluntary basis
and your questions might not be answered immediately.

Also, i recommend subscribing to the mailing list mentioned below.

Due to the experience gained supporting the predecessor of ISDN4BSD, let
me please clearly state that there is no guarantee that your bug will be
fixed within some specific amount of time, in fact there is no guarantee 
that your bug will be fixed at all; i'll do my best but there might be
more important things going on in my life than giving free support for
ISDN4BSD. Some bugs seem to occur only in certain environments and are
not reproduceable here without access to the equipment you are connected
to or other equipment like ISDN simulators (which i don't get access to
for free): in this case you are the only person being able to trace down
the bug and fix it.


8.  Where do i get commercial support for ISDN4BSD ?
----------------------------------------------------

In case you want to pay for support, maintenance, enhancements, extensions
to isdn4bsd or whatever else you may need, it is possible to hire me for
reasonable rates through my employer HCS GmbH; in this case please contact 
me for details at hm@hcs.de or look at http://www.freebsd-support.de.


9. How can i help and/or support ISDN4BSD ?
-------------------------------------------

I would really like to hear from you! (even if it runs out of the box :-)

I'm open for suggestions, bugreports, fixes, patches, enhancements and 
comments to improve ISDN4BSD. 

Please send flames to /dev/null and/or start writing your own ISDN package.

ISDN4BSD is a project on a voluntary basis and writing and supporting
communication systems like ISDN4BSD costs much money and much time.

Any contribution in terms of equipment, cards, documentation, cash
and/or daytime payed work on ISDN4BSD would be highly appreciated.

You can help by not only reporting bugs, but by sending in a patch for
the problem together with a bugreport.

In case you cannot fix something yourself, please describe your problem
as detailed as possible, include information which version of an operating
system you are running, which ISDN board you are using, to which kind
of ISDN equipment (like the brand of PBX) you are connected etc. etc.

In case you want to get a currently unsupported card supported, write a
low level driver for it yourself and submit it. In case you can't write
it yourself there is a good chance to get it supported if you can donate
one of those cards and - if at all possible - docs for it.


10. How do i report bugs ?
--------------------------

Please submit patches ONLY as context diffs (diff -c)!

I vastly prefer receiving bug fixes and enhancements that are clearly
differentiated. I don't always know what to do with large patches that
contain many bugs and enhances folded into the same context diffs. 

Please keep it to one fix or enhancement per patch!

If your change modifies the external interface of an ISDN4BSD program,
i.e. more config options, command-line switches, new programs, etc., 
then please also include patches for the manual pages and documentation.

Thank you!


11. Is there a mailing-list available for ISDN4BSD ?
---------------------------------------------------

There is a mailing list available at

        freebsd-isdn@freebsd.org

The list is maintained by majordomo, so i.e. to subscribe,
send a mail with the text

        subscribe freebsd-isdn
        
in the message body sent to

        majordomo@freebsd.org

This mailing list is NOT (!) FreeBSD specific, everyone is welcome there!


12. Where can i get ISDN4BSD ?
------------------------------

The ISDN4BSD package is available from:

	isdn4bsd@ftp.consol.de/pub
	--------------------------

you have to log in as user

	isdn4bsd
	--------

and give your mail address as the password. Then change to the "pub" 
directory. You will find the latest available ISDN4BSD package.

Anonymous ftp as user "ftp" or "anonymous" will NOT (!) give the desired
result !

This is a sample session:

	$ ftp ftp.consol.de
	Connected to stage.consol.de.
	220 ProFTPD 1.0.0 Server (ConSol* Data Exchange) [stage]
	Name (ftp.consol.de:root): isdn4bsd
	331 Anonymous login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
	Password:
	230 Anonymous access granted, restrictions apply.
	Remote system type is UNIX.
	Using binary mode to transfer files.
	ftp> cd pub
	250 CWD command successful.
	ftp>


13. What is the reward for reading everything in this file ?
------------------------------------------------------------

Have fun!
