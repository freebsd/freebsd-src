# This is a working example of ppp.conf.span-isp that uses ppp connections
# to the same machine through 3 null-modem serial cables.
#
#    cuaD03  <-> cuaD04
#    cuaD01  <-> cuaD06
#    cuaD00  <-> cuaD07
#
# with gettys running on cuaD04, cuaD06 and cuaD07.  The gettytab entry
# for these devices has a pp= capability that references a script that
# says:
#
#    #! /bin/sh
#    tty=$(tty)
#    exec /usr/sbin/pppin -direct isp-in-${tty#${tty%?}}
#
# The whole thing is brought up with these commands:
#
#    ppp -b isp1
#    ppp -b isp2
#    ppp -b isp3
#
# Something rather strange happens here.
# If you connect to the vpn-in diagnostic socket with ``pppctl
# /var/run/ppp/vpn-in'' and do a ``show links'', only a single link shows up.
# If you connect to the vpn diagnostic socket (which is created in
# ppp.linkup.span-isp.working, you see three links.  This is because inetd
# is told to ``wait'' for ppp to finish and the receiving ppp gets to
# handle all incoming packets on the first descriptor.
#
# This is why enabling LQR won't work - VPN-IN has magic number problems,
# fails to reply to LQRs and the VPN invocations end up shutting down.
#
# If anyone can come up with a better way of doing PPP over UDP I'd be
# interrested to hear it.  Currently, the server doesn't connect() or
# bind().... but the client connect()s.  Is there any other way ?
