CARD=sr0

# create an interface "ng0" and attach it to the sync port.
# The packets had jolly well better be IP because we are not discriminating.
ngctl mkpeer ${CARD}: iface rawdata inet

# if ng0 already exists, use a CONNECT command instead of a mkpeer. e.g.
# ngctl connect ${CARD}: ng0: rawdata inet

# Then use ifconfig on interface ng0 as usual
