This is a simple example of the firmware(9) system.  It consists of two
parts:

1) fwimage
	This is the firmware image (the ascii art of beastie from the boot
	menu).  The Makefile lists the firmware file "firmware.img" and the
	short handle for this firmware image "beastie".
	Note that the module is called "beastie" as well so that it can be
	loaded automatically if requested.

2) fwconsumer
	This module tries to get the a firmware image called "beastie",
	checks if the data is '\0'-terminated and prints it to the console.
	It keeps a reference to the firmware until it is unloaded.

This is mainly to demonstrate how to construct firmware image modules.
