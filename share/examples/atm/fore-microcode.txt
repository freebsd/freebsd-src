HARP and FORE Systems Microcode
===============================

ATM adapters from FORE Systems use Intel i960 embedded processors and 
require that application software (herein called "microcode") be downloaded
and executed on the adapter. The interface between the microcode and the host
device driver is specified in the FORE ATM Adaptation Layer Interface (AALI) 
(available from ftp.fore.com:/pub/docs/port). HARP uses microcode supplied 
by FORE Systems. The HARP device driver for the FORE adapter (hfa) conforms 
to the AALI specification.

As part of the HARP ATM initialization procedure, the HARP 'fore_dnld' utility
must be invoked in order to load the microcode file into each FORE adapter.
However, the microcode file is NOT included in the FreeBSD distribution. It is 
the user's responsibilty to obtain and install the FORE microcode file. Below 
are notes to assist users in finding and installing microcode known to work
with HARP. 

FORE microcode files can be obtained from either FORE's web site
(http://www.fore.com) or the CD distributed with new FORE adapters.
When using FORE's web site, you must have a valid login to access the
TACtics Online section of the site. The software download section is
available via the 'Services & Support'->'TACtics Online'->Software links.

If you are currently using HARP and already have a working microcode file, 
that microcode will continue to work with this release of HARP.


PCA200E
-------

From the FORE web pages, the following PCA200E adapter distributions
are known to have microcode which will work with HARP:

	pc_adapter->OS/2->archive->os2_4.0.2_1.20.200.zip
		unzip the file and execute the command:

		cp -p <unzip_directory>/Drivers/PCA200E.BIN /etc/pca200e.bin

	pc_adapter->'Windows NT'->archive->pca2e_12.zip
		unzip the file and execute the command:

		cp -p <unzip_directory>/NT/I386/PCA200E.BIN /etc/pca200e.bin


The following distributions from the FORE web pages are known to have 
microcode which will NOT work with HARP:

	pc_adapter:
		OS/2:
			release:
				os2_4.1.0_1.74.zip
		Windows95:
			archive:
				pc-w95_5.0.0.16432.zip
				win95_4.0.3_1.04.200.zip
				win95_4.1.6_1.16.zip
			release:
				pc-w95_4.1.6_27.zip
		Windows NT:
			archive:
				pc-nt_5.0.0_16342.zip
				winnt_4.0.3_1.05.200.zip
				winnt_4.1.2_1.27.zip
				winnt_4.1.6_1.16.zip
			release:
				pc-nt_4.1.6_27.zip
				pc-nt_i386_5.0.0_25096.zip


From the "ForeRunner 200E for PC/Mac" distribution CD-ROM, the following 
PCA200E adapter distributions are known to have microcode which will work 
with HARP (assuming the CD-ROM is mounted on /cdrom):

	/cdrom/rel4.0/os2/
		execute the command:
		
		cp -p /cdrom/rel4.0/os2/drivers/pca200e.bin /etc/pca200e.bin


Note: Windows-based files are supplied in a compressed form. If the
'fore_dnld' command complains about an unrecognized header format, you should
try to uncompress the microcode file. To do so, move the file in binary mode
to a DOS/Windows machine and use the DOS command 'expand' to uncompress the
file. The command syntax is:

	expand <in-file> <out-file>

Move the resulting <out-file> in binary mode back to the HARP machine as
/etc/pca200e.bin and try to initialize the ATM system again.
