HARP ATM Startup Configuration Instructions
===========================================

The following steps are required in order to use the HARP ATM software.
See the file atm-config.sh for an example ATM startup script.

1.  Each ATM physical interface must be configured with one or more network
    interfaces.  The physical interfaces are named:

	FORE Systems: hfa0, hfa1, ...
	Efficient Networks: hea0, hea1, ...

    The network interface names and the number of network interfaces for a
    particular physical interface are specified via the atm command.  The
    network interface name prefix may be any alphabetic string, but the 
    generated network interface names must be unique amongst all network
    interfaces, including non-ATM interfaces.

    To configure the network interfaces, type:

	atm set netif <interface_name> <netif_prefix> <netif_count>

    For example, the command:

	atm set netif hfa0 ni 3

    will generate the network interfaces ni0, ni1 and ni2 on the physical
    interface hfa0.

    For further details, see the man page atm(8).


2.  Each ATM network interface (netif) must be configured with an IP network
    address.  Each network interface must be on a different IP subnet.

    To configure the network interface, type:

	ifconfig <netif_name> <IP_address> up


3.  Each ATM physical interface must have a signalling manager attached.  The
    interfaces may have the same or different signalling managers.
 
    To attach a signalling manager, type:

	atm attach <interface_name> <signalling_manager_name>

	where <signalling_manager_name> may be:

		sigpvc - to only support PVCs on the interface;
		spans - to run FORE Systems SPANS signalling protocol across 
			the interface, plus support of PVCs;
		uni30 - to run ATM Forum UNI 3.0 signalling protocol across 
			the interface, plus support of PVCs;
		uni31 - to run ATM Forum UNI 3.1 signalling protocol across 
			the interface, plus support of PVCs;

    For further details, see the man page atm(8).


4.  Each of the host's PVCs (if any) must be defined.  
 
    To define a PVC, type:

	atm add pvc <interface_name> <vpi> <vci> <aal> <encaps> <owner> ....

	where <interface_name> is the name of the ATM physical interface 
			over which the PVC is being defined;
	      <vpi> is the VPI value for the PVC;
	      <vci> is the VCI value for the PVC;
	      <aal> is the AAL type which the PVC endpoints will use;
	      <encaps> is the encapsulation which the PVC endpoints will use;
	      <owner> specifies the the owner of the PVC, which may be:
			ip - the PVC is used for IP traffic;

	additional parameters may be required, depending on the PVC owner:

	for owner=ip,
	      <netif_name> is the name of the PVC's network interface;
	      <dst> specifies the IP address at the remote end of this PVC;

    For further details, see the man page atm(8).


5.  HARP includes an ILMI daemon, which will perform host address registration
    with the ATM switch for ATM Forum UNI interfaces.  If ILMI support is
    available and activated in the ATM switch and the ILMI daemon is running
    (see ilmid(8)), no further registration procedures are required.  
    The 'atm set prefix' command is not needed in this case.

    If ILMI address registration support is not available or activated, then
    the host must be manually registered with its switch.  There should be
    a user command available on the switch in order to do the registration.

    For example, if you are using a FORE Systems switch, you should enter
    the following AMI command:

	> conf nsap route new <host_nsap> 152 <switch_port> 0 

    If you are using a Cisco LightStream 1010 switch, you would use the
    following configuration command:

       > atm route <host_nsap> atm <atm_interface_#> internal

    For ATM Forum UNI interfaces, the 'atm set prefix' command must also
    be issued when not using ILMI address registration.


6.  HARP includes support for the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP),
    which can synchronize the ATMARP caches of multiple ATMARP servers.
    Obviously, this is only useful on hosts which are ATMARP servers.

    To run SCSP between servers, two daemons, scspd and atmarpd, must be
    started.  Scspd implements the SCSP protocol and atmarpd provides an
    interface between scspd and the ATMARP server in the kernel.  Scspd
    requires a configuration file.  It will look for a configuration
    file at /etc/scspd.conf unless told otherwise.
    
    An example of commands to start the two daemons is:

	# scspd
	# atmarpd <netif>

    See the man pages scspd(8) and atmarpd(8) for further information.
