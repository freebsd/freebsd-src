# src/share/man/man5/make.conf.5.
#
# /etc/make.conf, if present, will be read by make (see
# /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).  It allows you to override macro definitions
# to make without changing your source tree, or anything the source
# tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# There are additional things you can put into /etc/make.conf.
# You have to find those in the Makefiles and documentation of
# the source tree.
#
#
# The CPUTYPE variable controls which processor should be targeted for
# generated code.  This controls processor-specific optimizations in
# certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value
# of CFLAGS to contain the appropriate optimization directive to gcc.
# The automatic setting of CFLAGS may be overridden using the
# NO_CPU_CFLAGS variable below.
# Currently the following CPU types are recognized:
#   Intel x86 architecture:
#       (AMD CPUs)	athlon-mp athlon-xp athlon-4 athlon-tbird athlon k6-3
#			k6-2 k6 k5
#       (Intel CPUs)	p4 p3 p2 i686 i586/mmx i586 i486 i386
#   Alpha/AXP architecture: ev67 ev6 pca56 ev56 ev5 ev45 ev4
#   Intel ia64 architecture: itanium
#
# (?= allows to buildworld for a different CPUTYPE.)

#CPUTYPE?=i686
#NO_CPU_CFLAGS=	true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to CFLAGS automatically
#NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS=true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to COPTFLAGS automatically
#
# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimization settings above -O (-O2, ...) are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimization settings to "-O" before submitting bug reports
# to the developers.
# Note also that at this time the -O2 setting is known to produce BROKEN
# CODE on the Alpha platform.
#
#CFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.
#
#CXXFLAGS+= -fmemoize-lookups -fsave-memoized
#
# MAKE_SHELL controls the shell used internally by make(1) to process the
# command scripts in makefiles.  Three shells are supported, sh, ksh, and
# csh.  Using sh is most common, and advised.  Using ksh *may* work, but is
# not guaranteed to.  Using csh is absurd.  The default is to use sh.
#
#MAKE_SHELL?=sh
#
# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
# for use in developing FreeBSD and testing changes.  They can be used by
# putting "CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}" in /etc/make.conf.  -Wconversion is not
# included here due to compiler bugs, e.g., mkdir()'s mode_t argument.
#
#BDECFLAGS=	-W -Wall -ansi -pedantic -Wbad-function-cast -Wcast-align \
#		-Wcast-qual -Wchar-subscripts -Winline \
#		-Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -Wpointer-arith \
#		-Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -Wwrite-strings
#
# To compile just the kernel with special optimizations, you should use
# this instead of CFLAGS (which is not applicable to kernel builds anyway).
# There is very little to gain by using higher optimization levels, and doing
# so can cause problems.
#
#COPTFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# To build the system compiler such that it forces high optimization levels to
# a lower one.  GCC -O2+ is known to trigger known optimizer bugs at various

#	SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
#	SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl2
#
# Note: If you are using Cyrus SASL with other applications which require

#
#	define(`confDONT_BLAME_SENDMAIL',`GroupReadableSASLDBFile')
#
#SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDADD=
#SENDMAIL_DPADD=

# Setting SENDMAIL_SET_USER_ID will install the sendmail binary as a
# set-user-ID root binary instead of a set-group-ID smmsp binary and will
# prevent the installation of /etc/mail/submit.cf.
# This is a deprecated mode of operation.  See etc/mail/README for more
