# NOTE:  Please would any committer updating this file also update the
# make.conf(5) manual page, if necessary, which is located in
# src/share/man/man5/make.conf.5.
#
# /etc/make.conf, if present, will be read by make (see
# /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).  It allows you to override macro definitions
# to make without changing your source tree, or anything the source
# tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# There are additional things you can put into /etc/make.conf.
# You have to find those in the Makefiles and documentation of
# the source tree.
#
# Note, that you should not set MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX or MAKEOBJDIR
# from make.conf (or as command line variables to make).
# Both variables are environment variables for make and must be used as:
#
# env MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/big/directory make
#
#
# The CPUTYPE variable controls which processor should be targeted for
# generated code.  This controls processor-specific optimizations in
# certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value
# of CFLAGS to contain the appropriate optimization directive to gcc.
# The automatic setting of CFLAGS may be overridden using the
# NO_CPU_CFLAGS variable below.
# Currently the following CPU types are recognized:
#   Intel x86 architecture:
#       (AMD CPUs)	opteron athlon64 athlon-mp athlon-xp athlon-4
#			athlon-tbird athlon k8 k6-3 k6-2 k6 k5
#       (Intel CPUs)	nocona pentium4[m] prescott pentium3[m] pentium-m
#			pentium2 pentiumpro pentium-mmx pentium i486 i386
#   Alpha/AXP architecture: ev67 ev6 pca56 ev56 ev5 ev45 ev4
#   AMD64 architecture: opteron, athlon64, nocona
#   Intel ia64 architecture: itanium2, itanium
#
# (?= allows to buildworld for a different CPUTYPE.)
#
#CPUTYPE?=pentium3
#NO_CPU_CFLAGS=		# Don't add -march=<cpu> to CFLAGS automatically
#NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS=	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to COPTFLAGS automatically
#
# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimization settings other than -O and -O2 are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimization settings to "-O" or -O2 before submitting bug
# reports without patches to the developers.
#
#CFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.
#
#CXXFLAGS+= -fconserve-space
#
# MAKE_SHELL controls the shell used internally by make(1) to process the
# command scripts in makefiles.  Three shells are supported, sh, ksh, and
# csh.  Using sh is most common, and advised.  Using ksh *may* work, but is
# not guaranteed to.  Using csh is absurd.  The default is to use sh.
#
#MAKE_SHELL?=sh
#
# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
# for use in developing FreeBSD and testing changes.  They can be used by
# putting "CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}" in /etc/make.conf.  -Wconversion is not
# included here due to compiler bugs, e.g., mkdir()'s mode_t argument.
#
#BDECFLAGS=	-W -Wall -ansi -pedantic -Wbad-function-cast -Wcast-align \
#		-Wcast-qual -Wchar-subscripts -Winline \
#		-Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -Wpointer-arith \
#		-Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -Wwrite-strings
#
# To compile just the kernel with special optimizations, you should use
# this instead of CFLAGS (which is not applicable to kernel builds anyway).
# There is very little to gain by using higher optimization levels, and doing
# so can cause problems.

# prevent the installation of /etc/mail/submit.cf.
# This is a deprecated mode of operation.  See etc/mail/README for more
