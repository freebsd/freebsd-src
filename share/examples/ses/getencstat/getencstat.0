.Sh NAME
.Nm getencstat

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar device
.Op Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
gets summary and detailed SCSI Environmental Services (or SAF-TE) device
enclosure status.
The overall status is printed out.
If the overall status
is considered okay, nothing else is printed out (unless the
.Fl v
option is used).
.Pp
A SCSI Environmental Services device enclosure may be either in the state
of being \fBOK\fR, or in one or more of the states of \fBINFORMATIONAL\fR,
\fBNON-CRITICAL\fR, \fBCRITICAL\fB or \fBUNRECOVERABLE\fR states.
These
overall states reflect a summary of the states of each object within
such a device (such as power supplies or disk drives).
.Pp
With the
.Fl v
option, the status of all objects within the device is printed, whether
\fBOK\fR or not.
Along with the status of each object is the object identifier.
.Pp
The user may then use
.Xr setencstat 8
to try and clear overall device status, or may use
.Xr setobjstat 8
to set specific object status.
