.Ar device
.Op Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
monitors SCSI Environmental Services (or SAF-TE) devices for changes
in state and logs such changes to the system error logger
(see
.Xr syslogd 8 ) .
At least one device must be specified.
When no other options are supplied,
.Nm
detached becomes a daemon, by default waking up every 30 seconds to
poll each device for a change in state.
.Pp
The following options may be used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Try to clear enclosure status after read.
.It Fl t Ar poll-interval
Change the interval of polling from the default 30 seconds to the number
of seconds specified.
.It Fl d
Instead of detaching and becoming a daemon, stay attached to the
controlling terminal and log changes there as well as via the system
logger.
.El
.Pp
The user may then use
.Xr getencstat 8
to get more detailed information about the state of the over enclosure device
or objects within the enclosure device.
