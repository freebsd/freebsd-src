.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldns-read-zone 
.IR ZONEFILE 

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBldns-read-zone\fR reads a DNS zone file and prints it. The output has 1
resource record per line, and no pretty-printing makeup.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Canonicalize all resource records in the zone before printing

.TP
\fB-d\fR
Only print DNSSEC data from the zone. This option skips every record
that is not of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG or DNSKEY. DS records are not
printed.

.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show usage and exit

.TP

.TP
\fB-s\fR
Strip DNSSEC data from the zone. This option skips every record
that is of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG or DNSKEY. DS records are still
printed.

.TP
\fB-S\fR \fI[[+|0]number | YYYYMMDDxx | unixtime ]\fR
Set serial number to the given \fInumber\fR, or when preceded by a sign,
offset the exisiting number with it. When giving the literal strings 
\fIYYYYMMDDxx\fR or \fIunixtime\fR, the serial number is tried to be reset
in datecounter or in unixtime format respectively. Though is the updated serial
number is smaller than the original one, the original one is simply
increased by one.

When updating a serial number, records of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG and DNSKEY
will be skipped when printing the zone.


.TP
\fB-v\fR

.TP
