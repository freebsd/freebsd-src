ldns-keygen \- generate a DNSSEC key pair
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldns-keygen 
[
.IR OPTION
]
.IR DOMAIN 

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBldns-keygen\fR is used to generate a private/public keypair. When run, it
will create 3 files; a .key file with the public DNSKEY, a .private
file with the private keydata and a .ds with the DS record of the
DNSKEY record.

It prints out the basename for these files: K<name>+<alg>+<id>

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a \fI<algorithm>\fR 
Create a key with this algorithm. Specifying 'list' here gives a list of supported algorithms.
Several alias names are also accepted (from older versions and other software),
the list gives names from the RFC.  Also the plain algo number is accepted.

.TP
\fB-b \fI<bits>\fR 
Use this many bits for the key length.

.TP
\fB-k\fR 
When given, generate a key signing key. This just sets the flag field to
257 instead of 256 in the DNSKEY RR in the .key file.

.TP
\fB-r \fIdevice\fR
Make ldns-keygen use this file to seed the random generator with. This will
default to /dev/random.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Show the version and exit
