# Issue a useful error message if a user tries to build the project
# using GNU make.

all:
	$(error ERROR: This source tree needs to be built with BSD 'make'.)

# Some GNU/Linux distributions offer pre-built packages of BSD 'make':
#
# - On Debian-derived distributions, the "pmake" package provides an
#   older version of BSD 'make' that should suffice.
# - On Fedora, the 'bmake' package seems appropriate (untested).
#
# Portable source code for NetBSD 'make' may be found at:

#
# Please also read the file "INSTALL" for additional information about
# building the project from source.
