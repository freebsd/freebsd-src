# The internet hostname dma uses to identify the host.
# If not set or empty, the result of gethostname(2) is used.

# Use this if mails are not accepted by destination mail servers because

# By default, MASQUERADE is not set.
# Format: MASQUERADE [user@][host]
# Examples:
# MASQUERADE john@  on host "hamlet" will send all mails as john@hamlet
# MASQUERADE percolator  will send mails as $username@percolator, e.g. fish@percolator
# MASQUERADE herb@ert  will send all mails as herb@ert
