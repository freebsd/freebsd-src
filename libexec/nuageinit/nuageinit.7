.Sh NAME
.Nm nuageinit
.Nd initialize a cloud-init environment
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to initialize instances in a cloud environment.
.Nm
runs at the first boot after the system installation.
It is composed of 3
.Xr rc 8
scripts:
.Bl -tag -width "nuageinit"
.It Cm nuageinit
This script will detect the configuration disk kind of cloud environment the
system runs on and gather accordingly the configuration data.
The following cloud environments are supported right now:
.Bl -tag -width "OpenStack"
.It ondisk
A cloud agnostic environment where the disk is provided to the system
with the configuration data on it.
The disk should be formatted in one of the following formats:
.Xr cd9660 4
or
.Xr msdosfs 4
and be labelled (via filesystem label) either
.Ar config-2
or
.Ar cidata .
.It OpenStack
The system is running in an
.Lk https://www.openstack.org/ OpenStack environment .
It is detected via the
.Ar smbios.system.product
.Xr smbios 4
description available in
.Xr kenv 2 .
.El
.Pp
Depending on the cloud environment above,
.Nm
will attempt to configure the instance.
This script executes early
after all the local filesystem are mounted but before
the network is configured.
.It Cm nuageinit_post_net
This script is responsible for processing the configurations that are network
dependent:
.Bl -bullet
.It
dealing with packages
.It
dealing with users (which can depend on shell provided by packages)
.El
.It Cm nuageinit_user_data_script
This script is responsible for executing everything which would have
been passed via the configuration to be executed, via the configuration
or because the user_data provided is a script.
.El
.Pp
The default user for nuageinit is a user named
.Va freebsd
with a password set to
.Va freebsd
and a shell set to
.Va /bin/sh .
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The configuration of
.Nm
is typically done via metadata provided by the cloud provider.
The metadata is presented to nuageinit in different forms depending on
the provider:
.Bl -tag -width "config-2"
.It nocloud
If the data is provided via a disk labelled
.Va cidata ,
then the metadata is provided in the form of a file named
.Pa meta-data
in YAML format.
.Nm
will configure the hostname of the instance according the value of the
following variables
.Va local-hostname
or
.Va hostname .
.It config-2
If the data is provided via a disk labelled
.Va config-2
or if it is fetched from OpenStack,
the metadata is expected in two json files:
.Pp
The
.Pa meta_data.json
file supports the following keys:
.Bl -tag -width "public_keys"
.It Ic hostname
Set the hostname of the instance.
.It Ic public_keys
Append each entry of the array to
.Nm
default user which will be created.
.El
.Pp
The
.Pa network_data.json
file supports the following keys:
.Bl -tag -width "public_keys"
.It Ic links
Array of network interfaces to be configured.
.It Ic networks
Array of network configurations to be set.
.El
.El
.Pp
Along with the metadata, a user data file is provided, either named
.Pa user_data
or
.Pa user-data .
If this file starts with a
.Qq #! ,
it will be executed at the end of the boot via
.Cm nuageinit_user_data_script .
If this files starts with
.Qq #!cloud-config ,
it will be parsed as a YAML configuration file.
All other cases will be ignored.
.Pp
The
.Qq #!cloud-config
configuration entries supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "config-2"
.It Ic fqdn
Specify a fully qualified domain name for the instance.
.It Ic hostname
Specify the hostname of the instance if
.Qq Ic fqdn
is not set.
.It Ic groups
An array of strings or objects to be created:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If the entry is a string,
a group using this string as a name will be created.
.It
if the entry is an object, the
.Qq Ar key
will be used as the name of the group, the
.Qq Ar value
is expected to be a list of members (array), specified by name.
.El
.It Ic ssh_keys
An object of multiple key/values,
.Qq Cm keys
being in the form
.Ar algo_private
or
.Ar algo_public ,
.Qq Cm values
being the actual content of the files in
.Pa /etc/ssh .
.It Ic ssh_authorized_keys
Append each entry of the array to
.Nm
default user which will be created.
.It Ic ssh_pwauth
boolean which determines the value of the
.Qq Ic PasswordAuthentication
configuration in
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config
.It Ic network
.It Ic runcmd
An array of commands to be run at the end of the boot process
.It Ic packages
List of packages to be installed.
.It Ic package_update
Update the remote package metadata.
.It Ic package_upgrade
Upgrade the packages installed to their latest version.
.It Ic users
Specify a list of users to be created:
.Bl -tag -width "plain_text_passwd"
.It Ic name
Name of the user.
.It Ic gecos
GECOS for the user.
.It Ic homedir
The path of the home directory for the user.
.It Ic primary_group
The main group the user should belong to.
.It Ic groups
The list of other groups the user should belong to.
.It Ic no_create_home
A boolean which determines if the home directory should be created or not.
.It Ic shell
The shell that should be used for the user.
.It Ic passwd
The encrypted password for the user.
.It Ic plain_text_passwd
The password in plain text for the user.
Ignored if an encrypted password is already provided.
.It Ic groups
The list of other groups the user should belong to.
.It Ic locked
Boolean to determine if the user account should be locked.
.It Ic sudo
An entry which should be appended to
.Pa /usr/local/etc/sudoers.d/90-nuageinit-users
.El
.Pp
A special case exist: if the entry is a simple string with the value
.Qq default ,
than the default user is created.
.It Ic chpasswd
Change the passwords for users, it accepts the following keys:
.Bl -tag -width "expire"
.It Ic expire
Boolean to force the user to changes their password during the first login
.It Ic users
An array of objects:
.Bl -tag -width "password"
.It Ic user
Specify the user whose password will be changed.
.It Ic password
Specify a text line with the new password or
specify the user whose password will be changed.
.Qq Cm RANDOM
to assign the password randomly.
If the textline starts with
.Qq Cm $x$
where x is a number, then the password is considered encrypted,
otherwise the password is considered plaintext.
