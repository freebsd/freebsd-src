.Nd retrieve multiple files via pipelined HTTP
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

utility is a minimalist pipelined HTTP client,
which is used to retrieve multiple
.Ar file Ns s
from one
.Ar server ,
and saves the downloaded files in the current working directory,
using the last portion of their download path as file names.
.Pp
By making several "in flight" HTTP requests,
it can dramatically increase performance when a large number of
small files need to be downloaded.

The
.Xr freebsd-update 8
tool uses
.Nm
to download binary patch files.
