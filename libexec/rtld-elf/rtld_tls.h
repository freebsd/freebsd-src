 * Allocate a TLS block for a new thread. The memory allocated will
 * include 'tcbsize' bytes aligned to a 'tcbalign' boundary (in bytes)
 * for the thread library's private purposes. The location of the TCB
 * block is returned by this function. For architectures using
 * 'Variant I' TLS, the thread local storage follows the TCB, and for
 * 'Variant II', the thread local storage precedes it. For
 * architectures using the 'Variant II' model (e.g. i386, amd64) the
 * TCB must begin with two pointer fields which are used by rtld for
 * its TLS implementation. For the 'Variant I' model, the TCB must
 * begin with a single pointer field for rtld's implementation.
 *
 * If the value of 'oldtls' is non-NULL, the new TLS block will be
 * initialised using the values contained in 'oldtls' and 'oldtls'
 * will be freed. This is typically used when initialising a thread
 * library to migrate from using the initial bootstrap TLS block
 * created by rtld to one which contains suitable thread library
 * private data.
 *
 * The value returned from this function is suitable for installing
 * directly into the thread pointer register.
