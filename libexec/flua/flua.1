.Sh NAME
.Nm flua
.Nd Lua interpreter for the FreeBSD base system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm flua
.Op Fl EWiv
.Op Fl e Ar string
.Op Fl l Ar module
.Op Fl l Ar g=module
.Op Ar script Op Ar args
.Op Fl -
.Op Fl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimal Lua interpreter integrated into the FreeBSD base system.
It is derived from Lua 5.4 with modifications to suit the needs of
.Fx
build infrastructure and system tooling.
.Nm
is intended for internal use within the base system and is
.Em not
designed for general-purpose scripting or use by third-party applications.
.Pp
Unlike full Lua installations provided by the Ports Collection,
.Nm
has a reduced feature set and is limited to meeting the requirements of
base system environments such as the bootloader.
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
is typically invoked internally by FreeBSD base system tools and build scripts.
While it accepts Lua source files and arguments in a standard fashion, its
limited environment and module support make it unsuitable for general scripting
use.
.Sh INCLUDED MODULES
.Nm
includes a subset of functionality from a small number of standard Lua modules
as well as bespoke modules necessary for the base system:
.Bl -bullet
.It
lfs (LuaFileSystem) â€“ file attribute and directory manipulation
.It
lposix - basic POSIX system calls
.It
.Xr freebsd.kenv 3lua
.It
.Xr freebsd.sys.linker 3lua
.It
.Xr hash 3lua
.It
.Xr jail 3lua
.El
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
should not be used as a replacement for
.Xr lua 1
from the Ports Collection (e.g.,
.Pa lang/lua54 )
as it may be modified or updated to a newer Lua version in the future without
retaining backwards compatibility.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr freebsd.kenv 3lua ,
.Xr freebsd.sys.linker 3lua ,
.Xr hash 3lua ,
.Xr jail 3lua ,
.Xr style.lua 9
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 14.0 .
