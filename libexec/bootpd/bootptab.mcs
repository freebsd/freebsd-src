# Be careful about including backslashes where they're needed.  Weird (bad)
# things can happen when a backslash is omitted where one is intended.
# Also, note that generic option data must be either a string or a
# sequence of bytes where each byte is a two-digit hex value.

# First, we define a global entry which specifies the stuff every host uses.

# If you leave "td" empty, run bootpd with the "-c /tftpboot" switch
# so path names (boot files) will be interpreted relative to the same
# directory as tftpd will use when opening files.
