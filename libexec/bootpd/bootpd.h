 * IP addresses.
 *
 * The hostname, home directory, and bootfile are all shared strings.
 *
 * The generic data field is a shared binary data structure.  It is used to
 * hold future RFC1048 vendor data until bootpd is updated to understand it.
 *
 * The vm_cookie field specifies the four-octet vendor magic cookie to use
 * if it is desired to always send the same response to a given host.
 *
 * Hopefully, the rest is self-explanatory.
