.TH ELVISPRESERVE 8
.SH NAME
elvispreserve - Preserve the the modified version of a file after a crash.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB\fBelvispreserve\fP ["-\fIwhy elvis died\fP"] /tmp/\fIfilename\fP...
\fB\fBelvispreserve\fP -R /tmp/\fIfilename\fP...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIelvispreserve\fP preserves your edited text after \fIelvis\fP dies.
The text can be recovered later, via the \fIelvispreserve\fP program.
.PP
For UNIX-like systems,
you should never need to run this program from the command line.
It is run automatically when \fIelvis\fP is about to die,
and it should be run (via /etc/rc) when the computer is booted.
THAT'S ALL!
.PP
For non-UNIX systems such as MS-DOS, you can either use \fIelvispreserve\fP
the same way as under UNIX systems (by running it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file),
or you can run it separately with the "-R" flag to recover the files
in one step.
.PP
If you're editing a file when \fIelvis\fP dies
(due to a bug, system crash, power failure, etc.)
then \fIelvispreserve\fP will preserve the most recent version of your text.
The preserved text is stored in a special directory; it does NOT overwrite
your text file automatically.
.PP
\fIelvispreserve\fP will send mail to any user whose work it preserves,
if your operating system normally supports mail.
.SH FILES
.IP /tmp/elv*
The temporary file that \fIelvis\fP was using when it died.
.IP /var/preserve/p*
The text that is preserved by \fIelvispreserve\fP.
.IP /var/preserve/Index
A text file which lists the names of all preserved files, and the names
of the /var/preserve/p* files which contain their preserved text.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Due to the permissions on the /var/preserve directory, on UNIX systems
\fIelvispreserve\fP must be run as superuser.
This is accomplished by making the \fIelvispreserve\fP executable be owned by "root"
and turning on its "set user id" bit.
.PP
If you're editing a nameless buffer when \fIelvis\fP dies, then \fIelvispreserve\fP will pretend
that the file was named "foo".
