# REQUIRE: devd ipfw pf routing
# KEYWORD: nojail
#
# The netwait script helps handle two situations:
#  - Systems with USB or other late-attaching network hardware which
#    is initialized by devd events.  The script waits for all the
#    interfaces named in the netwait_if list to appear.
#  - Systems with statically-configured IP addresses in rc.conf(5).
#    The IP addresses in the netwait_ip list are pinged.  The script
#    waits for any single IP in the list to respond to the ping.  If your
#    system uses DHCP, you should probably use synchronous_dhclient="YES"
#    in your /etc/rc.conf instead of netwait_ip.
# Either or both of the wait lists can be used (at least one must be
# non-empty if netwait is enabled).
