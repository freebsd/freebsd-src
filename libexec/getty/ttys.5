.Sh NAME
.Nm ttys
.Nd terminal initialization information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains information that is used by various routines to initialize
and control the use of terminal special files.
Pseudo-terminals (see
.Xr pts 4 )
are not listed.
This information is read with the
.Xr getttyent 3
library routines.
There is one line in the
.Nm
file per special device file.
Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
Fields comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in double
quotes (``"'').
Blank lines and comments may appear anywhere in the file; comments
are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and new lines.
Any unspecified fields will default to null.
.Pp
The first field is normally the
name of the terminal special file as it is found in
.Pa /dev .
However, it can be any arbitrary string
when the associated command is not related to a tty.
.Pp
The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,
usually
.Xr getty 8 ,
which initializes and opens the line, setting the speed, waiting for
a user name and executing the
.Xr login 1
program.
It can be, however, any desired command, for example
the start up for a window system terminal emulator or some other
daemon process, and can contain multiple words if quoted.
.Pp
The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
tty line, normally the one found in the
.Xr termcap 5
data base file.
The environment variable
.Ev TERM
is initialized with the value by
either
.Xr getty 8
or
.Xr login 1 .
.Pp
The remaining fields set flags in the
.Fa ty_status
entry (see
.Xr getttyent 3 ) ,
specify a window system process that
.Xr init 8
will maintain for the terminal line, optionally determine the
type of tty (whether dialin, network or otherwise),
or specify a tty group
name that allows the login class database (see
.Xr login.conf 5 )
to refer to many ttys as a group, to selectively allow or
deny access or enable or disable accounting facilities for
ttys as a group.
.Pp
As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that
.Xr init 8
should (should not) execute the command given in the second field.
``onifconsole'' will cause this line to be enabled if and only if it is
an active kernel console device (it is equivalent to ``on'' in this
case).
The flag ``onifexists'' will cause this line to be enabled if and only
if the name exists.
If the name starts with a ``/'', it will be considered an absolute
path.
Otherwise, it is considered a path relative to
.Pa /dev .
The flag ``secure'' (if the console is enabled) allows users with a
uid of 0 to login on this line.
The flag ``insecure'' as well as the absence of the ``secure'' flag
disallows users with uid of 0 to login on this line.
The flag ``dialup'' indicates that a tty entry describes a dialin
line, and ``network'' is obsolete and does nothing.
Either of these strings may also be specified in the terminal type
field.
The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command
string which
.Xr init 8
will execute
.Em before
starting the command specified by the second field.
.Pp
The string ``group='' may be followed by a group name comprised of
alphanumeric characters that can be used by
.Xr login.conf 5
to refer to many tty lines as a group to enable or disable access
and accounting facilities.
If no group is specified, then the tty becomes a member of the group
"none".
For backwards compatibility, the ``group='' should appear last on the
line, immediately before the optional comment.
.Pp
Both the second field and any command specified with ``window=''
will be split into words and executed using
.Xr execve 2 .
Words are separated by any combinations of tabs and spaces.
Arguments containing whitespace should be enclosed in single quotes
.Pq Li ' .
Note that no shell-style globbing or other variable substitution occurs.
