# Most of the table entries here are just copies of the old getty table,
# it is by no means certain, or even likely, that any of them are optimal
# for any purpose whatever.  Nor is it likely that more than a couple are
# even correct.
#
# The default gettytab entry, used to set defaults for all other
# entries, and in cases where getty is called with no table name.
#
# cb, ce and ck are desirable on most crt's.  The non-crt entries need to
# be changed to turn them off (:cb@:ce@:ck@:).
#
# lc should always be on; it's a remainder of some stone age when there
# have been terminals around not being able of handling lower-case
# characters. Those terminals aren't supported any longer, but getty is
# `smart' about them by default.
#
# Parity defaults to even, but the Pc entry and all the `std' entries
# specify no parity.   The different parities are:
#     (none): same as ep for getty.  login will use terminal as is.
#     ep:     getty will use raw mode (cs8 -parenb) (unless rw is set) and
#             fake parity.  login will use even parity (cs7 parenb -parodd).
#     op:     same as ep except odd parity (cs7 parenb parodd) for login.
#             getty will fake odd parity as well.
#     ap:     same as ep except -inpck instead of inpck for login.
#             ap overrides op and ep.
#     np:     1. don't fake parity in getty.  The fake parity garbles
#                characters on non-terminals (like pccons) that don't
#                support parity.  It would probably better for getty not to
#                try to fake parity.  It could just use cbreak mode so as
#                not to force cs8 and let the hardware handle the parity.
#                login has to be rely on the hardware anyway.
#             2. set cs8 -parenb -istrip -inpck.
#     ep:op:  same as ap.
