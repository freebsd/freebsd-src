.Sh DESCRIPTION
This library is tightly integrated into the
.Xr mandoc 1
utility and not designed for stand-alone use.
The present manual is intended as a reference for developers working on
.Xr mandoc 1 .
.Ss Data structures
Unless otherwise noted, all of the following data structures are defined in
.In mandoc.h
and are deleted in
.Fn tbl_free .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Vt struct tbl_node
This structure describes a complete table.
It is defined in
.In libroff.h ,
created in
.Fn tbl_alloc ,
and stored in the members
.Va first_tbl ,
.Va last_tbl ,
and
.Va tbl
of
.Vt struct roff Bq Pa roff.c .
.It Vt struct tbl_opts
This structure describes the options of one table.
It is used as a substructure of
.Vt struct tbl_node
and thus created and deleted together with it.
It is filled in
.Fn tbl_options .
.It Vt struct tbl_head
This structure describes one layout column in a table,
in particular the vertical line to its left.
It is allocated and filled in
.Fn cell_alloc Bq Pa tbl_layout.c
and referenced from the
.Va first_head
and
.Va last_head
members of
.Vt struct tbl_node .
.It Vt struct tbl_row
This structure describes one layout line in a table
by maintaining a list of all the cells in that line.
It is allocated and filled in
.Fn row Bq Pa tbl_layout.c
and referenced from the
.Va layout
member of
.Vt struct tbl_node .
.It Vt struct tbl_cell
This structure describes one layout cell in a table,
in particular its alignment, membership in spans, and
usage for lines.
It is allocated and filled in
.Fn cell_alloc Bq Pa tbl_layout.c
and referenced from the
.Va first
and
.Va last
members of
.Vt struct tbl_row .
.It Vt struct tbl_span
This structure describes one data line in a table
by maintaining a list of all data cells in that line
or by specifying that it is a horizontal line.
It is allocated and filled in
.Fn newspan Bq Pa tbl_data.c
which is called from
.Fn tbl_data
and referenced from the
.Va first_span ,
.Va current_span ,
and
.Va last_span
members of
.Vt struct tbl_node ,
and from the
.Va span
members of
.Vt struct man_node
and
.Vt struct mdoc_node
from
.In man.h
and
.In mdoc.h .
.It Vt struct tbl_dat
This structure describes one data cell in a table by specifying
whether it contains a line or data, whether it spans additional
layout cells, and by storing the data.
It is allocated and filled in
.Fn data
and referenced from the
.Va first
and
.Va last
members of
.Vt struct tbl_span .
.El
.Ss Interface functions
The following functions are implemented in
.Pa tbl.c ,
and all callers in
.Pa roff.c .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn tbl_alloc
Allocates, initializes, and returns a new
.Vt struct tbl_node .
Called from
.Fn roff_TS .
.It Fn tbl_read
Dispatches to
.Fn tbl_option ,
.Fn tbl_layout ,
.Fn tbl_cdata ,
and
.Fn tbl_data ,
see below.
Called from
.Fn roff_parseln .
.It Fn tbl_restart
Resets the
.Va part
member of
.Vt struct tbl_node
to
.Dv TBL_PART_LAYOUT .
Called from
.Fn roff_T_ .
.It Fn tbl_span
On the first call, return the first
.Vt struct tbl_span ;
for later calls, return the next one or
.Dv NULL .
Called from
.Fn roff_span .
.It Fn tbl_end
Flags the last span as
.Dv TBL_SPAN_LAST
and clears the pointer passed as an argment.
Called from
.Fn roff_TE
and
.Fn roff_endparse .
.It Fn tbl_free
Frees the specified
.Vt struct tbl_node
and all the tbl_row, tbl_cell, tbl_span, tbl_dat and tbl_head structures
referenced from it.
Called from
.Fn roff_free
and
.Fn roff_reset .
.El
.Ss Private functions
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ft int Fn tbl_options "struct tbl_node *tbl" "int ln" "const char *p"
Parses the options line into
.Vt struct tbl_opts .
Implemented in
.Pa tbl_opts.c ,
called from
.Fn tbl_read .
.It Ft int Fn tbl_layout "struct tbl_node *tbl" "int ln" "const char *p"
Allocates and fills one
.Vt struct tbl_head
for each layout column, one
.Vt struct tbl_row
for each layout line, and one
.Vt struct tbl_cell
for each layout cell.
Implemented in
.Pa tbl_layout.c ,
called from
.Fn tbl_read .
.It Ft int Fn tbl_data "struct tbl_node *tbl" "int ln" "const char *p"
Allocates one
.Vt struct tbl_span
for each data line and calls
.Fn data
on that line.
Implemented in
.Pa tbl_data.c ,
called from
.Fn tbl_read .
.It Ft int Fn tbl_cdata "struct tbl_node *tbl" "int ln" "const char *p"
Continues parsing a data line:
When finding
.Sq T} ,
switches back to
.Dv TBL_PART_DATA
mode and calls
.Fn data
if there are more data cells on the line.
Otherwise, appends the data to the current data cell.
Implemented in
.Pa tbl_data.c ,
called from
.Fn tbl_read .
.It Xo
.Ft int
.Fo data
.Fa "struct tbl_node *tbl"
.Fa "struct tbl_span *dp"
.Fa "int ln"
.Fa "const char *p"
.Fa "int *pos"
.Fc
.Xc
Parses one data cell into one
.Vt struct tbl_dat .
Implemented in
.Pa tbl_data.c ,
called from
.Fn tbl_data
and
.Fn tbl_cdata .
