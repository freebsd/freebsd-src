;           Software interrupts receive FUP(CLIP) + TIP(BLIP?)
;
;           We can not reliably determine whether the FUP/TIP belongs to the
;           software interrupt or to an asynchronous interrupt that was taken
;           before the instruction.
;
;           To distinguish the two cases we would need to read ahead but that
;           may require decoding an unknown amount of code (e.g. in different
;           processes for system-wide ring-3 tracing) until we return either
;           to CLIP if it was an asynchronous interrupt or to NLIP (or even to
;           a later IP) if it wasn't.
;
;           Instead, we assume that it was an asynchronous interrupt.  Tracing
;           appears to get disabled before and re-enabled after the instruction.
;
;           This is wrong most of the time.  But it is predictably wrong and it
;           avoids the case where we incorrectly assume a synchronous transfer
;           and get out of sync.
