; APL12: Intel(R) PT OVF May Be Followed By An Unexpected FUP Packet.
;
;        Certain Intel PT (Processor Trace) packets including FUPs (Flow
;        Update Packets), should be issued only between TIP.PGE (Target IP
;        Packet - Packet Generaton Enable) and TIP.PGD (Target IP Packet -
;        Packet Generation Disable) packets.  When outside a TIP.PGE/TIP.PGD
;        pair, as a result of IA32_RTIT_STATUS.FilterEn[0] (MSR 571H) being
;        cleared, an OVF (Overflow) packet may be unexpectedly followed by a
;        FUP.
