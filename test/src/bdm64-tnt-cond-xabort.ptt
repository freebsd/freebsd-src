; BDM64: An Incorrect LBR or Intel(R) Processor Trace Packet May Be

;        Use of Intel(R) Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel(R) TSX)
;        may result in a transactional abort.  If an abort occurs immediately
;        following a branch instruction, an incorrect branch target may be
;        logged in an LBR (Last Branch Record) or in an Intel(R) Processor Trace
;        (Intel(R) PT) packet before the LBR or Intel PT packet produced by the
;        abort.
