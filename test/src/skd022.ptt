; SKD022: VM Entry That Clears TraceEn May Generate a FUP.
;
;         If VM entry clears Intel(R) PT (Intel Processor Trace)
;         IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn (MSR 570H, bit 0) while PacketEn is 1 then a
;         FUP (Flow Update Packet) will precede the TIP.PGD (Target IP Packet,
;         Packet Generation Disable).  VM entry can clear TraceEn if the
;         VM-entry MSR-load area includes an entry for the IA32_RTIT_CTL MSR.
