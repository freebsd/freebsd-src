.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Lb libtest
implements an API for writing tests.
.Ss Concepts
Tests are implemented using test functions, where each test function
verifies a specific assertion about the system being tested.
Test functions are associated with the following:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
An optional human-readable test description.
.It
An optional set of tags.
Tags are used to select or deselect specific tests in a run.
.El
.Pp
Test functions are further grouped into test cases, where a test case
contains a logical group of assertions about the system under test.
Test cases are associated the following:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
An optional human-readable test case description.
.It
An optional test case set up function.
If specified, this set up function would be invoked prior to any test
function contained in the test case.
The set up function can allocate and initialize test-specific state, to be
passed to test functions.
If no set up function is specified for the test case, a default no-op
function will be supplied.
.It
An optional test case tear down function.
The tear down function will be invoked after all test functions have been
invoked.
It would be responsible for deallocating any resources that its corresponding
set up function had allocated.
If no tear down function is specified for a test case, a default no-op
function will be supplied.
.It
An optional set of tags for the test case.
These tags are used to select or delect specific test cases in a given test
run.
.El
.Pp
One or more test cases would be linked with a test driver to form a
test executable.
The default test driver supplied allows the test cases and specific tests
within the executable to be specified on the command line.
.Ss Scaffolding Generation
The
.Xr make-test-scaffolding 1
script will generate the scaffolding needed to produce a test executable
from object files containing symbols following its naming conventions.
