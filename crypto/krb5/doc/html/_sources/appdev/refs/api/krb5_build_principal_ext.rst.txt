This function creates a principal from a length-counted string and a variable-length list of length-counted components. The list of components ends with the first 0 length argument (so it is not possible to specify an empty component with this function). Call krb5_free_principal() to free allocated memory for principal when it is no longer needed.



Beginning with release 1.20, the name type of the principal will be inferred as **KRB5_NT_SRV_INST** or **KRB5_NT_WELLKNOWN** based on the principal name. The type will be **KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL** if a type cannot be inferred.
