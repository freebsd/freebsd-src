This function reads a password from keyboard input and stores it in *return_pwd* . *size_return* should be set by the caller to the amount of storage space available in *return_pwd* ; on successful return, it will be set to the length of the password read.



 *prompt* is printed to the terminal, followed by":", and then a password is read from the keyboard.



If *prompt2* is NULL, the password is read only once. Otherwise, *prompt2* is printed to the terminal and a second password is read. If the two passwords entered are not identical, KRB5_LIBOS_BADPWDMATCH is returned.



Echoing is turned off when the password is read.
