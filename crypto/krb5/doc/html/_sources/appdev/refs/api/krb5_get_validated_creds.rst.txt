This function gets a validated credential using a postdated credential from *ccache* . If *in_tkt_service* is specified, it is parsed (with the realm part ignored) and used as the server principal of the credential; otherwise, the ticket-granting service is used.



If successful, the validated credential is placed in *creds* .
