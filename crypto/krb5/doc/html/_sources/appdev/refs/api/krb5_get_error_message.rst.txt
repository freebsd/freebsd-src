krb5_get_error_message -  Get the (possibly extended) error message for a code. 
================================================================================

..

.. c:function:: const char * krb5_get_error_message(krb5_context ctx, krb5_error_code code)

..


:param:

	          **[in]** **ctx** - Library context

	          **[in]** **code** - Error code


..



..







The behavior of krb5_get_error_message() is only defined the first time it is called after a failed call to a krb5 function using the same context, and only when the error code passed in is the same as that returned by the krb5 function.



This function never returns NULL, so its result may be used unconditionally as a C string.



The string returned by this function must be freed using krb5_free_error_message()










..






.. note::

	 Future versions may return the same string for the second and following calls.
