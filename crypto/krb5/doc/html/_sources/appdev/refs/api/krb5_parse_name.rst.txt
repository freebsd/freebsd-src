Convert a string representation of a principal name to a krb5_principal structure.



A string representation of a Kerberos name consists of one or more principal name components, separated by slashes, optionally followed by the @ character and a realm name. If the realm name is not specified, the local realm is used.



To use the slash and @ symbols as part of a component (quoted) instead of using them as a component separator or as a realm prefix), put a backslash () character in front of the symbol. Similarly, newline, tab, backspace, and NULL characters can be included in a component by using **n** , **t** , **b** or **0** , respectively.



Beginning with release 1.20, the name type of the principal will be inferred as **KRB5_NT_SRV_INST** or **KRB5_NT_WELLKNOWN** based on the principal name. The type will be **KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL** if a type cannot be inferred.



Use krb5_free_principal() to free *principal_out* when it is no longer needed.

.. note::

	 The realm in a Kerberos *name* cannot contain slash, colon, or NULL characters.
