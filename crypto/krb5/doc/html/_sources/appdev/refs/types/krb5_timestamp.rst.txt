==============

..
.. c:type:: krb5_timestamp
..

Represents a timestamp in seconds since the POSIX epoch.

This legacy type is used frequently in the ABI, but cannot represent timestamps after 2038 as a positive number. Code which uses this type should cast values of it to uint32_t so that negative values are treated as timestamps between 2038 and 2106 on platforms with 64-bit time_t.

Declaration
------------

typedef krb5_int32 krb5_timestamp
