A container for a set of preauthentication questions and answers.

A responder context is supplied by the krb5 authentication system to a krb5_responder_fn callback. It contains a list of questions and can receive answers. Questions contained in a responder context can be listed using krb5_responder_list_questions(), retrieved using krb5_responder_get_challenge(), or answered using krb5_responder_set_answer(). The form of a question's challenge and answer depend on the question name.
