===============

..
.. c:type:: krb5_crypto_iov
..

Structure to describe a region of text to be encrypted or decrypted.

The *flags* member describes the type of the iov. The *data* member points to the memory that will be manipulated. All iov APIs take a pointer to the first element of an array of krb5_crypto_iov's along with the size of that array. Buffer contents are manipulated in-place; data is overwritten. Callers must allocate the right number of krb5_crypto_iov structures before calling into an iov API.

Declaration
------------

typedef struct _krb5_crypto_iov krb5_crypto_iov
