# Shell script that changes names that have been truncated to 8.3 format
# back to their original longer name. The awk script produces a script with
# lines of the following format:
#     if [ -f <short> ]; then echo ::mv <short> <long> ; mv <short> <long> ; fi
# These lines then get executed in bin/sh.
