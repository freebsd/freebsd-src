<p>
The MIT Kerberos program helps you manage your Kerberos tickets. Click
the Get Ticket button and enter your principal (your Kerberos identity)
and password to obtain a ticket. The ticket allows you to securely
access all of the computers and services set up to authenticate you
through Kerberos, until the ticket expires, without requiring you to
enter your password again. </p>

a renewable lifetime that is much longer (usually several days). Each

need to (once at time or automatically) until the renewable lifetime is
reached. Then you must obtain a new ticket. </td></tr>
