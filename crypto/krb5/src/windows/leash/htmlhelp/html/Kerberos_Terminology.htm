<h1><a name="top"> Kerberos Terminology</a></h1>
<p>
It is helpful to understand three terms when using Kerberos; <a href="#principal"> principals</a>, <a href="#realm"> realms</a>, and <a href="#ticket"> tickets</a>.</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th><a name="principal">Principals</a></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
 A Kerberos <i>principal</i> is a unique identity that uses
Kerberos. For users, it is the identity you use to log on to Kerberos.
Principals are a combination of your user name and the name of the <a href="#realm"> realm</a> (or domain) you belong to, in the form <span class="typed">username@REALM.NAME.</span> For example: <span class="typed">jdoe@SALES.WIDGET.COM.</span>
Some people will have more than one principal. An administrator might
have a regular principal and a separate one with administrative rights.
Or if a particular installation uses multiple realms and requires a
separate log-on for each one, people with access to multiple realms
will have a principal for each realm.
<p></p>
Because Kerberos provides <em>mutual</em> authentication, the
network resources that use Kerberos also have unique principals.
However, you do not need to know a service's principal to access it.<p></p>

<tr>
<th> <a name="realm"> Realms</a> </th>

<tr>
<td>
 Kerberos <i>realms</i> are a way of logically grouping
resources and identities that use Kerberos. Your realm is the home of
your Kerberos identity and your point of entry to the network resources
controlled by Kerberos. In Windows, realms are called <em>domains.</em>
<p></p>
When a Kerberos installation is set up, administrators decide how to
group identities and network resources into realms. For example, some
installations group all network resources into one realm. Others group
all identities into one realm that is solely used as an entry point to
resources grouped in other realms. Depending on your installation and
your needs, you might have a <a href="#principal"> principal</a>
(or principals) in only one realm that provides you with all the access
you need, or you might have different principals for accessing
different realms.
<p></p>Realms are usually named after the DNS domain they correspond
to, but using all upper case letters. For example, Widget Makers
Incorporated might have a realm named <span type="" typed="">WIDGETMAKERSINC.COM.</span>  By definition, each network resource in a Kerberos realm uses the same Kerberos installation  for authentication.<p></p>

<tr>
<th> <a name="ticket">Tickets</a></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Kerberos uses the concept of <i>tickets </i> to keep passwords
from being transmitted in the clear and to provide users the
convenience of a single log-on to access multiple services and hosts. <p></p>
Once a you provide a valid principal and password, Kerberos issues you
a ticket with a limited lifetime. This ticket is an encrypted block of
data that authenticates you. In most cases the ticket allows you to
access all of the appropriate network resources in the realm you use,
for the lifetime of the ticket, without having to take any further
action. <p></p>
When you access one of these resources, MIT Kerberos passes your
initial Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the service. Kerberos verifies
the ticket and then issues a separate ticket that allows access to that
service. You don't have to worry about obtaining or managing these new
service tickets; they are automatically issued. Service tickets can be
viewed with MIT Kerberos but cannot be directly obtained or destroyed
through it.
<p></p>
Tickets contain two <a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popupEncryptionKey, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">encryption keys</a>:
the ticket key and the session key. The ticket key is shared between
the Kerberos infrastructure and the service you are using. The session
key is shared between you and the service, and is used to encrypt and
decrypt communication with the service. <p></p>
