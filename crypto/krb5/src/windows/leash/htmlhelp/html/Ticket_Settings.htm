Your Kerberos ticket will expire at the end of the lifetime specified
with this slider control. Longer lifetimes are more convenient but less
secure. To get a longer usable ticket lifetime without losing security,
flag the ticket as renewable and then in the main window select the
Automatic Ticket Renewal option. <br>

You can forward tickets flagged as forwardable to the remote host when

you will not need to get new tickets to use remote services. Often your tickets will be forwarded automatically as needed. Ask your help desk or administrator for information specific to your installation.

A renewable ticket still has the normal lifetime, but before it expires
it can be renewed. Each renewal resets the ticket to the length of the
original lifetime (e.g. 10 hours). You can renew the ticket as often as
needed until the "Renewable Until" deadline is reached (e.g., 6 days).
You do not need to enter your password to renew tickets. <p></p>
If you let your ticket expire, you cannot renew it even if the ticket
is still within the renewable lifetime. For convenience, you can set
your tickets to automatically renew.<br>
