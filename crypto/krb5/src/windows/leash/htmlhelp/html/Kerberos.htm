<h1> Kerberos </h1>
<h2>What is Kerberos? </h2>
<p>
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that allows users to
securely access services over a physically insecure network. Kerberos,
or MIT Kerberos, is also the name of this application. MIT Kerberos
provides an easy interface to the Kerberos protocol.</p>

<p>
In addition to providing secure access to services, Kerberos adds
convenience by allowing you to sign on just once to use many network
resources such as servers, hosts, or other services.</p>
<p>
Kerberos gives you this convenience and security through the use of
single sign on, mutual authentication, and secret key encryption. </p>

<p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Single Sign On </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Your Kerberos identity (your <em><a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popupPrincipal, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)">principal</a></em>)
and your password allow you to log on just once to access all of the
servers, hosts, and other resources that use the Kerberos installation.
No matter how many resources you use, you will not need to enter your
password again. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Mutual Authentication </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Authentication is proof of identity. Any protocol or service that
demands a password is authenticating the user. However, Kerberos
provides <i>mutual</i> authentication, so in addition to proving your
identity to the server, it proves that the server you are communicating
with is what it claims to be. This protects you against <a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popupPhishing, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)"> phishing </a> and <a href="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(popupSpoofing, popfont,9,9,-1,-1)"> spoofing. </a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Secret-Key Encryption </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Kerberos prevents malicious attempts to intercept your password by
encrypting your password before transmitting it. In addition, once you
and the server have proved your identities to each other, Kerberos uses
secret-key cryptography to secure the rest of your communications. This
helps maintain your privacy and the integrity of your data.</td>
