<a name="renew">  <h3> When I try to renew my ticket, why do I get an error message and see the Get Ticket window? </h3> </a>
<p>
The ticket cannot be renewed. This could be because the ticket was not
flagged as renewable when you obtained it, or because it expired before
you could renew it, or because the ticket's renewable lifetime has been
reached. <a href="HTML/Tickets.htm#renewable">About: Renewable Tickets</a> </p>

<a name="expire">  </a><h3><a name=" expire">  Why did my tickets expire even though I had Automatically Renew Tickets turned on?  </a></h3>
<p> MIT Kerberos can only renew your tickets if the program is running
and active. It cannot renew your tickets if you exit the program or if
your computer is turned off or in hibernation mode.</p>

<p> Your Kerberos installation is configured for a maximum ticket
lifetime length that is determined by the administrators. If your
installation uses a shorter maximum ticket lifetime than the default,
the Ticket Lifetime slider might show the default maximum instead of
the actual maximum.</p>
<p> For example, if your Kerberos installation has been configured to
issue tickets that expire in 5 hours or less, you might be able to move
the slider to show 12 hours but you would still be issued a ticket with
a lifetime of only 5 hours.</p>

<h3> <a name="set-preferences"> How do I set properties like the default ticket lifetime?</a></h3>
<p>
You cannot use the MIT Kerberos program to set properties such as
default ticket lifetimes. Instead, edit the appropriate configuration
file. For more information, visit the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/krb_admins/conf_files/index.html" target="new"> MIT Kerberos documentation site. </a>

<h3>  <a name="default-principal"> I have multiple principals and have
tickets for all of them, but sometimes an application that requires
Kerberos doesn't work. What's going on? </a></h3>
<p>
When you try to use a Keberized application, it requests your
credentials from Kerberos. Some applications do this by asking for a
specific principal's credentials, but others ask generically. When
applications make a generic request, Kerberos does not know which
principal is being authenticated and checks the default principal for
tickets. If the default principal is not the one being authenticated,
the application will usually simply fail to work with no warning or
notice. <a href="HTML/Make_Default.htm">How to: Make Default Principal</a>
