			  IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This directory contains code of somewhat unknown origin that is
INCOMPATIBLE with both Berkeley DB 1.85 and Sleepycat DB 2.x.  Do NOT
contact Sleepycat regarding bugs in code found here; they do not
appreciate it.  All bug reports about this code should go to the MIT
Kerberos team via email to krb5-bugs@mit.edu, as usual.

It is believed that this "db" code originated from Berkeley DB 1.85
and was further modified by Cygnus and the MIT Kerberos team.  Some
significant changes to the hash code occurred at some point.

The file README.db2 contains the README file provided with the
2.0-alpha release of Berkeley/Sleepycat DB, which may contain
marginally useful information.  It is not known at this time how well
this code matches that of the 2.0-alpha release.
