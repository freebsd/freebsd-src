.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
kadmin and kadmin.local are command\-line interfaces to the Kerberos V5
administration system.  They provide nearly identical functionalities;
the difference is that kadmin.local directly accesses the KDC
database, while kadmin performs operations using kadmind(8)\&.
Except as explicitly noted otherwise, this man page will use "kadmin"
to refer to both versions.  kadmin provides for the maintenance of
Kerberos principals, password policies, and service key tables
(keytabs).
.sp
The remote kadmin client uses Kerberos to authenticate to kadmind
using the service principal \fBkadmin/admin\fP or \fBkadmin/ADMINHOST\fP
(where \fIADMINHOST\fP is the fully\-qualified hostname of the admin
server).  If the credentials cache contains a ticket for one of these
principals, and the \fB\-c\fP credentials_cache option is specified, that
ticket is used to authenticate to kadmind.  Otherwise, the \fB\-p\fP and
\fB\-k\fP options are used to specify the client Kerberos principal name
used to authenticate.  Once kadmin has determined the principal name,
it requests a service ticket from the KDC, and uses that service
ticket to authenticate to kadmind.
.sp
Since kadmin.local directly accesses the KDC database, it usually must
be run directly on the primary KDC with sufficient permissions to read
the KDC database.  If the KDC database uses the LDAP database module,
kadmin.local can be run on any host which can access the LDAP server.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrealm\fP
Use \fIrealm\fP as the default database realm.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIprincipal\fP
Use \fIprincipal\fP to authenticate.  Otherwise, kadmin will append
\fB/admin\fP to the primary principal name of the default ccache,
the value of the \fBUSER\fP environment variable, or the username as
obtained with getpwuid, in order of preference.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
Use a keytab to decrypt the KDC response instead of prompting for
a password.  In this case, the default principal will be
\fBhost/hostname\fP\&.  If there is no keytab specified with the
\fB\-t\fP option, then the default keytab will be used.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIkeytab\fP
Use \fIkeytab\fP to decrypt the KDC response.  This can only be used
with the \fB\-k\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Requests anonymous processing.  Two types of anonymous principals
are supported.  For fully anonymous Kerberos, configure PKINIT on
the KDC and configure \fBpkinit_anchors\fP in the client\(aqs
krb5.conf(5)\&.  Then use the \fB\-n\fP option with a principal
of the form \fB@REALM\fP (an empty principal name followed by the
at\-sign and a realm name).  If permitted by the KDC, an anonymous
ticket will be returned.  A second form of anonymous tickets is
supported; these realm\-exposed tickets hide the identity of the
client but not the client\(aqs realm.  For this mode, use \fBkinit
\-n\fP with a normal principal name.  If supported by the KDC, the
principal (but not realm) will be replaced by the anonymous
principal.  As of release 1.8, the MIT Kerberos KDC only supports
fully anonymous operation.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcredentials_cache\fP
Use \fIcredentials_cache\fP as the credentials cache.  The cache
should contain a service ticket for the \fBkadmin/admin\fP or
\fBkadmin/ADMINHOST\fP (where \fIADMINHOST\fP is the fully\-qualified
hostname of the admin server) service; it can be acquired with the
kinit(1) program.  If this option is not specified, kadmin
requests a new service ticket from the KDC, and stores it in its
own temporary ccache.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIpassword\fP
Use \fIpassword\fP instead of prompting for one.  Use this option with
care, as it may expose the password to other users on the system
via the process list.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP \fIquery\fP
Perform the specified query and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdbname\fP
Specifies the name of the KDC database.  This option does not
apply to the LDAP database module.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIadmin_server\fP[:\fIport\fP]
Specifies the admin server which kadmin should contact.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
If using kadmin.local, prompt for the database master password
instead of reading it from a stash file.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP "\fIenc\fP:\fIsalt\fP ..."
Sets the keysalt list to be used for any new keys created.  See
Keysalt_lists in kdc.conf(5) for a list of possible
values.
.TP
\fB\-O\fP
Force use of old AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Prevent fallback to AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP \fIdb_args\fP
Specifies the database specific arguments.  See the next section
for supported options.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Starting with release 1.14, if any command\-line arguments remain after
the options, they will be treated as a single query to be executed.
This mode of operation is intended for scripts and behaves differently
from the interactive mode in several respects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Query arguments are split by the shell, not by kadmin.
.IP \(bu 2
Informational and warning messages are suppressed.  Error messages
and query output (e.g. for \fBget_principal\fP) will still be
displayed.
.IP \(bu 2
Confirmation prompts are disabled (as if \fB\-force\fP was given).
Password prompts will still be issued as required.
.IP \(bu 2
The exit status will be non\-zero if the query fails.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-q\fP option does not carry these behavior differences; the query
will be processed as if it was entered interactively.  The \fB\-q\fP
option cannot be used in combination with a query in the remaining
arguments.
.SH DATABASE OPTIONS
.sp
Database options can be used to override database\-specific defaults.
Supported options for the DB2 module are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-x dbname=\fP*filename*
Specifies the base filename of the DB2 database.
.TP
\fB\-x lockiter\fP
Make iteration operations hold the lock for the duration of
the entire operation, rather than temporarily releasing the
lock while handling each principal.  This is the default
behavior, but this option exists to allow command line
override of a [dbmodules] setting.  First introduced in
release 1.13.
.TP
\fB\-x unlockiter\fP
Make iteration operations unlock the database for each
principal, instead of holding the lock for the duration of the
entire operation.  First introduced in release 1.13.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Supported options for the LDAP module are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-x host=\fP\fIldapuri\fP
Specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI.
.TP
\fB\-x binddn=\fP\fIbind_dn\fP
Specifies the DN used to bind to the LDAP server.
.TP
\fB\-x bindpwd=\fP\fIpassword\fP
Specifies the password or SASL secret used to bind to the LDAP
server.  Using this option may expose the password to other
users on the system via the process list; to avoid this,
instead stash the password using the \fBstashsrvpw\fP command of
kdb5_ldap_util(8)\&.
.TP
\fB\-x sasl_mech=\fP\fImechanism\fP
Specifies the SASL mechanism used to bind to the LDAP server.
The bind DN is ignored if a SASL mechanism is used.  New in
release 1.13.
.TP
\fB\-x sasl_authcid=\fP\fIname\fP
Specifies the authentication name used when binding to the
LDAP server with a SASL mechanism, if the mechanism requires
one.  New in release 1.13.
.TP
\fB\-x sasl_authzid=\fP\fIname\fP
Specifies the authorization name used when binding to the LDAP
server with a SASL mechanism.  New in release 1.13.
.TP
\fB\-x sasl_realm=\fP\fIrealm\fP
Specifies the realm used when binding to the LDAP server with
a SASL mechanism, if the mechanism uses one.  New in release
1.13.
.TP
\fB\-x debug=\fP\fIlevel\fP
sets the OpenLDAP client library debug level.  \fIlevel\fP is an
integer to be interpreted by the library.  Debugging messages
are printed to standard error.  New in release 1.12.

\fBadd_principal\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fInewprinc\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creates the principal \fInewprinc\fP, prompting twice for a password.  If
no password policy is specified with the \fB\-policy\fP option, and the
policy named \fBdefault\fP is assigned to the principal if it exists.
However, creating a policy named \fBdefault\fP will not automatically
assign this policy to previously existing principals.  This policy
assignment can be suppressed with the \fB\-clearpolicy\fP option.
.sp
This command requires the \fBadd\fP privilege.
.sp
Aliases: \fBaddprinc\fP, \fBank\fP

Prevents any policy from being assigned when \fB\-policy\fP is not
specified.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_postdated\fP
\fB\-allow_postdated\fP prohibits this principal from obtaining
postdated tickets.  \fB+allow_postdated\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_forwardable\fP
\fB\-allow_forwardable\fP prohibits this principal from obtaining
forwardable tickets.  \fB+allow_forwardable\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_renewable\fP

renewable tickets.  \fB+allow_renewable\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_proxiable\fP
\fB\-allow_proxiable\fP prohibits this principal from obtaining
proxiable tickets.  \fB+allow_proxiable\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_dup_skey\fP
\fB\-allow_dup_skey\fP disables user\-to\-user authentication for this
principal by prohibiting others from obtaining a service ticket
encrypted in this principal\(aqs TGT session key.
\fB+allow_dup_skey\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBrequires_preauth\fP
\fB+requires_preauth\fP requires this principal to preauthenticate
before being allowed to kinit.  \fB\-requires_preauth\fP clears this
flag.  When \fB+requires_preauth\fP is set on a service principal,
the KDC will only issue service tickets for that service principal
if the client\(aqs initial authentication was performed using
preauthentication.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBrequires_hwauth\fP
\fB+requires_hwauth\fP requires this principal to preauthenticate
using a hardware device before being allowed to kinit.
\fB\-requires_hwauth\fP clears this flag.  When \fB+requires_hwauth\fP is
set on a service principal, the KDC will only issue service tickets
for that service principal if the client\(aqs initial authentication was
performed using a hardware device to preauthenticate.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBok_as_delegate\fP
\fB+ok_as_delegate\fP sets the \fBokay as delegate\fP flag on tickets
issued with this principal as the service.  Clients may use this
flag as a hint that credentials should be delegated when
authenticating to the service.  \fB\-ok_as_delegate\fP clears this
flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_svr\fP
\fB\-allow_svr\fP prohibits the issuance of service tickets for this
principal.  In release 1.17 and later, user\-to\-user service
tickets are still allowed unless the \fB\-allow_dup_skey\fP flag is
also set.  \fB+allow_svr\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_tgs_req\fP
\fB\-allow_tgs_req\fP specifies that a Ticket\-Granting Service (TGS)
request for a service ticket for this principal is not permitted.
\fB+allow_tgs_req\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBallow_tix\fP
\fB\-allow_tix\fP forbids the issuance of any tickets for this
principal.  \fB+allow_tix\fP clears this flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBneedchange\fP
\fB+needchange\fP forces a password change on the next initial
authentication to this principal.  \fB\-needchange\fP clears this
flag.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBpassword_changing_service\fP
\fB+password_changing_service\fP marks this principal as a password
change service principal.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBok_to_auth_as_delegate\fP
\fB+ok_to_auth_as_delegate\fP allows this principal to acquire
forwardable tickets to itself from arbitrary users, for use with
constrained delegation.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBno_auth_data_required\fP
\fB+no_auth_data_required\fP prevents PAC or AD\-SIGNEDPATH data from
being added to service tickets for the principal.
.TP
{\-|+}\fBlockdown_keys\fP
\fB+lockdown_keys\fP prevents keys for this principal from leaving
the KDC via kadmind.  The chpass and extract operations are denied
for a principal with this attribute.  The chrand operation is
allowed, but will not return the new keys.  The delete and rename
operations are also denied if this attribute is set, in order to
prevent a malicious administrator from replacing principals like
krbtgt/* or kadmin/* with new principals without the attribute.
This attribute can be set via the network protocol, but can only
be removed using kadmin.local.
.TP
\fB\-randkey\fP
Sets the key of the principal to a random value.
.TP
\fB\-nokey\fP
Causes the principal to be created with no key.  New in release
1.12.
.TP
\fB\-pw\fP \fIpassword\fP
Sets the password of the principal to the specified string and
does not prompt for a password.  Note: using this option in a
shell script may expose the password to other users on the system
via the process list.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP \fIenc\fP:\fIsalt\fP,...
Uses the specified keysalt list for setting the keys of the
principal.  See Keysalt_lists in kdc.conf(5) for a
list of possible values.

of objects, each having optional \fBtype\fP and \fBusername\fP fields.
.TP
\fBpkinit_cert_match\fP
Specifies a matching expression that defines the certificate
attributes required for the client certificate used by the
principal during PKINIT authentication.  The matching expression
is in the same format as those used by the \fBpkinit_cert_match\fP
option in krb5.conf(5)\&.  (New in release 1.16.)
.TP
\fBpac_privsvr_enctype\fP
Forces the encryption type of the PAC KDC checksum buffers to the
specified encryption type for tickets issued to this server, by
deriving a key from the local krbtgt key if it is of a different
encryption type.  It may be necessary to set this value to
"aes256\-sha1" on the cross\-realm krbtgt entry for an Active
Directory realm when using aes\-sha2 keys on the local krbtgt
entry.

\fB\-maxlife\fP \fItime\fP
(duration or getdate string) Sets the maximum
lifetime of a password.
.TP
\fB\-minlife\fP \fItime\fP
(duration or getdate string) Sets the minimum
lifetime of a password.
.TP
\fB\-minlength\fP \fIlength\fP
Sets the minimum length of a password.
.TP
\fB\-minclasses\fP \fInumber\fP
Sets the minimum number of character classes required in a
password.  The five character classes are lower case, upper case,
numbers, punctuation, and whitespace/unprintable characters.
.TP
\fB\-history\fP \fInumber\fP
Sets the number of past keys kept for a principal.  This option is
not supported with the LDAP KDC database module.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-maxfailure\fP \fImaxnumber\fP
Sets the number of authentication failures before the principal is
locked.  Authentication failures are only tracked for principals
which require preauthentication.  The counter of failed attempts
resets to 0 after a successful attempt to authenticate.  A
\fImaxnumber\fP value of 0 (the default) disables lockout.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-failurecountinterval\fP \fIfailuretime\fP
(duration or getdate string) Sets the allowable time
between authentication failures.  If an authentication failure
happens after \fIfailuretime\fP has elapsed since the previous
failure, the number of authentication failures is reset to 1.  A
\fIfailuretime\fP value of 0 (the default) means forever.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-lockoutduration\fP \fIlockouttime\fP
(duration or getdate string) Sets the duration for
which the principal is locked from authenticating if too many
authentication failures occur without the specified failure count
interval elapsing.  A duration of 0 (the default) means the
principal remains locked out until it is administratively unlocked
with \fBmodprinc \-unlock\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-allowedkeysalts\fP
Specifies the key/salt tuples supported for long\-term keys when
setting or changing a principal\(aqs password/keys.  See
Keysalt_lists in kdc.conf(5) for a list of the
accepted values, but note that key/salt tuples must be separated
with commas (\(aq,\(aq) only.  To clear the allowed key/salt policy use
a value of \(aq\-\(aq.
