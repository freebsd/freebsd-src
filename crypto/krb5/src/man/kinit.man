.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
kinit obtains and caches an initial ticket\-granting ticket for
\fIprincipal\fP\&.  If \fIprincipal\fP is absent, kinit chooses an appropriate
principal name based on existing credential cache contents or the
local username of the user invoking kinit.  Some options modify the
choice of principal name.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
display verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIlifetime\fP
(duration string.)  Requests a ticket with the lifetime
\fIlifetime\fP\&.
.sp
For example, \fBkinit \-l 5:30\fP or \fBkinit \-l 5h30m\fP\&.
.sp
If the \fB\-l\fP option is not specified, the default ticket lifetime
(configured by each site) is used.  Specifying a ticket lifetime
longer than the maximum ticket lifetime (configured by each site)
will not override the configured maximum ticket lifetime.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIstart_time\fP
(duration string.)  Requests a postdated ticket.  Postdated
tickets are issued with the \fBinvalid\fP flag set, and need to be
resubmitted to the KDC for validation before use.
.sp
\fIstart_time\fP specifies the duration of the delay before the ticket
can become valid.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrenewable_life\fP
(duration string.)  Requests renewable tickets, with a total
lifetime of \fIrenewable_life\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
requests forwardable tickets.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
requests non\-forwardable tickets.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
requests proxiable tickets.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP
requests non\-proxiable tickets.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
requests tickets restricted to the host\(aqs local address[es].
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
requests tickets not restricted by address.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
requests canonicalization of the principal name, and allows the
KDC to reply with a different client principal from the one
requested.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP
treats the principal name as an enterprise name.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
requests that the ticket\-granting ticket in the cache (with the
\fBinvalid\fP flag set) be passed to the KDC for validation.  If the
ticket is within its requested time range, the cache is replaced
with the validated ticket.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
requests renewal of the ticket\-granting ticket.  Note that an
expired ticket cannot be renewed, even if the ticket is still
within its renewable life.
.sp
Note that renewable tickets that have expired as reported by
klist(1) may sometimes be renewed using this option,
because the KDC applies a grace period to account for client\-KDC
clock skew.  See krb5.conf(5) \fBclockskew\fP setting.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP [\fB\-i\fP | \fB\-t\fP \fIkeytab_file\fP]
requests a ticket, obtained from a key in the local host\(aqs keytab.
The location of the keytab may be specified with the \fB\-t\fP
\fIkeytab_file\fP option, or with the \fB\-i\fP option to specify the use
of the default client keytab; otherwise the default keytab will be
used.  By default, a host ticket for the local host is requested,
but any principal may be specified.  On a KDC, the special keytab
location \fBKDB:\fP can be used to indicate that kinit should open
the KDC database and look up the key directly.  This permits an
administrator to obtain tickets as any principal that supports
authentication based on the key.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Requests anonymous processing.  Two types of anonymous principals
are supported.
.sp
For fully anonymous Kerberos, configure pkinit on the KDC and
configure \fBpkinit_anchors\fP in the client\(aqs krb5.conf(5)\&.
Then use the \fB\-n\fP option with a principal of the form \fB@REALM\fP
(an empty principal name followed by the at\-sign and a realm
name).  If permitted by the KDC, an anonymous ticket will be
returned.
.sp
A second form of anonymous tickets is supported; these
realm\-exposed tickets hide the identity of the client but not the
client\(aqs realm.  For this mode, use \fBkinit \-n\fP with a normal
principal name.  If supported by the KDC, the principal (but not
realm) will be replaced by the anonymous principal.
.sp
As of release 1.8, the MIT Kerberos KDC only supports fully
anonymous operation.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-I\fP \fIinput_ccache\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the name of a credentials cache that already contains a
ticket.  When obtaining that ticket, if information about how that
ticket was obtained was also stored to the cache, that information
will be used to affect how new credentials are obtained, including
preselecting the same methods of authenticating to the KDC.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-T\fP \fIarmor_ccache\fP
Specifies the name of a credentials cache that already contains a
ticket.  If supported by the KDC, this cache will be used to armor
the request, preventing offline dictionary attacks and allowing
the use of additional preauthentication mechanisms.  Armoring also
makes sure that the response from the KDC is not modified in
transit.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcache_name\fP
use \fIcache_name\fP as the Kerberos 5 credentials (ticket) cache
location.  If this option is not used, the default cache location
is used.
.sp
The default cache location may vary between systems.  If the
\fBKRB5CCNAME\fP environment variable is set, its value is used to
locate the default cache.  If a principal name is specified and
the type of the default cache supports a collection (such as the
DIR type), an existing cache containing credentials for the
principal is selected or a new one is created and becomes the new
primary cache.  Otherwise, any existing contents of the default
cache are destroyed by kinit.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIservice_name\fP
specify an alternate service name to use when getting initial
tickets.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP \fIattribute\fP[=\fIvalue\fP]
specify a pre\-authentication \fIattribute\fP and \fIvalue\fP to be
interpreted by pre\-authentication modules.  The acceptable
attribute and value values vary from module to module.  This
option may be specified multiple times to specify multiple
attributes.  If no value is specified, it is assumed to be "yes".
.sp
The following attributes are recognized by the PKINIT
pre\-authentication mechanism:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fBX509_user_identity\fP=\fIvalue\fP
specify where to find user\(aqs X509 identity information
.TP
\fBX509_anchors\fP=\fIvalue\fP
specify where to find trusted X509 anchor information
.TP
\fBflag_RSA_PROTOCOL\fP[\fB=yes\fP]
specify use of RSA, rather than the default Diffie\-Hellman
protocol
.TP
\fBdisable_freshness\fP[\fB=yes\fP]
disable sending freshness tokens (for testing purposes only)
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fB\-\-request\-pac\fP | \fB\-\-no\-request\-pac\fP
mutually exclusive.  If \fB\-\-request\-pac\fP is set, ask the KDC to
include a PAC in authdata; if \fB\-\-no\-request\-pac\fP is set, ask the
KDC not to include a PAC; if neither are set,  the KDC will follow
its default, which is typically is to include a PAC if doing so is
supported.

variables.
