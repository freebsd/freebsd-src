/*
 * Approach overview:
 *
 * If a system version is available but buggy, save handles to it,
 * redefine the names to refer to static functions defined here, and
 * in those functions, call the system versions and fix up the
 * returned data.  Use the native data structures and flag values.
 *
 * If no system version exists, use gethostby* and fake it.  Define
 * the data structures and flag values locally.
 *
 *
 * On macOS, getaddrinfo results aren't cached (though gethostbyname
 * results are), so we need to build a cache here.  Now things are
 * getting really messy.  Because the cache is in use, we use
 * getservbyname, and throw away thread safety.  (Not that the cache
 * is thread safe, but when we get locking support, that'll be dealt
 * with.)  This code needs tearing down and rebuilding, soon.
 *
 *
 * Note that recent Windows developers' code has an interesting hack:
 * When you include the right header files, with the right set of
 * macros indicating system versions, you'll get an inline function
 * that looks for getaddrinfo (or whatever) in the system library, and
 * calls it if it's there.  If it's not there, it fakes it with
 * gethostby* calls.
 *
 * We're taking a simpler approach: A system provides these routines or
 * it does not.
 *
 * Someday, we may want to take into account different versions (say,
 * different revs of GNU libc) where some are broken in one way, and
 * some work or are broken in another way.  Cross that bridge when we
 * come to it.

/* To do, maybe:
 *
 * + For AIX 4.3.3, using the RFC 2133 definition: Implement
 *   AI_NUMERICHOST.  It's not defined in the header file.
 *
 *   For certain (old?) versions of GNU libc, AI_NUMERICHOST is
 *   defined but not implemented.
 *
 * + Use gethostbyname2, inet_aton and other IPv6 or thread-safe
 *   functions if available.  But, see
 *   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=135182 for one
 *   gethostbyname2 problem on Linux.  And besides, if a platform is
 *   supporting IPv6 at all, they really should be doing getaddrinfo
 *   by now.
 *
 * + inet_ntop, inet_pton
 *
 * + Conditionally export/import the function definitions, so a
 *   library can have a single copy instead of multiple.
 *
 * + Upgrade host requirements to include working implementations of
 *   these functions, and throw all this away.  Pleeease?  :-)
