=head1 NAME

EVP_MD-SHAKE, EVP_MD-KECCAK-KMAC
- The SHAKE / KECCAK family EVP_MD implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing SHAKE or KECCAK-KMAC digests through the
B<EVP_MD> API.

KECCAK-KMAC is an Extendable Output Function (XOF), with a definition
similar to SHAKE, used by the KMAC EVP_MAC implementation (see
L<EVP_MAC-KMAC(7)>).

=head2 Identities

This implementation is available in the FIPS provider as well as the default
provider, and includes the following varieties:

=over 4

=item KECCAK-KMAC-128

Known names are "KECCAK-KMAC-128" and "KECCAK-KMAC128".  This is used
by L<EVP_MAC-KMAC128(7)>.  Using the notation from NIST FIPS 202
(Section 6.2), we have S<KECCAK-KMAC-128(M, d)> = S<KECCAK[256](M || 00, d)>
(see the description of KMAC128 in Appendix A of NIST SP 800-185).

=item KECCAK-KMAC-256

Known names are "KECCAK-KMAC-256" and "KECCAK-KMAC256".  This is used
by L<EVP_MAC-KMAC256(7)>.  Using the notation from NIST FIPS 202
(Section 6.2), we have S<KECCAK-KMAC-256(M, d)> = S<KECCAK[512](M || 00, d)>
(see the description of KMAC256 in Appendix A of NIST SP 800-185).

=item SHAKE-128

Known names are "SHAKE-128" and "SHAKE128".

=item SHAKE-256

Known names are "SHAKE-256" and "SHAKE256".

=back

=head2 Parameters

This implementation supports the following L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> entries:

=over 4

=item "xoflen" (B<OSSL_DIGEST_PARAM_XOFLEN>) <unsigned integer>

Sets or Gets the digest length for extendable output functions.
The length of the "xoflen" parameter should not exceed that of a B<size_t>.

The SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 implementations do not have any default digest
length.

This parameter must be set before calling either EVP_DigestFinal_ex() or
EVP_DigestFinal(), since these functions were not designed to handle variable
length output. It is recommended to either use EVP_DigestSqueeze() or
EVP_DigestFinalXOF() instead.

=item "size" (B<OSSL_DIGEST_PARAM_SIZE>) <unsigned integer>

An alias of "xoflen".

=back

See L<EVP_DigestInit(3)/PARAMETERS> for further information related to parameters

=head1 NOTES

For SHAKE-128, to ensure the maximum security strength of 128 bits, the output
length passed to EVP_DigestFinalXOF() should be at least 32.

For SHAKE-256, to ensure the maximum security strength of 256 bits, the output
length passed to EVP_DigestFinalXOF() should be at least 64.

=head1 HISTORY

Since OpenSSL 3.4 the SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 implementations have no default
digest length.
