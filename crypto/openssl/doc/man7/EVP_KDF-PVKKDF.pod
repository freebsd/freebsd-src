=head1 NAME

EVP_KDF-PVKKDF - The PVK EVP_KDF implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing the B<PVK KDF> PIN-based KDF through the B<EVP_KDF>
API.

The EVP_KDF-PVKKDF algorithm implements a PVK PIN-based key
derivation function; it derives a key from a password using a salt.

=head2 Identity

"PVKKDF" is the name for this implementation; it
can be used with the EVP_KDF_fetch() function.

=head2 Supported parameters

The supported parameters are:

=over 4

=item "pass" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PASSWORD>) <octet string>

=item "salt" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SALT>) <octet string>

=item "properties" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PROPERTIES>) <UTF8 string>

=item "digest" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

A typical application of this algorithm is to derive keying material for an
encryption algorithm from a password in the "pass" and a salt in "salt".

No assumption is made regarding the given password; it is simply treated as a
byte sequence.

The legacy provider needs to be available in order to access this algorithm.
