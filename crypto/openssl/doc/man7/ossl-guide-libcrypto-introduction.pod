- OpenSSL Guide: An introduction to libcrypto


=head1 INTRODUCTION

The OpenSSL cryptography library (C<libcrypto>) enables access to a wide range
of cryptographic algorithms used in various Internet standards. The services
provided by this library are used by the OpenSSL implementations of TLS and
CMS, and they have also been used to implement many other third party products
and protocols.

The functionality includes symmetric encryption, public key cryptography, key
agreement, certificate handling, cryptographic hash functions, cryptographic
pseudo-random number generators, message authentication codes (MACs), key
derivation functions (KDFs), and various utilities.

=head2 Algorithms

Cryptographic primitives such as the SHA256 digest, or AES encryption are
referred to in OpenSSL as "algorithms". Each algorithm may have multiple
implementations available for use. For example the RSA algorithm is available as
a "default" implementation suitable for general use, and a "fips" implementation
which has been validated to FIPS 140 standards for situations where that is
important. It is also possible that a third party could add additional
implementations such as in a hardware security module (HSM).

Algorithms are implemented in providers. See
L<ossl-guide-libraries-introduction(7)> for information about providers.

=head2 Operations

Different algorithms can be grouped together by their purpose. For example there
are algorithms for encryption, and different algorithms for digesting data.
These different groups are known as "operations" in OpenSSL. Each operation
has a different set of functions associated with it. For example to perform an
encryption operation using AES (or any other encryption algorithm) you would use
the encryption functions detailed on the L<EVP_EncryptInit(3)> page. Or to
perform a digest operation using SHA256 then you would use the digesting
functions on the L<EVP_DigestInit(3)> page.

=head1 ALGORITHM FETCHING

In order to use an algorithm an implementation for it must first be "fetched".
Fetching is the process of looking through the available implementations,
applying selection criteria (via a property query string), and finally choosing
the implementation that will be used.

Two types of fetching are supported by OpenSSL - L</Explicit fetching> and
L</Implicit fetching>.

=head2 Explicit fetching

Explicit fetching involves directly calling a specific API to fetch an algorithm
implementation from a provider. This fetched object can then be passed to other
APIs. These explicit fetching functions usually have the name C<APINAME_fetch>,
where C<APINAME> is the name of the operation. For example L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)>
can be used to explicitly fetch a digest algorithm implementation. The user is
responsible for freeing the object returned from the C<APINAME_fetch> function
using C<APINAME_free> when it is no longer needed.

These fetching functions follow a fairly common pattern, where three
arguments are passed:

=over 4

=item The library context

See L<OSSL_LIB_CTX(3)> for a more detailed description.
This may be NULL to signify the default (global) library context, or a
context created by the user. Only providers loaded in this library context (see
L<OSSL_PROVIDER_load(3)>) will be considered by the fetching function. In case
no provider has been loaded in this library context then the default provider
will be loaded as a fallback (see L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)>).

=item An identifier

For all currently implemented fetching functions this is the algorithm name.
Each provider supports a list of algorithm implementations. See the provider
specific documentation for information on the algorithm implementations
available in each provider:
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS>,
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS>,
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS> and
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-base(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS>.

Note, while providers may register algorithms against a list of names using a
string with a colon separated list of names, fetching algorithms using that
format is currently unsupported.

=item A property query string

The property query string used to guide selection of the algorithm
implementation. See
L<ossl-guide-libraries-introduction(7)/PROPERTY QUERY STRINGS>.

=back

The algorithm implementation that is fetched can then be used with other diverse
functions that use them. For example the L<EVP_DigestInit_ex(3)> function takes
as a parameter an B<EVP_MD> object which may have been returned from an earlier
call to L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)>.

=head2 Implicit fetching

OpenSSL has a number of functions that return an algorithm object with no
associated implementation, such as L<EVP_sha256(3)>, L<EVP_aes_128_cbc(3)>,
L<EVP_get_cipherbyname(3)> or L<EVP_get_digestbyname(3)>. These are present for
compatibility with OpenSSL before version 3.0 where explicit fetching was not
available.

When they are used with functions like L<EVP_DigestInit_ex(3)> or
L<EVP_CipherInit_ex(3)>, the actual implementation to be used is
fetched implicitly using default search criteria (which uses NULL for the
library context and property query string).

In some cases implicit fetching can also occur when a NULL algorithm parameter
is supplied. In this case an algorithm implementation is implicitly fetched
using default search criteria and an algorithm name that is consistent with
the context in which it is being used.

Functions that use an B<EVP_PKEY_CTX> or an L<EVP_PKEY(3)>, such as
L<EVP_DigestSignInit(3)>, all fetch the implementations implicitly. Usually the
algorithm to fetch is determined based on the type of key that is being used and
the function that has been called.

=head2 Performance

If you perform the same operation many times with the same algorithm then it is
recommended to use a single explicit fetch of the algorithm and then reuse the
explicitly fetched algorithm each subsequent time. This will typically be
faster than implicitly fetching the algorithm every time you use it. See an
example of Explicit fetching in L</USING ALGORITHMS IN APPLICATIONS>.

Prior to OpenSSL 3.0, functions such as EVP_sha256() which return a "const"
object were used directly to indicate the algorithm to use in various function
calls. If you pass the return value of one of these convenience functions to an
operation then you are using implicit fetching. If you are converting an
application that worked with an OpenSSL version prior to OpenSSL 3.0 then
consider changing instances of implicit fetching to explicit fetching instead.

If an explicitly fetched object is not passed to an operation, then any implicit
fetch will use an internally cached prefetched object, but it will
still be slower than passing the explicitly fetched object directly.

The following functions can be used for explicit fetching:

=over 4

=item L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)>

Fetch a message digest/hashing algorithm implementation.

=item L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)>

Fetch a symmetric cipher algorithm implementation.

=item L<EVP_KDF_fetch(3)>

Fetch a Key Derivation Function (KDF) algorithm implementation.

=item L<EVP_MAC_fetch(3)>

Fetch a Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm implementation.

=item L<EVP_KEM_fetch(3)>

Fetch a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) algorithm implementation

=item L<OSSL_ENCODER_fetch(3)>

Fetch an encoder algorithm implementation (e.g. to encode keys to a specified
format).

=item L<OSSL_DECODER_fetch(3)>

Fetch a decoder algorithm implementation (e.g. to decode keys from a specified
format).

=item L<EVP_RAND_fetch(3)>

Fetch a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithm implementation.

=back

See L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS>,
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS>,
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS> and
L<OSSL_PROVIDER-base(7)/OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS> for a list of algorithm names
that can be fetched.

=head1 FETCHING EXAMPLES

The following section provides a series of examples of fetching algorithm
implementations.

Fetch any available implementation of SHA2-256 in the default context. Note
that some algorithms have aliases. So "SHA256" and "SHA2-256" are synonymous:

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", NULL);
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Fetch any available implementation of AES-128-CBC in the default context:

 EVP_CIPHER *cipher = EVP_CIPHER_fetch(NULL, "AES-128-CBC", NULL);
 ...
 EVP_CIPHER_free(cipher);

Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 from the default provider in the default
context:

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", "provider=default");
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 that is not from the default provider in the
default context:

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", "provider!=default");
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 that is preferably from the FIPS provider in
the default context:

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", "provider=?fips");
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Fetch an implementation of SHA2-256 from the default provider in the specified
library context:

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(libctx, "SHA2-256", "provider=default");
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Load the legacy provider into the default context and then fetch an
implementation of WHIRLPOOL from it:

 /* This only needs to be done once - usually at application start up */
 OSSL_PROVIDER *legacy = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy");

 EVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "WHIRLPOOL", "provider=legacy");
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md);

Note that in the above example the property string "provider=legacy" is optional
since, assuming no other providers have been loaded, the only implementation of
the "whirlpool" algorithm is in the "legacy" provider. Also note that the
default provider should be explicitly loaded if it is required in addition to
other providers:

 /* This only needs to be done once - usually at application start up */
 OSSL_PROVIDER *legacy = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy");
 OSSL_PROVIDER *default = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "default");

 EVP_MD *md_whirlpool = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "whirlpool", NULL);
 EVP_MD *md_sha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA2-256", NULL);
 ...
 EVP_MD_free(md_whirlpool);
 EVP_MD_free(md_sha256);


=head1 USING ALGORITHMS IN APPLICATIONS

Cryptographic algorithms are made available to applications through use of the
"EVP" APIs. Each of the various operations such as encryption, digesting,
message authentication codes, etc., have a set of EVP function calls that can
be invoked to use them. See the L<evp(7)> page for further details.

Most of these follow a common pattern. A "context" object is first created. For
example for a digest operation you would use an B<EVP_MD_CTX>, and for an
encryption/decryption operation you would use an B<EVP_CIPHER_CTX>. The
operation is then initialised ready for use via an "init" function - optionally
passing in a set of parameters (using the L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> type) to configure how
the operation should behave. Next data is fed into the operation in a series of
"update" calls. The operation is finalised using a "final" call which will
typically provide some kind of output. Finally the context is cleaned up and
freed.

The following shows a complete example for doing this process for digesting
data using SHA256. The process is similar for other operations such as
encryption/decryption, signatures, message authentication codes, etc. Additional
examples can be found in the OpenSSL demos (see
L<ossl-guide-libraries-introduction(7)/DEMO APPLICATIONS>).

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <openssl/evp.h>
 #include <openssl/bio.h>
 #include <openssl/err.h>

 int main(void)
 {
     EVP_MD_CTX *ctx = NULL;
     EVP_MD *sha256 = NULL;
     const unsigned char msg[] = {
         0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03
     };
     unsigned int len = 0;
     unsigned char *outdigest = NULL;
     int ret = 1;

     /* Create a context for the digest operation */
     ctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new();
     if (ctx == NULL)
         goto err;

     /*
      * Fetch the SHA256 algorithm implementation for doing the digest. We're
      * using the "default" library context here (first NULL parameter), and
      * we're not supplying any particular search criteria for our SHA256
      * implementation (second NULL parameter). Any SHA256 implementation will
      * do.
      * In a larger application this fetch would just be done once, and could
      * be used for multiple calls to other operations such as EVP_DigestInit_ex().
      */
     sha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, "SHA256", NULL);
     if (sha256 == NULL)
         goto err;

    /* Initialise the digest operation */
    if (!EVP_DigestInit_ex(ctx, sha256, NULL))
        goto err;

     /*
      * Pass the message to be digested. This can be passed in over multiple
      * EVP_DigestUpdate calls if necessary
      */
     if (!EVP_DigestUpdate(ctx, msg, sizeof(msg)))
         goto err;

     /* Allocate the output buffer */
     outdigest = OPENSSL_malloc(EVP_MD_get_size(sha256));
     if (outdigest == NULL)
         goto err;

     /* Now calculate the digest itself */
     if (!EVP_DigestFinal_ex(ctx, outdigest, &len))
         goto err;

     /* Print out the digest result */
     BIO_dump_fp(stdout, outdigest, len);

     ret = 0;

  err:
     /* Clean up all the resources we allocated */
     OPENSSL_free(outdigest);
     EVP_MD_free(sha256);
     EVP_MD_CTX_free(ctx);
     if (ret != 0)
        ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
     return ret;
 }

=head1 ENCODING AND DECODING KEYS

Many algorithms require the use of a key. Keys can be generated dynamically
using the EVP APIs (for example see L<EVP_PKEY_Q_keygen(3)>). However it is often
necessary to save or load keys (or their associated parameters) to or from some
external format such as PEM or DER (see L<openssl-glossary(7)>). OpenSSL uses
encoders and decoders to perform this task.

Encoders and decoders are just algorithm implementations in the same way as
any other algorithm implementation in OpenSSL. They are implemented by
providers. The OpenSSL encoders and decoders are available in the default
provider. They are also duplicated in the base provider.

For information about encoders see L<OSSL_ENCODER_CTX_new_for_pkey(3)>. For
information about decoders see L<OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey(3)>.

As well as using encoders/decoders directly there are also some helper functions
that can be used for certain well known and commonly used formats. For example
see L<PEM_read_PrivateKey(3)> and L<PEM_write_PrivateKey(3)> for information
about reading and writing key data from PEM encoded files.
