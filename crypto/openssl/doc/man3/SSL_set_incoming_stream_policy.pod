SSL_set_incoming_stream_policy, SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_AUTO,
SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_ACCEPT,
SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_REJECT - manage the QUIC incoming stream
policy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 #define SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_AUTO
 #define SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_ACCEPT
 #define SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_REJECT

 int SSL_set_incoming_stream_policy(SSL *conn, int policy,
                                           uint64_t app_error_code);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_set_incoming_stream_policy() policy changes the incoming stream policy for a
QUIC connection. Depending on the policy configured, OpenSSL QUIC may
automatically reject incoming streams initiated by the peer. This is intended to
ensure that legacy applications using single-stream operation with a default
stream on a QUIC connection SSL object are not passed remotely-initiated streams
by a peer which those applications are not prepared to handle.

I<app_error_code> is an application error code which will be used in any QUIC
B<STOP_SENDING> or B<RESET_STREAM> frames generated to implement the policy. The
default application error code is 0.

The valid values for I<policy> are:

=over 4

=item SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_AUTO

This is the default setting. Incoming streams are accepted according to the
following rules:

=over 4

=item *

If the default stream mode (configured using L<SSL_set_default_stream_mode(3)>)
is set to B<SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_BIDI> (the default) or
B<SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_AUTO_UNI>, the incoming stream is rejected.

=item *

Otherwise (where the default stream mode is B<SSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_MODE_NONE>),
the application is assumed to be stream aware, and the incoming stream is
accepted.

=back

=item SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_ACCEPT

Always accept incoming streams, allowing them to be dequeued using
L<SSL_accept_stream(3)>.

=item SSL_INCOMING_STREAM_POLICY_REJECT

Always reject incoming streams.

=back

Where an incoming stream is rejected, it is rejected immediately and it is not
possible to gain access to the stream using L<SSL_accept_stream(3)>. The stream
is rejected using QUIC B<STOP_SENDING> and B<RESET_STREAM> frames as
appropriate.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

This function fails if called on a QUIC stream SSL object, or on a non-QUIC SSL
object.
