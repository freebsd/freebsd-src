=head1 NAME

SSL_stream_conclude - conclude the sending part of a QUIC stream

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 __owur int SSL_stream_conclude(SSL *s, uint64_t flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_stream_conclude() signals the normal end-of-stream condition for the send
part of a QUIC stream. If called on a QUIC connection SSL object with an
associated default stream, it signals the end of the single stream to the peer.

Any data already queued for transmission via a call to SSL_write() will still be
written in a reliable manner before the end-of-stream is signalled, assuming the
connection remains healthy. This function can be thought of as appending a
logical end-of-stream marker after any data which has previously been written to
the stream via calls to SSL_write(). Further attempts to call SSL_write() after
calling this function will fail.

When calling this on a stream, the receive part of the stream remains
unaffected, and the peer may continue to send data until it also signals the end
of the stream. Thus, SSL_read() can still be used.

I<flags> is reserved and should be set to 0.

Only the first call to this function has any effect for a given stream;
subsequent calls are no-ops. This is considered a success case.

This function is not supported on an object other than a QUIC stream SSL object.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

Returns 0 if called on an SSL object not representing a QUIC stream.
