DTLSv1_handle_timeout - handle a pending timeout event for a DTLS or QUIC SSL
object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int DTLSv1_handle_timeout(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DTLSv1_handle_timeout() handles any timeout events which have become pending
on a DTLS or QUIC SSL object.

Use L<DTLSv1_get_timeout(3)> or L<SSL_get_event_timeout(3)> to determine
when to call DTLSv1_handle_timeout().

This function is only applicable to DTLS or QUIC SSL objects. It returns 0 if
called on any other kind of SSL object.

L<SSL_handle_events(3)> supersedes all use cases for this function and may
be used instead of it.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns 1 if there was a pending timeout event and it was handled successfully.

Returns 0 if there was no pending timeout event, or if the SSL object is not a
DTLS or QUIC object.

Returns -1 if there was a pending timeout event but it could not be handled
successfully.
