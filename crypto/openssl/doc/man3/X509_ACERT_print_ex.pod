=head1 NAME

X509_ACERT_print_ex, X509_ACERT_print
- X509_ACERT printing routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509_acert.h>

 int X509_ACERT_print(BIO *bp, X509_ACERT *acert);
 int X509_ACERT_print_ex(BIO *bp, X509_ACERT *acert, unsigned long nmflags,
                         unsigned long cflag);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_ACERT_print_ex() prints a human readable version of the attribute
certificate I<acert> to BIO I<bp>.

The following data contained in the attribute certificate is printed
in order:

=over 4

=item *

The header text "Attribute certificate:" and "Data:" (X509_FLAG_NO_HEADER)

= item *

The attribute certificate version number as defined by the standard,
followed in parentheses by the value contained in the version field in
hexadecimal notation.  If the version number is not a valid value according
to the specification, only the raw value is printed.
See X509_ACERT_get_version(3) for details. (X509_FLAG_NO_VERSION)

= item *

The serial number of the attribute certificate (X509_FLAG_NO_SERIAL)

= item *

The identity of the holder of the attribute certificate. If the
holder issuer name is present, the first GENERAL_NAME
returned by X509_ACERT_get0_holder_entityName() is printed.
If the holder baseCertificateId is present, the issuer name
(printed with X509_NAME_print_ex) and serial number of the
holder's certificate are displayed. (X509_FLAG_NO_SUBJECT)

= item *

The name of the attribute certificate issuer as returned from
X509_ACERT_get0_issuerName() and printed using X509_NAME_print_ex().
(X509_FLAG_NO_ISSUER)

= item *

The period of validity between the times returned from X509_ACERT_get0_notBefore()
and  X509_ACERT_get0_notAfter().  The values are printed as a generalized times
using ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME_print(). (X509_FLAG_NO_VALIDITY)

= item *

The list of attributes contained in the attribute certificate.
The attribute type is printed with i2a_ASN1_OBJECT().  String valued
attributes are printed as raw string data. ASN1 encoded values are
printed with ASN1_parse_dump().  (X509_FLAG_NO_ATTRIBUTES)

= item *

All X.509 extensions contained in the attribute certificate. (X509_FLAG_NO_EXTENSIONS)

= item *

The signature is printed with X509_signature_print(). (X509_FLAG_NO_SIGDUMP)

If I<cflag> is specifies as X509_FLAG_COMPAT, all of the above data in the
attribute certificate will be printed.

The I<nmflags> flag determines the format used to output all fields printed using
X509_NAME_print_ex(). See L<X509_NAME_print_ex(3)> for details.

X509_ACERT_print() is equivalent to calling X509_ACERT_print_ex() with the
I<nmflags> and I<cflags> set to XN_FLAG_COMPAT and X509_FLAG_COMPAT
respectively.

X509_ACERT_print_ex() X509_ACERT_print() return 1 for
success and 0 for failure.
