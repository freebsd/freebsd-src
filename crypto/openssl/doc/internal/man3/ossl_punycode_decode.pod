=head1 NAME

ossl_punycode_decode, ossl_a2ulabel
- internal punycode-related functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include "crypto/punycode.h"

  int ossl_punycode_decode(const char *pEncoded, const size_t enc_len,
                           unsigned int *pDecoded, unsigned int *pout_length);

  int ossl_a2ulabel(const char *in, char *out, size_t outlen);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PUNYCODE encoding introduced in RFCs 3490-3492 is widely used for
representation of hostnames in ASCII-only format. Some specifications,
such as RFC 8398, require comparison of hostnames encoded in UTF-8 charset.

ossl_a2ulabel() decodes NUL-terminated hostname from PUNYCODE to UTF-8,
using a provided buffer for output.  The output buffer is NUL-terminated.

ossl_punycode_decode() decodes one label (one dot-separated part) from
a hostname, with stripped PUNYCODE marker I<xn-->.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_a2ulabel() returns 1 on success, 0 if the output buffer is too small and
-1 if an invalid PUNYCODE string is passed or another error occurs.

ossl_punycode_decode() returns 1 on success, 0 on error. On success,
*pout_length contains the number of codepoints decoded.

=head1 HISTORY

The functions described here were all added in OpenSSL 3.0.
