=head1 NAME

ossl_serial_number_print
- Print a CertificateSerialNumber

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <crypto/x509.h>

 int ossl_serial_number_print(BIO *out, const ASN1_INTEGER *bs, int indent);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function writes a certificate serial number I<bs> to BIO I<out> in decimal if the serial
number can be read into a long int, as well as hexadecimal. It notifies the
user of negative serial numbers, and handles wrapping of huge serial numbers.
The output is written to a newline and indented by I<indent> spaces if the
serial number cannot be read into a long int.

If the serial number fits into a long int, it is printed on the same line as
whatever precedes it, after a single SPACE character.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
