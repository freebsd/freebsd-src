This package describes important Cygwin specific stuff concerning OpenSSH.

The binary package is usually built for recent Cygwin versions and might
not run on older versions.  Please check http://cygwin.com/ for information
about current Cygwin releases.

==================
Host configuration
==================

If you are installing OpenSSH the first time, you can generate global config
files and server keys, as well as installing sshd as a service, by running

   /usr/bin/ssh-host-config

Note that this binary archive doesn't contain default config files in /etc.
That files are only created if ssh-host-config is started.

To support testing and unattended installation ssh-host-config got
some options:

usage: ssh-host-config [OPTION]...
Options:
    --debug  -d            Enable shell's debug output.
    --yes    -y            Answer all questions with "yes" automatically.
    --no     -n            Answer all questions with "no" automatically.
    --cygwin -c <options>  Use "options" as value for CYGWIN environment var.
    --name   -N <name>     sshd windows service name.
    --port   -p <n>        sshd listens on port n.
    --user   -u <account>  privileged user for service, default 'cyg_server'.
    --pwd    -w <passwd>   Use "pwd" as password for privileged user.
    --privileged           On Windows XP, require privileged user
                           instead of LocalSystem for sshd service.

Installing sshd as daemon via ssh-host-config is recommended.

Alternatively you can start sshd via inetd, if you have the inetutils
package installed.  Just run ssh-host-config, but answer "no" when asked
to install sshd as service.  The ssh-host-config script also adds the
required lines to /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services.

==================
User configuration
==================

Any user can simplify creating the own private and public keys by running

  /usr/bin/ssh-user-config

To support testing and unattended installation ssh-user-config got
some options as well:

usage: ssh-user-config [OPTION]...
Options:
    --debug      -d        Enable shell's debug output.
    --yes        -y        Answer all questions with "yes" automatically.
    --no         -n        Answer all questions with "no" automatically.
    --passphrase -p word   Use "word" as passphrase automatically.

Please note that OpenSSH does never use the value of $HOME to
search for the users configuration files! It always uses the
value of the pw_dir field in /etc/passwd as the home directory.
If no home directory is set in /etc/passwd, the root directory
is used instead!

================
Building OpenSSH
================

Building from source is easy.  Just unpack the source archive, cd to that
directory, and call cygport:

	cygport openssh.cygport all

You must have installed the following packages to be able to build OpenSSH
with the aforementioned cygport script:

  zlib
  crypt
  libssl-devel
  libedit-devel
  libkrb5-devel

Please send requests, error reports etc. to cygwin@cygwin.com.


Have fun,
