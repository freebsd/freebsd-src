This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to external
libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced and
many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH was created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song, and has been
developed and maintained by Andre Lucas, Ben Lindstom, Damien Miller,
Darren Tucker and Tim Rice. It has a homepage at https://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support, EGD/PRNGD support and replacements for OpenBSD library
functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port
has been best tested on AIX, Cygwin, HP-UX, Linux, MacOS/X,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenServer, Solaris and UnixWare.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to https://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to https://bugzilla.mindrot.org or
the mailing list openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org.  To mitigate spam, the
list only allows posting from subscribed addresses.  Code contribution
are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD style guidelines[1].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on dependencies and
how to install OpenSSH on your system.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free sample implementation
released by Tatu Ylonen.
