     Add a special case for the DH group size for 3des-cbc, which has an
     effective strength much lower than the key size.  This causes problems
     with some cryptlib implementations, which don't support group sizes larger
     than 4k but also don't use the largest group size it does support as
     specified in the RFC.  Based on a patch from Petr Lautrbach at Redhat,

   declarations that stopped being included when we stopped including

   redhat.com.
 - (dtucker) [configure.ac] On Cygwin the getopt variables (like optargs,
   optind) are defined in getopt.h already.  Unfortunately they are defined as
   "declspec(dllimport)" for historical reasons, because the GNU linker didn't
   allow auto-import on PE/COFF targets way back when.  The problem is the
   dllexport attributes collide with the definitions in the various source
   files in OpenSSH, which obviousy define the variables without
   declspec(dllimport).  The least intrusive way to get rid of these warnings
   is to disable warnings for GCC compiler attributes when building on Cygwin.

     [readconf.c readconf.h roaming_client.c ssh.1 ssh.c ssh_config.5]
     [sshconnect.c sshconnect.h]
     Implement client-side hostname canonicalisation to allow an explicit
     search path of domain suffixes to use to convert unqualified host names
     to fully-qualified ones for host key matching.
     This is particularly useful for host certificates, which would otherwise
     need to list unqualified names alongside fully-qualified ones (and this
     causes a number of problems).

     [channels.c channels.h clientloop.c]
     Add an "ABANDONED" channel state and use for mux sessions that are
     disconnected via the ~. escape sequence.  Channels in this state will
     be able to close if the server responds, but do not count as active channels.
     This means that if you ~. all of the mux clients when using ControlPersist
     on a broken network, the backgrounded mux master will exit when the
     Control Persist time expires rather than hanging around indefinitely.
     bz#1917, also reported and tested by tedu@.  ok djm@ markus@.

 - (dtucker) [configure.ac] Detect platforms that can't use select(2) with
   setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, rl_zero) and disable the rlimit sandbox on those.
 - (dtucker) [configure.ac sandbox-rlimit.c] Test whether or not
   setrlimit(RLIMIT_FSIZE, rl_zero) and skip it if it's not supported.  Its
   benefit is minor, so it's not worth disabling the sandbox if it doesn't
   work.
