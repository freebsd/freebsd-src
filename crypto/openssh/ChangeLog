    upstream: Pass "ControlMaster no" to ssh when invoked by scp & sftp.
    
    If you have ControlMaster auto (or yes) in your config, and the
    first connection you make is via scp or sftp, then you may get a
    few unexpected options applied to it (eg ForwardX11 no), since sftp
    and sftp explicitly disable those for reasons.  These effects will
    persist beyond the initial scp or sftp command.
    
    This explicitly disables persistent session *creation* by scp and sftp.
    It will not prevent them from using an existing session if one has
    already been created.

    Add support for locking memory on Linux
    
    Linux wakes up kcompactd threads in order to make more contiguous memory
    available on the system, it does this by migrating live movable pages
    (actively modifying live processes' page tables and constantly flooding
    them with page invalidation IPIs, which can be up to millions per
    second), which causes the process to become unresponsive for up to
    seconds or even minutes in some severe cases. In case of sshd, we want
    to always be able to connect to the system, even if it's under heavy
    kcompactd load.
    
    Introduce an option to protect sshd and its children sessions from being
    compacted by kcompactd (this works in cojunction with
    compact_unevictable_allowed = 0). Note that we depend on MCL_ONFAULT
    being available, which was introduced in linux 4.4. MCL_ONFAULT allows
    the system to lock pages lazily, thus drastically reducing memory usage
    of a locked process (without MCL_ONFAULT, every existing mapping in the
    process is instantly write-faulted).

    upstream: Fix EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl() return checks
    
    While this API tries to translate negative return values (i.e. -1) to 0
    in BoringSSL and LibreSSL, it is still possible for it to return negative
    values in prinicple. We even incorrectly document that -1 can be returned
    while Boring and OpenSSL plead the Fifth.
    
    In OpenSSL 3 there are now code paths that explicitly return -1 and they
    started shifting their return checks to <= 0 - of course they do this in
    inconsistent and sometimes incorrect manner. While these paths aren't
    reachable from ssh right now, who can really tell what happens in the two
    hundred lines of inscrutable bloated mess this has become.
    
    So error check with <= 0 to ensure that we don't accidentally translate an
    error to success.

    Lazily unmount github workspace at end of workflow.
    
    Sometimes when a test times out the workspace is still busy when we try
    to unmount it, which leaves the runner unusable until it's cleaned up
    manually. We try to unmount this in the first step, but that usually
    doesn't work since it fails during setup before it starts our workflow.
    Move it to the end and make it a lazy unmount so it hopefully works
    eventually.

    Try to fix github tcmalloc target failure
    
    tcmalloc may, depending on the stacktrace generator it uses, create
    pipe(2) fds during shared library initialisation. These will later
    get clobbered by ssh/sshd calling closefrom() and chaos will ensue.
    Tell tcmalloc to use an unwinder that doesn't pull this stuff.

    Add make target for standalone sk-libfido2
    
    Add a Makefile target for sk-libfido2, the standalone fido2 security
    key shared library, suitable for use with the SecurityKeyProvider
    option.
    
    Add a new configure option `--with-security-key-standalone` that
    optionally sets the shared library target sk-libfido2$(SHLIBEXT), and
    adds it to $(TARGETS).
    
    misc.h is required when SK_STANDALONE is defined, because of the use
    of `monotime_tv` in `sk_select_by_touch`.
    
    Sets the shared library extension for sk-libfido2 is by setting
    `SHLIBEXT` depending on the platform in configure.ac.
    
    Add the shared library to the CI builds in the `sk` target config to
    make sure it can compile under the same conditions as
    `--with-security-key-builtin`.
    
    Add a libssh-pic.a static library that compiles with `-fPIC` reusing
    .c.lo method in sk-dummy.so for use in the shared library sk-libfido2.
    
    Note, a separate static library libssh-pic.a is needed, since defining
    -DSK_STANDALONE excludes some symbols needed in sshkey.lo.

    Test bigendian interop.
    
    Where our test target is a bigendian system, do an additional build on
    the runner host (which is little endian) and test interop between the two.
    Should hopefully catch obvious endianness bugs.

    Allow overridding TEST_SSH_SSHD.
    
    This will allow tests to specify an alternative sshd, eg on a remote
    machine with different endianness.

commit 82662d562cf54829df8a941cdfb2fd307e1d9a90

    upstream: ssh-agent implemented an all-or-nothing allow-list of
    
    FIDO application IDs for security key-backed keys, to prevent web key handles
    from being used remotely as this would likely lead to unpleasant surprises.
    By default, only application IDs that start with "ssh:*" are allowed.
    
    This adds a -Owebsafe-allow=... argument that can override the default
    list with a more or less restrictive one. The default remains unchanged.

    upstream: Ignore extra groups that don't fit in the buffer passed
    
    to getgrouplist(3)
    
    Our kernel supports 16 groups (NGROUPS_MAX), but nothing prevents
    an admin from adding a user to more groups.  With that tweak we'll keep
    on ignoring them instead of potentially reading past the buffer passed to
    getgrouplist(3).  That behavior is explicitely described in initgroups(3).

    Retire the minix3 test config.
    
    It got broken by the sshd-auth change, it's not obvious why, and the
    platform lacks the debugging tools (eg gdb, strace) to figure it out.
    The upstream project seems effectively dead (6 years since the last
    commit, 10 since the last release).  It was useful while it lasted
    (we found a real bug because of it) but its time seems to have passed.

    Simplify pselect shim and remove side effects.
    
    Instead of maintaing state (pipe descriptors, signal handlers) across
    pselect-on-select invocations, set up and restore them each call.
    This prevents outside factors (eg a closefrom or signal handler
    installation) from potentially causing problems.  This does result in a
    drop in throughput of a couple of percent on geriatric platforms without
    a native pselect due to the extra overhead.  Tweaks & ok djm@

    upstream: Split per-connection sshd-session binary
    
    This splits the user authentication code from the sshd-session
    binary into a separate sshd-auth binary. This will be executed by
    sshd-session to complete the user authentication phase of the
    protocol only.
    
    Splitting this code into a separate binary ensures that the crucial
    pre-authentication attack surface has an entirely disjoint address
    space from the code used for the rest of the connection. It also
    yields a small runtime memory saving as the authentication code will
    be unloaded after thhe authentication phase completes.

    is unchanged and continues to support these methods by default.
    
    Finite field Diffie Hellman is slow and computationally expensive for
    the same security level as Elliptic Curve DH or PQ key agreement while
    offering no redeeming advantages.
    
    ECDH has been specified for the SSH protocol for 15 years and some
    form of ECDH has been the default key exchange in OpenSSH for the last
    14 years.

    upstream: fix regression introduced when I switched the "Match"
    
    criteria tokeniser to a more shell-like one. Apparently the old tokeniser
    (accidentally?) allowed "Match criteria=argument" as well as the "Match
    criteria argument" syntax that we tested for.
    
    People were using this syntax so this adds back support for
    "Match criteria=argument"

    This allows writing Match conditions that trigger for invalid username.
    E.g.
    
    PerSourcePenalties refuseconnection:90s
    Match invalid-user
     RefuseConnection yes
    
    Will effectively penalise bots try to guess passwords for bogus accounts,
    at the cost of implicitly revealing which accounts are invalid.

    stubs for ML-KEM KEX functions

    declare defeat trying to detect C89 compilers
    
    I can't find a reliable way to detect the features the ML-KEM code
    requires in configure. Give up for now and use VLA support (that we
    can detect) as a proxy for "old compiler" and turn off ML-KEM if
    it isn't supported.

    ML-KEM code is actually using compound literals, so test for them.

    test for compiler feature needed for ML-KEM
    
    The ML-KEM implementation we uses need the compiler to support
    C99-style named struct initialisers (e.g foo = {.bar = 1}). We
    still support (barely) building OpenSSH with older compilers, so
    add a configure test for this.

    upstream: Add experimental support for hybrid post-quantum key exchange
    
    ML-KEM768 with ECDH/X25519 from the Internet-draft:
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke-03
    
    This is based on previous patches from markus@ but adapted to use the
    final FIPS203 standard ML-KEM using a formally-verified implementation
    from libcrux.
    
    Note this key exchange method is still a draft and thus subject to
    change. It is therefore disabled by default; set MLKEM=yes to build it.
    We're making it available now to make it easy for other SSH
    implementations to test against it.

    Don't skip audit before exitting cleanup_exit
    
    This fixes an issue where the SSH_CONNECTION_ABANDON event is not
    audited because cleanup_exit overrides the regular _exit too soon and
    as a result, failed auth attempts are not logged correctly.
    
    The problem was introduced in 81c1099d22b81ebfd20a334ce986c4f753b0db29
    where the code from upstream was merged before the audit_event call when
    it should have been merged right before the _exit call in order to honor
    the comment that just mentions an override of the exit value.

    upstream: As defined in the RFC, the SSH protocol has negotiable
    
    compression support (which is requested as the name "zlib"). Compression
    starts very early in the session. Relative early in OpenSSH lifetime, privsep
    was added to sshd, and this required a shared-memory hack so the two
    processes could see what was going on in the dataflow.  This shared-memory
    hack was soon recognized as a tremendous complexity risk, because it put libz
    (which very much trusts it's memory) in a dangerous place, and a new option
    ("zlib@openssh.com") was added begins compression after authentication (aka
    delayed-compression).  That change also permitted removal of the
    shared-memory hack. Despite removal from the server, the old "zlib" support
    remained in the client, to allow negotiation with non-OpenSSH daemons which
    lack the delayed-compression option. This commit deletes support for the
    older "zlib" option in the client. It reduces our featureset in a small way,
    and encourages other servers to move to a better design. The SSH protocol is
    different enough that compressed-key-material attacks like BEAST are
    unlikely, but who wants to take the chance? We encourage other ssh servers
    who care about optional compression support to add delayed-zlib support.
    (Some already do "zlib@openssh.com") ok djm markus

    Move rekey test into valgrind-2.
    
    Now that the rekey test has been optimized it's fast enough to not be in
    its own valgrind test, so move it into valgrind-2, which is currently
    the quickest of the others, bringing all of them to roughly the same
    runtime of ~1.1 hours.

    when configured without OpenSSL.  Add a check to ensure that the kex we
    intended to test is the one we actually tested. Speeds test up by ~5%.

    retire testing aginst older LibreSSL versions
    
    libressl prior to 3.4.x lack support for the EVP_DigestSign and
    EVP_DigestVerify APIs that we need now that sshkey is converted
    to EVP_PKEY.
    
    If someone makes a good case for why we should support these versions
    then we could bring back support with wrappers.

    upstream: Extend sshbuf validation
    
    Multiple sshbuf structs can be linked through a parent/child relationship.
    Make sure that a single sshbuf cannot be its own parent. If this would ever
    happen, it would result in reference counting issues.
    
    This is a cheap way of testing this with very little overhead. It does not
    detect A->B->A linkages though for performance reason and the fact that it
    takes a programming error for this to occur anyway.

    upstream: Fix proxy multiplexing (-O proxy) bug
    
    If a mux started with ControlPersist then later has a forwarding added using
    mux proxy connection and the forwarding was used, then when the mux proxy
    session terminates, the mux master process will send a channel close to the
    server with a bad channel ID and crash the connection.
    
    This was caused by my stupidly reusing c->remote_id for mux channel
    associations when I should have just added another member to struct channel.

    Fix detection of setres*id on GNU/Hurd
    
    Like Linux, proper _SOURCE macros need to be set to get declarations of
    various standard functions, notably setres*id. Now that Debian is using
    -Werror=implicit-function-declaration this is really required. While at
    it, define other _SOURCE macros like on GNU/Linux, since GNU/Hurd uses
    the same glibc.

    propagate PAM crashes to PerSourcePenalties
    
    If the PAM subprocess crashes, exit with a crash status that will be
    picked up by the sshd(8) listener process where it can be used by
    PerSourcePenalties to block the client. This is similar handling to
    the privsep preauth process.

    sshd: don't use argv[0] as PAM service name
    
    sshd would implicitly use argv[0] as the PAM service name to
    allow people to select different PAM service names by making
    differently-named copies/links to the sshd binary.
    
    Splitting sshd into sshd/sshd-session broke this, as the process
    that starts PAM is always sshd-session and the user has no control
    over this.
    
    Hardcode "sshd" as the default PAM service name unless/until we
    figure out a better way. Should unbreak OSX integration tests.

    fix PTY allocation on Cygwin, broken by sshd split
    
    Cygwin doesn't support FD passing and so used to disable post-auth
    privilege separation entirely because privsep requires PTY allocation
    to happen in the privileged monitor process with the PTY file
    descriptors being passed back to the unprivileged process.
    
    This brings back a minimal version of the previous special treatment
    for Cygwin (and any other platform that sets DISABLE_FD_PASSING):
    privilege separation remains enabled, but PTY allocation happens in
    the post-auth user process rather than the monitor.
    
    This either requires PTY allocation to not need privilege to begin
    with (this appears to be the case on Cygwin), or the post-auth
    privsep process retain privilege (other platforms that set the
    DISABLE_FD_PASSING option).
    
    Keeping privileges here is bad, but the non-Cygwin systems that set
    DISABLE_FD_PASSING are so deeply legacy that this is likely to be the
    least of their problems.

    delay lookup of privsep user until config loaded
    
    sshd-session attempting to use options.kerberos_authentication to
    decide whether it needed to lookup the privsep user before the
    configuration was loaded. This caused it to get a placeholder value
    that caused it always to try to lookup the privsep user, breaking at
    least one test environment.

    upstream: split PerSourcePenalties address tracking. Previously it
    
    used one shared table and overflow policy for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, now it
    will use separate tables and optionally different overflow policies.
    
    This prevents misbehaviour from IPv6 addresses (which are vastly easier
    to obtain many of) from affecting IPv4 connections and may allow for
    stricter overflow policies.

    upstream: Add a facility to sshd(8) to penalise particular
    
    problematic client behaviours, controlled by two new sshd_config(5) options:
    PerSourcePenalties and PerSourcePenaltyExemptList.
    
    When PerSourcePenalties are enabled, sshd(8) will monitor the exit
    status of its child pre-auth session processes. Through the exit
    status, it can observe situations where the session did not
    authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
    repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly indicating
    an attack against one or more accounts, e.g. password guessing), or
    when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly indicating
    attempts to exploit sshd).
    
    When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of some
    duration (e.g. 30 seconds) against the client's address. If this time
    is above a minimum threshold specified by the PerSourcePenalties, then
    connections from the client address will be refused (along with any
    others in the same PerSourceNetBlockSize CIDR range).
    
    Repeated offenses by the same client address will accrue greater
    penalties, up to a configurable maximum. A PerSourcePenaltyExemptList
    option allows certain address ranges to be exempt from all penalties.
    
    We hope these options will make it significantly more difficult for
    attackers to find accounts with weak/guessable passwords or exploit
    bugs in sshd(8) itself.
    
    PerSourcePenalties is off by default, but we expect to enable it
    automatically in the near future.
    
    much feedback markus@ and others, ok markus@

    upstream: be really strict with fds reserved for communication with the
    
    separate sshd-session process - reserve them early and fatal if we can't
    dup2(2) them later. The pre-split fallback to re-reading the configuration
    files is not possible, so sshd-session absolutely requires the fd the
    configuration is passed over to be in order.

    upstream: Start the process of splitting sshd into separate
    
    binaries. This step splits sshd into a listener and a session binary. More
    splits are planned.
    
    After this changes, the listener binary will validate the configuration,
    load the hostkeys, listen on port 22 and manage MaxStartups only. All
    session handling will be performed by a new sshd-session binary that the
    listener fork+execs.
    
    This reduces the listener process to the minimum necessary and sets us
    up for future work on the sshd-session binary.
    
    feedback/ok markus@ deraadt@
    
    NB. if you're updating via source, please restart sshd after installing,
    otherwise you run the risk of locking yourself out.

    upstream: never close stdin
    
    The sanitise_stdfd call makes sure that standard file descriptors are
    open (if they were closed, they are connected with /dev/null).
    
    Do not close stdin in any case to prevent error messages when stdin is
    read multiple times and to prevent later usage of fd 0 for connections,
    e.g.
    
    echo localhost | ssh-keyscan -f - -f -
    
    While at it, make stdin-related error messages nicer.

    Merge flags for OpenSSL 3.x versions.
    
    OpenSSL has moved to 3.4 which we don't currently accept.  Based on
    the OpenSSL versioning policy[0] it looks like all of the 3.x versions
    should work with OpenSSH, so remove the distinction in configure and
    accept all of them.

    Rearrange selfhosted VM scheduling.
    
    Instead of trying to infer the type of the self hosted tests in each of
    the driver scripts (inconsistently...), set one of the following
    variables to "true" in the workflow:
    
    VM: tests run in a virtual machine.
    EPHEMERAL: tests run on an ephemeral virtual machine.
    PERSISTENT: tests run on a persistent virtual machine
    REMOTE: tests run on a physical remote host.
    
    EPHEMERAL VMs can have multiple instances of any given VM can exist
    simultaneously and are run by a runner pool.  The other types have a
    dedicated runner instance and can only run a single test at a time.
    
    Other settings:
    SSHFS: We need to sshfs mount over the repo so the workflow can collect
            build artifacts.  This also implies the tests must be run over ssh.
    DEBUG_ACTIONS: enable "set -x" in scripts for debugging.

    upstream: add a "global" ChannelTimeout type to ssh(1) and sshd(8)
    
    that watches all open channels and will close all open channels if there is
    no traffic on any of them for the specified interval. This is in addition to
    the existing per-channel timeouts added a few releases ago.
    
    This supports use-cases like having a session + x11 forwarding channel
    open where one may be idle for an extended period but the other is
    actively used. The global timeout would allow closing both channels when
    both have been idle for too long.

    upstream: ssh-agent: record failed session-bind attempts
    
    Record failed attempts to session-bind a connection and refuse signing
    operations on that connection henceforth.
    
    Prevents a future situation where we add a new hostkey type that is not
    recognised by an older ssh-agent, that consequently causes session-bind
    to fail (this situation is only likely to arise when people mix ssh(1)
    and ssh-agent(1) of different versions on the same host). Previously,
    after such a failure the agent socket would be considered unbound and
    not subject to restriction.

    upstream: ban user/hostnames with most shell metacharacters
    
    This makes ssh(1) refuse user or host names provided on the
    commandline that contain most shell metacharacters.
    
    Some programs that invoke ssh(1) using untrusted data do not filter
    metacharacters in arguments they supply. This could create
    interactions with user-specified ProxyCommand and other directives
    that allow shell injection attacks to occur.
    
    It's a mistake to invoke ssh(1) with arbitrary untrusted arguments,
    but getting this stuff right can be tricky, so this should prevent
    most obvious ways of creating risky situations. It however is not
    and cannot be perfect: ssh(1) has no practical way of interpreting
    what shell quoting rules are in use and how they interact with the
    user's specified ProxyCommand.
    
    To allow configurations that use strange user or hostnames to
    continue to work, this strictness is applied only to names coming
    from the commandline. Names specified using User or Hostname
    directives in ssh_config(5) are not affected.

    upstream: stricter handling of channel window limits
    
    This makes ssh/sshd more strict in handling non-compliant peers that
    send more data than the advertised channel window allows. Previously
    the additional data would be silently discarded. This change will
    cause ssh/sshd to terminate the connection if the channel window is
    exceeded by more than a small grace allowance.

    upstream: add "ext-info-in-auth@openssh.com" extension
    
    This adds another transport protocol extension to allow a sshd to send
    SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO during user authentication, after the server has
    learned the username that is being logged in to.
    
    This lets sshd to update the acceptable signature algoritms for public
    key authentication, and allows these to be varied via sshd_config(5)
    "Match" directives, which are evaluated after the server learns the
    username being authenticated.

Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 13:11:31 2023 +1100

    Put long-running test targets on hipri runners.
    
    Some of the selfhosted test targets take a long time to run for various
    reasons, so label them for "libvirt-hipri" runners so that they can
    start immediately.  This should reduce the time to complete all tests.

    upstream: Don't try to use sudo inside sshd log wrapper.
    
    We still need to check if we're using sudo since we don't want to chown
    unecessarily, as on some platforms this causes an error which pollutes
    stderr. We also don't want to unnecessarily invoke sudo, since it's
    running in the context of the proxycommand, on *other* platforms it
    may not be able to authenticate, and if we're using SUDO then it should
    already be privileged.

    Use zero-call-used-regs=used with Apple compilers.
    
    Apple's versions of clang have version numbers that do not match the
    corresponding upstream clang versions.  Unfortunately, they do still
    have the clang-15 zero-call-used-regs=all bug, so for now use the value
    that doesn't result in segfaults.  We could allowlist future versions
    that are known to work.  bz#3584 (and probably also our github CI

    Prefer OpenSSL's SHA256 in sk-dummy.so
    
    Previously sk-dummy.so used libc's (or compat's) SHA256 since it may be
    built without OpenSSL.  In many cases, however, including both libc's
    and OpenSSL's headers together caused conflicting definitions.
    
    We tried working around this (on OpenSSL <1.1 you could define
    OPENSSL_NO_SHA, NetBSD had USE_LIBC_SHA2, various #define hacks) with
    varying levels of success.  Since OpenSSL >=1.1 removed OPENSSL_NO_SHA
    and including most OpenSSL headers would bring sha.h in, even if it
    wasn't used directly this was a constant hassle.
    
    Admit defeat and use OpenSSL's SHA256 unless we aren't using OpenSSL at
    all.  ok djm@

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 19 14:03:45 2023 +0000

    upstream: Separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each p11 module
    
    Make ssh-pkcs11-client start an independent helper for each provider,
    providing better isolation between modules and reliability if a single
    module misbehaves.
    
    This also implements reference counting of PKCS#11-hosted keys,
    allowing ssh-pkcs11-helper subprocesses to be automatically reaped
    when no remaining keys reference them. This fixes some bugs we have
    that make PKCS11 keys unusable after they have been deleted, e.g.

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>

    upstream: Disallow remote addition of FIDO/PKCS11 provider
    
    libraries to ssh-agent by default.
    
    The old behaviour of allowing remote clients from loading providers
    can be restored using `ssh-agent -O allow-remote-pkcs11`.
    
    Detection of local/remote clients requires a ssh(1) that supports
    the `session-bind@openssh.com` extension. Forwarding access to a
    ssh-agent socket using non-OpenSSH tools may circumvent this control.

    upstream: add a "match localnetwork" predicate.
    
    This allows matching on the addresses of available network interfaces
    and may be used to vary the effective client configuration based on
    network location (e.g. to use a ProxyJump when not on a particular
    network).

    upstream: remove vestigal support for KRL signatures
    
    When the KRL format was originally defined, it included support for
    signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs and verify KRL
    signatues was never completed in OpenSSH.
    
    Now, some years later, we have SSHSIG support in ssh-keygen that is
    more general, well tested and actually works. So this removes the
    semi-finished KRL signing/verification support from OpenSSH and
    refactors the remaining code to realise the benefit - primarily, we
    no longer need to perform multiple parsing passes over KRL objects.

    This defines wire formats for optional KRL extensions and implements

    if -s & -p specified, mention 'sftp -P' on success
    
    This was inspired by this:
     https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/321
    but I thought that it was better to not do the sed patching.
    
    BTW the reason one can get away with using $SSH_OPTS throughout, despite
    the lowercase -p in there, even if sftp is in use, is that the sftp call
    is using the already-established ssh master connection, so the port was
    passed to the earlier ssh.

    upstream: adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that reorder
    
    requests.
    
    sftp/scp will ftruncate the destination file after a transfer completes,
    to deal with the case where a longer destination file already existed.
    We tracked the highest contiguous block transferred to deal with this
    case, but our naive tracking doesn't deal with servers that reorder
    requests - a misfeature strictly permitted by the protocol but seldom
    implemented.
    
    Adjust the logic to ftruncate() at the highest absolute block received
    when the transfer is successful. feedback deraadt@ ok markus@
