    upstream: add a "Match invalid-user" predicate to sshd_config Match
    
    options.
    
    This allows writing Match conditions that trigger for invalid username.
    E.g.
    
    PerSourcePenalties refuseconnection:90s
    Match invalid-user
     RefuseConnection yes
    
    Will effectively penalise bots try to guess passwords for bogus accounts,
    at the cost of implicitly revealing which accounts are invalid.

    declare defeat trying to detect C89 compilers
    
    I can't find a reliable way to detect the features the ML-KEM code
    requires in configure. Give up for now and use VLA support (that we
    can detect) as a proxy for "old compiler" and turn off ML-KEM if
    it isn't supported.

    test for compiler feature needed for ML-KEM
    
    The ML-KEM implementation we uses need the compiler to support
    C99-style named struct initialisers (e.g foo = {.bar = 1}). We
    still support (barely) building OpenSSH with older compilers, so
    add a configure test for this.

    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke-03
    
    This is based on previous patches from markus@ but adapted to use the
    final FIPS203 standard ML-KEM using a formally-verified implementation
    from libcrux.
    
    Note this key exchange method is still a draft and thus subject to
    change. It is therefore disabled by default; set MLKEM=yes to build it.
    We're making it available now to make it easy for other SSH

    Don't skip audit before exitting cleanup_exit
    
    This fixes an issue where the SSH_CONNECTION_ABANDON event is not
    audited because cleanup_exit overrides the regular _exit too soon and
    as a result, failed auth attempts are not logged correctly.
    
    The problem was introduced in 81c1099d22b81ebfd20a334ce986c4f753b0db29
    where the code from upstream was merged before the audit_event call when
    it should have been merged right before the _exit call in order to honor
    the comment that just mentions an override of the exit value.

    upstream: As defined in the RFC, the SSH protocol has negotiable
    
    compression support (which is requested as the name "zlib"). Compression
    starts very early in the session. Relative early in OpenSSH lifetime, privsep
    was added to sshd, and this required a shared-memory hack so the two
    processes could see what was going on in the dataflow.  This shared-memory
    hack was soon recognized as a tremendous complexity risk, because it put libz
    (which very much trusts it's memory) in a dangerous place, and a new option
    ("zlib@openssh.com") was added begins compression after authentication (aka
    delayed-compression).  That change also permitted removal of the
    shared-memory hack. Despite removal from the server, the old "zlib" support
    remained in the client, to allow negotiation with non-OpenSSH daemons which
    lack the delayed-compression option. This commit deletes support for the
    older "zlib" option in the client. It reduces our featureset in a small way,
    and encourages other servers to move to a better design. The SSH protocol is
    different enough that compressed-key-material attacks like BEAST are
    unlikely, but who wants to take the chance? We encourage other ssh servers
    who care about optional compression support to add delayed-zlib support.
    (Some already do "zlib@openssh.com") ok djm markus

commit a76a6b85108e3032c8175611ecc5746e7131f876
Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 20:36:12 2024 +1000

    Move rekey test into valgrind-2.
    
    Now that the rekey test has been optimized it's fast enough to not be in
    its own valgrind test, so move it into valgrind-2, which is currently
    the quickest of the others, bringing all of them to roughly the same
    runtime of ~1.1 hours.

    upstream: Use aes128-ctr for MAC tests since default has implicit MAC.
    
    Also verify that the Cipher or MAC we intended to use is actually the one
    selected during the test.

    upstream: Use curve25519-sha256 kex where possible.
    
    Except where we're explicitly testing a different kex, use
    curve25519-sha256 since it's faster than the default and supported even
    when configured without OpenSSL.  Add a check to ensure that the kex we
    intended to test is the one we actually tested. Speeds test up by ~5%.

Date:   Tue Aug 20 07:27:25 2024 +0000

    upstream: Unnest rekey param parsing test and use ssh not sshd.
    
    ssh uses the same parsing code, now has "-G" to dump its config and is
    slightly faster to start up.  This speeds up the test slightly (~5%) in the
    common case but should help more during instrumented tests, eg under
    valgrind, where startup costs are magnified.

    upstream: Extend sshbuf validation
    
    Multiple sshbuf structs can be linked through a parent/child relationship.
    Make sure that a single sshbuf cannot be its own parent. If this would ever
    happen, it would result in reference counting issues.
    
    This is a cheap way of testing this with very little overhead. It does not
    detect A->B->A linkages though for performance reason and the fact that it
    takes a programming error for this to occur anyway.

    upstream: Fix proxy multiplexing (-O proxy) bug
    
    If a mux started with ControlPersist then later has a forwarding added using
    mux proxy connection and the forwarding was used, then when the mux proxy
    session terminates, the mux master process will send a channel close to the
    server with a bad channel ID and crash the connection.
    
    This was caused by my stupidly reusing c->remote_id for mux channel
    associations when I should have just added another member to struct channel.

    Fix detection of setres*id on GNU/Hurd
    
    Like Linux, proper _SOURCE macros need to be set to get declarations of
    various standard functions, notably setres*id. Now that Debian is using
    -Werror=implicit-function-declaration this is really required. While at
    it, define other _SOURCE macros like on GNU/Linux, since GNU/Hurd uses
    the same glibc.

    sshd: don't use argv[0] as PAM service name
    
    sshd would implicitly use argv[0] as the PAM service name to
    allow people to select different PAM service names by making
    differently-named copies/links to the sshd binary.
    
    Splitting sshd into sshd/sshd-session broke this, as the process
    that starts PAM is always sshd-session and the user has no control
    over this.
    
    Hardcode "sshd" as the default PAM service name unless/until we
    figure out a better way. Should unbreak OSX integration tests.

    fix PTY allocation on Cygwin, broken by sshd split
    
    Cygwin doesn't support FD passing and so used to disable post-auth
    privilege separation entirely because privsep requires PTY allocation
    to happen in the privileged monitor process with the PTY file
    descriptors being passed back to the unprivileged process.
    
    This brings back a minimal version of the previous special treatment
    for Cygwin (and any other platform that sets DISABLE_FD_PASSING):
    privilege separation remains enabled, but PTY allocation happens in
    the post-auth user process rather than the monitor.
    
    This either requires PTY allocation to not need privilege to begin
    with (this appears to be the case on Cygwin), or the post-auth
    privsep process retain privilege (other platforms that set the
    DISABLE_FD_PASSING option).
    
    Keeping privileges here is bad, but the non-Cygwin systems that set
    DISABLE_FD_PASSING are so deeply legacy that this is likely to be the
    least of their problems.

    delay lookup of privsep user until config loaded
    
    sshd-session attempting to use options.kerberos_authentication to
    decide whether it needed to lookup the privsep user before the
    configuration was loaded. This caused it to get a placeholder value
    that caused it always to try to lookup the privsep user, breaking at
    least one test environment.

    missing file for PerSourcePenalties regress test

    upstream: split PerSourcePenalties address tracking. Previously it
    
    used one shared table and overflow policy for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, now it
    will use separate tables and optionally different overflow policies.
    
    This prevents misbehaviour from IPv6 addresses (which are vastly easier
    to obtain many of) from affecting IPv4 connections and may allow for
    stricter overflow policies.

    upstream: Add a facility to sshd(8) to penalise particular
    
    problematic client behaviours, controlled by two new sshd_config(5) options:
    PerSourcePenalties and PerSourcePenaltyExemptList.
    
    When PerSourcePenalties are enabled, sshd(8) will monitor the exit
    status of its child pre-auth session processes. Through the exit
    status, it can observe situations where the session did not
    authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
    repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly indicating
    an attack against one or more accounts, e.g. password guessing), or
    when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly indicating
    attempts to exploit sshd).
    
    When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of some
    duration (e.g. 30 seconds) against the client's address. If this time
    is above a minimum threshold specified by the PerSourcePenalties, then
    connections from the client address will be refused (along with any
    others in the same PerSourceNetBlockSize CIDR range).
    
    Repeated offenses by the same client address will accrue greater
    penalties, up to a configurable maximum. A PerSourcePenaltyExemptList
    option allows certain address ranges to be exempt from all penalties.
    
    We hope these options will make it significantly more difficult for
    attackers to find accounts with weak/guessable passwords or exploit
    bugs in sshd(8) itself.
    
    PerSourcePenalties is off by default, but we expect to enable it
    automatically in the near future.
    
    much feedback markus@ and others, ok markus@

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>
Date:   Sat Jun 1 07:03:37 2024 +0000

    upstream: be really strict with fds reserved for communication with the
    
    separate sshd-session process - reserve them early and fatal if we can't
    dup2(2) them later. The pre-split fallback to re-reading the configuration
    files is not possible, so sshd-session absolutely requires the fd the
    configuration is passed over to be in order.

    upstream: Start the process of splitting sshd into separate
    
    binaries. This step splits sshd into a listener and a session binary. More
    splits are planned.
    
    After this changes, the listener binary will validate the configuration,
    load the hostkeys, listen on port 22 and manage MaxStartups only. All
    session handling will be performed by a new sshd-session binary that the
    listener fork+execs.
    
    This reduces the listener process to the minimum necessary and sets us
    up for future work on the sshd-session binary.
    
    feedback/ok markus@ deraadt@
    
    NB. if you're updating via source, please restart sshd after installing,
    otherwise you run the risk of locking yourself out.

    upstream: never close stdin
    
    The sanitise_stdfd call makes sure that standard file descriptors are
    open (if they were closed, they are connected with /dev/null).
    
    Do not close stdin in any case to prevent error messages when stdin is
    read multiple times and to prevent later usage of fd 0 for connections,
    e.g.
    
    echo localhost | ssh-keyscan -f - -f -
    
    While at it, make stdin-related error messages nicer.

    upstream: new-style relink kit for sshd. The old scheme created
    
    a Makefile by concatenating two Makefiles and was incredibly fragile.  In the
    new way a narrow-purposed install.sh script is created and shipped with the
    objects. A recently commited /etc/rc script understands these files.

    Merge flags for OpenSSL 3.x versions.
    
    OpenSSL has moved to 3.4 which we don't currently accept.  Based on
    the OpenSSL versioning policy[0] it looks like all of the 3.x versions
    should work with OpenSSH, so remove the distinction in configure and
    accept all of them.

    Rearrange selfhosted VM scheduling.
    
    Instead of trying to infer the type of the self hosted tests in each of
    the driver scripts (inconsistently...), set one of the following
    variables to "true" in the workflow:
    
    VM: tests run in a virtual machine.
    EPHEMERAL: tests run on an ephemeral virtual machine.
    PERSISTENT: tests run on a persistent virtual machine
    REMOTE: tests run on a physical remote host.
    
    EPHEMERAL VMs can have multiple instances of any given VM can exist
    simultaneously and are run by a runner pool.  The other types have a
    dedicated runner instance and can only run a single test at a time.
    
    Other settings:
    SSHFS: We need to sshfs mount over the repo so the workflow can collect
            build artifacts.  This also implies the tests must be run over ssh.
    DEBUG_ACTIONS: enable "set -x" in scripts for debugging.

    upstream: add a "global" ChannelTimeout type to ssh(1) and sshd(8)
    
    that watches all open channels and will close all open channels if there is
    no traffic on any of them for the specified interval. This is in addition to
    the existing per-channel timeouts added a few releases ago.
    
    This supports use-cases like having a session + x11 forwarding channel
    open where one may be idle for an extended period but the other is
    actively used. The global timeout would allow closing both channels when
    both have been idle for too long.

    upstream: ssh-agent: record failed session-bind attempts
    
    Record failed attempts to session-bind a connection and refuse signing
    operations on that connection henceforth.
    
    Prevents a future situation where we add a new hostkey type that is not
    recognised by an older ssh-agent, that consequently causes session-bind
    to fail (this situation is only likely to arise when people mix ssh(1)
    and ssh-agent(1) of different versions on the same host). Previously,
    after such a failure the agent socket would be considered unbound and
    not subject to restriction.

    upstream: ban user/hostnames with most shell metacharacters
    
    This makes ssh(1) refuse user or host names provided on the
    commandline that contain most shell metacharacters.
    
    Some programs that invoke ssh(1) using untrusted data do not filter
    metacharacters in arguments they supply. This could create
    interactions with user-specified ProxyCommand and other directives
    that allow shell injection attacks to occur.
    
    It's a mistake to invoke ssh(1) with arbitrary untrusted arguments,
    but getting this stuff right can be tricky, so this should prevent
    most obvious ways of creating risky situations. It however is not
    and cannot be perfect: ssh(1) has no practical way of interpreting
    what shell quoting rules are in use and how they interact with the
    user's specified ProxyCommand.
    
    To allow configurations that use strange user or hostnames to
    continue to work, this strictness is applied only to names coming
    from the commandline. Names specified using User or Hostname
    directives in ssh_config(5) are not affected.

    upstream: stricter handling of channel window limits
    
    This makes ssh/sshd more strict in handling non-compliant peers that
    send more data than the advertised channel window allows. Previously
    the additional data would be silently discarded. This change will
    cause ssh/sshd to terminate the connection if the channel window is
    exceeded by more than a small grace allowance.

    upstream: add "ext-info-in-auth@openssh.com" extension
    
    This adds another transport protocol extension to allow a sshd to send
    SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO during user authentication, after the server has
    learned the username that is being logged in to.
    
    This lets sshd to update the acceptable signature algoritms for public
    key authentication, and allows these to be varied via sshd_config(5)
    "Match" directives, which are evaluated after the server learns the
    username being authenticated.

    Use zero-call-used-regs=used with Apple compilers.
    
    Apple's versions of clang have version numbers that do not match the
    corresponding upstream clang versions.  Unfortunately, they do still
    have the clang-15 zero-call-used-regs=all bug, so for now use the value
    that doesn't result in segfaults.  We could allowlist future versions
    that are known to work.  bz#3584 (and probably also our github CI

    upstream: the sftp code was one of my first contributions to
    
    OpenSSH and it shows - the function names are terrible.
    
    Rename do_blah() to sftp_blah() to make them less so.
    
    Completely mechanical except for sftp_stat() and sftp_lstat() which
    change from returning a pointer to a static variable (error-prone) to
    taking a pointer to a caller-provided receiver.

    This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive

    small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes
    for a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
    controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword/

    Prefer OpenSSL's SHA256 in sk-dummy.so
    
    Previously sk-dummy.so used libc's (or compat's) SHA256 since it may be
    built without OpenSSL.  In many cases, however, including both libc's
    and OpenSSL's headers together caused conflicting definitions.
    
    We tried working around this (on OpenSSL <1.1 you could define
    OPENSSL_NO_SHA, NetBSD had USE_LIBC_SHA2, various #define hacks) with
    varying levels of success.  Since OpenSSL >=1.1 removed OPENSSL_NO_SHA
    and including most OpenSSL headers would bring sha.h in, even if it
    wasn't used directly this was a constant hassle.
    
    Admit defeat and use OpenSSL's SHA256 unless we aren't using OpenSSL at
    all.  ok djm@

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 19 14:03:45 2023 +0000

    upstream: Separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each p11 module
    
    Make ssh-pkcs11-client start an independent helper for each provider,
    providing better isolation between modules and reliability if a single
    module misbehaves.
    
    This also implements reference counting of PKCS#11-hosted keys,
    allowing ssh-pkcs11-helper subprocesses to be automatically reaped
    when no remaining keys reference them. This fixes some bugs we have
    that make PKCS11 keys unusable after they have been deleted, e.g.

    upstream: Disallow remote addition of FIDO/PKCS11 provider
    
    libraries to ssh-agent by default.
    
    The old behaviour of allowing remote clients from loading providers
    can be restored using `ssh-agent -O allow-remote-pkcs11`.
    
    Detection of local/remote clients requires a ssh(1) that supports
    the `session-bind@openssh.com` extension. Forwarding access to a
    ssh-agent socket using non-OpenSSH tools may circumvent this control.

    upstream: remove vestigal support for KRL signatures
    
    When the KRL format was originally defined, it included support for
    signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs and verify KRL
    signatues was never completed in OpenSSH.
    
    Now, some years later, we have SSHSIG support in ssh-keygen that is
    more general, well tested and actually works. So this removes the
    semi-finished KRL signing/verification support from OpenSSH and
    refactors the remaining code to realise the benefit - primarily, we
    no longer need to perform multiple parsing passes over KRL objects.

    Hardenedmalloc dropped support for "legacy glibc" versions in their

    upstream: better validate CASignatureAlgorithms in ssh_config and
    
    sshd_config.
    
    Previously this directive would accept certificate algorithm names, but
    these were unusable in practice as OpenSSH does not support CA chains.

    if -s & -p specified, mention 'sftp -P' on success
    
    This was inspired by this:
     https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/321
    but I thought that it was better to not do the sed patching.
    
    BTW the reason one can get away with using $SSH_OPTS throughout, despite
    the lowercase -p in there, even if sftp is in use, is that the sftp call
    is using the already-established ssh master connection, so the port was
    passed to the earlier ssh.

    Special case OpenWrt instead of Dropbear.
    
    OpenWrt overrides the location of authorized_keys for root.  Currently we
    assume that all Dropbear installations behave this way, which is not the
    case.  Check for OpenWrt and root user before using that location instead
    of assuming that for all Dropbear servers.  Prompted by Github PR#250.

    upstream: adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that reorder
    
    requests.
    
    sftp/scp will ftruncate the destination file after a transfer completes,
    to deal with the case where a longer destination file already existed.
    We tracked the highest contiguous block transferred to deal with this
    case, but our naive tracking doesn't deal with servers that reorder
    requests - a misfeature strictly permitted by the protocol but seldom
    implemented.
    
    Adjust the logic to ftruncate() at the highest absolute block received
    when the transfer is successful. feedback deraadt@ ok markus@

    upstream: Rework logging for the regression tests.
    
    Previously we would log to ssh.log and sshd.log, but that is insufficient
    for tests that have more than one concurent ssh/sshd.
    
    Instead, we'll log to separate datestamped files in a $OBJ/log/ and
    leave a symlink at the previous location pointing at the most recent
    instance with an entry in regress.log showing which files were created
    at each point.  This should be sufficient to reconstruct what happened

    fails, tar up all of the logs for later analysis.

    upstream: fseek to end of known_hosts before writing to it.
    
    POSIX and ANSI C require that applications call fseek or similar between
    read and writing to a RW file.  OpenBSD doesn't enforce this, but some
    (System V derived) platforms need this to prevent it from writing a
    spurious extra byte (in this case, a newline).  ok djm@ deraadt@

    harden Linux seccomp sandbox
    
    Linux mmap(2) and madvise(2) syscalls support quite a number of funky
    flags that we don't expect that sshd/libc will ever need. We can
    exclude this kernel attack surface by filtering the mmap(2) flags
    and the madvise(2) advice arguments.
    
    Similarly, the sandboxed process in sshd is a single-threaded program
    that does not use shared memory for synchronisation or communication.
    Therefore, there should be no reason for the advanced priority
    inheritance futex(2) operations to be necessary. These can also be
    excluded.
    
    Motivated by Jann Horn pointing out that there have been kernel bugs
    in nearby Linux kernel code, e.g. CVE-2020-29368, CVE-2020-29374 and
    CVE-2022-42703.

    binary layout is now semi-unknown (meaning relative, fixed, and gadget
    offsets are not precisely known), change the filesystem permissions to 511 to
    prevent what I call "logged in BROP". I have ideas for improving this further

    Skip connection-timeout when missing FD passing.
    
    This tests uses multiplexing which uses file descriptor passing, so
    skip it if we don't have that.  Fixes test failures on Cygwin.

    upstream: Implement channel inactivity timeouts
    
    This adds a sshd_config ChannelTimeouts directive that allows channels that
    have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be automatically closed.
    Different timeouts may be applied to session, X11, agent and TCP forwarding
    channels.
    
    Note: this only affects channels over an opened SSH connection and not
    the connection itself. Most clients close the connection when their channels
    go away, with a notable exception being ssh(1) in multiplexing mode.

    upstream: Add channel_force_close()
    
    This will forcibly close an open channel by simulating read/write errors,
    draining the IO buffers and calling the detach function.
    
    Previously the detach function was only ever called during channel garbage
    collection, but there was no way to signal the user of a channel (e.g.
    session.c) that its channel was being closed deliberately (vs. by the
    usual state-machine logic). So this adds an extra "force" argument to the
    channel cleanup callback to indicate this condition.

    Rework how selfhosted tests interact with runners.
    
    Previously there was one runner per test target (mostly VMs).  This had
    a few limitations:
     - multiple tests that ran on the same target (eg multiple build
       configs) were serialized on availability or that runner.
     - it needed manual balancing of VMs over host machines.
    
    To address this, make VMs that use ephemeral disks (ie most of them)
    all use a pool of runners with the "libvirt" label.  This requires that
    we distinguish between "host" and "target" for those.  Native runners
    and VMs with persistent disks (eg the constantly-updated snapshot ones)
    specify the same host and target.
    
    This should improve test throughput.

    If we haven't found it yet, recheck for sys/stat.h.
    
    On some very old platforms, sys/stat.h needs sys/types.h, however
    autoconf 2.71's AC_CHECK_INCLUDES_DEFAULT checks for them in the
    opposite order, which in combination with modern autoconf's
    "present but cannot be compiled" behaviour causes it to not be
    detected.

    Remove seed passing over reexec.
    
    This was added for the benefit of platforms using ssh-rand-helper to
    prevent a delay on each connection as sshd reseeded itself.
    
    ssh-random-helper is long gone, and since the re-exec happens before the
    chroot the re-execed sshd can reseed itself normally. ok djm@

    Avoid assuming layout of fd_set
    
    POSIX doesn't specify the internal layout of the fd_set object, so let's
    not assume it is just a bit mask. This increases compatibility with
    systems that have a different layout.
    
    The assumption is also worthless as we already refuse to use file
    descriptors over FD_SETSIZE anyway. Meaning that the default size of
    fd_set is quite sufficient.

    upstream: begin big refactor of sshkey
    
    Move keytype data and some of the type-specific code (allocation,
    cleanup, etc) out into each key type's implementation. Subsequent
    commits will move more, with the goal of having each key-*.c file
    owning as much of its keytype's implementation as possible.

    upstream: when scp(1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the
    
    default), better match scp/rcp's handling of globs that don't match the
    globbed characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to transfer
    "foo.[1]").
    
    Previously scp(1) in SFTP mode would not match these pathnames but
    legacy scp/rcp mode would.
