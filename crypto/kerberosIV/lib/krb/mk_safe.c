 * ===================== begin checksum ================================
 * 
 * 4 bytes		length			length of user data
 * length		in			user data
 * 1 byte		msg_time_5ms		timestamp milliseconds
 * 4 bytes		sender->sin.addr.s_addr	sender's IP address

 * 4 bytes		msg_time_sec or		timestamp seconds with
