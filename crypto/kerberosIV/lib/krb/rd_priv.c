 * krb_rd_priv() decrypts and checks the integrity of an

 * "sender" and "receiver" of the message, krb_rd_safe() returns
 * RD_AP_OK if the message is okay, otherwise some error code.

 * The message data retrieved from "in" are returned in the structure

 * (m_data->app_data) refers back to the appropriate place in "in".
