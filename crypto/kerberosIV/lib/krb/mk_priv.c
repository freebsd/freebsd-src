/*
 * krb_mk_priv() constructs an AUTH_MSG_PRIVATE message.  It takes
 * some user data "in" of "length" bytes and creates a packet in "out"
 * consisting of the user data, a timestamp, and the sender's network
 * address.
 * The packet is encrypted by pcbc_encrypt(), using the given
 * "key" and "schedule".
 * The length of the resulting packet "out" is
 * returned.
 *
 * It is similar to krb_mk_safe() except for the additional key
 * schedule argument "schedule" and the fact that the data is encrypted
 * rather than appended with a checksum.  The protocol version is
 * KRB_PROT_VERSION, defined in "krb.h".
 *
 * The "out" packet consists of:
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field
 * ----			--------		-----
 *
 * 1 byte		KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version number
 * 1 byte		AUTH_MSG_PRIVATE |	message type plus local
 *			HOST_BYTE_ORDER		byte order in low bit
 *
 * 4 bytes		c_length		length of data
 * we encrypt from here with pcbc_encrypt
 * 
 * 4 bytes		length			length of user data
 * length		in			user data
 * 1 byte		msg_time_5ms		timestamp milliseconds
 * 4 bytes		sender->sin.addr.s_addr	sender's IP address
 *
 * 4 bytes		msg_time_sec or		timestamp seconds with
 *			-msg_time_sec		direction in sign bit
 *
 * 0<=n<=7  bytes	pad to 8 byte multiple	zeroes
