 * krb_mk_req takes a text structure in which an authenticator is to
 * be built, the name of a service, an instance, a realm,
 * and a checksum.  It then retrieves a ticket for
 * the desired service and creates an authenticator in the text
 * structure passed as the first argument.  krb_mk_req returns
 * KSUCCESS on success and a Kerberos error code on failure.
 *
 * The peer procedure on the other end is krb_rd_req.  When making
 * any changes to this routine it is important to make corresponding
 * changes to krb_rd_req.
 *
 * The authenticator consists of the following:
 *
 * authent->dat
 *
 * unsigned char	KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version no.
 * unsigned char	AUTH_MSG_APPL_REQUEST	message type
 * (least significant
 * bit of above)	HOST_BYTE_ORDER		local byte ordering
 * unsigned char	kvno from ticket	server's key version
 * string		realm			server's realm
 * unsigned char	tl			ticket length
 * unsigned char	idl			request id length
 * text			ticket->dat		ticket for server
 * text			req_id->dat		request id
 *
 * The ticket information is retrieved from the ticket cache or
 * fetched from Kerberos.  The request id (called the "authenticator"
 * in the papers on Kerberos) contains the following:
 *
 * req_id->dat
 *
 * string		cr.pname		{name, instance, and
 * string		cr.pinst		realm of principal
 * string		myrealm			making this request}
 * 4 bytes		checksum		checksum argument given
 * unsigned char	tv_local.tf_usec	time (milliseconds)
 * 4 bytes		tv_local.tv_sec		time (seconds)
 *
 * req_id->length = 3 strings + 3 terminating nulls + 5 bytes for time,
 *                  all rounded up to multiple of 8.
