.TH KRB.CONF 5 "Kerberos Version 4.0" "MIT Project Athena"
.SH NAME
/etc/krb.conf \- Kerberos configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb.conf
contains configuration information describing the Kerberos realm(s) and the
Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) servers for known realms.
.PP
.I krb.conf
starts with a definition of the local realm on the first line, this is
followed by any number lines defining supplementary local realms.  The
rest of the file consists of lines indicating realm/host entries. The
first token is a realm name, and the second is a server specification
of a host running a KDC for that realm. The words "admin server"
following the hostname indicate that the host also provides an
administrative database server.

To be able to communicate with the KDC through a firewall it is
sometimes necessary to tunnel requests over HTTP or TCP. Tunnel
protocols and port numbers are specified in the server specification
using the syntax [(UDP|TCP|HTTP)/]hostname[:port].

For example:
.nf
.in +1i
SICS.SE
NADA.KTH.SE
SICS.SE     TCP/kerberos.sics.se:88 admin server
NADA.KTH.SE kerberos.nada.kth.se    admin server
NADA.KTH.SE kerberos-1.nada.kth.se
NADA.KTH.SE kerberos-2.nada.kth.se
NADA.KTH.SE HTTP/kerberos-3.nada.kth.se
KTH.SE      kerberos.kth.se         admin server
