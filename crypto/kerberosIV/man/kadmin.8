.Sh DESCRIPTION
This utility provides a unified administration interface to the
Kerberos master database.  Kerberos administrators use
.Nm
to register new users and services to the master database, and to
change information about existing database entries, such as changing a
user's Kerberos password. A Kerberos administrator is a user with an
.Dq admin
instance whose name appears on one of the Kerberos administration
access control lists.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ar principal
This is the adminstrator principal to use when talking to the Kadmin
server. The default is taken from the users environment.
.It Fl r Ar realm
This is the default realm to use for transactions. Default is the
local realm.
.It Fl u Ar username
This is similar to 
.Fl p ,
but specifies a name, that gets appended with a
.Dq admin
instance.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
To prevent someone from walking up to an unguarded terminal and doing
malicious things, administrator tickets are destroyed after a period
of inactivity. This flag changes the timeout from the default of one
minute. A timeout of zero seconds disables this functionality.
.It Fl m
Historically
.Nm
destroyed tickets after every command; this flag used to stop this
behaviour (only destroying tickets upon exit). Now it's just a synonym
for
.Fl T Ar 0 .
.It Fl t
Use existing tickets (if any are available), this also disbles
timeout, and doesn't destroy any tickets upon exit.
.Pp
These tickets have to be for the changepw.kerberos service.  Use
.Nm kinit -p
to acquire them.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
program communicates over the network with the
.Nm kadmind
program, which runs on the machine housing the Kerberos master
database, and does the actual modifications to the database.
.Pp
When you enter the
.Nm
command, the program displays a message that welcomes you and explains
how to ask for help.  Then
.Nm
waits for you to enter commands (which are described below).  It then
asks you for your administrator's password before accessing the
database.
.Pp
All commands can be abbreviated as long as they are unique.  Some
short versions of the commands are also recognized for backwards
compatibility.
.Pp
Recognised commands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It add_new_key Ar principal
Creates a new principal in the Kerberos database. You give the name of
the new principal as an argument. You will then be asked for a maximum
ticket lifetime, attributes, the expiration date of the principal, and
finally the password of the principal.
.It change_password Ar principal
Changes a principal's password. You will be prompted for the new
password.
.It change_key Ar principal
This is the same as change_password, but the password is given as a
raw DES key (for the few occations when you need this).
.It change_admin_password
Changes your own admin password. It will prompt you for you old and
new passwords.
.It del_entry Ar principal
Removes principal from the database.
.It get_entry Ar principal
Show various information for the given principal. Note that the key is
shown as zeros.
.It mod_entry Ar principal
Modifies a particular entry, for instance to change the expiration
date.  
.It destroy_tickets
Destroys your admin tickets explicitly.
.It quit
Obvious.

The user interface is primitive, and the command names could be
better.
