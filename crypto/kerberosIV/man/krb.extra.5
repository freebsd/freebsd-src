.It kdc_timeout
time in seconds to wait for an answer from the KDC (default is 4
seconds)

if this is enabled, the time differential between the client and the
KDC will be stored, and used later on when computing the correct time;
this is useful if the client's clock is drifting
.It firewall_address
the outside address of the firewall; this is used in some places to
compute a direction bit, and this might break if the server has a
different idea about which address to use then the client
.It krb4_proxy
address of a web-proxy to use when connecting to the KDC via HTTP
.It krb_default_tkt_root
the default prefix for ticket files. E.g, if your uid is 42 and the
prefix is /tmp/tkt then your default ticket file will be /tmp/tkt42
.It krb_default_keyfile
the default kefile, normally /etc/srvtab
.It nat_in_use
if a Network Address Translator (NAT) is being used.
