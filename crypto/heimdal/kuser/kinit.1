.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to authenticate to the Kerberos server as
.Ar principal ,
or if none is given, a system generated default (typically your login
name at the default realm), and acquire a ticket granting ticket that
can later be used to obtain tickets for other services.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cachename Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cachename
The credentials cache to put the acquired ticket in, if other than
default.
.It Fl f Fl Fl no-forwardable
Get ticket that can be forwarded to another host, or if the negative
flags use, don't get a forwardable flag.
.It Fl t Ar keytabname , Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar keytabname
Don't ask for a password, but instead get the key from the specified
keytab.
.It Fl l Ar time , Fl Fl lifetime= Ns Ar time
Specifies the lifetime of the ticket.
The argument can either be in seconds, or a more human readable string
like
.Sq 1h .
.It Fl p , Fl Fl proxiable
Request tickets with the proxiable flag set.
.It Fl R , Fl Fl renew
Try to renew ticket.
The ticket must have the
.Sq renewable
flag set, and must not be expired.
.It Fl Fl renewable
The same as
.Fl Fl renewable-life ,
with an infinite time.
.It Fl r Ar time , Fl Fl renewable-life= Ns Ar time
The max renewable ticket life.
.It Fl S Ar principal , Fl Fl server= Ns Ar principal
Get a ticket for a service other than krbtgt/LOCAL.REALM.
.It Fl s Ar time , Fl Fl start-time= Ns Ar time
Obtain a ticket that starts to be valid
.Ar time
(which can really be a generic time specification, like
.Sq 1h )
seconds into the future.
.It Fl k , Fl Fl use-keytab
The same as
.Fl Fl keytab ,
but with the default keytab name (normally
.Ar FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab ) .
.It Fl v , Fl Fl validate
Try to validate an invalid ticket.
.It Fl e , Fl Fl enctypes= Ns Ar enctypes
Request tickets with this particular enctype.
.It Fl Fl password-file= Ns Ar filename
read the password from the first line of
.Ar filename .
If the
.Ar filename
is
.Ar STDIN ,
the password will be read from the standard input.
.It Fl Fl fcache-version= Ns Ar version-number
Create a credentials cache of version
.Ar version-number .
.It Fl a , Fl Fl extra-addresses= Ns Ar enctypes
Adds a set of addresses that will, in addition to the systems local
addresses, be put in the ticket.
This can be useful if all addresses a client can use can't be
automatically figured out.
One such example is if the client is behind a firewall.
Also settable via
.Li libdefaults/extra_addresses
in
.Xr krb5.conf 5 .
.It Fl A , Fl Fl no-addresses
Request a ticket with no addresses.
.It Fl Fl anonymous
Request an anonymous ticket (which means that the ticket will be
issued to an anonymous principal, typically
.Dq anonymous@REALM ) .
.It Fl Fl enterprise
Parse principal as a enterprise (KRB5-NT-ENTERPRISE) name. Enterprise
names are email like principals that are stored in the name part of
the principal, and since there are two @ characters the parser needs
to know that the first is not a realm.
An example of an enterprise name is
.Dq lha@e.kth.se@KTH.SE ,
and this option is usually used with canonicalize so that the
principal returned from the KDC will typically be the real principal
name.
.It Fl Fl afslog
Gets AFS tickets, converts them to version 4 format, and stores them
in the kernel.
Only useful if you have AFS.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar forwardable ,
.Ar proxiable ,
.Ar ticket_life ,
and
.Ar renewable_life
options can be set to a default value from the
.Dv appdefaults
section in krb5.conf, see
.Xr krb5_appdefault 3 .
.Pp
If  a
.Ar command
is given,
.Nm
will set up new credentials caches, and AFS PAG, and then run the given
command.
When it finishes the credentials will be removed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev KRB5CCNAME
Specifies the default credentials cache.
.It Ev KRB5_CONFIG
The file name of
.Pa krb5.conf ,
the default being
.Pa /etc/krb5.conf .
.It Ev KRBTKFILE
Specifies the Kerberos 4 ticket file to store version 4 tickets in.
