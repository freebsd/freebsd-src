Oo Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype Oc Oo Fl w Ar password Oc \
Oo Fl Fl password= Ns Ar password Oc Oo Fl r Oc Oo Fl Fl random Oc \
Oo Fl s Oc Oo Fl Fl no-salt Oc Oo Fl H Oc Op Fl Fl hex
Adds a key to the keytab. Options that are not specified will be
prompted for. This requires that you know the password or the hex key of the
principal to add; if what you really want is to add a new principal to
the keytab, you should consider the
.Ar get
command, which talks to the kadmin server.
.It change Oo Fl r Ar realm Oc Oo Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm Oc \
Oo Fl Fl a Ar host Oc Oo Fl Fl admin-server= Ns Ar host Oc \
Oo Fl Fl s Ar port Oc Op Fl Fl server-port= Ns Ar port
Update one or several keys to new versions.  By default, use the admin
server for the realm of a keytab entry.  Otherwise it will use the
values specified by the options.
.Pp
If no principals are given, all the ones in the keytab are updated.
.It copy Ar keytab-src Ar keytab-dest
Copies all the entries from
.Ar keytab-src
to
.Ar keytab-dest .
.It get Oo Fl p Ar admin principal Oc \
Oo Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar admin principal Oc Oo Fl e Ar enctype Oc \

Oo Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm Oc Oo Fl a Ar admin server Oc \
Oo Fl Fl admin-server= Ns Ar admin server Oc Oo Fl s Ar server port Oc \
Oo Fl Fl server-port= Ns Ar server port Oc Ar principal ...
For each
.Ar principal ,
generate a new key for it (creating it if it doesn't already exist),
and put that key in the keytab.
.Pp
If no
.Ar realm
is specified, the realm to operate on is taken from the first
principal.
.It list Oo Fl Fl keys Oc Op Fl Fl timestamp
List the keys stored in the keytab.
.It remove Oo Fl p Ar principal Oc Oo Fl Fl principal= Ns Ar principal Oc \
Oo Fl V kvno Oc Oo Fl Fl kvno= Ns Ar kvno Oc Oo Fl e enctype Oc \
Oo Fl Fl enctype= Ns Ar enctype Oc
Removes the specified key or keys. Not specifying a
.Ar kvno
removes keys with any version number. Not specifying an
.Ar enctype
removes keys of any type.
.It rename Ar from-principal Ar to-principal
Renames all entries in the keytab that match the
.Ar from-principal
to
.Ar to-principal .
.It purge Op Fl Fl age= Ns Ar age
Removes all old versions of a key for which there is a newer version
that is at least
.Ar age
(default one week) old.
