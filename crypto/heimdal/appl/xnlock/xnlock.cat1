       _x_n_l_o_c_k is a program that acts as a screen saver for  work-
       stations  running  X11.   It  also "locks" the screen such
       that the workstation can be left unattended without  worry
       that  someone  else will walk up to it and mess everything
       up.  When _x_n_l_o_c_k is running, a little man with a big  nose
       and  a hat runs around spewing out messages to the screen.
       By default, the messages are "humorous", but that  depends
       on your sense of humor.

       If  a  key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed
       requesting the user's password.  If a RETURN is not  typed
       within  30 seconds, the little man resumes running around.

       Text on the command line is  used  as  the  message.   For
       example:
            % xnlock I'm out to lunch for a couple of hours.
       Note the need to quote shell metacharacters.

       In  the  absence  of flags or text, _x_n_l_o_c_k displays random
       fortunes.

       Command line options override all resource specifications.
       All  arguments that are not associated with a command line
       option is taken to be message text  that  the  little  man
       will   "say"   every   once  in  a  while.   The  resource
       xxnnlloocckk..tteexxtt may be set to a string.

       --ffnn _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
              The default font is the first 18 point font in  the
              _n_e_w  _c_e_n_t_u_r_y _s_c_h_o_o_l_b_o_o_k family.  While larger fonts
              are recokmmended over smaller ones, any font in the
              server's  font list will work.  The resource to use
              for this option is xxnnlloocckk..ffoonntt.

       --ffiilleennaammee  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Take the message to  be  displayed  from  the  file
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.     If   _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e   is   not   specified,
              _$_H_O_M_E_/_._m_s_g_f_i_l_e is used.  If  the  contents  of  the
              file  are  changed  during runtime, the most recent
              text of the file is used  (allowing  the  displayed
              message  to be altered remotely).  Carriage returns
              within the text are allowed, but tabs or other con-
              trol  characters  are not translated and should not
              be used.  The resource available for this option is
              xxnnlloocckk..ffiillee.

       --aarr    Accept  root's  password  to  unlock  screen.  This
              option is true by default.  The reason for this  is
              so  that someone's screen may be unlocked by autor-
              ized users in case of emergency and the person run-
              ning  the  program  is  still  out  to  lunch.  The
              resource available for specifying  this  option  is
              xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooaarr  Don't  accept  root's password.  This option is for
              paranoids who fear their peers might breakin  using
              root's  password  and  remove  their  files anyway.
              Specifying this option on the  command  line  over-
              rides the xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd if set to True.

       --iipp    Ignore password prompt.  The resource available for
              this option is xxnnlloocckk..iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooiipp  Don't ignore password prompt.  This is available in
              order  to override the resource iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd if set
              to True.

       --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
              Specifies  the  foreground  color.   The   resource
              available for this is xxnnlloocckk..ffoorreeggrroouunndd.

       --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
              Specifies   the  background  color.   The  resource
              available for this is xxnnlloocckk..bbaacckkggrroouunndd.

       --rrvv    Reverse the foreground and background colors.   The
              resource for this is xxvvnnlloocckk..rreevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo.

       --nnoorrvv  Don't  use  reverse  video.   This  is available to
              override the reverseVideo resource if set to  True.

       --pprroogg _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
              Receive  message text from the running program _p_r_o_-
              _g_r_a_m. If there are  arguments  to  _p_r_o_g_r_a_m,  encase
              them  with  the name of the program in quotes (e.g.
              xnlock -t "fortune -o").  The resource for this  is
              xxnnlloocckk..pprrooggrraamm.
