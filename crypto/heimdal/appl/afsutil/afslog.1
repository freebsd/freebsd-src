.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
obtains AFS tokens for a number of cells. What cells to get tokens for
can either be specified as an explicit list, as file paths to get
tokens for, or be left unspecified, in which case
.Nm
will use whatever magic
.Xr krb_afslog 3
decides upon.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl no-v4
This makes
.Nm
not try using Kerberos 4.
.It Fl Fl no-v5
This makes
.Nm
not try using Kerberos 5.
.It Xo
.Fl P Ar principal ,
.Fl Fl principal Ar principal
.Xc
select what Kerberos 5 principal to use.
.It Fl Fl cache Ar cache
select what Kerberos 5 credential cache to use.
.Fl Fl principal
overrides this option.
.It Xo
.Fl u ,
.Fl Fl unlog
.Xc
Destroy tokens instead of obtaining new. If this is specified, all
other options are ignored (except for
.Fl Fl help
and
.Fl Fl version ) .
.It Xo
.Fl v ,
.Fl Fl verbose
.Xc
Adds more verbosity for what is actually going on.
.It Xo
.Fl c Ar cell,
.Fl Fl cell= Ns Ar cell
.Xc
This specified one or more cell names to get tokens for.
.It Xo
.Fl k Ar realm ,
.Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm
.Xc
This is the Kerberos realm the AFS servers live in, this should
normally not be specified.
.It Xo
.Fl p Ar path ,
.Fl Fl file= Ns Ar path
.Xc
This specified one or more file paths for which tokens should be
obtained.
.El
.Pp
Instead of using
.Fl c
and
.Fl p ,
you may also pass a list of cells and file paths after any other
options. These arguments are considered files if they are either
the strings
.Do . Dc
or
.Dq ..
or they contain a slash, or if there exists a file by that name.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Assuming that there is no file called
.Dq openafs.org
in the current directory, and that
.Pa /afs/openafs.org
points to that cell, the follwing should be identical:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ afslog -c openafs.org
$ afslog openafs.org
$ afslog /afs/openafs.org/some/file
