     The oottpp program initializes and updates your current series of one-time
     passwords (OTPs).

     Use this to set a new series of one-time passwords.  Only perform this on
     the console or over an encrypted link as you will have to supply your
     pass-phrase.  The other two parameters are _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and _s_e_e_d.

     Options are:

     --dd      To delete a one-time password.

     --ff      Choose a different _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m from the default md5.  Pick any of:
             md4, md5, and sha.

     --hh      For getting a help message.

     --ll      List the current table of one-time passwords.

     --oo      To open (unlock) the otp-entry for a user.

     --rr      To renew a one-time password series.  This operation can be per-
             formed over an potentially eavesdropped link because you do not
             supply the pass-phrase.  First you need to supply the current
             one-time password and then the new one corresponding to the sup-
             plied _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and _s_e_e_d.

     --uu      To choose a different _u_s_e_r to set one-time passwords for.  This
             only works when running oottpp as root.
