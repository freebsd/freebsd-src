.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program initializes and updates your current series of one-time
passwords (OTPs).
.Pp
Use this to set a new series of one-time passwords.  Only perform this
on the console or over an encrypted link as you will have to supply
your pass-phrase.  The other two parameters are
.Ar sequence-number
and
.Ar seed .
.Pp
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
To delete a one-time password.

Choose a different
.Ar algorithm
from the default md5.  Pick any of: md4, md5, and sha.
.It Fl h
For getting a help message.
.It Fl l
List the current table of one-time passwords.
.It Fl o
To open (unlock) the otp-entry for a user.
.It Fl r
To renew a one-time password series.  This operation can be performed
over an potentially eavesdropped link because you do not supply the
pass-phrase.  First you need to supply the current one-time password
and then the new one corresponding to the supplied
.Ar sequence-number
and
.Ar seed .
.It Fl u
To choose a different
.Ar user
to set one-time passwords for.  This only works when running
.Nm
as root.
