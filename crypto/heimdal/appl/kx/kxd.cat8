     This is the daemon for kkxx.

     Options supported by kkxxdd:

     --tt      TCP.  Normally kkxxdd will only listen for X connections on a UNIX
             socket, but some machines (for example, Cray) have X libraries
             that are not able to use UNIX sockets and thus you need to use
             TCP to talk to the pseudo-xserver created by kkxxdd.. This option de-
             creases the security significantly and should only be used when
             it is necessary and you have considered the consequences of doing
             so.

     --ii      Interactive.  Do not expect to be started by iinneettdd,, but allocate
             and listen to the socket yourself.  Handy for testing and debug-
             ging.

     --pp      Port.  Listen on the port _p_o_r_t. Only usable with --ii.
