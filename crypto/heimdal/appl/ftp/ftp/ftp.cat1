     FFttpp is the user interface to the ARPANET standard File Transfer Protocol.
     The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote network
     site.

     Modifications has been made so that it almost follows the ftpsec Internet
     draft.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter-
     preter.

     --tt    Enables packet tracing.

     --vv    Verbose option forces ffttpp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     --nn    Restrains ffttpp from attempting ``auto-login'' upon initial connec-
           tion.  If auto-login is enabled, ffttpp will check the _._n_e_t_r_c (see be-
           low) file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ffttpp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
           account with which to login.

     --ii    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     --pp    Turn on passive mode.

     --dd    Enables debugging.

     --gg    Disables file name globbing.

     --ll    Disables command line editing.

     The client host with which ffttpp is to communicate may be specified on the
     command line.  If this is done, ffttpp will immediately attempt to establish
     a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ffttpp will enter its
     command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When ffttpp is
     awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp>' is provided to the us-
     er.  The following commands are recognized by ffttpp:

     !! [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_s]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $$ _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e [_a_r_g_s]
                 Execute the macro _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e that was defined with the mmaaccddeeff
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     aaccccoouunntt [_p_a_s_s_w_d]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be


                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     aappppeenndd _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any nnttrraannss
                 or nnmmaapp setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 ttyyppee, ffoorrmmaatt, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree.

     aasscciiii       Set the file transfer ttyyppee to network ASCII. This is the de-
                 fault type.

     bbeellll        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com-
                 mand is completed.

     bbiinnaarryy      Set the file transfer ttyyppee to support binary image transfer.

     bbyyee         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ffttpp. An end of file will also terminate the session and exit.

     ccaassee        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mmggeett
                 commands.  When ccaassee is on (default is off), remote computer
                 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
                 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     ccdd _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to _r_e_m_o_t_e_-
                 _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     ccdduupp        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     cchhmmoodd _m_o_d_e _f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e
                 Change the permission modes of the file _f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e on the re-
                 mote sytem to _m_o_d_e.

     cclloossee       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     ccrr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file re-
                 trieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When ccrr is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line-
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when ccrr is
                 off.

     ddeelleettee _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e
                 Delete the file _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e on the remote machine.

     ddeebbuugg [_d_e_b_u_g_-_v_a_l_u_e]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional _d_e_b_u_g_-_v_a_l_u_e is speci-
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ffttpp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string `-->'

     ddiirr [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
                 _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, and, optionally, placing the output in
                 _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e. If interactive prompting is on, ffttpp will prompt
                 the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the tar-
                 get local file for receiving ddiirr output.  If no directory is
                 specified, the current working directory on the remote ma-
                 chine is used.  If no local file is specified, or _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e

                 is --, output comes to the terminal.

     ddiissccoonnnneecctt  A synonym for _c_l_o_s_e.

     ffoorrmm _f_o_r_m_a_t
                 Set the file transfer ffoorrmm to _f_o_r_m_a_t. The default format is
                 ``file''.

     ggeett _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Retrieve the _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current ccaassee, nnttrraannss, and nnmmaapp settings.  The current
                 settings for ttyyppee, ffoorrmm, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree are used while
                 transferring the file.

     gglloobb        Toggle filename expansion for mmddeelleettee, mmggeett and mmppuutt. If
                 globbing is turned off with gglloobb, the file name arguments are
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mmppuutt is done
                 as in csh(1).  For mmddeelleettee and mmggeett, each remote file name is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
                 server, and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-files -'.
                 As a security measure, remotely globbed files that starts
                 with `/' or contains `../', will not be automatically re-
                 ceived. If you have interactive prompting turned off, these
                 filenames will be ignored.  Note: mmggeett and mmppuutt are not meant
                 to transfer entire directory subtrees of files.  That can be
                 done by transferring a tar(1) archive of the subtree (in bi-
                 nary mode).

     hhaasshh        Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans-
                 ferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     hheellpp [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. If
                 no argument is given, ffttpp prints a list of the known com-
                 mands.

     iiddllee [_s_e_c_o_n_d_s]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to _s_e_c_o_n_d_s sec-
                 onds.  If _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
                 printed.

     llccdd [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     llss [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa-
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
                 (See also nnlliisstt.) If _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ffttpp will prompt the user to verify that the
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 llss output.  If no local file is specified, or if _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e
                 is `--', the output is sent to the terminal.

     mmaaccddeeff _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined un-
                 til a cclloossee command is executed.  The macro processor inter-
                 prets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed by a
                 number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument
                 on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' followed by an
                 `i' signals that macro processor that the executing macro is
                 to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is replaced by the
                 first argument on the macro invocation command line, on the
                 second pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on.
                 A `\' followed by any character is replaced by that charac-
                 ter.  Use the `\' to prevent special treatment of the `$'.

     mmddeelleettee [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s]
                 Delete the _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s on the remote machine.

     mmddiirr _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e
                 Like ddiirr, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
                 interactive prompting is on, ffttpp will prompt the user to ver-
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving mmddiirr output.

     mmggeett _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s
                 Expand the _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s on the remote machine and do a ggeett
                 for each file name thus produced.  See gglloobb for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to ccaassee, nnttrraannss, and nnmmaapp settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
                 can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories
                 can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     mmkkddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_n_a_m_e
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mmllss _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e_s _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e
                 Like nnlliisstt, except multiple remote files may be specified,
                 and the _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e must be specified.  If interactive prompt-
                 ing is on, ffttpp will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mmllss
                 output.

     mmooddee [_m_o_d_e_-_n_a_m_e]
                 Set the file transfer mmooddee to _m_o_d_e_-_n_a_m_e. The default mode is
                 ``stream'' mode.

     mmooddttiimmee _f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote ma-
                 chine.

     mmppuutt _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e_s
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu-
                 ments and do a ppuutt for each file in the resulting list.  See
                 gglloobb for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to nnttrraannss and nnmmaapp settings.

     nneewweerr _f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                 considered nneewweerr. Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 _g_e_t.

     nnlliisstt [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote ma-
                 chine.  If _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is left unspecified, the current
                 working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on,
                 ffttpp will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is
                 indeed the target local file for receiving nnlliisstt output.  If
                 no local file is specified, or if _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e is --, the output
                 is sent to the terminal.

                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands issued without a specified re-
                 mote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mmggeett commands and ggeett commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com-
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n and _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
                 [_I_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the nnttrraannss and ccaassee
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n. Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to de-
                 termine the nnmmaapp [_i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n] variable values.  For example,
                 given _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n determines the resulting mapped file-
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n template.  The se-
                 quence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Additional-
                 ly, the sequence `[_s_e_q_1, _s_e_q_2]' is replaced by [_s_e_q_1] if _s_e_q_1
                 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by _s_e_q_2. For
                 example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file-
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the in-
                 put filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[','[', and `,' characters.

     nnttrraannss [_i_n_c_h_a_r_s [_o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans-
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char-
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mmppuutt com-
                 mands and ppuutt commands issued without a specified remote tar-
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in lo-
                 cal filenames are translated during mmggeett commands and ggeett
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in _i_n_c_h_a_r_s are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s. If the
                 character's position in _i_n_c_h_a_r_s is longer than the length of
                 _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s, the character is deleted from the file name.

     ooppeenn _h_o_s_t [_p_o_r_t]
                 Establish a connection to the specified _h_o_s_t FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ffttpp will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the aauuttoo--
                 llooggiinn option is on (default), ffttpp will also attempt to auto-

                 matically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     ppaassssiivvee     Toggle passive mode.  If passive mode is turned on (default
                 is off), the ftp client will send a PASV command for all data
                 connections instead of the usual PORT command.  The PASV com-
                 mand requests that the remote server open a port for the data
                 connection and return the address of that port.  The remote
                 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
                 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis-
                 tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
                 who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
                 ffttpp through a gateway router or host that controls the direc-
                 tionality of traffic.  (Note that though ftp servers are re-
                 quired to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

     pprroommpptt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec-
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mmggeett or mmppuutt will transfer all files,
                 and any mmddeelleettee will delete all files.

     pprrooxxyy _f_t_p_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first pprrooxxyy command should be an ooppeenn, to establish the sec-
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec-
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref-
                 aced by pprrooxxyy: ooppeenn will not define new macros during the au-
                 to-login process, cclloossee will not erase existing macro defini-
                 tions, ggeett and mmggeett transfer files from the host on the pri-
                 mary control connection to the host on the secondary control
                 connection, and ppuutt, mmppuutt, and aappppeenndd transfer files from the
                 host on the secondary control connection to the host on the
                 primary control connection.  Third party file transfers de-
                 pend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by the
                 server on the secondary control connection.

                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process-

                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for

                 smaller than _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e, _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e is presumed to be a par-
                 tially transferred copy of _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e and the transfer is
                 continued from the apparent point of failure.  This command
                 is useful when transferring very large files over networks


                 that are prone to dropping connections.

                 may be necessary following a violation of the ftp protocol by
                 the remote server.

     rreessttaarrtt _m_a_r_k_e_r

     rruunniiqquuee     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique file-
                 names.  If a file already exists with a name equal to the
                 target local filename for a ggeett or mmggeett command, a ".1" is
                 appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches another
                 existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
                 this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
                 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generated
                 unique filename will be reported.  Note that rruunniiqquuee will not
                 affect local files generated from a shell command (see be-
                 low).  The default value is off.

     sseennddppoorrtt    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, ffttpp will at-
                 tempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connection
                 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT
                 command fails, ffttpp will use the default data port.  When the
                 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
                 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for
                 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
                 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

                 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d
                 is not specified and the server requires it, ffttpp will prompt
                 the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an _a_c_c_o_u_n_t
                 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
                 user will be prompted for it.  If an _a_c_c_o_u_n_t field is speci-
                 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
                 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
                 did not require it for logging in.  Unless ffttpp is invoked
                 with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done automati-
                 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     vveerrbboossee     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the

     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-
     C).  Sending transfers will be immediately halted.  Receiving transfers
     will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote serv-
     er, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is
     accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR process-
     ing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, an `ftp>'
     prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.


     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when ffttpp has complet-
     ed any local processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote server.
     A long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing described
     above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server, including viola-
     tions of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from unexpected remote
     server behavior, the local ffttpp program must be killed by hand.

     Files specified as arguments to ffttpp commands are processed according to
     the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `--' is specified, the _s_t_d_i_n (for reading) or _s_t_d_o_u_t
          (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the
          argument is interpreted as a shell command.  FFttpp then forks a shell,
          using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
          the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argu-
          ment must be quoted; e.g.  ``" ls -lt"''.  A particularly useful ex-
          ample of this mechanism is: ``dir more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file
          names are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1);  c.f.
          the gglloobb command.  If the ffttpp command expects a single local file
          (.e.g.  ppuutt), only the first filename generated by the "globbing"
          operation is used.

     4.   For mmggeett commands and ggeett commands with unspecified local file
          names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be al-
          tered by a ccaassee, nnttrraannss, or nnmmaapp setting.  The resulting filename
          may then be altered if rruunniiqquuee is on.

     5.   For mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands with unspecified remote file
          names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be al-
          tered by a nnttrraannss or nnmmaapp setting.  The resulting filename may then
          be altered by the remote server if ssuunniiqquuee is on.

     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.  The ttyyppee may be one of ``ascii'', ``image'' (binary),
     ``ebcdic'', and ``local byte size'' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).
     FFttpp supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte
     size 8 for tteenneexx mode transfers.

     FFttpp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer pa-
     rameters: mmooddee, ffoorrmm, and ssttrruucctt.

     The _._n_e_t_r_c file contains login and initialization information used by the
     auto-login process.  It resides in the user's home directory.  The fol-
     lowing tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or
     new-lines:

     mmaacchhiinnee _n_a_m_e
               Identify a remote machine _n_a_m_e. The auto-login process searches
               the _._n_e_t_r_c file for a mmaacchhiinnee token that matches the remote ma-
               chine specified on the ffttpp command line or as an ooppeenn command
               argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent _._n_e_t_r_c tokens
               are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or an-
               other mmaacchhiinnee or a ddeeffaauulltt token is encountered.

     ddeeffaauulltt   This is the same as mmaacchhiinnee _n_a_m_e except that ddeeffaauulltt matches
               any name.  There can be only one ddeeffaauulltt token, and it must be
               after all mmaacchhiinnee tokens.  This is normally used as:


                     default login anonymous password user@site

               thereby giving the user _a_u_t_o_m_a_t_i_c anonymous ftp login to ma-
               chines not specified in _._n_e_t_r_c. This can be overridden by using
               the --nn flag to disable auto-login.

     llooggiinn _n_a_m_e
               Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is pre-
               sent, the auto-login process will initiate a login using the
               specified _n_a_m_e.

     ppaasssswwoorrdd _s_t_r_i_n_g
               Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
               process will supply the specified string if the remote server
               requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
               this token is present in the _._n_e_t_r_c file for any user other
               than _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s, ffttpp will abort the auto-login process if the
               _._n_e_t_r_c is readable by anyone besides the user.

     aaccccoouunntt _s_t_r_i_n_g
               Supply an additional account password.  If this token is pre-
               sent, the auto-login process will supply the specified string
               if the remote server requires an additional account password,
               or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it
               does not.

     mmaaccddeeff _n_a_m_e
               Define a macro.  This token functions like the ffttpp mmaaccddeeff com-
               mand functions.  A macro is defined with the specified name;
               its contents begin with the next _._n_e_t_r_c line and continue until
               a null line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.
               If a macro named iinniitt is defined, it is automatically executed
               as the last step in the auto-login process.

     FFttpp utilizes the following environment variables.

     HOME        For default location of a _._n_e_t_r_c file, if one exists.

     SHELL       For default shell.

     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
     remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode
     transfer code has been corrected.  This correction may result in incor-
     rect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii
     type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.
