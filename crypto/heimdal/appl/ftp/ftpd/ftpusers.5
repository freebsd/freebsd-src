.Sh NAME
.Pa /etc/ftpusers
.Nd FTP access list file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pa /etc/ftpusers
contains a list of users that should be allowed or denied FTP
access. Each line contains a user, optionally followed by
.Dq allow
(anything but
.Dq allow
is ignored).  The semi-user
.Dq *
matches any user.  Users that has an explicit
.Dq allow ,
or that does not match any line, are allowed access. Anyone else is
denied access.
.Pp
Note that this is compatible with the old format, where this file
contained a list of users that should be denied access.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This will deny anyone but
.Dq foo
and
.Dq bar
to use FTP:
.Bd -literal
foo allow
bar allow
