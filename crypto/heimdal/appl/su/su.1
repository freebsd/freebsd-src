.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm su
will use Kerberos authentication provided that an instance for the
user wanting to change effective UID is present in a file named
.Pa .k5login
in the target user id's home directory
.Pp
A special case exists where
.Ql root Ap s
.Pa ~/.k5login
needs to contain an entry for:
.Ql user Ns / Ns Ao instance Ac Ns @ Ns REALM
for
.Nm su
to succed (where
.Aq instance
is
.Ql root
unless changed with
.Fl i ) .
.Pp
In the absence of either an entry for current user in said file or
other problems like missing
.Ql host/hostname@REALM
keys in the system's
keytab, or user typing the wrong password,
.Nm su
will fall back to traditional
.Pa /etc/passwd
authentication.
.Pp
When using
.Pa /etc/passwd
authentication,
.Nm su
allows
.Ql root
access only to members of the group
.Ql wheel ,
or to any user (with knowledge of the
.Ql root
password) if that group
does not exist, or has no members.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -item -width Ds

.Fl Fl no-kerberos
don't use Kerberos.
