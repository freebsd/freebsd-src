DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The tteellnneett command is used to communicate with another host using the
     TELNET protocol.  If tteellnneett is invoked without the _h_o_s_t argument, it en-
     ters command mode, indicated by its prompt (tteellnneett>>). In this mode, it
     accepts and executes the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with
     arguments, it performs an ooppeenn command with those arguments.

     Options:

     --88      Specifies an 8-bit data path.  This causes an attempt to negoti-
             ate the TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.

     --77      Do not try to negotiate TELNET BINARY option.

     --EE      Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.

     --FF      If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the --FF option allows
             the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system, in-
             cluding any credentials that have already been forwarded into the
             local environment.

     --KK      Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.

     --LL      Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes the BINARY
             option to be negotiated on output.

     --SS _t_o_s  Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connec-
             tion to the value _t_o_s, which can be a numeric TOS value or, on
             systems that support it, a symbolic TOS name found in the
             /etc/iptos file.

     --XX _a_t_y_p_e
             Disables the _a_t_y_p_e type of authentication.

     --aa      Attempt automatic login.  Currently, this sends the user name via
             the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if supported by the re-
             mote system.  The name used is that of the current user as re-
             turned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with the current user ID, oth-
             erwise it is the name associated with the user ID.

     --cc      Disables the reading of the user's _._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file.  (See the
             ttooggggllee sskkiipprrcc command on this man page.)

     --dd      Sets the initial value of the ddeebbuugg toggle to TRUE

     --ee _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r
             Sets the initial tteellnneett tteellnneett escape character to _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r.
             If _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r is omitted, then there will be no escape charac-
             ter.

     --ff      If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the --ff option allows
             the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system.

     --kk _r_e_a_l_m
             If Kerberos authentication is being used, the --kk option requests
             that telnet obtain tickets for the remote host in realm realm in-
             stead of the remote host's realm, as determined by
             krb_realmofhost(3).

     --ll _u_s_e_r
             When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system under-
             stands the ENVIRON option, then _u_s_e_r will be sent to the remote
             system as the value for the variable USER.  This option implies
             the --aa option.  This option may also be used with the ooppeenn com-
             mand.

     --nn _t_r_a_c_e_f_i_l_e
             Opens _t_r_a_c_e_f_i_l_e for recording trace information.  See the sseett
             ttrraacceeffiillee command below.

     --rr      Specifies a user interface similar to rlogin(1).  In this mode,
             the escape character is set to the tilde (~) character, unless
             modified by the -e option.

     --xx      Turns on encryption of the data stream if possible. This is cur-
             rently the default and when it fails a warning is issued.

     _h_o_s_t    Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address of
             a remote host.

     _p_o_r_t    Indicates a port number (address of an application).  If a number
             is not specified, the default tteellnneett port is used.

     When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~.  disconnects from the remote
     host; ~ is the telnet escape character.  Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends
     the telnet session.  The line ~^] escapes to the normal telnet escape
     prompt.

     Once a connection has been opened, tteellnneett will attempt to enable the
     TELNET LINEMODE option.  If this fails, then tteellnneett will revert to one of
     two input modes: either ``character at a time'' or ``old line by line''
     depending on what the remote system supports.

     When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local sys-
     tem, under the control of the remote system.  When input editing or char-
     acter echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay that infor-
     mation.  The remote system will also relay changes to any special charac-
     ters that happen on the remote system, so that they can take effect on
     the local system.

     In ``character at a time'' mode, most text typed is immediately sent to
     the remote host for processing.

     In ``old line by line'' mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally)
     only completed lines are sent to the remote host.  The ``local echo char-
     acter'' (initially ``^E'') may be used to turn off and on the local echo
     (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being
     echoed).

     If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the llooccaallcchhaarrss toggle is TRUE
     (the default for ``old line by line``; see below), the user's qquuiitt, iinnttrr,
     and fflluusshh characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET protocol se-
     quences to the remote side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the
     user's ssuusspp and eeooff are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and qquuiitt
     is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK There are options (see ttooggggllee
     aauuttoofflluusshh and ttooggggllee aauuttoossyynncchh below) which cause this action to flush
     subsequent output to the terminal (until the remote host acknowledges the
     TELNET sequence) and flush previous terminal input (in the case of qquuiitt
     and iinnttrr).


     While connected to a remote host, tteellnneett command mode may be entered by
     typing the tteellnneett ``escape character'' (initially ``^]'').  When in com-
     mand mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.

     The following tteellnneett commands are available.  Only enough of each command
     to uniquely identify it need be typed (this is also true for arguments to
     the mmooddee, sseett, ttooggggllee, uunnsseett, ssllcc, eennvviirroonn, and ddiissppllaayy commands).

     aauutthh _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.
                The auth command manipulates the information sent through the
                TELNET AUTHENTICATE option.  Valid arguments for the auth com-
                mand are as follows:

                ddiissaabbllee _t_y_p_e  Disables the specified type of authentication.
                              To obtain a list of available types, use the
                              aauutthh ddiissaabbllee ?? command.

                eennaabbllee _t_y_p_e   Enables the specified type of authentication.
                              To obtain a list of available types, use the

     ddiissppllaayy _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.
                Displays all, or some, of the sseett and ttooggggllee values (see be-
                low).

     eennccrryypptt _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _._._.
                The encrypt command manipulates the information sent through
                the TELNET ENCRYPT option.

                Note:  Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option
                is not supported outside of the United States and Canada.

                Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as follows:

                ddiissaabbllee _t_y_p_e [iinnppuutt | oouuttppuutt]
                              Disables the specified type of encryption.  If
                              you omit the input and output, both input and
                              output are disabled.  To obtain a list of avail-
                              able types, use the eennccrryypptt ddiissaabbllee ?? command.

                              Enables the specified type of encryption.  If
                              you omit input and output, both input and output
                              are enabled.  To obtain a list of available
                              types, use the eennccrryypptt eennaabbllee ?? command.

                iinnppuutt         This is the same as the eennccrryypptt ssttaarrtt iinnppuutt com-

                ssttaarrtt [iinnppuutt | oouuttppuutt]
                              Attempts to start encryption.  If you omit iinnppuutt
                              and oouuttppuutt, both input and output are enabled.
                              To obtain a list of available types, use the
                              eennccrryypptt eennaabbllee ?? command.

                ssttaattuuss        Lists the current status of encryption.

                ssttoopp [iinnppuutt | oouuttppuutt]
                              Stops encryption.  If you omit input and output,
                              encryption is on both input and output.

                ttyyppee _t_y_p_e     Sets the default type of encryption to be used
                              with later eennccrryypptt ssttaarrtt or eennccrryypptt ssttoopp com-

     eennvviirroonn _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s _._._.
                The eennvviirroonn command is used to manipulate the the variables
                that my be sent through the TELNET ENVIRON option.  The ini-
                tial set of variables is taken from the users environment,
                with only the DISPLAY and PRINTER variables being exported by
                default.  The USER variable is also exported if the --aa or --ll
                options are used.

                Valid arguments for the eennvviirroonn command are:

                ddeeffiinnee _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e
                            Define the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to have a value of
                            _v_a_l_u_e. Any variables defined by this command are
                            automatically exported.  The _v_a_l_u_e may be enclosed
                            in single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces
                            may be included.

                uunnddeeffiinnee _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Remove _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e from the list of environment vari-
                            ables.

                eexxppoorrtt _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Mark the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to be exported to the
                            remote side.

                uunneexxppoorrtt _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                            Mark the variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e to not be exported un-
                            less explicitly asked for by the remote side.

                lliisstt        List the current set of environment variables.
                            Those marked with a ** will be sent automatically,
                            other variables will only be sent if explicitly
                            requested.

                ??           Prints out help information for the eennvviirroonn com-
                            mand.

     llooggoouutt     Sends the TELNET LOGOUT option to the remote side.  This com-
                mand is similar to a cclloossee command; however, if the remote
                side does not support the LOGOUT option, nothing happens.  If,
                however, the remote side does support the LOGOUT option, this
                command should cause the remote side to close the TELNET con-
                nection.  If the remote side also supports the concept of sus-
                pending a user's session for later reattachment, the logout
                argument indicates that you should terminate the session imme-
                diately.

     mmooddee _t_y_p_e  _T_y_p_e is one of several options, depending on the state of the
                TELNET session.  The remote host is asked for permission to go
                into the requested mode.  If the remote host is capable of en-
                tering that mode, the requested mode will be entered.

                cchhaarraacctteerr     Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
                              remote side does not understand the LINEMODE op-
                              tion, then enter ``character at a time`` mode.

                lliinnee          Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the

                              tion, then attempt to enter ``old-line-by-line``
                              mode.

     ooppeenn _h_o_s_t [--ll _u_s_e_r] [[--]_p_o_r_t]
                Open a connection to the named host.  If no port number is
                specified, tteellnneett will attempt to contact a TELNET server at
                the default port.  The host specification may be either a host
                name (see hosts(5))  or an Internet address specified in the
                ``dot notation'' (see inet(3)).  The [--ll] option may be used
                to specify the user name to be passed to the remote system via
                the ENVIRON option.  When connecting to a non-standard port,
                tteellnneett omits any automatic initiation of TELNET options.  When
                the port number is preceded by a minus sign, the initial op-
                tion negotiation is done.  After establishing a connection,
                the file _._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c in the users home directory is opened.
                Lines beginning with a # are comment lines.  Blank lines are
                ignored.  Lines that begin without white space are the start
                of a machine entry.  The first thing on the line is the name
                of the machine that is being connected to.  The rest of the
                line, and successive lines that begin with white space are as-
                sumed to be tteellnneett commands and are processed as if they had
                been typed in manually to the tteellnneett command prompt.

     qquuiitt       Close any open TELNET session and exit tteellnneett. An end of file
                (in command mode) will also close a session and exit.

     sseenndd _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
                Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote
                host.  The following are the arguments which may be specified
                (more than one argument may be specified at a time):

                aabboorrtt   Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

                aaoo      Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to flush all output
                        _f_r_o_m the remote system _t_o the user's terminal.

                aayytt     Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to
                        which the remote system may or may not choose to re-

                        spond.

                bbrrkk     Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which may have
                        significance to the remote system.

                eecc      Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to erase the last char-
                        acter entered.

                eell      Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which
                        should cause the remote system to erase the line cur-
                        rently being entered.

                eeooff     Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

                eeoorr     Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

                eessccaappee  Sends the current tteellnneett escape character (initially
                        ``^'').

                ggaa      Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely
                        has no significance to the remote system.

                ggeettssttaattuuss
                        If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command,
                        ggeettssttaattuuss will send the subnegotiation to request that
                        the server send its current option status.

                iipp      Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence,
                        which should cause the remote system to abort the cur-
                        rently running process.

                nnoopp     Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

                ssuusspp    Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

                ssyynncchh   Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence.  This sequence causes
                        the remote system to discard all previously typed (but
                        not yet read) input.  This sequence is sent as TCP ur-
                        gent data (and may not work if the remote system is a
                        4.2BSD system -- if it doesn't work, a lower case
                        ``r'' may be echoed on the terminal).

                ddoo _c_m_d

                ddoonntt _c_m_d

                wwiillll _c_m_d

                wwoonntt _c_m_d
                        Sends the TELNET DO _c_m_d sequence.  _C_m_d can be either a
                        decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name
                        for a specific TELNET command.  _C_m_d can also be either
                        hheellpp or ?? to print out help information, including a
                        list of known symbolic names.

                ??       Prints out help information for the sseenndd command.

     sseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e

     uunnsseett _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _v_a_l_u_e
                The sseett command will set any one of a number of tteellnneett vari-
                ables to a specific value or to TRUE. The special value ooffff
                turns off the function associated with the variable, this is
                equivalent to using the uunnsseett command.  The uunnsseett command will
                disable or set to FALSE any of the specified functions.  The
                values of variables may be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy com-
                mand.  The variables which may be set or unset, but not tog-
                gled, are listed here.  In addition, any of the variables for
                the ttooggggllee command may be explicitly set or unset using the
                sseett and uunnsseett commands.

                aayytt     If TELNET is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is en-
                        abled, and the status character is typed, a TELNET AYT
                        sequence (see sseenndd aayytt preceding) is sent to the re-
                        mote host.  The initial value for the "Are You There"
                        character is the terminal's status character.

                eecchhoo    This is the value (initially ``^E'') which, when in
                        ``line by line'' mode, toggles between doing local
                        echoing of entered characters (for normal processing),
                        and suppressing echoing of entered characters (for en-
                        tering, say, a password).

                eeooff     If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line'' mode, entering this character as the first
                        character on a line will cause this character to be
                        sent to the remote system.  The initial value of the
                        eof character is taken to be the terminal's eeooff char-
                        acter.

                eerraassee   If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below), aanndd if tteellnneett is operating in ``character at a
                        time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EC sequence (see sseenndd eecc above) is sent to the
                        remote system.  The initial value for the erase char-
                        acter is taken to be the terminal's eerraassee character.

                eessccaappee  This is the tteellnneett escape character (initially ``^['')
                        which causes entry into tteellnneett command mode (when con-
                        nected to a remote system).

                fflluusshhoouuttppuutt
                        If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the fflluusshhoouuttppuutt character is typed, a
                        TELNET AO sequence (see sseenndd aaoo above) is sent to the
                        remote host.  The initial value for the flush charac-
                        ter is taken to be the terminal's fflluusshh character.

                ffoorrww11

                ffoorrww22   If TELNET is operating in LINEMODE, these are the
                        characters that, when typed, cause partial lines to be
                        forwarded to the remote system.  The initial value for
                        the forwarding characters are taken from the termi-
                        nal's eol and eol2 characters.

                iinntteerrrruupptt
                        If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the iinntteerrrruupptt character is typed, a TELNET
                        IP sequence (see sseenndd iipp above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the interrupt character
                        is taken to be the terminal's iinnttrr character.

                kkiillll    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below), aanndd if tteellnneett is operating in ``character at a
                        time'' mode, then when this character is typed, a
                        TELNET EL sequence (see sseenndd eell above) is sent to the
                        remote system.  The initial value for the kill charac-
                        ter is taken to be the terminal's kkiillll character.

                llnneexxtt   If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's llnneexxtt character.  The initial value for the
                        lnext character is taken to be the terminal's llnneexxtt
                        character.

                qquuiitt    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss
                        below) and the qquuiitt character is typed, a TELNET BRK
                        sequence (see sseenndd bbrrkk above) is sent to the remote
                        host.  The initial value for the quit character is
                        taken to be the terminal's qquuiitt character.

                rreepprriinntt
                        If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's rreepprriinntt character.  The initial value for
                        the reprint character is taken to be the terminal's
                        rreepprriinntt character.

                rrllooggiinn  This is the rlogin escape character.  If set, the nor-
                        mal TELNET escape character is ignored unless it is
                        preceded by this character at the beginning of a line.
                        This character, at the beginning of a line followed by
                        a "."  closes the connection; when followed by a ^Z it
                        suspends the telnet command.  The initial state is to
                        disable the rlogin escape character.

                ssttaarrtt   If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been en-
                        abled, then this character is taken to be the termi-
                        nal's ssttaarrtt character.  The initial value for the kill
                        character is taken to be the terminal's ssttaarrtt charac-
                        ter.

                ssttoopp    If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been en-
                        abled, then this character is taken to be the termi-
                        nal's ssttoopp character.  The initial value for the kill
                        character is taken to be the terminal's ssttoopp charac-
                        ter.

                ssuusspp    If tteellnneett is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode, or LINEMODE is en-
                        abled, and the ssuussppeenndd character is typed, a TELNET
                        SUSP sequence (see sseenndd ssuusspp above) is sent to the re-
                        mote host.  The initial value for the suspend charac-
                        ter is taken to be the terminal's ssuussppeenndd character.

                ttrraacceeffiillee
                        This is the file to which the output, caused by
                        nneettddaattaa or ooppttiioonn tracing being TRUE, will be written.
                        If it is set to ``--'', then tracing information will
                        be written to standard output (the default).

                wwoorrddeerraassee
                        If tteellnneett is operating in LINEMODE or ``old line by
                        line`` mode, then this character is taken to be the
                        terminal's wwoorrddeerraassee character.  The initial value for
                        the worderase character is taken to be the terminal's
                        wwoorrddeerraassee character.

                ??       Displays the legal sseett (uunnsseett) commands.

     ssllcc _s_t_a_t_e  The ssllcc command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or
                change the state of the the special characters when the TELNET
                LINEMODE option has been enabled.  Special characters are
                characters that get mapped to TELNET commands sequences (like
                iipp or qquuiitt) or line editing characters (like eerraassee and kkiillll).


                By default, the local special characters are exported.

                            send all the current special character settings,
                            and if there are any discrepancies with the local
                            side, the local side will switch to the remote

                Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control how
                tteellnneett responds to events.  These flags may be set explicitly
                to TRUE or FALSE using the sseett and uunnsseett commands listed

                              when the aaoo, or qquuiitt characters are recognized
                              (and transformed into TELNET sequences; see sseett
                              above for details), tteellnneett refuses to display
                              any data on the user's terminal until the remote
                              system acknowledges (via a TELNET TIMING MARK
                              option) that it has processed those TELNET se-
                              quences.  The initial value for this toggle is
                              TRUE if the terminal user had not done an "stty
                              noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see stty(1)).

                aauuttooddeeccrryypptt   When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by
                              default the actual encryption (decryption) of
                              the data stream does not start automatically.
                              The autoencrypt (autodecrypt) command states
                              that encryption of the output (input) stream
                              should be enabled as soon as possible.

                              Note:  Because of export controls, the TELNET
                              ENCRYPT option is not supported outside the
                              United States and Canada.

                aauuttoollooggiinn     If the remote side supports the TELNET
                              AUTHENTICATION option TELNET attempts to use it
                              to perform automatic authentication.  If the
                              AUTHENTICATION option is not supported, the us-
                              er's login name are propagated through the
                              TELNET ENVIRON option.  This command is the same
                              as specifying _a option on the ooppeenn command.

                aauuttoossyynncchh     If aauuttoossyynncchh and llooccaallcchhaarrss are both TRUE, then
                              when either the iinnttrr or qquuiitt characters is typed
                              (see sseett above for descriptions of the iinnttrr and
                              qquuiitt characters), the resulting TELNET sequence
                              sent is followed by the TELNET SYNCH sequence.
                              This procedure sshhoouulldd cause the remote system to
                              begin throwing away all previously typed input
                              until both of the TELNET sequences have been
                              read and acted upon.  The initial value of this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                bbiinnaarryy        Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
                              both input and output.

                ccrrllff          If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be
                              sent as <CR><LF>. If this is FALSE, then car-
                              riage returns will be send as <CR><NUL>. The
                              initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                ccrrmmoodd         Toggle carriage return mode.  When this mode is
                              enabled, most carriage return characters re-
                              ceived from the remote host will be mapped into
                              a carriage return followed by a line feed.  This
                              mode does not affect those characters typed by
                              the user, only those received from the remote
                              host.  This mode is not very useful unless the
                              remote host only sends carriage return, but nev-
                              er line feed.  The initial value for this toggle
                              is FALSE.

                ddeebbuugg         Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to
                              the ssuuppeerr uusseerr). The initial value for this tog-
                              gle is FALSE.

                eennccddeebbuugg      Turns on debugging information for the encryp-

                llooccaallcchhaarrss    If this is TRUE, then the fflluusshh, iinntteerrrruupptt,
                              qquuiitt, eerraassee, and kkiillll characters (see sseett above)
                              are recognized locally, and transformed into
                              (hopefully) appropriate TELNET control sequences
                              (respectively aaoo, iipp, bbrrkk, eecc, and eell; see sseenndd
                              above).  The initial value for this toggle is
                              TRUE in ``old line by line'' mode, and FALSE in
                              ``character at a time'' mode.  When the LINEMODE
                              option is enabled, the value of llooccaallcchhaarrss is
                              ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE. If
                              LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then qquuiitt is
                              sent as aabboorrtt, and eeooff and ssuussppeenndd are sent as
                              eeooff and ssuusspp, see sseenndd above).

                nneettddaattaa       Toggles the display of all network data (in hex-
                              adecimal format).  The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                ooppttiioonnss       Toggles the display of some internal tteellnneett pro-
                              tocol processing (having to do with TELNET op-
                              tions).  The initial value for this toggle is
                              FALSE.

                pprreettttyydduummpp    When the nneettddaattaa toggle is enabled, if
                              pprreettttyydduummpp is enabled the output from the
                              nneettddaattaa command will be formatted in a more user
                              readable format.  Spaces are put between each
                              character in the output, and the beginning of
                              any TELNET escape sequence is preceded by a '*'
                              to aid in locating them.

                sskkiipprrcc        When the skiprc toggle is TRUE, TELNET skips the
                              reading of the _._t_e_l_n_e_t_r_c file in the users home
                              directory when connections are opened.  The ini-
                              tial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                tteerrmmddaattaa      Toggles the display of all terminal data (in
                              hexadecimal format).  The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE.

                              When the vveerrbboossee__eennccrryypptt toggle is TRUE, TELNET
                              prints out a message each time encryption is en-
                              abled or disabled.  The initial value for this
                              toggle is FALSE. Note:  Because of export con-
                              trols, data encryption is not supported outside
                              of the United States and Canada.
