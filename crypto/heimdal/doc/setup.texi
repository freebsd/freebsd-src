A
@cindex realm
realm is an administrative domain.  The name of a Kerberos realm is
usually the Internet domain name in uppercase.  Call your realm the same
as your Internet domain name if you do not have strong reasons for not
doing so.  It will make life easier for you and everyone else.

@node  Configuration file, Creating the database, Setting up a realm, Setting up a realm
@section Configuration file

To setup a realm you will first have to create a configuration file:
@file{/etc/krb5.conf}. The @file{krb5.conf} file can contain many
configuration options, some of which are described here.

There is a sample @file{krb5.conf} supplied with the distribution.

The configuration file is a hierarchical structure consisting of
sections, each containing a list of bindings (either variable
assignments or subsections). A section starts with
@samp{[section-name]}.  A binding consists of a left hand side, an equal
(@samp{=}) and a right hand side (the left hand side tag must be
separated from the equal with some whitespace.) Subsections has a
@samp{@{} as the first non-whitespace character after the equal. All
other bindings are treated as variable assignments. The value of a
variable extends to the end of the line.

@example
[section1]
        a-subsection = @{
                var = value1
                other-var = value with @{@}
                sub-sub-section = @{ 
                        var = 123
                @}
        @}
        var = some other value
[section2]
        var = yet another value
@end example

In this manual, names of sections and bindings will be given as strings
separated by slashes (@samp{/}). The @samp{other-var} variable will thus
be @samp{section1/a-subsection/other-var}.

For in-depth information about the contents of the config file, refer to
the @file{krb5.conf} manual page. Some of the more important sections
are briefly described here.

The @samp{libdefaults} section contains a list of library configuration
parameters, such as the default realm and the timeout for kdc
responses. The @samp{realms} section contains information about specific
realms, such as where they hide their KDC. This section serves the same
purpose as the Kerberos 4 @file{krb.conf} file, but can contain more
information. Finally the @samp{domain_realm} section contains a list of
mappings from domains to realms, equivalent to the Kerberos 4
@file{krb.realms} file.

To continue with the realm setup, you will have to create a config file,
with contents similar to the following.

@example
[libdefaults]
        default_realm = MY.REALM
[realms]
        MY.REALM = @{
                kdc = my.kdc
        @}
[domain_realm]
        .my.domain = MY.REALM

@end example

If you use a realm name equal to your domain name, you can omit the
@samp{libdefaults}, and @samp{domain_realm}, sections. If you have a
SRV-record for your realm, or your kerberos server has CNAME called
@samp{kerberos.my.realm}, you can omit the @samp{realms} section too.

@node Creating the database, keytabs, Configuration file, Setting up a realm
@section Creating the database

The database library will look for the database in @file{/var/heimdal},
so you should probably create that directory.

The keys of all the principals are stored in the database.  If you
choose to, these can be encrypted with a master key.  You do not have to
remember this key (or password), but just to enter it once and it will
be stored in a file (@file{/var/heimdal/m-key}).  If you want to have a
master key, run @samp{kstash} to create this master key:

@example
# kstash
Master key: 
Verifying password - Master key: 
@end example

To initialise the database use the @code{kadmin} program, with the
@samp{-l} option (to enable local database mode). First issue a
@kbd{init MY.REALM} command. This will create the database and insert
default principals for that realm. You can have more than one realm in
one database, so @samp{init} does not destroy any old database.

Before creating the database, @samp{init} will ask you some questions
about max ticket lifetimes.

After creating the database you should probably add yourself to it. You
do this with the @samp{add} command. It takes as argument the name of a
principal. The principal should contain a realm, so if you haven't setup
a default realm, you will need to explicitly include the realm.

@example
# kadmin -l
kadmin> init MY.REALM
Realm max ticket life [unlimited]:
Realm max renewable ticket life [unlimited]:
kadmin> add me  
Max ticket life [unlimited]:
Max renewable life [unlimited]:
Attributes []:
Password: 
Verifying password - Password: 
@end example

Now start the KDC and try getting a ticket.

@example
# kdc &
# kinit me
me@@MY.REALMS's Password:
# klist
Credentials cache: /tmp/krb5cc_0
        Principal: me@@MY.REALM

  Issued           Expires          Principal
Aug 25 07:25:55  Aug 25 17:25:55  krbtgt/MY.REALM@@MY.REALM
@end example

If you are curious you can use the @samp{dump} command to list all the
entries in the database.  It should look something similar to the
following example (note that the entries here are truncated for
typographical reasons):

@smallexample
kadmin> dump
me@@MY.REALM 1:0:1:0b01d3cb7c293b57:-:0:7:8aec316b9d1629e3baf8 ...
kadmin/admin@@MY.REALM 1:0:1:e5c8a2675b37a443:-:0:7:cb913ebf85 ...
krbtgt/MY.REALM@@MY.REALM 1:0:1:52b53b61c875ce16:-:0:7:c8943be ...
kadmin/changepw@@MY.REALM 1:0:1:f48c8af2b340e9fb:-:0:7:e3e6088 ...
@end smallexample

@node keytabs, Remote administration, Creating the database, Setting up a realm
@section keytabs

To extract a service ticket from the database and put it in a keytab you
need to first create the principal in the database with @samp{ank}
(using the @kbd{--random-key} flag to get a random key) and then
extract it with @samp{ext_keytab}.

@example
kadmin> add --random-key host/my.host.name
Max ticket life [unlimited]:
Max renewable life [unlimited]:
Attributes []:
kadmin> ext host/my.host.name
# ktutil list
Version  Type             Principal
     1   des-cbc-md5      host/my.host.name@@MY.REALM
     1   des-cbc-md4      host/my.host.name@@MY.REALM
     1   des-cbc-crc      host/my.host.name@@MY.REALM
     1   des3-cbc-sha1    host/my.host.name@@MY.REALM
@end example

@node Remote administration, Password changing, keytabs, Setting up a realm
@section Remote administration

The administration server, @samp{kadmind}, can be started by
@samp{inetd} (which isn't recommended) or run as a normal daemon. If you
want to start it from @samp{inetd} you should add a line similar to the
one below to your @file{/etc/inetd.conf}.

@example
kerberos-adm stream     tcp     nowait  root /usr/heimdal/libexec/kadmind kadmind
@end example

You might need to add @samp{kerberos-adm} to your @file{/etc/services}
as 749/tcp.

Access to the admin server is controlled by an acl-file, (default
@file{/var/heimdal/kadmind.acl}.) The lines in the access file, has the
following syntax:
@smallexample
principal       [priv1,priv2,...]       [glob-pattern]
@end smallexample

The privileges you can assign to a principal are: @samp{add},
@samp{change-password} (or @samp{cpw} for short), @samp{delete},
@samp{get}, @samp{list}, and @samp{modify}, or the special privilege
@samp{all}. All of these roughly corresponds to the different commands
in @samp{kadmin}.

If a @var{glob-pattern} is given on a line, it restricts the right for
the principal to only apply for the subjects that match the pattern.
The patters are of the same type as those used in shell globbing, see
@url{none,,fnmatch(3)}.

In the example below @samp{lha/admin} can change every principal in the
database. @samp{jimmy/admin} can only modify principals that belong to
the realm @samp{E.KTH.SE}. @samp{mille/admin} is working at the
helpdesk, so he should only be able to change the passwords for single
component principals (ordinary users). He will not be able to change any
@samp{/admin} principal.

@example
lha/admin@@E.KTH.SE	all
jimmy/admin@@E.KTH.SE	all		*@@E.KTH.SE
jimmy/admin@@E.KTH.SE	all		*/*@@E.KTH.SE
mille/admin@@E.KTH.SE	change-password	*@@E.KTH.SE
@end example

@node Password changing, Testing clients and servers, Remote administration, Setting up a realm
@section Password changing

To allow users to change their passwords, you should run @samp{kpasswdd}.
It is not run from @samp{inetd}.

You might need to add @samp{kpasswd} to your @file{/etc/services} as
464/udp.

@subsection Password quality assurance

It is important that users have good passwords, both to make it harder
to guess them and to avoid off-line attacks (pre-authentication provides
some defense against off-line attacks).  To ensure that the users choose
good passwords, you can enable password quality controls in
@samp{kpasswdd}.  The controls themselves are done in a shared library
that is used by @samp{kpasswdd}.  To configure in these controls, add
lines similar to the following to your @file{/etc/krb5.conf}:

@example
[password_quality]
        check_library = @var{library}
        check_function = @var{function}
@end example

The function @var{function} in the shared library @var{library} will be
called for proposed new passwords.  The function should be declared as:

@example
const char *
function(krb5_context context, krb5_principal principal, krb5_data *pwd);
@end example

The function should verify that @var{pwd} is a good password for
@var{principal} and if so return @code{NULL}.  If it is deemed to be of
low quality, it should return a string explaining why that password
should not be used.

Code for a password quality checking function that uses the cracklib
library can be found in @file{kpasswd/sample_password_check.c} in the
source code distribution.  It requires the cracklib library built with
the patch available at
@url{ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krb/src/cracklib.patch}.

If no password quality checking function is configured, it is only
verified that it is at least six characters of length.

@node Testing clients and servers, Slave Servers, Password changing, Setting up a realm
@section Testing clients and servers

Now you should be able to run all the clients and servers.  Refer to the
appropriate man pages for information on how to use them.

@node Slave Servers, Incremental propagation, Testing clients and servers, Setting up a realm
@section Slave servers, Incremental propagation, Testing clients and servers, Setting up a realm

It is desirable to have at least one backup (slave) server in case the
master server fails. It is possible to have any number of such slave
servers but more than three usually doesn't buy much more redundancy.

All Kerberos servers for a realm shall have the same database so that
they present the same service to all the users.  The
@pindex hprop
@code{hprop} program, running on the master, will propagate the database
to the slaves, running
@pindex hpropd
@code{hpropd} processes.

Every slave needs a keytab with a principal,
@samp{hprop/@var{hostname}}.  Add that with the
@pindex ktutil
@code{ktutil} command and start
@pindex hpropd
@code{propd}, as follows:

@example
slave# ktutil get -p foo/admin host/`hostname`
slave# hpropd
@end example

The master will use the principal @samp{kadmin/hprop} to authenticate to
the slaves.  This principal should be added when running @kbd{kadmin -l
init} but if you do not have it in your database for whatever reason,
please add it with @kbd{kadmin -l add}.

Then run
@pindex hprop
@code{hprop} on the master:

@example
master# hprop slave
@end example

This was just an on-hands example to make sure that everything was
working properly.  Doing it manually is of course the wrong way and to
automate this you will want to start
@pindex hpropd
@code{hpropd} from @code{inetd} on the slave(s) and regularly run
@pindex hprop
@code{hprop} on the master to regularly propagate the database.
Starting the propagation once an hour from @code{cron} is probably a
good idea.

@node Incremental propagation, Salting , Slave Servers, Setting up a realm
@section Incremental propagation

There is also a newer and still somewhat experimental mechanism for
doing incremental propagation in Heimdal.  Instead of sending the whole
database regularly, it sends the changes as they happen on the master to
the slaves.  The master keeps track of all the changes by assigned a
version number to every change to the database.  The slaves know which
was the latest version they saw and in this way it can be determined if
they are in sync or not.  A log of all the changes is kept on the master
and when a slave is at an older versioner than the oldest one in the
log, the whole database has to be sent.

Protocol-wise, all the slaves connects to the master and as a greeting
tell it the latest version that they have (@samp{IHAVE} message).  The
master then responds by sending all the changes between that version and
the current version at the master (a series of @samp{FORYOU} messages)
or the whole database in a @samp{TELLYOUEVERYTHING} message.

@subsection Configuring incremental propagation

The program that runs on the master is @code{ipropd-master} and all
clients run @code{ipropd-slave}.

Create the file @file{/var/heimdal/slaves} on the master containing all
the slaves that the database should be propagated to.  Each line contains
the full name of the principal (for example
@samp{iprop/hemligare.foo.se@@FOO.SE}).

You should already have @samp{iprop/tcp} defined as 2121, in your
@file{/etc/services}.  Otherwise, or if you need to use a different port
for some peculiar reason, you can use the @kbd{--port} option.  This is
useful when you have multiple realms to distribute from one server.

Then you need to create these principals that you added in the
configuration file.  Create one @samp{iprop/hostname} for the master and
for every slave.


@example
master# /usr/heimdal/sbin/ktutil get iprop/`hostname`
@end example

The next step is to start the @code{ipropd-master} process on the master
server.  The @code{ipropd-master} listens on the UNIX-socket
@file{/var/heimdal/signal} to know when changes have been made to the
database so they can be propagated to the slaves.  There is also a
safety feature of testing the version number regularly (every 30
seconds) to see if it has been modified by some means that do not raise
this signal.  Then, start @code{ipropd-slave} on all the slaves:

@example
master# /usr/heimdal/libexec/ipropd-master &
slave#  /usr/heimdal/libexec/ipropd-slave master &
@end example

@node Salting, , Incremental propagation, Setting up a realm
@section Salting
@cindex Salting

Salting is used to make it harder to precalculate all possible
keys. Using a salt increases the search space to make it almost
impossible to precalculate all keys. In salting you just append the salt
to the password, or somehow merge the password with the salt.

In Kerberos 5 the salting is determined by the encryption-type, except
in case of @code{des}. In @code{des} there is the kerberos 4 salting
(none at all) or the afs-salting (using the cell (realm in
afs-lingo)). @code{[kadmin]default_keys} in @file{krb5.conf} controls
what salting to use,

The syntax of @code{[kadmin]default_keys} is
@samp{[etype:]salt-type[:salt-string]}. @samp{etype} is the encryption
type (des, des3, arcfour), @code{salt-type} is the type of salt (pw-salt
or afs3-salt), and the salt-string is the string that will be used as
salt (remember that if the salt is appened/prepended, the empty salt ""
is the same thing as no salt at all).

Common types of salting includes

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{v4} (or @code{des:pw-salt:})

The Kerberos 4 salting is using no salt att all. Reson there is colon
that the end is that 

@item @code{v5} (or @code{pw-salt})

@code{pw-salt} means all regular encryption-types that is regular 

@item @code{afs3-salt}

@code{afs3-salt} is the salting that is used with Transarc kaserver. Its
the cell appended to the password.
