/**
 * @page internalVSmechname Internal names and mechanism names
 * @section gssapi_api_INvsMN Name forms
 *
 * There are two forms of name in GSS-API, Internal form and
 * Contiguous string ("flat") form. gss_export_name() and
 * gss_import_name() can be used to convert between the two forms.
 *
 * - The contiguous string form is described by an oid specificing the
 *   type and an octet string. A special form of the contiguous
 *   string form is the exported name object. The exported name
 *   defined for each mechanism, is something that can be stored and
 *   complared later. The exported name is what should be used for
 *   ACLs comparisons.
 *
 * - The Internal form
 *
 *   There is also special form of the Internal Name (IN), and that is
 *   the Mechanism Name (MN). In the mechanism name all the generic
 *   information is stripped of and only contain the information for
 *   one mechanism.  In GSS-API some function return MN and some
 *   require MN as input. Each of these function is marked up as such.
 *
 *
 * Describe relationship between import_name, canonicalize_name,
 * export_name and friends.
