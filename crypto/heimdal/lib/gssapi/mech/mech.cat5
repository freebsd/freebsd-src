     The _/_e_t_c_/_g_s_s_/_m_e_c_h file contains a list of installed GSS-API security
     mechanisms.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the first
     character is '#' or it contains five fields with the following meanings:

     Name          The name of this GSS-API mechanism.

     Object identifier
                   The OID for this mechanism.

     Library       A shared library containing the implementation of this
                   mechanism.

     Kernel module (optional)
                   A kernel module containing the implementation of this mech-
                   anism (not yet supported in FreeBSD).

     Library options (optional)
                   Optionsal parameters interpreted by the mechanism. Library
                   options must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to differentiate
                   them from the optional kernel module entry.

     The _/_e_t_c_/_g_s_s_/_q_o_p file contains a list of Quality of Protection values for
     use with GSS-API.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the
     first character is '#' or it contains three fields with the following
     meanings:

     QOP string    The name of this Quality of Protection algorithm.

     QOP value     The numeric value used to select this algorithm for use
                   with GSS-API functions such as gss_get_mic(3).

     Mechanism name
                   The GSS-API mechanism name that corresponds to this algo-
                   rithm.
