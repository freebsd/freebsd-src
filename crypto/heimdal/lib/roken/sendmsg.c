/**
 * Implementation of sendmsg() for WIN32
 *
 * We are using a contrived definition of msghdr which actually uses
 * an array of ::_WSABUF structures instead of ::iovec .  This allows
 * us to call WSASend directly using the given ::msghdr instead of
 * having to allocate another array of ::_WSABUF and copying data for
 * each call.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *
 * - msg->msg_name is ignored.  So is msg->control.
 * - WSASend() only supports ::MSG_DONTROUTE, ::MSG_OOB and
 *   ::MSG_PARTIAL.
 *
 * @param[in] s The socket to use.
 * @param[in] msg The message
 * @param[in] flags Flags.  A combination of ::MSG_DONTROUTE,
 *  ::MSG_OOB and ::MSG_PARTIAL
 *
 * @return The number of bytes sent, on success.  Or -1 on error.
