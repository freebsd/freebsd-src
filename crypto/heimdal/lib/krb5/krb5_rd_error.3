.Sh DESCRIPTION
Usually applications never needs to parse and understand Kerberos
error messages since higher level functions will parse and push up the
error in the krb5_context.
These functions are described for completeness.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_rd_error
parses and returns the kerboeros error message, the structure should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_error_contents
when the caller is done with the structure.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_error
frees the content and the memory region holding the structure iself.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_error_contents
free the content of the KRB-ERROR message.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_error_from_rd_error
will parse the error message and set the error buffer in krb5_context
to the error string passed back or the matching error code in the
KRB-ERROR message.
Caller should pick up the message with
.Fn krb5_get_error_string 3
(don't forget to free the returned string with
.Fn krb5_free_error_string ) .
