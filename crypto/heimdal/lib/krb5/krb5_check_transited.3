.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn krb5_check_transited
checks the path from
.Fa client_realm
to
.Fa server_realm
where
.Fa realms
and
.Fa num_realms
is the realms between them.
If the function returns an error value,
.Fa bad_realm
will be set to the realm in the list causing the error.
.Fn krb5_check_transited
is used internally by the KDC and libkrb5 and should not be called by
client applications.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_check_transited_realms
is deprecated.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_domain_x500_encode
and
.Fn krb5_domain_x500_decode
encodes and decodes the realm names in the X500 format that Kerberos
uses to describe the transited realms in krbtgts.
