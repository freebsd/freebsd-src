.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
function verifies the initial tickets with the local keytab to make
sure the response of the KDC was spoof-ed.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
will use principal
.Fa ap_req_server
from the local keytab, if
.Dv NULL
is passed in, the code will guess the local hostname and use that to
form host/hostname/GUESSED-REALM-FOR-HOSTNAME.
.Fa creds
is the credential that
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
should verify.
If
.Fa ccache
is given
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds
stores all credentials it fetched from the KDC there, otherwise it
will use a memory credential cache that is destroyed when done.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds_opt_init
cleans the the structure, must be used before trying to pass it in to
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds_opt_set_ap_req_nofail
controls controls the behavior if
.Fa ap_req_server
doesn't exists in the local keytab or in the KDC's database, if it's
true, the error will be ignored.  Note that this use is possible
insecure.
