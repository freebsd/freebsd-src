.Dt VERIFY_KRB5_CONF 8
.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm verify_krb5_conf
.Nd checks krb5.conf for obvious errors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar [config-file]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the configuration file
.Pa krb5.conf ,
or the file given on the command line,
parses it, checking verifying that the syntax is not correctly wrong.
.Pp
If the file is syntactically correct,
.Nm
tries to verify that the contents of the file is of relevant nature.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev KRB5_CONFIG
points to the configuration file to read.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/krb5.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/krb5.conf
Kerberos 5 configuration file
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Possible output from
.Nm
include:
.Bl -tag -width "FpathF"
.It "<path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean"
Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
weird characters. The parsing done by
.Nm
is more strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that
work in real life might be reported as bad.
.It "<path>: host not found (<hostname>)"
Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
recognised as one.
.It <path>: unknown or wrong type
Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list, vice
versa, or just that
.Nm
is confused.
.It <path>: unknown entry
Means that <string> is not known by
.Nm .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr krb5.conf 5
.Sh BUGS
Since each application can put almost anything in the config file,
it's hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of
the default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that
every problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a
possible problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with
some care.
.Pp
It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
doesn't.
