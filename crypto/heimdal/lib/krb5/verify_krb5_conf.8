.Sh NAME
.Nm verify_krb5_conf
.Nd does a crude test that
.Pa krb5.conf
does not contain any obvious syntax error
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar [config-file]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the configuration file
.Pa krb5.conf ,
or the file given on the command line,
and parses it, thereby verifying that the syntax is not correctly wrong.
Since that file is read by almost all Kerberos programs but most of
them have no way of notifying the user that it could not be parsed,
this program is useful.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev KRB5_CONFIG
points to the configuration file to read.
.Sh FILES
.Xr krb5.conf 5
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr krb5.conf 5
.Sh BUGS
It should know about what variables are actually used and warn about
unknown ones.
