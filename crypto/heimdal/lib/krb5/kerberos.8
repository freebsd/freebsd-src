.Sh NAME
.Nm kerberos
.Nd introduction to the Kerberos system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Kerberos is a network authentication system. It's purpose is to
securely authenticate users and services in an insecure network
environment. 
.Pp
This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party,
keeping a database with secret keys for all users and services
(collectively called
.Em principals ) .
.Pp
Each principal belongs to exactly one 
.Em realm ,
which is the administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm usually
corresponds to an organisation, and the realm should normally be
derived from that organisation's domain name. A realm is served by one
or more Kerberos servers.
.Pp
The authentication process involves exchange of
.Sq tickets
and 
.Sq authenticators 
which together prove the principal's identity.
.Pp
When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal
system login or with the
.Xr kinit 1
program, you acquire a 
.Em ticket granting ticket
which allows you to get new tickets for other services, such as
.Ic telnet
or
.Ic ftp ,
without giving your password.
.Pp

questions see the Kerberos FAQ at

.Sh HISTORY
The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as
part of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but
version 4 was (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic
community, but is also used in commercial products like the AFS
filesystem.
.Pp
The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code
was not too well written (since it had been developed over a long
time), and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many
of these issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF
RFC1510 in 1993. Since then much work has been put into the further
development, and a new RFC will hopefully appear soon.

This manual manual page is part of the
.Nm Heimdal
Kerberos 5 distribution, which has been in development at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, since about 1997.
