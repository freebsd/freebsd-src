.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm krb5_set_real_time
sets the absolute time that the caller knows the KDC has.
With this the Kerberos library can calculate the relative
difference between the KDC time and the local system time and store it
in the
.Fa context .
With this information the Kerberos library can adjust all time stamps
in Kerberos packages.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_timeofday
returns the current time, but adjusted with the time difference
between the local host and the KDC.
.Fn krb5_us_timeofday
also returns microseconds.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_format_time
formats the time
.Fa t
into the string
.Fa s
of length
.Fa len .
If
.Fa include_time
is set, the time is set include_time.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_string_to_deltat
parses delta time
.Fa string
into
.Fa deltat .
