.Fn krb5_appdefault_time "krb5_context context" "const char *appname" "krb5_realm realm" "const char *option" "time_t def_val" "time_t *ret_val"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions get application defaults from the
.Dv appdefaults
section of the
.Xr krb5.conf 5
configuration file. These defaults can be specified per application,
and/or per realm.
.Pp
These values will be looked for in
.Xr krb5.conf 5 ,
in order of descending importance.

		option = value
	}
	option = value

.Fa appname
is the name of the application, and

resolving values.
.Fa def_val
is the value to return if no value is found in
