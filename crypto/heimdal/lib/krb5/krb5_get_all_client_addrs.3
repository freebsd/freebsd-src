.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_get_all_client_addrs ,

.Nd return local addresses
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft "krb5_error_code"
.Fn krb5_get_all_client_addrs "krb5_context context" "krb5_addresses *addrs"
.Ft "krb5_error_code"
.Fn krb5_get_all_server_addrs "krb5_context context" "krb5_addresses *addrs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions return in
.Fa addrs
a list of addresses associated with the local
host.
.Pp
The server variant returns all configured interface addresses (if
possible), including loop-back addresses. This is useful if you want
to create sockets to listen to.
.Pp
The client version will also scan local interfaces (can be turned off
by setting
.Li libdefaults/scan_interfaces
to false in
.Pa krb5.conf ) ,
but will not include loop-back addresses, unless there are no other
addresses found. It will remove all addresses included in
.Li libdefaults/ignore_addresses
but will unconditionally include addresses in
.Li libdefaults/extra_addresses .
.Pp
The returned addresses should be freed by calling
.Fn krb5_free_addresses .
