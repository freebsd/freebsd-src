.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_free_krbhst "krb5_context context" "char **hostlist"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions implement the old API to get a list of Kerberos hosts,
and are thus similar to the
.Fn krb5_krbhst_init
functions. However, since these functions returns
.Em all
hosts in one go, they potentially have to do more lookups than
necessary. These functions remain for compatibility reasons.
.Pp
After a call to one of these functions,
.Fa hostlist
is a
.Dv NULL
terminated list of strings, pointing to the requested Kerberos hosts. These should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_krbhst
when done with.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code will print the KDCs of the realm
.Dq MY.REALM .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char **hosts, **p;
krb5_get_krbhst(context, "MY.REALM", &hosts);
for(p = hosts; *p; p++)
    printf("%s\\n", *p);
krb5_free_krbhst(context, hosts);
