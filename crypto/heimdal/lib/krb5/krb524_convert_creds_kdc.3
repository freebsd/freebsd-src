.Sh NAME
.Nm krb524_convert_creds_kdc ,
.Nm krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache
.Nd converts Kerberos 5 credentials to Kerberos 4 credentials
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fo krb524_convert_creds_kdc
.Fa "krb5_context context"
.Fa "krb5_creds *in_cred"
.Fa "struct credentials *v4creds"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Convert the Kerberos 5 credential to Kerberos 4 credential.
This is done by sending them to the 524 service in the KDC.
.Pp
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc
converts the Kerberos 5 credential in
.Fa in_cred
to Kerberos 4 credential that is stored in
.Fa credentials .
.Pp
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache
is different from
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc
in that way that if
.Fa in_cred
doesn't contain a DES session key, then a new one is fetched from the
KDC and stored in the cred cache
.Fa ccache ,
and then the KDC is queried to convert the credential.
.Pp
This interfaces are used to make the migration to Kerberos 5 from
Kerberos 4 easier.
There are few services that still need Kerberos 4, and this is mainly
for compatibility for those services.
Some services, like AFS, really have Kerberos 5 supports, but still
uses the 524 interface to make the migration easier.
