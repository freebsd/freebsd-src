.Fn krb5_rd_safe "krb5_context context" "krb5_auth_context auth_context" "const krb5_data *inbuf" "krb5_data *outbuf" "krb5_replay_data *outdata"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn krb5_rd_safe
and
.Fn krb5_rd_priv
parses
.Li KRB-SAFE
and
.Li KRB-PRIV
messages (as generated by
.Xr krb5_mk_safe 3
and
.Xr krb5_mk_priv 3 )
from
.Fa inbuf
and verifies its integrity. The user data part of the message in put
in
.Fa outbuf .
The encryption state, including keyblocks and addresses, is taken from
.Fa auth_context .
If the
.Dv KRB5_AUTH_CONTEXT_RET_SEQUENCE
or
.Dv KRB5_AUTH_CONTEXT_RET_TIME
flags are set in the
.Fa auth_context
the sequence number and time are returned in the
.Fa outdata
parameter.
