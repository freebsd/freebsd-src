     ffttpp is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Proto-
     col.  The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     The last five arguments will fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP proto-
     cols, or by direct copying, into the current directory.  This is ideal
     for scripts.  Refer to _A_U_T_O_-_F_E_T_C_H_I_N_G _F_I_L_E_S below for more information.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter-
     preter.

     --44       Forces ffttpp to only use IPv4 addresses.

     --66       Forces ffttpp to only use IPv6 addresses.

     --AA       Force active mode ftp.  By default, ffttpp will try to use passive
              mode ftp and fall back to active mode if passive is not support-
              ed by the server.  This option causes ffttpp to always use an ac-
              tive connection.  It is only useful for connecting to very old
              servers that do not implement passive mode properly.

     --aa       Causes ffttpp to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anony-
              mous login instead.

     --dd       Enables debugging.

     --ee       Disables command line editing.  This is useful for Emacs ange-
              ftp mode.

     --ff       Forces a cache reload for transfers that go through the FTP or
              HTTP proxies.

     --gg       Disables file name globbing.

     --ii       Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     --nn       Restrains ffttpp from attempting ``auto-login'' upon initial con-
              nection.  If auto-login is enabled, ffttpp will check the _._n_e_t_r_c
              (see below) file in the user's home directory for an entry de-
              scribing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists,
              ffttpp will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is
              the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary,
              prompt for a password and an account with which to login.

     --NN _n_e_t_r_c
              Use _n_e_t_r_c instead of _~_/_._n_e_t_r_c.  Refer to _T_H_E _._n_e_t_r_c _F_I_L_E for
              more information.

     --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t
              When auto-fetching files, save the contents in _o_u_t_p_u_t.  _o_u_t_p_u_t
              is parsed according to the _F_I_L_E _N_A_M_I_N_G _C_O_N_V_E_N_T_I_O_N_S below.  If
              _o_u_t_p_u_t is not `-' or doesn't start with `|', then only the first
              file specified will be retrieved into _o_u_t_p_u_t; all other files
              will be retrieved into the basename of their remote name.

     --pp       Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filter-
              ing firewalls.  This option has been deprecated as ffttpp now tries
              to use passive mode by default, falling back to active mode if
              the server does not support passive connections.

     --PP _p_o_r_t  Sets the port number to _p_o_r_t.

     --rr _w_a_i_t  Retry the connection attempt if it failed, pausing for _w_a_i_t sec-
              onds.

     --RR       Restart all non-proxied auto-fetches.

     --tt       Enables packet tracing.

     --TT _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n,_m_a_x_i_m_u_m[,_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t]
              Set the maximum transfer rate for _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n to _m_a_x_i_m_u_m
              bytes/second, and if specified, the increment to _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t
              bytes/second.  Refer to rraattee for more information.

     --uu _u_r_l _f_i_l_e [...]
              Upload files on the command line to _u_r_l where _u_r_l is one of the
              ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an optional tar-
              get filename for single file uploads), and _f_i_l_e is one or more
              local files to be uploaded.

     --vv       Enable vveerrbboossee and pprrooggrreessss.  This is the default if output is
              to a terminal (and in the case of pprrooggrreessss, ffttpp is the fore-
              ground process).  Forces ffttpp to show all responses from the re-
              mote server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     --VV       Disable vveerrbboossee and pprrooggrreessss, overriding the default of enabled
              when output is to a terminal.

     The client host with which ffttpp is to communicate may be specified on the
     command line.  If this is done, ffttpp will immediately attempt to establish
     a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ffttpp will enter its
     command interpreter and await instructions from the user.  When ffttpp is
     awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp>' is provided to the us-
     er.  The following commands are recognized by ffttpp:

     !! [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_s]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $$ _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e [_a_r_g_s]
                 Execute the macro _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e that was defined with the mmaaccddeeff
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     aaccccoouunntt [_p_a_s_s_w_d]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     aappppeenndd _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any nnttrraannss
                 or nnmmaapp setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 ttyyppee, ffoorrmmaatt, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree.

     aasscciiii       Set the file transfer ttyyppee to network ASCII.  This is the de-
                 fault type.

     bbeellll        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com-
                 mand is completed.

     bbiinnaarryy      Set the file transfer ttyyppee to support binary image transfer.

     bbyyee         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ffttpp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and ex-
                 it.

     ccaassee        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during ggeett,
                 mmggeett and mmppuutt commands.  When ccaassee is on (default is off),
                 remote computer file names with all letters in upper case are
                 written in the local directory with the letters mapped to
                 lower case.

     ccdd _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to _r_e_m_o_t_e_-
                 _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     ccdduupp        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     cchhmmoodd _m_o_d_e _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e
                 Change the permission modes of the file _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e on the
                 remote system to _m_o_d_e.

     cclloossee       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     ccrr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file re-
                 trieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When ccrr is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line-
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when ccrr is
                 off.

     ddeebbuugg [_d_e_b_u_g_-_v_a_l_u_e]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional _d_e_b_u_g_-_v_a_l_u_e is speci-
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ffttpp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string `-->'

     ddeelleettee _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e
                 Delete the file _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e on the remote machine.

     ddiirr [_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_p_a_t_h [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa-
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
                 If _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_p_a_t_h is left unspecified, the current working di-
                 rectory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, ffttpp will
                 prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed
                 the target local file for receiving ddiirr output.  If no local
                 file is specified, or if _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e is `--', the output is
                 sent to the terminal.

     ddiissccoonnnneecctt  A synonym for cclloossee.

     eeddiitt        Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command
                 and file completion.  This is automatically enabled if input
                 is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

     eeppssvv44       Toggle the use of the extended EPSV and EPRT commands on IPv4
                 connections; first try EPSV / EPRT, and then PASV / PORT.
                 This is enabled by default.  If an extended command fails
                 then this option will be temporarily disabled for the dura-
                 tion of the current connection, or until eeppssvv44 is executed
                 again.

     eexxiitt        A synonym for bbyyee.

     ffeeaattuurreess    Display what features the remote server supports (using the
                 FEAT command).

     ffggeett _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e
                 Retrieve the files listed in _l_o_c_a_l_f_i_l_e, which has one line
                 per filename.

     ffoorrmm _f_o_r_m_a_t
                 Set the file transfer ffoorrmm to _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The default (and only
                 supported) format is ``non-print''.

     ffttpp _h_o_s_t [_p_o_r_t]
                 A synonym for ooppeenn.

     ggaattee [_h_o_s_t [_p_o_r_t]]
                 Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS
                 FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies.  This will not be permitted if
                 the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the
                 user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If _h_o_s_t
                 is given, then gate-ftp mode will be enabled, and the gate-
                 ftp server will be set to _h_o_s_t.  If _p_o_r_t is also given, that
                 will be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp serv-
                 er.

     ggeett _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e [_l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e]
                 Retrieve the _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current ccaassee, nnttrraannss, and nnmmaapp settings.  The current
                 settings for ttyyppee, ffoorrmm, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree are used while
                 transferring the file.

     gglloobb        Toggle filename expansion for mmddeelleettee, mmggeett, mmppuutt, and
                 mmrreeggeett.  If globbing is turned off with gglloobb, the file name
                 arguments are taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for
                 mmppuutt is done as in csh(1).  For mmddeelleettee, mmggeett, and mmrreeggeett,
                 each remote file name is expanded separately on the remote
                 machine and the lists are not merged.  Expansion of a direc-
                 tory name is likely to be different from expansion of the
                 name of an ordinary file: the exact result depends on the
                 foreign operating system and ftp server, and can be previewed
                 by doing `mls remote-files -' Note: mmggeett, mmppuutt and mmrreeggeett are
                 not meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files.
                 That can be done by transferring a tar(1) archive of the sub-
                 tree (in binary mode).

     hhaasshh [_s_i_z_e]
                 Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans-
                 ferred.  The size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes.
                 This can be changed by specifying _s_i_z_e in bytes.  Enabling
                 hhaasshh disables pprrooggrreessss.

     hheellpp [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.
                 If no argument is given, ffttpp prints a list of the known com-
                 mands.

     iiddllee [_s_e_c_o_n_d_s]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to _s_e_c_o_n_d_s sec-
                 onds.  If _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is omitted, the current inactivity timer is

     mmaaccddeeff _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 _m_a_c_r_o_-_n_a_m_e; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined un-
                 til a cclloossee command is executed.  The macro processor inter-
                 prets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed by a
                 number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument
                 on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' followed by an
                 `i' signals that macro processor that the executing macro is
                 to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is replaced by the
                 first argument on the macro invocation command line, on the
                 second pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on.
                 A `\' followed by any character is replaced by that charac-
                 ter.  Use the `\' to prevent special treatment of the `$'.

                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands issued without a specified re-
                 mote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mmggeett commands and ggeett commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com-
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n and _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
                 [_I_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the nnttrraannss and ccaassee
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to de-
                 termine the nnmmaapp [_i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n] variable values.  For example,
                 given _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n determines the resulting mapped file-
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n template.  The se-
                 quence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Additional-
                 ly, the sequence `[_s_e_q_1, _s_e_q_2]' is replaced by [_s_e_q_1] if _s_e_q_1
                 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by _s_e_q_2.  For
                 example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file-
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the in-
                 put filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[',']', and `,' characters.

     nnttrraannss [_i_n_c_h_a_r_s [_o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans-
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char-
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mmppuutt com-
                 mands and ppuutt commands issued without a specified remote tar-
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in lo-
                 cal filenames are translated during mmggeett commands and ggeett
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in _i_n_c_h_a_r_s are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s.  If
                 the character's position in _i_n_c_h_a_r_s is longer than the length
                 of _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s, the character is deleted from the file name.

     ooppeenn _h_o_s_t [_p_o_r_t]
                 Establish a connection to the specified _h_o_s_t FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ffttpp will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the aauuttoo--
                 llooggiinn option is on (default), ffttpp will also attempt to auto-
                 matically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     ppaassssiivvee [aauuttoo]
                 Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If aauuttoo is
                 given, act as if FTPMODE is set to `auto'.  If passive mode
                 is turned on (default), ffttpp will send a PASV command for all
                 data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command
                 requests that the remote server open a port for the data con-
                 nection and return the address of that port.  The remote
                 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
                 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis-
                 tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
                 who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
                 ffttpp through a gateway router or host that controls the direc-
                 tionality of traffic.  (Note that though FTP servers are re-
                 quired to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote FTP

                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process-

                 Throttle the maximum transfer rate to _m_a_x_i_m_u_m bytes/second.
                 If _m_a_x_i_m_u_m is 0, disable the throttle.

                       SIGUSR2  Decrement _m_a_x_i_m_u_m by _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t bytes.  The re-
                                sult must be a positive number.

                 rreeggeett acts like ggeett, except that if _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e exists and is
                 smaller than _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e, _l_o_c_a_l_-_f_i_l_e is presumed to be a par-
                 tially transferred copy of _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_f_i_l_e and the transfer is
                 continued from the apparent point of failure.  This command
                 is useful when transferring very large files over networks
                 that are prone to dropping connections.

                 _o_p_t_i_o_n_s (whose absence is handled on a command-specific ba-
                 sis).  Remote FTP commands known to support options include:

     rreennaammee [_f_r_o_m [_t_o]]
                 Rename the file _f_r_o_m on the remote machine, to the file _t_o.

     rreesseett       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes command/re-
                 ply sequencing with the remote FTP server.  Resynchronization
                 may be necessary following a violation of the FTP protocol by
                 the remote server.

     rruunniiqquuee     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique file-
                 names.  If a file already exists with a name equal to the
                 target local filename for a ggeett or mmggeett command, a ".1" is
                 appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches another
                 existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
                 this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
                 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generated
                 unique filename will be reported.  Note that rruunniiqquuee will not
                 affect local files generated from a shell command (see be-
                 low).  The default value is off.

     sseennddppoorrtt    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, ffttpp will at-
                 tempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connection
                 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT
                 command fails, ffttpp will use the default data port.  When the
                 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
                 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for
                 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
                 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     sseett [_o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e]

                 (and only supported) structure is ``file''.

     ssuunniiqquuee     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file
                 names.  The remote FTP server must support FTP protocol STOU
                 command for successful completion.  The remote server will
                 report unique name.  Default value is off.

     ttyyppee [_t_y_p_e_-_n_a_m_e]
                 Set the file transfer ttyyppee to _t_y_p_e_-_n_a_m_e.  If no type is spec-
                 ified, the current type is printed.  The default type is net-
                 work ASCII.

     uummaasskk [_n_e_w_m_a_s_k]
                 Set the default umask on the remote server to _n_e_w_m_a_s_k.  If
                 _n_e_w_m_a_s_k is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     uunnsseett _o_p_t_i_o_n
                 Unset _o_p_t_i_o_n.  Refer to sseett for more information.

     uussaaggee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

                 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d
                 is not specified and the server requires it, ffttpp will prompt
                 the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an _a_c_c_o_u_n_t
                 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
                 user will be prompted for it.  If an _a_c_c_o_u_n_t field is speci-
                 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
                 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
                 did not require it for logging in.  Unless ffttpp is invoked
                 with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done automati-
                 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     vveerrbboossee     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the
                 FTP server are displayed to the user.  In addition, if ver-
                 bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics re-
                 garding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By de-
                 fault, verbose is on.

     xxffeerrbbuuff _s_i_z_e
                 Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to _s_i_z_e.

     ?? [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                 A synonym for hheellpp.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote `"'
     marks.

     Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit oonn or ooffff argument to
     force the setting appropriately.

     Commands which take a byte count as an argument (e.g., hhaasshh, rraattee, and
     xxffeerrbbuuff) support an optional suffix on the argument which changes the in-
     terpretation of the argument.  Supported suffixes are:
           b    Causes no modification. (Optional)
           k    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
           m    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
           g    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824

     If ffttpp receives a SIGINFO (see the ``status'' argument of stty(1)) or
     SIGQUIT signal whilst a transfer is in progress, the current transfer
     rate statistics will be written to the standard error output, in the same
     format as the standard completion message.

AAUUTTOO--FFEETTCCHHIINNGG FFIILLEESS
     In addition to standard commands, this version of ffttpp supports an auto-
     fetch feature.  To enable auto-fetch, simply pass the list of host-
     names/files on the command line.

     The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:

     [user@]host:[path][/]
           ``Classic'' FTP format.

           If _p_a_t_h contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see
           gglloobb), then the equivalent of `mget path' is performed.

           If the directory component of _p_a_t_h contains no globbing characters,
           it is stored locally with the name basename (see basename(1)) of
           ppaatthh, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote name is
           used as the local name, relative to the local root directory.

     ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]
           An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if sseett ffttpp__pprrooxxyy isn't
           defined.  Otherwise, transfer the URL using HTTP via the proxy de-
           fined in sseett ffttpp__pprrooxxyy.  If sseett ffttpp__pprrooxxyy isn't defined and _u_s_e_r is
           given, login as _u_s_e_r.  In this case, use _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d if supplied, oth-
           erwise prompt the user for one.

           In order to be compliant with RRFFCC 11773388, ffttpp strips the leading `/'
           from _p_a_t_h, resulting in a transfer relative from the default login
           directory of the user.  If the _/ directory is required, use a lead-
           ing path of ``%2F''.  If a user's home directory is required (and
           the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading path of
           ``%7Euser/''.  For example, to retrieve _/_e_t_c_/_m_o_t_d from `localhost'
           as the user `myname' with the password `mypass', use
           ``ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd''

           If a suffix of `;type=A' or `;type=I' is supplied, then the trans-
           fer type will take place as ascii or binary (respectively).  The
           default transfer type is binary.

     http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path
           An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol.  If sseett hhttttpp__pprrooxxyy
           is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy server.  If HTTP
           authorisation is required to retrieve _p_a_t_h, and `user' (and option-
           ally `password') is in the URL, use them for the first attempt to
           authenticate.

     file:///path
           A local URL, copied from _/_p_a_t_h.

     Unless noted otherwise above, and --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t is not given, the file is
     stored in the current directory as the basename(1) of _p_a_t_h.

     If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing `/' or an empty
     _p_a_t_h component, then ffttpp will connect to the site and ccdd to the directory
     given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode ready for fur-
     ther input.  This will not work if sseett ffttpp__pprrooxxyy is being used.

     Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use
     HTTP 1.0.

     If --RR is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP prox-
     ies will be restarted.  For FTP, this is implemented by using rreeggeett in-
     stead of ggeett.  For HTTP, this is implemented by using the `Range: bytes='
     HTTP/1.1 directive.

     If WWW or proxy WWW authentication is required, you will be prompted to
     enter a username and password to authenticate with.

     When specifying IPv6 numeric addresses in a URL, you need to surround the
     address in square brackets.  E.g.: ``ftp://[::1]:21/''.  This is because
     colons are used in IPv6 numeric address as well as being the separator
     for the port number.

     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-
     C).  Sending transfers will be immediately halted.  Receiving transfers
     will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR command to the remote
     server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which
     this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR
     processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, the
     prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.

     If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst ffttpp is awaiting a
     reply from the remote server for the ABOR processing, then the connection
     will be closed.  This is different from the traditional behaviour (which
     ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more
     useful.

     Files specified as arguments to ffttpp commands are processed according to
     the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `--' is specified, the _s_t_d_i_n (for reading) or _s_t_d_o_u_t
          (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the
          argument is interpreted as a shell command.  ffttpp then forks a shell,
          using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
          the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argu-
          ment must be quoted; e.g.  ``"| ls -lt"''.  A particularly useful
          example of this mechanism is: ``dir "" |more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file
          names are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); c.f.
          the gglloobb command.  If the ffttpp command expects a single local file
          (e.g.  ppuutt), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" op-
          eration is used.

     4.   For mmggeett commands and ggeett commands with unspecified local file
          names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be al-
          tered by a ccaassee, nnttrraannss, or nnmmaapp setting.  The resulting filename
          may then be altered if rruunniiqquuee is on.

     5.   For mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands with unspecified remote file
          names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be al-
          tered by a nnttrraannss or nnmmaapp setting.  The resulting filename may then
          be altered by the remote server if ssuunniiqquuee is on.

FFIILLEE TTRRAANNSSFFEERR PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.  The ttyyppee may be one of ``ascii'', ``image'' (binary),
     ``ebcdic'', and ``local byte size'' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).
     ffttpp supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte
     size 8 for tteenneexx mode transfers.

     ffttpp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer pa-
     rameters: mmooddee, ffoorrmm, and ssttrruucctt.

TTHHEE ..nneettrrcc FFIILLEE
     The _._n_e_t_r_c file contains login and initialization information used by the
     auto-login process.  It resides in the user's home directory, unless
     overridden with the --NN _n_e_t_r_c option, or specified in the NETRC environ-
     ment variable.  The following tokens are recognized; they may be separat-
     ed by spaces, tabs, or new-lines:

     mmaacchhiinnee _n_a_m_e
               Identify a remote machine _n_a_m_e.  The auto-login process search-
               es the _._n_e_t_r_c file for a mmaacchhiinnee token that matches the remote
               machine specified on the ffttpp command line or as an ooppeenn command
               argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent _._n_e_t_r_c tokens
               are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or an-
               other mmaacchhiinnee or a ddeeffaauulltt token is encountered.

     ddeeffaauulltt   This is the same as mmaacchhiinnee _n_a_m_e except that ddeeffaauulltt matches
               any name.  There can be only one ddeeffaauulltt token, and it must be
               after all mmaacchhiinnee tokens.  This is normally used as:

                     default login anonymous password user@site

               thereby giving the user an automatic anonymous FTP login to ma-
               chines not specified in _._n_e_t_r_c.  This can be overridden by us-
               ing the --nn flag to disable auto-login.

     llooggiinn _n_a_m_e
               Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is pre-
               sent, the auto-login process will initiate a login using the
               specified _n_a_m_e.

     ppaasssswwoorrdd _s_t_r_i_n_g
               Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
               process will supply the specified string if the remote server
               requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
               this token is present in the _._n_e_t_r_c file for any user other
               than _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s, ffttpp will abort the auto-login process if the
               _._n_e_t_r_c is readable by anyone besides the user.

     aaccccoouunntt _s_t_r_i_n_g
               Supply an additional account password.  If this token is pre-
               sent, the auto-login process will supply the specified string
               if the remote server requires an additional account password,
               or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it
               does not.

     mmaaccddeeff _n_a_m_e
               Define a macro.  This token functions like the ffttpp mmaaccddeeff com-
               mand functions.  A macro is defined with the specified name;
               its contents begin with the next _._n_e_t_r_c line and continue until
               a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.
               If a macro named iinniitt is defined, it is automatically executed
               as the last step in the auto-login process.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE EEDDIITTIINNGG
     ffttpp supports interactive command line editing, via the editline(3) li-
     brary.  It is enabled with the eeddiitt command, and is enabled by default if
     input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and edited with the
     arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as well.

     The editline(3) library is configured with a _._e_d_i_t_r_c file - refer to
     editrc(5) for more information.

     An extra key binding is available to ffttpp to provide context sensitive
     command and filename completion (including remote file completion).  To
     use this, bind a key to the editline(3) command ffttpp--ccoommpplleettee.  By de-
     fault, this is bound to the TAB key.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE PPRROOMMPPTT
     By default, ffttpp displays a command line prompt of ``ftp>'' to the user.
     This can be changed with the sseett pprroommpptt command.

     A prompt can be displayed on the right side of the screen (after the com-
     mand input) with the sseett rrpprroommpptt command.

     The following formatting sequences are replaced by the given information:

           %/   The current remote working directory.

           %c[[0]_n], %.[[0]_n]
                The trailing component of the current remote working directo-
                ry, or _n trailing components if a digit _n is given.  If _n be-
                gins with `0', the number of skipped components precede the
                trailing component(s) in the format ``/_<_s_k_i_p_p_e_d_>trailing''
                (for `%c') or ``...trailing'' (for `%.').

           %M   The remote host name.

           %m   The remote host name, up to the first `.'.

           %n   The remote user name.

           %%   A single `%'.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     ffttpp uses the following environment variables.

     FTPANONPASS    Password to send in an anonymous FTP transfer.  Defaults
                    to ```whoami`@''.

     FTPMODE        Overrides the default operation mode.  Support values are:

                    active   active mode FTP only

                    auto     automatic determination of passive or active
                             (this is the default)

                    passive  passive mode FTP only

     FTPPROMPT      Command-line prompt to use.  Defaults to ``ftp>''.  Refer
                    to _C_O_M_M_A_N_D _L_I_N_E _P_R_O_M_P_T for more information.

     FTPRPROMPT     Command-line right side prompt to use.  Defaults to ``''.
                    Refer to _C_O_M_M_A_N_D _L_I_N_E _P_R_O_M_P_T for more information.

     FTPSERVER      Host to use as gate-ftp server when ggaattee is enabled.

     FTPSERVERPORT  Port to use when connecting to gate-ftp server when ggaattee
                    is enabled.  Default is port returned by a ggeettsseerrvvbbyynnaammee()
                    lookup of ``ftpgate/tcp''.

     HOME           For default location of a _._n_e_t_r_c file, if one exists.

     NETRC          An alternate location of the _._n_e_t_r_c file.

     PAGER          Used by various commands to display files.  Defaults to
                    more(1) if empty or not set.

     SHELL          For default shell.

     ftp_proxy      URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests (if
                    not defined, use the standard FTP protocol).

                    _N_O_T_E: this is not used for interactive sessions, only for
                    command-line fetches.

     http_proxy     URL of HTTP proxy to use when making HTTP URL requests.
                    If proxy authentication is required and there is a user-
                    name and password in this URL, they will automatically be
                    used in the first attempt to authenticate to the proxy.

                    Note that the use of a username and password in ftp_proxy
                    and http_proxy may be incompatible with other programs
                    that use it (such as lynx(1)).

                    _N_O_T_E: this is not used for interactive sessions, only for
                    command-line fetches.

     no_proxy       A space or comma separated list of hosts (or domains) for
                    which proxying is not to be used.  Each entry may have an
                    optional trailing ":port", which restricts the matching to
                    connections to that port.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ffttpp command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Various features such as command line editing, context sensitive command
     and file completion, dynamic progress bar, automatic fetching of files
     and URLs, modification time preservation, transfer rate throttling, con-
     figurable command line prompt, and other enhancements over the standard
     BSD ffttpp were implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke Mewburn
     <lukem@netbsd.org>.

     IPv6 support was added by the WIDE/KAME project (but may not be present
     in all non-NetBSD versions of this program, depending if the operating
     system supports IPv6 in a similar manner to KAME).

BBUUGGSS
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
     remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode
     transfer code has been corrected.  This correction may result in incor-
     rect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii
     type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.

     ffttpp assumes that all IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv6 addresses with a form
     like ::ffff:10.1.1.1) indicate IPv4 destinations which can be handled by
     AF_INET sockets.  However, in certain IPv6 network configurations, this
     assumption is not true.  In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses
     must be passed to AF_INET6 sockets directly.  For example, if your site
     uses a SIIT translator for IPv6-to-IPv4 translation, ffttpp is unable to
     support your configuration.
