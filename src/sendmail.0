DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       SSeennddmmaaiill sends a message to one or more _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_s_, routing the message
       over whatever networks are necessary.  SSeennddmmaaiill does internetwork  for-
       warding as necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.

       SSeennddmmaaiill  is  not  intended as a user interface routine; other programs
       provide user-friendly front ends; sseennddmmaaiill is used only to deliver pre-
       formatted messages.

       With  no  flags, sseennddmmaaiill reads its standard input up to an end-of-file
       or a line consisting only of a single dot and sends a copy of the  mes-
       sage  found  there  to  all of the addresses listed.  It determines the
       network(s) to use based on the syntax and contents of the addresses.

       Local addresses are looked up in  a  file  and  aliased  appropriately.
       Aliasing  can  be  prevented by preceding the address with a backslash.
       Beginning with 8.10, the sender is included in  any  alias  expansions,
       e.g.,  if  `john'  sends to `group', and `group' includes `john' in the
       expansion, then the letter will also be delivered to `john'.

   PPaarraammeetteerrss
       --AAcc    Use submit.cf even if the operation mode does  not  indicate  an
              initial mail submission.

       --AAmm    Use  sendmail.cf even if the operation mode indicates an initial
              mail submission.

       --BB_t_y_p_e Set the body type to _t_y_p_e.  Current legal  values  are  7BIT  or
              8BITMIME.

       --bbaa    Go  into  ARPANET  mode.  All input lines must end with a CR-LF,
              and all messages will be generated with  a  CR-LF  at  the  end.
              Also,  the ``From:'' and ``Sender:'' fields are examined for the
              name of the sender.

       --bbdd    Run as a daemon.  SSeennddmmaaiill will fork and run in background  lis-
              tening on socket 25 for incoming SMTP connections.  This is nor-
              mally run from /etc/rc.

       --bbDD    Same as --bbdd except runs in foreground.

       --bbhh    Print the persistent host status database.

       --bbHH    Purge expired entries from the persistent host status  database.

       --bbii    Initialize the alias database.

       --bbmm    Deliver mail in the usual way (default).

       --bbpp    Print a listing of the queue(s).

       --bbPP    Print  number  of  entries  in the queue(s); only available with
              shared memory support.

       --bbss    Use the SMTP protocol as described in RFC821 on  standard  input
              and  output.   This  flag  implies all the operations of the --bbaa
              flag that are compatible with SMTP.

       --bbtt    Run in address test mode.  This mode reads addresses  and  shows
              the  steps  in  parsing;  it is used for debugging configuration
              tables.

       --bbvv    Verify names only - do not try to collect or deliver a  message.
              Verify  mode  is  normally  used for validating users or mailing
              lists.

       --CC_f_i_l_e Use  alternate  configuration  file.   SSeennddmmaaiill  gives  up   any
              enhanced  (set-user-ID  or set-group-ID) privileges if an alter-
              nate configuration file is specified.

       --DD _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
              Send debugging output to the indicated log file instead of  std-
              out.

       --dd_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y.._l_e_v_e_l_._._.
              Set  the  debugging  flag  for  _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y  to _l_e_v_e_l.  _C_a_t_e_g_o_r_y is
              either an integer or a name specifying the topic, and  _l_e_v_e_l  an
              integer  specifying  the  level  of  debugging  output  desired.
              Higher levels generally mean more output.  More  than  one  flag
              can  be  specified  by  separating  them with commas.  A list of
              numeric debugging categories can be found in the TRACEFLAGS file
              in the sendmail source distribution.
              The  option --dd00..11 prints the version of sseennddmmaaiill and the options
              it was compiled with.
              Most other categories are only useful with, and  documented  in,
              sseennddmmaaiill's source code.

       --FF_f_u_l_l_n_a_m_e
              Set the full name of the sender.

       --ff_n_a_m_e Sets  the name of the ``from'' person (i.e., the envelope sender
              of the mail).  This address may also be used in the From: header
              if  that header is missing during initial submission.  The enve-
              lope sender address is used as the recipient for delivery status
              notifications  and may also appear in a Return-Path: header.  --ff
              should only be used by ``trusted'' users (normally _r_o_o_t, _d_a_e_m_o_n,
              and  _n_e_t_w_o_r_k)  or  if the person you are trying to become is the
              same as the person you  are.   Otherwise,  an  X-Authentication-
              Warning header will be added to the message.

       --GG     Relay  (gateway) submission of a message, e.g., when rrmmaaiill calls
              sseennddmmaaiill ..

       --hh_N    Set the hop count to _N.  The hop count is incremented every time
              the  mail  is  processed.   When it reaches a limit, the mail is
              returned with an error message, the victim of an aliasing  loop.
              If  not  specified,  ``Received:''  lines  in  the  message  are
              counted.

       --ii     Do not strip a leading dot from lines in incoming messages,  and
              do not treat a dot on a line by itself as the end of an incoming
              message.  This should be set if you  are  reading  data  from  a
              file.

       --LL _t_a_g Set  the identifier used in syslog messages to the supplied _t_a_g.

       --NN _d_s_n Set delivery status notification conditions to _d_s_n, which can be
              `never'  for  no  notifications or a comma separated list of the
              values `failure' to be notified if delivery failed,  `delay'  to
              be notified if delivery is delayed, and `success' to be notified
              when the message is successfully delivered.

       --nn     Don't do aliasing.

       --OO _o_p_t_i_o_n=_v_a_l_u_e
              Set option _o_p_t_i_o_n to the specified _v_a_l_u_e.  This form  uses  long
              names.  See below for more details.

       --oo_x _v_a_l_u_e
              Set  option  _x  to  the  specified _v_a_l_u_e.  This form uses single
              character names only.  The short names are not described in this
              manual  page;  see the _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n _a_n_d _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e
              for details.

       --pp_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
              Set the name of the protocol used to receive the message.   This
              can be a simple protocol name such as ``UUCP'' or a protocol and
              hostname, such as ``UUCP:ucbvax''.

       --qq[_t_i_m_e]
              Process saved messages in the queue at given intervals.  If _t_i_m_e
              is  omitted,  process the queue once.  _T_i_m_e is given as a tagged
              number, with `s' being seconds, `m' being minutes (default), `h'
              being  hours, `d' being days, and `w' being weeks.  For example,
              `-q1h30m' or `-q90m' would both set  the  timeout  to  one  hour
              thirty  minutes.   By  default,  sseennddmmaaiill  will run in the back-
              ground.  This option can be used safely with --bbdd.

       --qqpp[_t_i_m_e]
              Similar to --qq_t_i_m_e, except that instead of periodically forking a
              child  to  process the queue, sendmail forks a single persistent
              child for each queue  that  alternates  between  processing  the
              queue and sleeping.  The sleep time is given as the argument; it
              defaults to 1 second.  The process will always sleep at least  5
              seconds if the queue was empty in the previous queue run.

       --qqf    Process  saved messages in the queue once and do not fork(), but
              run in the foreground.

       --qqG_n_a_m_e
              Process jobs in queue group called _n_a_m_e only.

       --qq[_!]I_s_u_b_s_t_r
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as  a  substring
              of the queue id or not when _!  is specified.

       --qq[_!]Q_s_u_b_s_t_r
              Limit  processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as a
              substring of the quarantine reason or not when _!  is  specified.

       --qq[_!]R_s_u_b_s_t_r
              Limit  processed  jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as a substring
              of one of the recipients or not when _!  is specified.

       --qq[_!]S_s_u_b_s_t_r
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r as  a  substring
              of the sender or not when _!  is specified.

       --QQ[reason]
              Quarantine a normal queue items with the given reason or unquar-
              antine quarantined queue items if  no  reason  is  given.   This
              should  only  be  used  with some sort of item matching using as
              described above.

       --RR _r_e_t_u_r_n
              Set the amount of the message to  be  returned  if  the  message
              bounces.   The  _r_e_t_u_r_n  parameter  can  be  `full' to return the
              entire message or `hdrs' to return only  the  headers.   In  the
              latter case also local bounces return only the headers.

       --rr_n_a_m_e An alternate and obsolete form of the --ff flag.

       --tt     Read  message  for recipients.  To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines will be
              scanned for recipient addresses.  The Bcc: line will be  deleted
              before transmission.

       --VV _e_n_v_i_d
              Set the original envelope id.  This is propagated across SMTP to
              servers that support DSNs and is returned in DSN-compliant error
              messages.

       --vv     Go  into verbose mode.  Alias expansions will be announced, etc.

       --XX _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
              Log all traffic in and out of mailers in the indicated log file.
              This  should  only be used as a last resort for debugging mailer
              bugs.  It will log a lot of data very quickly.

       ----     Stop processing command flags and use the rest of the  arguments
              as addresses.

   OOppttiioonnss
       There  are  also  a number of processing options that may be set.  Nor-
       mally these will only be used by a system administrator.   Options  may
       be  set either on the command line using the --oo flag (for short names),
       the --OO flag (for long names), or in the configuration file.  This is  a
       partial  list  limited to those options that are likely to be useful on
       the command line and only shows the long names;  for  a  complete  list
       (and  details),  consult the _S_e_n_d_m_a_i_l _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n _a_n_d _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e.
       The options are:

       AliasFile=_f_i_l_e
              Use alternate alias file.

       HoldExpensive
              On mailers that are  considered  ``expensive''  to  connect  to,
              don't initiate immediate connection.  This requires queueing.

       CheckpointInterval=_N
              Checkpoint  the  queue  file after every _N successful deliveries
              (default 10).  This avoids excessive duplicate  deliveries  when
              sending to long mailing lists interrupted by system crashes.

       DeliveryMode=_x
              Set the delivery mode to _x.  Delivery modes are `i' for interac-
              tive (synchronous) delivery, `b' for  background  (asynchronous)
              delivery, `q' for queue only - i.e., actual delivery is done the
              next time the queue is run, and `d' for deferred - the  same  as
              `q'  except that database lookups for maps which have set the -D
              option (default for the host map) are avoided.

       ErrorMode=_x
              Set error processing to mode _x.  Valid modes  are  `m'  to  mail
              back  the error message, `w' to ``write'' back the error message
              (or mail it back if the sender is not logged in), `p'  to  print
              the  errors  on  the terminal (default), `q' to throw away error
              messages (only exit status is returned), and `e' to  do  special
              processing  for  the BerkNet.  If the text of the message is not
              mailed back by modes `m' or `w' and if the sender  is  local  to
              this  machine,  a  copy  of  the message is appended to the file
              _d_e_a_d_._l_e_t_t_e_r in the sender's home directory.

       SaveFromLine
              Save UNIX-style From lines at the front of messages.

       MaxHopCount=_N
              The maximum number of times a  message  is  allowed  to  ``hop''
              before we decide it is in a loop.

       IgnoreDots
              Do  not  take dots on a line by themselves as a message termina-
              tor.

       SendMimeErrors
              Send error messages in MIME format.  If not set, the DSN (Deliv-
              ery Status Notification) SMTP extension is disabled.

       ConnectionCacheTimeout=_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
              Set connection cache timeout.

       ConnectionCacheSize=_N
              Set connection cache size.

       LogLevel=_n
              The log level.

       MeToo=_F_a_l_s_e
              Don't send to ``me'' (the sender) if I am in an alias expansion.

       CheckAliases
              Validate the right hand side of aliases during  a  newaliases(1)
              command.

       OldStyleHeaders
              If  set,  this  message may have old style headers.  If not set,
              this message is guaranteed to have new style headers (i.e., com-
              mas  instead  of spaces between addresses).  If set, an adaptive
              algorithm is used that will correctly determine the header  for-
              mat in most cases.

       QueueDirectory=_q_u_e_u_e_d_i_r
              Select the directory in which to queue messages.

       StatusFile=_f_i_l_e
              Save statistics in the named file.

       Timeout.queuereturn=_t_i_m_e
              Set  the  timeout  on  undelivered  messages in the queue to the
              specified time.  After delivery has failed (e.g., because  of  a
              host  being  down) for this amount of time, failed messages will
              be returned to the sender.  The default is five days.

       UserDatabaseSpec=_u_s_e_r_d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e
              If set, a user database is consulted to get forwarding  informa-
              tion.   You  can consider this an adjunct to the aliasing mecha-
              nism, except that the database is intended  to  be  distributed;
              aliases  are local to a particular host.  This may not be avail-
              able if your sendmail does not have the USERDB  option  compiled
              in.

       ForkEachJob
              Fork  each  job during queue runs.  May be convenient on memory-
              poor machines.

       SevenBitInput
              Strip incoming messages to seven bits.

       EightBitMode=_m_o_d_e
              Set the handling of eight bit input to seven bit destinations to
              _m_o_d_e: m (mimefy) will convert to seven-bit MIME format, p (pass)
              will pass it as eight  bits  (but  violates  protocols),  and  s
              (strict) will bounce the message.

       MinQueueAge=_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
              Sets  how  long a job must ferment in the queue between attempts
              to send it.

       DefaultCharSet=_c_h_a_r_s_e_t
              Sets the default character set used to label 8-bit data that  is
              not otherwise labelled.

       DialDelay=_s_l_e_e_p_t_i_m_e
              If  opening  a connection fails, sleep for _s_l_e_e_p_t_i_m_e seconds and
              try again.  Useful on dial-on-demand sites.

       NoRecipientAction=_a_c_t_i_o_n
              Set the behaviour when there are no recipient headers (To:,  Cc:
              or  Bcc:)  in  the  message  to  _a_c_t_i_o_n: none leaves the message
              unchanged, add-to adds a To: header with  the  envelope  recipi-
              ents,  add-apparently-to  adds an Apparently-To: header with the
              envelope recipients, add-bcc adds an empty Bcc: header, and add-
              to-undisclosed  adds  a  header reading `To: undisclosed-recipi-
              ents:;'.

       MaxDaemonChildren=_N
              Sets the maximum number of children that an incoming SMTP daemon
              will allow to spawn at any time to _N.

       ConnectionRateThrottle=_N
              Sets  the  maximum  number of connections per second to the SMTP
              port to _N.

       In aliases, the first character of a name may  be  a  vertical  bar  to
       cause  interpretation  of the rest of the name as a command to pipe the
       mail to.  It may be necessary to quote the name to keep  sseennddmmaaiill  from
       suppressing  the  blanks from between arguments.  For example, a common
       alias is:

              msgs: "|/usr/bin/msgs -s"

       Aliases may also have the syntax ``:include:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e'' to ask  sseennddmmaaiill
       to read the named file for a list of recipients.  For example, an alias
       such as:

              poets: ":include:/usr/local/lib/poets.list"

       would read _/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_l_i_b_/_p_o_e_t_s_._l_i_s_t for the list of  addresses  making
       up the group.

       SSeennddmmaaiill  returns an exit status describing what it did.  The codes are
       defined in <_s_y_s_e_x_i_t_s_._h>:

       EX_OK  Successful completion on all addresses.

       EX_NOUSER
              User name not recognized.

       EX_UNAVAILABLE
              Catchall meaning necessary resources were not available.

       EX_SYNTAX
              Syntax error in address.

       EX_SOFTWARE
              Internal software error, including bad arguments.

       EX_OSERR
              Temporary operating system error, such as ``cannot fork''.

       EX_NOHOST
              Host name not recognized.

       EX_TEMPFAIL
              Message could not be sent immediately, but was queued.

       If invoked as nneewwaalliiaasseess, sseennddmmaaiill will rebuild the alias database.  If
       invoked  as  mmaaiillqq, sseennddmmaaiill will print the contents of the mail queue.
       If invoked as hhoossttssttaatt, sseennddmmaaiill will print the persistent host  status
       database.  If invoked as ppuurrggeessttaatt, sseennddmmaaiill will purge expired entries
       from the persistent host status database.  If invoked as  ssmmttppdd,  sseenndd--
       mmaaiill will act as a daemon, as if the --bbdd option were specified.

NNOOTTEESS
       sseennddmmaaiill  often  gets  blamed  for  many problems that are actually the
       result of other problems, such as overly permissive modes  on  directo-
       ries.  For this reason, sseennddmmaaiill checks the modes on system directories
       and files to determine if they can be trusted.  Although  these  checks
       can be turned off and your system security reduced by setting the DDoonntt--
       BBllaammeeSSeennddmmaaiill option, the permission problems  should  be  fixed.   For
