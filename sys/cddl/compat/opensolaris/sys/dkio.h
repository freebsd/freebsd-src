 *
 * When invoked from within the kernel, the arg can be NULL to indicate
 * a synchronous request or can be the address of a struct dk_callback
 * to request an asynchronous callback when the flush request is complete.
 * In this case, the flag to the ioctl must include FKIOCTL and the
 * dkc_callback field of the pointed to struct must be non-null or the
 * request is made synchronously.
 *
 * In the callback case: if the ioctl returns 0, a callback WILL be performed.
 * If the ioctl returns non-zero, a callback will NOT be performed.
 * NOTE: In some cases, the callback may be done BEFORE the ioctl call
 * returns.  The caller's locking strategy should be prepared for this case.
