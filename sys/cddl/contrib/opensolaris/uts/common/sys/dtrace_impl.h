/*
 * DTrace Probes
 *
 * The probe is the fundamental unit of the DTrace architecture.  Probes are
 * created by DTrace providers, and managed by the DTrace framework.  A probe
 * is identified by a unique <provider, module, function, name> tuple, and has
 * a unique probe identifier assigned to it.  (Some probes are not associated
 * with a specific point in text; these are called _unanchored probes_ and have
 * no module or function associated with them.)  Probes are represented as a
 * dtrace_probe structure.  To allow quick lookups based on each element of the
 * probe tuple, probes are hashed by each of provider, module, function and
 * name.  (If a lookup is performed based on a regular expression, a
 * dtrace_probekey is prepared, and a linear search is performed.) Each probe
 * is additionally pointed to by a linear array indexed by its identifier.  The
 * identifier is the provider's mechanism for indicating to the DTrace
 * framework that a probe has fired:  the identifier is passed as the first
 * argument to dtrace_probe(), where it is then mapped into the corresponding
 * dtrace_probe structure.  From the dtrace_probe structure, dtrace_probe() can
 * iterate over the probe's list of enabling control blocks; see "DTrace
 * Enabling Control Blocks", below.)

/*
 * DTrace Enabling Control Blocks
 *
 * When a provider wishes to fire a probe, it calls into dtrace_probe(),
 * passing the probe identifier as the first argument.  As described above,
 * dtrace_probe() maps the identifier into a pointer to a dtrace_probe_t
 * structure.  This structure contains information about the probe, and a
 * pointer to the list of Enabling Control Blocks (ECBs).  Each ECB points to
 * DTrace consumer state, and contains an optional predicate, and a list of
 * actions.  (Shown schematically below.)  The ECB abstraction allows a single
 * probe to be multiplexed across disjoint consumers, or across disjoint
 * enablings of a single probe within one consumer.

 * accordingly.  When the action list has been completely executed, processing
 * advances to the next ECB. The ECB abstraction allows disjoint consumers
 * to multiplex on single probes.
 *
 * Execution of the ECB results in consuming dte_size bytes in the buffer
 * to record data.  During execution, dte_needed bytes must be available in
 * the buffer.  This space is used for both recorded data and tuple data.

/*
 * DTrace Buffers
 *
 * Principal buffers, aggregation buffers, and speculative buffers are all
 * managed with the dtrace_buffer structure.  By default, this structure
 * includes twin data buffers -- dtb_tomax and dtb_xamot -- that serve as the
 * active and passive buffers, respectively.  For speculative buffers,
 * dtb_xamot will be NULL; for "ring" and "fill" buffers, dtb_xamot will point
 * to a scratch buffer.  For all buffer types, the dtrace_buffer structure is
 * always allocated on a per-CPU basis; a single dtrace_buffer structure is
 * never shared among CPUs.  (That is, there is never true sharing of the
 * dtrace_buffer structure; to prevent false sharing of the structure, it must
 * always be aligned to the coherence granularity -- generally 64 bytes.)
 *
 * One of the critical design decisions of DTrace is that a given ECB always
 * stores the same quantity and type of data.  This is done to assure that the
 * only metadata required for an ECB's traced data is the EPID.  That is, from
 * the EPID, the consumer can determine the data layout.  (The data buffer
 * layout is shown schematically below.)  By assuring that one can determine
 * data layout from the EPID, the metadata stream can be separated from the
 * data stream -- simplifying the data stream enormously.  The ECB always
 * proceeds the recorded data as part of the dtrace_rechdr_t structure that
 * includes the EPID and a high-resolution timestamp used for output ordering
 * consistency.

 *     limit of data buffer --->  +--------------------------------------+
 *
 * When evaluating an ECB, dtrace_probe() determines if the ECB's needs of the
 * principal buffer (both scratch and payload) exceed the available space.  If
 * the ECB's needs exceed available space (and if the principal buffer policy
 * is the default "switch" policy), the ECB is dropped, the buffer's drop count
 * is incremented, and processing advances to the next ECB.  If the ECB's needs
 * can be met with the available space, the ECB is processed, but the offset in
 * the principal buffer is only advanced if the ECB completes processing
 * without error.
 *
 * When a buffer is to be switched (either because the buffer is the principal
 * buffer with a "switch" policy or because it is an aggregation buffer), a
 * cross call is issued to the CPU associated with the buffer.  In the cross
 * call context, interrupts are disabled, and the active and the inactive
 * buffers are atomically switched.  This involves switching the data pointers,
 * copying the various state fields (offset, drops, errors, etc.) into their
 * inactive equivalents, and clearing the state fields.  Because interrupts are
 * disabled during this procedure, the switch is guaranteed to appear atomic to
 * dtrace_probe().
 *
 * DTrace Ring Buffering
 *
 * To process a ring buffer correctly, one must know the oldest valid record.
 * Processing starts at the oldest record in the buffer and continues until
 * the end of the buffer is reached.  Processing then resumes starting with
 * the record stored at offset 0 in the buffer, and continues until the
 * youngest record is processed.  If trace records are of a fixed-length,
 * determining the oldest record is trivial:
 *
 *   - If the ring buffer has not wrapped, the oldest record is the record
 *     stored at offset 0.
 *
 *   - If the ring buffer has wrapped, the oldest record is the record stored
 *     at the current offset.
 *
 * With variable length records, however, just knowing the current offset
 * doesn't suffice for determining the oldest valid record:  assuming that one
 * allows for arbitrary data, one has no way of searching forward from the
 * current offset to find the oldest valid record.  (That is, one has no way
 * of separating data from metadata.) It would be possible to simply refuse to
 * process any data in the ring buffer between the current offset and the
 * limit, but this leaves (potentially) an enormous amount of otherwise valid
 * data unprocessed.
 *
 * To effect ring buffering, we track two offsets in the buffer:  the current
 * offset and the _wrapped_ offset.  If a request is made to reserve some
 * amount of data, and the buffer has wrapped, the wrapped offset is
 * incremented until the wrapped offset minus the current offset is greater
 * than or equal to the reserve request.  This is done by repeatedly looking
 * up the ECB corresponding to the EPID at the current wrapped offset, and
 * incrementing the wrapped offset by the size of the data payload
 * corresponding to that ECB.  If this offset is greater than or equal to the
 * limit of the data buffer, the wrapped offset is set to 0.  Thus, the
 * current offset effectively "chases" the wrapped offset around the buffer.
 * Schematically:

 * the inactive buffer; in a "ring" buffer policy, it stores the wrapped
 * offset.
 *
 * DTrace Scratch Buffering
 *
 * Some ECBs may wish to allocate dynamically-sized temporary scratch memory.
 * To accommodate such requests easily, scratch memory may be allocated in
 * the buffer beyond the current offset plus the needed memory of the current
 * ECB.  If there isn't sufficient room in the buffer for the requested amount
 * of scratch space, the allocation fails and an error is generated.  Scratch
 * memory is tracked in the dtrace_mstate_t and is automatically freed when
 * the ECB ceases processing.  Note that ring buffers cannot allocate their
 * scratch from the principal buffer -- lest they needlessly overwrite older,
 * valid data.  Ring buffers therefore have their own dedicated scratch buffer
 * from which scratch is allocated.

 * DTrace Aggregation Buffers
 *
 * Aggregation buffers use much of the same mechanism as described above
 * ("DTrace Buffers").  However, because an aggregation is fundamentally a
 * hash, there exists dynamic metadata associated with an aggregation buffer
 * that is not associated with other kinds of buffers.  This aggregation
 * metadata is _only_ relevant for the in-kernel implementation of
 * aggregations; it is not actually relevant to user-level consumers.  To do
 * this, we allocate dynamic aggregation data (hash keys and hash buckets)
 * starting below the _limit_ of the buffer, and we allocate data from the
 * _base_ of the buffer.  When the aggregation buffer is copied out, _only_ the
 * data is copied out; the metadata is simply discarded.  Schematically,
 * aggregation buffers look like:
 *
 *      base of data buffer --->  +-------+------+-----------+-------+
 *                                | aggid | key  | value     | aggid |

 * given record.

/*
 * DTrace Speculations
 *
 * Speculations have a per-CPU buffer and a global state.  Once a speculation
 * buffer has been comitted or discarded, it cannot be reused until all CPUs
 * have taken the same action (commit or discard) on their respective
 * speculative buffer.  However, because DTrace probes may execute in arbitrary
 * context, other CPUs cannot simply be cross-called at probe firing time to
 * perform the necessary commit or discard.  The speculation states thus
 * optimize for the case that a speculative buffer is only active on one CPU at
 * the time of a commit() or discard() -- for if this is the case, other CPUs
 * need not take action, and the speculation is immediately available for
 * reuse.  If the speculation is active on multiple CPUs, it must be
 * asynchronously cleaned -- potentially leading to a higher rate of dirty
 * speculative drops.  The speculation states are as follows:
 *
 *  DTRACESPEC_INACTIVE       <= Initial state; inactive speculation
 *  DTRACESPEC_ACTIVE         <= Allocated, but not yet speculatively traced to
 *  DTRACESPEC_ACTIVEONE      <= Speculatively traced to on one CPU
 *  DTRACESPEC_ACTIVEMANY     <= Speculatively traced to on more than one CPU
 *  DTRACESPEC_COMMITTING     <= Currently being commited on one CPU
 *  DTRACESPEC_COMMITTINGMANY <= Currently being commited on many CPUs
 *  DTRACESPEC_DISCARDING     <= Currently being discarded on many CPUs
 *
 * The state transition diagram is as follows:

/*
 * DTrace Dynamic Variables
 *
 * The dynamic variable problem is obviously decomposed into two subproblems:
 * allocating new dynamic storage, and freeing old dynamic storage.  The
 * presence of the second problem makes the first much more complicated -- or
 * rather, the absence of the second renders the first trivial.  This is the
 * case with aggregations, for which there is effectively no deallocation of
 * dynamic storage.  (Or more accurately, all dynamic storage is deallocated
 * when a snapshot is taken of the aggregation.)  As DTrace dynamic variables
 * allow for both dynamic allocation and dynamic deallocation, the
 * implementation of dynamic variables is quite a bit more complicated than
 * that of their aggregation kin.
 *
 * We observe that allocating new dynamic storage is tricky only because the
 * size can vary -- the allocation problem is much easier if allocation sizes
 * are uniform.  We further observe that in D, the size of dynamic variables is
 * actually _not_ dynamic -- dynamic variable sizes may be determined by static
 * analysis of DIF text.  (This is true even of putatively dynamically-sized
 * objects like strings and stacks, the sizes of which are dictated by the
 * "stringsize" and "stackframes" variables, respectively.)  We exploit this by
 * performing this analysis on all DIF before enabling any probes.  For each
 * dynamic load or store, we calculate the dynamically-allocated size plus the
 * size of the dtrace_dynvar structure plus the storage required to key the
 * data.  For all DIF, we take the largest value and dub it the _chunksize_.
 * We then divide dynamic memory into two parts:  a hash table that is wide
 * enough to have every chunk in its own bucket, and a larger region of equal
 * chunksize units.  Whenever we wish to dynamically allocate a variable, we
 * always allocate a single chunk of memory.  Depending on the uniformity of
 * allocation, this will waste some amount of memory -- but it eliminates the
 * non-determinism inherent in traditional heap fragmentation.
 *
 * Dynamic objects are allocated by storing a non-zero value to them; they are
 * deallocated by storing a zero value to them.  Dynamic variables are
 * complicated enormously by being shared between CPUs.  In particular,
 * consider the following scenario:
 *
 *                 CPU A                                 CPU B

 *  :                                 :   :                                 :
 *  .                                 .   .                                 .
 *
 * This is obviously a race in the D program, but there are nonetheless only
 * two valid values for CPU B's load from a[123]:  345 or 0.  Most importantly,
 * CPU B may _not_ see the value 789 for a[123].
 *
 * There are essentially two ways to deal with this:
 *
 *  (1)  Explicitly spin-lock variables.  That is, if CPU B wishes to load
 *       from a[123], it needs to lock a[123] and hold the lock for the
 *       duration that it wishes to manipulate it.
 *
 *  (2)  Avoid reusing freed chunks until it is known that no CPU is referring
 *       to them.
 *
 * The implementation of (1) is rife with complexity, because it requires the
 * user of a dynamic variable to explicitly decree when they are done using it.
 * Were all variables by value, this perhaps wouldn't be debilitating -- but
 * dynamic variables of non-scalar types are tracked by reference.  That is, if
 * a dynamic variable is, say, a string, and that variable is to be traced to,
 * say, the principal buffer, the DIF emulation code returns to the main
 * dtrace_probe() loop a pointer to the underlying storage, not the contents of
 * the storage.  Further, code calling on DIF emulation would have to be aware
 * that the DIF emulation has returned a reference to a dynamic variable that
 * has been potentially locked.  The variable would have to be unlocked after
 * the main dtrace_probe() loop is finished with the variable, and the main
 * dtrace_probe() loop would have to be careful to not call any further DIF
 * emulation while the variable is locked to avoid deadlock.  More generally,
 * if one were to implement (1), DIF emulation code dealing with dynamic
 * variables could only deal with one dynamic variable at a time (lest deadlock
 * result).  To sum, (1) exports too much subtlety to the users of dynamic
 * variables -- increasing maintenance burden and imposing serious constraints
 * on future DTrace development.
 *
 * The implementation of (2) is also complex, but the complexity is more
 * manageable.  We need to be sure that when a variable is deallocated, it is
 * not placed on a traditional free list, but rather on a _dirty_ list.  Once a
 * variable is on a dirty list, it cannot be found by CPUs performing a
 * subsequent lookup of the variable -- but it may still be in use by other
 * CPUs.  To assure that all CPUs that may be seeing the old variable have
 * cleared out of probe context, a dtrace_sync() can be issued.  Once the
 * dtrace_sync() has completed, it can be known that all CPUs are done
 * manipulating the dynamic variable -- the dirty list can be atomically
 * appended to the free list.  Unfortunately, there's a slight hiccup in this
 * mechanism:  dtrace_sync() may not be issued from probe context.  The
 * dtrace_sync() must be therefore issued asynchronously from non-probe
 * context.  For this we rely on the DTrace cleaner, a cyclic that runs at the
 * "cleanrate" frequency.  To ease this implementation, we define several chunk
 * lists:
 *
 *   - Dirty.  Deallocated chunks, not yet cleaned.  Not available.
 *
 *   - Rinsing.  Formerly dirty chunks that are currently being asynchronously
 *     cleaned.  Not available, but will be shortly.  Dynamic variable
 *     allocation may not spin or block for availability, however.
 *
 *   - Clean.  Clean chunks, ready for allocation -- but not on the free list.
 *
 *   - Free.  Available for allocation.
 *
 * Moreover, to avoid absurd contention, _each_ of these lists is implemented
 * on a per-CPU basis.  This is only for performance, not correctness; chunks
 * may be allocated from another CPU's free list.  The algorithm for allocation
 * then is this:
 *
 *   (1)  Attempt to atomically allocate from current CPU's free list.  If list
 *        is non-empty and allocation is successful, allocation is complete.
 *
 *   (2)  If the clean list is non-empty, atomically move it to the free list,
 *        and reattempt (1).
 *
 *   (3)  If the dynamic variable space is in the CLEAN state, look for free
 *        and clean lists on other CPUs by setting the current CPU to the next
 *        CPU, and reattempting (1).  If the next CPU is the current CPU (that
 *        is, if all CPUs have been checked), atomically switch the state of
 *        the dynamic variable space based on the following:
 *
 *        - If no free chunks were found and no dirty chunks were found,
 *          atomically set the state to EMPTY.
 *
 *        - If dirty chunks were found, atomically set the state to DIRTY.
 *
 *        - If rinsing chunks were found, atomically set the state to RINSING.
 *
 *   (4)  Based on state of dynamic variable space state, increment appropriate
 *        counter to indicate dynamic drops (if in EMPTY state) vs. dynamic
 *        dirty drops (if in DIRTY state) vs. dynamic rinsing drops (if in
 *        RINSING state).  Fail the allocation.
 *
 * The cleaning cyclic operates with the following algorithm:  for all CPUs
 * with a non-empty dirty list, atomically move the dirty list to the rinsing
 * list.  Perform a dtrace_sync().  For all CPUs with a non-empty rinsing list,
 * atomically move the rinsing list to the clean list.  Perform another
 * dtrace_sync().  By this point, all CPUs have seen the new clean list; the
 * state of the dynamic variable space can be restored to CLEAN.
 *
 * There exist two final races that merit explanation.  The first is a simple
 * allocation race:
 *
 *                 CPU A                                 CPU B

 *
 * Again, this is a race in the D program.  It can be resolved by having a[123]
 * hold the value 345 or a[123] hold the value 567 -- but it must be true that
 * a[123] have only _one_ of these values.  (That is, the racing CPUs may not
 * put the same element twice on the same hash chain.)  This is resolved
 * simply:  before the allocation is undertaken, the start of the new chunk's
 * hash chain is noted.  Later, after the allocation is complete, the hash
 * chain is atomically switched to point to the new element.  If this fails
 * (because of either concurrent allocations or an allocation concurrent with a
 * deletion), the newly allocated chunk is deallocated to the dirty list, and
 * the whole process of looking up (and potentially allocating) the dynamic
 * variable is reattempted.
 *
 * The final race is a simple deallocation race:
 *
 *                 CPU A                                 CPU B
 *  +---------------------------------+   +---------------------------------+
 *  |                                 |   |                                 |
 *  | deallocates dynamic object      |   | deallocates dynamic object      |
 *  | a[123] by storing the value 0   |   | a[123] by storing the value 0   |
 *  | to it                           |   | to it                           |
 *  |                                 |   |                                 |
 *  :                                 :   :                                 :
 *  .                                 .   .                                 .
 *
 * Once again, this is a race in the D program, but it is one that we must
 * handle without corrupting the underlying data structures.  Because
 * deallocations require the deletion of a chunk from the middle of a hash
 * chain, we cannot use a single-word atomic operation to remove it.  For this,
 * we add a spin lock to the hash buckets that is _only_ used for deallocations
 * (allocation races are handled as above).  Further, this spin lock is _only_
 * held for the duration of the delete; before control is returned to the DIF
 * emulation code, the hash bucket is unlocked.

/*
 * DTrace Variable State
 *
 * The DTrace variable state tracks user-defined variables in its dtrace_vstate
 * structure.  Each DTrace consumer has exactly one dtrace_vstate structure,
 * but some dtrace_vstate structures may exist without a corresponding DTrace
 * consumer (see "DTrace Helpers", below).  As described in <sys/dtrace.h>,
 * user-defined variables can have one of three scopes:
 *
 *  DIFV_SCOPE_GLOBAL  =>  global scope
 *  DIFV_SCOPE_THREAD  =>  thread-local scope (i.e. "self->" variables)
 *  DIFV_SCOPE_LOCAL   =>  clause-local scope (i.e. "this->" variables)
 *
 * The variable state tracks variables by both their scope and their allocation
 * type:
 *
 *  - The dtvs_globals and dtvs_locals members each point to an array of
 *    dtrace_statvar structures.  These structures contain both the variable
 *    metadata (dtrace_difv structures) and the underlying storage for all
 *    statically allocated variables, including statically allocated
 *    DIFV_SCOPE_GLOBAL variables and all DIFV_SCOPE_LOCAL variables.
 *
 *  - The dtvs_tlocals member points to an array of dtrace_difv structures for
 *    DIFV_SCOPE_THREAD variables.  As such, this array tracks _only_ the
 *    variable metadata for DIFV_SCOPE_THREAD variables; the underlying storage
 *    is allocated out of the dynamic variable space.
 *
 *  - The dtvs_dynvars member is the dynamic variable state associated with the
 *    variable state.  The dynamic variable state (described in "DTrace Dynamic
 *    Variables", above) tracks all DIFV_SCOPE_THREAD variables and all
 *    dynamically-allocated DIFV_SCOPE_GLOBAL variables.

 * DTrace Enablings

 * ECBs immediately thereafter.  However, enablings are also generally
 * retained should the probes they describe be created at a later time; as
 * each new module or provider registers with the framework, the retained
 * enablings are reevaluated, with any new match resulting in new ECBs.  To
 * prevent probes from being matched more than once, the enabling tracks the
 * last probe generation matched, and only matches probes from subsequent
 * generations.

 * DTrace Toxic Ranges

 * accordingly.  However, there may exist some regions of memory in which an
 * arbitrary load can change system state, and from which it is impossible to
 * recover from such a load after it has been attempted.  Examples of this may
 * include memory in which programmable I/O registers are mapped (for which a
 * read may have some implications for the device) or (in the specific case of
 * UltraSPARC-I and -II) the virtual address hole.  The platform is required
 * to make DTrace aware of these toxic ranges; DTrace will then check that
 * target addresses are not in a toxic range before attempting to issue a
 * safe load.
