/**
 * @brief Probe to see if a device matches a driver.
 *
 * Users should not call this method directly. Normally, this
 * is called via device_probe_and_attach() to select a driver
 * calling the DEVICE_PROBE() of all candidate drivers and attach
 * the winning driver (if any) to the device.
 *
 * This function is used to match devices to device drivers.
 * Typically, the driver will examine the device to see if
 * it is suitable for this driver. This might include checking
 * the values of various device instance variables or reading
 * hardware registers.
 *  
 * In some cases, there may be more than one driver available
 * which can be used for a device (for instance there might
 * be a generic driver which works for a set of many types of
 * device and a more specific driver which works for a subset
 * of devices). Because of this, a driver should not assume
 * that it will be the driver that attaches to the device even
 * if it returns a success status from DEVICE_PROBE(). In particular,
 * a driver must free any resources which it allocated during
 * the probe before returning. The return value of DEVICE_PROBE()
 * is used to elect which driver is used - the driver which returns
 * the largest non-error value wins the election and attaches to
 * the device. Common non-error values are described in the
 * DEVICE_PROBE(9) manual page.
 *
 * If a driver matches the hardware, it should set the device
 * description string using device_set_desc() or
 * device_set_desc_copy(). This string is used to generate an
 * informative message when DEVICE_ATTACH() is called.
 * 
 * As a special case, if a driver returns zero, the driver election
 * is cut short and that driver will attach to the device
 * immediately. This should rarely be used.
 *
 * For example, a probe method for a PCI device driver might look
 * like this:
 *
 * @code
 * int
 * foo_probe(device_t dev)
 * {
 *         if (pci_get_vendor(dev) == FOOVENDOR &&
 *             pci_get_device(dev) == FOODEVICE) {
 *                 device_set_desc(dev, "Foo device");
 *                 return (BUS_PROBE_DEFAULT);
 *         }
 *         return (ENXIO);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To include this method in a device driver, use a line like this
 * in the driver's method list:
 *
 * @code
 * 	KOBJMETHOD(device_probe, foo_probe)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param dev		the device to probe
 *
 * @retval 0		if this is the only possible driver for this
 *			device
 * @retval negative	if the driver can match this device - the
 *			least negative value is used to select the
 *			driver
 * @retval ENXIO	if the driver does not match the device
 * @retval positive	if some kind of error was detected during
 *			the probe, a regular unix error code should
 *			be returned to indicate the type of error
 * @see DEVICE_ATTACH(), pci_get_vendor(), pci_get_device()

/**
 * @brief Allow a device driver to detect devices not otherwise enumerated.
 *
 * The DEVICE_IDENTIFY() method is used by some drivers (e.g. the ISA
 * bus driver) to help populate the bus device with a useful set of
 * child devices, normally by calling the BUS_ADD_CHILD() method of
 * the parent device. For instance, the ISA bus driver uses several
 * special drivers, including the isahint driver and the pnp driver to
 * create child devices based on configuration hints and PnP bus
 * probes respectively.
 *
 * Many bus drivers which support true plug-and-play do not need to
 * use this method at all since child devices can be discovered
 * automatically without help from child drivers.
 *
 * To include this method in a device driver, use a line like this
 * in the driver's method list:
