/* Mutex pool routines.  These routines are designed to be used as short
 * term leaf mutexes (e.g. the last mutex you might acquire other then
 * calling msleep()).  They operate using a shared pool.  A mutex is chosen
 * from the pool based on the supplied pointer (which may or may not be
 * valid).
 *
 * Advantages:
 *	- no structural overhead.  Mutexes can be associated with structures
 *	  without adding bloat to the structures.
 *	- mutexes can be obtained for invalid pointers, useful when uses
 *	  mutexes to interlock destructor ops.
 *	- no initialization/destructor overhead.
 *	- can be used with msleep.
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 *	- should generally only be used as leaf mutexes.
 *	- pool/pool dependency ordering cannot be depended on.
 *	- possible L1 cache mastersip contention between cpus.
