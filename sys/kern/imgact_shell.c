 *
 * The interpreter is then started up such that it will see:
 *    arg[0] -> The name of interpreter as specified after `#!' in the

 *		not be longer than MAXSHELLCMDLEN bytes.
 *    arg[1] -> *If* there are any additional tokens on the first line,

 *		that line.  The copy starts at the first token after the
 *		interpreter name.  We leave it to the interpreter to
 *		parse the tokens in that value.
 *    arg[x] -> the full pathname of the script.  This will either be
 *		arg[2] or arg[1], depending on whether or not tokens
 *		were found after the interpreter name.
 *  arg[x+1] -> all the arguments that were specified on the original
 *		command line.

/*
 * HISTORICAL NOTE: From 1993 to mid-2005, FreeBSD parsed out the tokens as
 * found on the first line of the script, and setup each token as a separate
 * value in arg[].  This extra processing did not match the behavior of other
 * OS's, and caused a few subtle problems.  For one, it meant the kernel was
 * deciding how those values should be parsed (wrt characters for quoting or
 * comments, etc), while the interpreter might have other rules for parsing.
 * It also meant the interpreter had no way of knowing which arguments came
 * from the first line of the shell script, and which arguments were specified
 * by the user on the command line.  That extra processing was dropped in the
 * 6.x branch on May 28, 2005 (matching __FreeBSD_version 600029).
