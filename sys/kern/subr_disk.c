/*
 * BIO queue implementation
 *
 * Please read carefully the description below before making any change
 * to the code, or you might change the behaviour of the data structure
 * in undesirable ways.
 *
 * A bioq stores disk I/O request (bio), normally sorted according to
 * the distance of the requested position (bio->bio_offset) from the
 * current head position (bioq->last_offset) in the scan direction, i.e.
 *
 * 	(uoff_t)(bio_offset - last_offset)
 *
 * Note that the cast to unsigned (uoff_t) is fundamental to insure
 * that the distance is computed in the scan direction.
 *
 * The main methods for manipulating the bioq are:
 *
 *   bioq_disksort()	performs an ordered insertion;
 *
 *   bioq_first()	return the head of the queue, without removing;
 *
 *   bioq_takefirst()	return and remove the head of the queue,
 *		updating the 'current head position' as
 *		bioq->last_offset = bio->bio_offset + bio->bio_length;
 *
 * When updating the 'current head position', we assume that the result of
 * bioq_takefirst() is dispatched to the device, so bioq->last_offset
 * represents the head position once the request is complete.
 *
 * If the bioq is manipulated using only the above calls, it starts
 * with a sorted sequence of requests with bio_offset >= last_offset,
 * possibly followed by another sorted sequence of requests with
 * 0 <= bio_offset < bioq->last_offset 
 *
 * NOTE: historical behaviour was to ignore bio->bio_length in the
 *	update, but its use tracks the head position in a better way.
 *	Historical behaviour was also to update the head position when
 *	the request under service is complete, rather than when the
 *	request is extracted from the queue. However, the current API
 *	has no method to update the head position; secondly, once
 *	a request has been submitted to the disk, we have no idea of
 *	the actual head position, so the final one is our best guess.
 *
 * --- Direct queue manipulation ---
 *
 * A bioq uses an underlying TAILQ to store requests, so we also
 * export methods to manipulate the TAILQ, in particular:
 *
 * bioq_insert_tail()	insert an entry at the end.
 *		It also creates a 'barrier' so all subsequent
 *		insertions through bioq_disksort() will end up
 *		after this entry;
 *
 * bioq_insert_head()	insert an entry at the head, update
 *		bioq->last_offset = bio->bio_offset so that
 *		all subsequent insertions through bioq_disksort()
 *		will end up after this entry;
 *
 * bioq_remove()	remove a generic element from the queue, act as
 *		bioq_takefirst() if invoked on the head of the queue.
 *
 * The semantic of these methods is the same as the operations
 * on the underlying TAILQ, but with additional guarantees on
 * subsequent bioq_disksort() calls. E.g. bioq_insert_tail()
 * can be useful for making sure that all previous ops are flushed
 * to disk before continuing.
 *
 * Updating bioq->last_offset on a bioq_insert_head() guarantees
 * that the bio inserted with the last bioq_insert_head() will stay
 * at the head of the queue even after subsequent bioq_disksort().
 *
 * Note that when the direct queue manipulation functions are used,
 * the queue may contain multiple inversion points (i.e. more than
 * two sorted sequences of requests).
 *
