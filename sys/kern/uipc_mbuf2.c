	 *	      mbuf, it is still not considered "writable."
	 *	  (ii) since mbuf has M_EXT, the ext_type _has_ to be
	 *	       EXT_CLUSTER. Anything else makes it non-writable.
	 *	  (iii) M_WRITABLE() must evaluate true.
	 *      Ideally, the requirement should only be (iii).
	 *
	 * If we're writable, we're sure we're writable, because the ref. count
	 * cannot increase from 1, as that would require possession of mbuf
	 * n by someone else (which is impossible). However, if we're _not_
	 * writable, we may eventually become writable )if the ref. count drops
	 * to 1), but we'll fail to notice it unless we re-evaluate
	 * M_WRITABLE(). For now, we only evaluate once at the beginning and
