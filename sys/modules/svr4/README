This is a SysVR4 emulator derived from work done as part of the NetBSD
Project by Christos Zoulas.  It has been ported to FreeBSD by Mark Newton.

To use it:

1.  Choose one of:
      a.  Add "pseudo-device streams" to your kernel config file and rebuild,
          reboot; or
      b.  Build and install the streams module in /sys/modules/streams

2.  Build and install the svr4 module in /sys/modules/svr4

3.  Type "kldload svr4" to start it up.

4.  Grab compat_sol26.tar.gz or compat_svr4.tar.gz from
    http://www.freebsd.org/~newton/freebsd-svr4 and install them in
    /compat/svr4

5.  Run "sh SVR4_MAKEDEV all" in /compat/svr4/dev

6.  Mount a Solaris/x86 v2.6 or v7 CD-ROM on /cdrom (also works with 
    v2.4 and v2.5.1, but you need different symlinks in /compat/svr4)

7.  Brand any executables you want to run, and/or set the
    kern.fallback_elf_brand sysctl to 'SVR4' to establish this as the
    default emulator for unbranded executables.

8.  See if your SysVR4 programs work.

It's early days yet, folks -- You'll probably have trouble getting 100%
functionality out of most things (specifically, poll() on a socket doesn't
look like it works at the moment, so Netscape doesn't work (among other
things)).  Patches will be appreciated (use send-pr).
