saute procfs lyonnais

procfs supports two levels of directory.  the filesystem root
directory contains a representation of the system process table.
this consists of an entry for each active and zombie process, and
an additional entry "curproc" which always represents the process
making the lookup request.

each of the sub-directories contains several files.  these files
are used to control and interrogate processes.  the files implemented
are:

	file	- xxx.  the exec'ed file.

	status  - r/o.  returns process status.

	ctl	- w/o.  sends a control message to the process.
			for example:
				echo hup > /proc/curproc/note
			will send a SIGHUP to the shell.
			whereas
				echo attach > /proc/1293/ctl
			would set up process 1293 for debugging.
			see below for more details.

	mem	- r/w.  virtual memory image of the process.
			parts of the address space are readable
			only if they exist in the target process.
			a more reasonable alternative might be
			to return zero pages instead of an error.
			comments?

	note	- w/o.  writing a string here sends the
			equivalent note to the process.
			[ not implemented. ]

	notepg	- w/o.  the same as note, but sends to all
			members of the process group.
			[ not implemented. ]

	regs	- r/w.	process register set.  this can be read
			or written any time even if the process
			is not stopped.  since the bsd kernel
			is single-processor, this implementation
			will get the "right" register values.
			a multi-proc kernel would need to do some
			synchronisation.

this then looks like:

the basic sequence of commands written to "ctl" would be

	attach		- this stops the target process and
			  arranges for the sending process
			  to become the debug control process
	wait		- wait for the target process to come to
			  a steady state ready for debugging.
	step		- single step, with no signal delivery.
	run		- continue running, with no signal delivery,
			  until next trap or breakpoint.
	<signame>	- deliver signal <signame> and continue running.
	detach		- continue execution of the target process
			  and remove it from control by the debug process

in a normal debugging environment, where the target is fork/exec'd by
the debugger, the debugger should fork and the child should stop itself
(with a self-inflicted SIGSTOP).  the parent should do a "wait" then an
"attach".  as before, the child will hit a breakpoint on the first
instruction in any newly exec'd image.
