 * The heap is a struct dn_heap plus a dynamically allocated

 * the array, 'elements' count entries in use. The topmost
 * element has the smallest key.
 * The heap supports ordered insert, and extract from the top.
 * To extract an object from the middle of the heap, we the object
 * must reserve an 'int32_t' to store the position of the object
 * in the heap itself, and the location of this field must be
 * passed as an argument to heap_init() -- use -1 if the feature
 * is not used.

/*------------------------------------------------------
 * This module implements a generic hash table with support for
 * running callbacks on the entire table. To avoid allocating
 * memory during hash table operations, objects must reserve
 * space for a link field. XXX if the heap is moderately full,
 * an SLIST suffices, and we can tolerate the cost of a hash
 * computation on each removal.
 *
 * dn_ht_init() initializes the table, setting the number of
 *	buckets, the offset of the link field, the main callbacks.
 *	Callbacks are:
 * 
 *	hash(key, flags, arg) called to return a bucket index.
 *	match(obj, key, flags, arg) called to determine if key
 *		matches the current 'obj' in the heap
 *	newh(key, flags, arg) optional, used to allocate a new
 *		object during insertions.
 *
 * dn_ht_free() frees the heap or unlink elements.
 *	DNHT_REMOVE unlink elements, 0 frees the heap.
 *	You need two calls to do both.
 *
 * dn_ht_find() is the main lookup function, which can also be
 *	used to insert or delete elements in the hash table.
 *	The final 'arg' is passed to all callbacks.
 *
 * dn_ht_scan() is used to invoke a callback on all entries of
 *	the heap, or possibly on just one bucket. The callback
 *	is invoked with a pointer to the object, and must return
 *	one of DNHT_SCAN_DEL or DNHT_SCAN_END to request the
 *	removal of the object from the heap and the end of the
 *	scan, respectively.
 *
 * dn_ht_scan_bucket() is similar to dn_ht_scan(), except that it scans
 *	only the specific bucket of the table. The bucket is a in-out
 *	parameter and return a valid bucket number if the original
 *	is invalid.
 *
 * A combination of flags can be used to modify the operation
 * of the dn_ht_find(), and of the callbacks:
 *
 * DNHT_KEY_IS_OBJ	means the key is the object pointer.
 *	It is usually of interest for the hash and match functions.
 *
 * DNHT_MATCH_PTR	during a lookup, match pointers instead
 *	of calling match(). Normally used when removing specific
 *	entries. Does not imply KEY_IS_OBJ as the latter _is_ used
 *	by the match function.
 *
 * DNHT_INSERT		insert the element if not found.
 *	Calls new() to allocates a new object unless
 *	DNHT_KEY_IS_OBJ is set.
 *
 * DNHT_UNIQUE		only insert if object not found.
 *	XXX should it imply DNHT_INSERT ?
 *
 * DNHT_REMOVE		remove objects if we find them.
