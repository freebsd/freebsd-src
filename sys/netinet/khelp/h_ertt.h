 * The ERTT (Enhanced Round Trip Time) Khelp module calculates an estimate of
 * the instantaneous TCP RTT which, for example, is used by delay-based
 * congestion control schemes. When the module is loaded, ERTT data is
 * calculated for each active TCP connection and encapsulated within a
 * "struct ertt".
 *
 * This software was first released in 2010 by David Hayes and Lawrence Stewart
 * whilst working on the NewTCP research project at Swinburne University of
 * Technology's Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures, Melbourne,
 * Australia, which was made possible in part by a grant from the Cisco
 * University Research Program Fund at Community Foundation Silicon Valley.
 * Testing and development was further assisted by a grant from the FreeBSD
 * Foundation. More details are available at:
