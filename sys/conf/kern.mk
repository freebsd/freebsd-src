# Warning flags for compiling the kernel and components of the kernel.
#
# Note that the newly added -Wcast-qual is responsible for generating 
# most of the remaining warnings.  Warnings introduced with -Wall will
# also pop up, but are easier to fix.
#
CWARNFLAGS?=	-Wall -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Wstrict-prototypes \
		-Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Winline -Wcast-qual \
		-fformat-extensions -ansi
#
# The following flags are next up for working on:
#	-W
#
# When working on removing warnings from code, the `-Werror' flag should be
# of material assistance.
#

#
# On the alpha, make sure that we don't use floating-point registers and
# allow the use of EV56 instructions (only needed for low-level i/o).
