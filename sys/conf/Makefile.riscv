# RISCVTODO: copy pasted from aarch64, needs to be
# constructed from a machine description:
#	config machineid
# Most changes should be made in the machine description
#	/sys/riscv/conf/``machineid''
# after which you should do
#	 config machineid
# Generic makefile changes should be made in
#	/sys/conf/Makefile.riscv
# after which config should be rerun for all machines.
#

# Which version of config(8) is required.

# us to load the kernel with the -kernel flag in QEMU without having to embed
# it inside BBL or OpenSBI's fw_payload first.
# Note: For rv32 the start address is different (0x80400000).
# We set this value using --defsym rather than hardcoding it in ldscript.riscv
# so that different kernel configs can override the load address.
