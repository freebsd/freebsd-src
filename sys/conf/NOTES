# NOTES -- Lines that can be cut/pasted into kernel and hints configs.
#
# Lines that begin with 'device', 'options', 'machine', 'ident', 'maxusers',
# 'makeoptions', 'hints', etc. go into the kernel configuration that you
# run config(8) with.
#
# Lines that begin with 'hint.' are NOT for config(8), they go into your
# hints file.  See /boot/device.hints and/or the 'hints' config(8) directive.
#
# Please use ``make LINT'' to create an old-style LINT file if you want to
# do kernel test-builds.
#
# This file contains machine independent kernel configuration notes.  For
# machine dependent notes, look in /sys/<arch>/conf/NOTES.
#

#
# NOTES conventions and style guide:
#
# Large block comments should begin and end with a line containing only a
# comment character.
#
# To describe a particular object, a block comment (if it exists) should
# come first.  Next should come device, options, and hints lines in that
# order.  All device and option lines must be described by a comment that
# doesn't just expand the device or option name.  Use only a concise
# comment on the same line if possible.  Very detailed descriptions of
# devices and subsystems belong in manpages.
#
# A space followed by a tab separates 'option' from an option name.  Two
# spaces followed by a tab separate 'device' from a device name.  Comments
# after an option or device should use one space after the comment character.
# To comment out a negative option that disables code and thus should not be
# enabled for LINT builds, precede 'option' with "#!".
#

#
# This is the ``identification'' of the kernel.  Usually this should
# be the same as the name of your kernel.
#
ident		LINT

#
# The `maxusers' parameter controls the static sizing of a number of
# internal system tables by a formula defined in subr_param.c.
# Omitting this parameter or setting it to 0 will cause the system to
# auto-size based on physical memory.
#
maxusers	10

#
# The `makeoptions' parameter allows variables to be passed to the
# generated Makefile in the build area.
#
# CONF_CFLAGS gives some extra compiler flags that are added to ${CFLAGS}
# after most other flags.  Here we use it to inhibit use of non-optimal
# gcc builtin functions (e.g., memcmp).
#
# DEBUG happens to be magic.
# The following is equivalent to 'config -g KERNELNAME' and creates
# 'kernel.debug' compiled with -g debugging as well as a normal
# 'kernel'.  Use 'make install.debug' to install the debug kernel
# but that isn't normally necessary as the debug symbols are not loaded
# by the kernel and are not useful there anyway.
#
# KERNEL can be overridden so that you can change the default name of your
# kernel.
#
# MODULES_OVERRIDE can be used to limit modules built to a specific list.

# Be compatible with SunOS.  The COMPAT_43 option above pulls in most
# (all?) of the changes that this option turns on.
#
options 	COMPAT_SUNOS

# Enable FreeBSD4 compatibility syscalls
options 	COMPAT_FREEBSD4

#####################################################################
# DEBUGGING OPTIONS

#
# Enable the kernel debugger.
#
options 	DDB

#
# Use direct symbol lookup routines for ddb instead of the kernel linker
# ones, so that symbols (mostly) work before the kernel linker has been
# initialized.  This is not the default because it breaks ddb's lookup of
# symbols in loaded modules.
#
#!options 	DDB_NOKLDSYM

#
# Print a stack trace of the current thread out on the console for a panic.
#
options 	DDB_TRACE

#
# Don't drop into DDB for a panic. Intended for unattended operation
# where you may want to drop to DDB from the console, but still want
# the machine to recover from a panic
#
options 	DDB_UNATTENDED

#
# If using GDB remote mode to debug the kernel, there's a non-standard
# extension to the remote protocol that can be used to use the serial
# port as both the debugging port and the system console.  It's non-
# standard and you're on your own if you enable it.  See also the
# "remotechat" variables in the FreeBSD specific version of gdb.
#
options 	GDB_REMOTE_CHAT

#
# KTRACE enables the system-call tracing facility ktrace(2).  To be more
# SMP-friendly, KTRACE uses a worker thread to process most trace events
# asynchronously to the thread generating the event.  This requires a
# pre-allocated store of objects representing trace events.  The
# KTRACE_REQUEST_POOL option specifies the initial size of this store.
# The size of the pool can be adjusted both at boottime and runtime via
# the kern.ktrace_request_pool tunable and sysctl.
#
options 	KTRACE			#kernel tracing
options 	KTRACE_REQUEST_POOL=101

#
# KTR is a kernel tracing mechanism imported from BSD/OS.  Currently it
# has no userland interface aside from a few sysctl's.  It is enabled with
# the KTR option.  KTR_ENTRIES defines the number of entries in the circular
# trace buffer.  KTR_COMPILE defines the mask of events to compile into the
# kernel as defined by the KTR_* constants in <sys/ktr.h>.  KTR_MASK defines the
# initial value of the ktr_mask variable which determines at runtime what
# events to trace.  KTR_CPUMASK determines which CPU's log events, with
# bit X corresponding to cpu X.  KTR_VERBOSE enables dumping of KTR events
# to the console by default.  This functionality can be toggled via the
# debug.ktr_verbose sysctl and defaults to off if KTR_VERBOSE is not defined.
#
options 	KTR

#
# The INVARIANTS option is used in a number of source files to enable
# extra sanity checking of internal structures.  This support is not
# enabled by default because of the extra time it would take to check
# for these conditions, which can only occur as a result of
# programming errors.
#
options 	INVARIANTS

#
# The INVARIANT_SUPPORT option makes us compile in support for
# verifying some of the internal structures.  It is a prerequisite for
# 'INVARIANTS', as enabling 'INVARIANTS' will make these functions be
# called.  The intent is that you can set 'INVARIANTS' for single
# source files (by changing the source file or specifying it on the
# command line) if you have 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' enabled.  Also, if you
# wish to build a kernel module with 'INVARIANTS', then adding
# 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' to your kernel will provide all the necessary
# infrastructure without the added overhead.
#
options 	INVARIANT_SUPPORT

#
# The DIAGNOSTIC option is used to enable extra debugging information
# from some parts of the kernel.  As this makes everything more noisy,
# it is disabled by default.
#
options 	DIAGNOSTIC

#
# REGRESSION causes optional kernel interfaces necessary only for regression
# testing to be enabled.  These interfaces may consitute security risks
# when enabled, as they permit processes to easily modify aspects of the
# run-time environment to reproduce unlikely or unusual (possibly normally
# impossible) scenarios.
#
options 	REGRESSION

#
# RESTARTABLE_PANICS allows one to continue from a panic as if it were
# a call to the debugger via the Debugger() function instead.  It is only
# useful if a kernel debugger is present.  To restart from a panic, reset
# the panicstr variable to NULL and continue execution.  This option is
# for development use only and should NOT be used in production systems
# to "workaround" a panic.
#
#options 	RESTARTABLE_PANICS

#
# This option let some drivers co-exist that can't co-exist in a running
# system.  This is used to be able to compile all kernel code in one go for
# quality assurance purposes (like this file, which the option takes it name
# from.)

#
# WARNING:  IPFIREWALL defaults to a policy of "deny ip from any to any"
# and if you do not add other rules during startup to allow access,

# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

hint.scbus.0.at="ahc0"
hint.scbus.1.at="ahc1"
hint.scbus.1.bus="0"
hint.scbus.3.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.3.bus="0"
hint.scbus.2.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.2.bus="1"
hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
hint.da.0.target="0"
hint.da.0.unit="0"
hint.da.1.at="scbus3"
hint.da.1.target="1"
hint.da.2.at="scbus2"
hint.da.2.target="3"
hint.sa.1.at="scbus1"
hint.sa.1.target="6"

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The ch driver drives SCSI Media Changer ("jukebox") devices.
#
# The da driver drives SCSI Direct Access ("disk") and Optical Media
# ("WORM") devices.
#
# The sa driver drives SCSI Sequential Access ("tape") devices.
#
# The cd driver drives SCSI Read Only Direct Access ("cd") devices.
#
# The ses driver drives SCSI Envinronment Services ("ses") and
# SAF-TE ("SCSI Accessable Fault-Tolerant Enclosure") devices.
#
# The pt driver drives SCSI Processor devices.
#
# 
# Target Mode support is provided here but also requires that a SIM
# (SCSI Host Adapter Driver) provide support as well.
#
# The targ driver provides target mode support as a Processor type device.
# It exists to give the minimal context necessary to respond to Inquiry
# commands. There is a sample user application that shows how the rest
# of the command support might be done in /usr/share/examples/scsi_target.
#
# The targbh driver provides target mode support and exists to respond
# to incoming commands that do not otherwise have a logical unit assigned
# to them.
# 
# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration as the "pass" driver.
