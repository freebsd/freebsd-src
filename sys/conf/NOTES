# This directive is mandatory; it defines the architecture to be
# configured for; in this case, the 386 family.  You must also specify
# at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on); deleting the
# specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make parts of the
# system run faster

# This is the ``identification'' of the kernel.  Usually this should
# be the same as the name of your kernel.

#
# The `maxusers' parameter controls the static sizing of a number of
# internal system tables by a complicated formula defined in param.c.

# defaults on bootup.  (an example is a large news server in which
# the uid, news, can sometimes need > 100 simultaneous processes running)
options		"CHILD_MAX=128"
options		"OPEN_MAX=128"

#
# A math emulator is mandatory if you wish to run on hardware which
# does not have a floating-point processor.  Pick either the original,
# bogus (but freely-distributable) math emulator, or a much more
# fully-featured but GPL-licensed emulator taken from Linux.

# This directive defines a number of things:
#  - The compiled kernel is to be called `kernel'
#  - The root filesystem might be on partition wd0a
#  - The kernel can swap on wd0b and sd0b, defaulting to the former
#  - Crash dumps will be written to wd0b, if possible

# Allow user-mode programs to manipulat their local descriptor tables.
# This option is required for the WINE Windows(tm) emulator, and is
# not used by anything else (that we know of).
#
options		USER_LDT		#allow user-level control of i386 ldt

# DEBUGGING OPTIONS

#
# This line enables the kernel debugger, DDB, and the line following

# KTRACE enables the system-call tracing facility ktrace(2).

options		KTRACE			#kernel tracing

#
# The DIAGNOSTIC option is used in a number of source files to enable
# extra sanity checking of internal structures.  This support is not

# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# Protocol families:
#  Only the INET (Internet) family is officially supported in FreeBSD.
#  Source code for the NS (Xerox Network Service), ISO (OSI), and

#
# Network interfaces:
#  The `loop' pseudo-device is mandatory when networking is enabled.
#  The `ether' pseudo-device provides generic code to handle
#  Ethernets; it is mandatory when a Ethernet device driver is
#  configured.
#  The `sppp' pseudo-device serves a similar role for certain types
#  of synchronous PPP links (like `cx').
#  The `sl' pseudo-device implements the Serial Line IP (SLIP) service.
#  The `ppp' pseudo-device implements the Point-to-Point Protocol.
#  The `bpfilter' pseudo-device enables the Berkeley Packet Filter.  Be

# larger static sizes of a number of system tables.
#
# MROUTING enables the kernel multicast packet forwarder, which works
# with mrouted(8).
#
# IPFIREWALL enables support for IP firewall construction, in
# conjunction with the `ipfw' program.  IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE does
# the obvious thing.
#
# ARP_PROXYALL enables global proxy ARP.  Beware!  This can burn
# your house down!  See netinet/if_ether.c for the gory details.

# FILESYSTEM OPTIONS

#
# Only the root, /usr, and /tmp filesystems need be statically
# compiled; everything else will be automatically loaded at mount
# time.  (Exception: the UFS family---FFS, MFS, and LFS---cannot
# currently be demand-loaded.)  Some people still prefer to statically
# compile other filesystems as well.
#
# NB: The LFS, PORTAL, and UNION filesystems are known to be buggy,
# and WILL panic your system if you attempt to do anything with them.
# They are included here as an incentive for some enterprising soul to
# sit down and fix them.
#

# One of these is mandatory:

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

#
# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Note that, unlike most similar systems, the FreeBSD SCSI system
# does not wire a particular device unit number to any specific
# SCSI bus unit number.  Rather, unit numbers are assigned in the
# order that the devices are found on the SCSI bus.  (This means that
# if you remove a disk drive, you may have to rewrite your /etc/fstab
# file.)  It is expected that this will change for FreeBSD 2.1.
#
controller	scbus0	#base SCSI code
device		ch0	#SCSI media changers
device		sd0	#SCSI disks
device		st0	#SCSI tapes
device		uk0			#unknown scsi devices

#
# The `cd' (SCSI read-only removable disk) driver is special in that
# the code dynamically allocates more units as they are required, with
# no limit (other than memory) to the number available.
device		cd0	#SCSI CD-ROMs


#####################################################################
# MISCELLANEOUS DEVICES AND OPTIONS

#
# Of these, only the `log' device is truly mandatory.  The `pty'
# device usually turns out to be ``effectively mandatory'', as it is
# required for `telnetd', `rlogind', `screen', `emacs', and `xterm',
# among others.
#
pseudo-device	pty	4	#Pseudo ttys
pseudo-device	speaker		#Play IBM BASIC-style noises out your speaker

# HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# ISA and EISA devices:
# Currently there is no separate support for EISA.  There should be.
# Micro Channel is not supported at all.

#
# Mandatory ISA devices: isa, sc, npx
#
controller	isa0

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_DRQ suppresses the DMA conflict checks.  This option is
# not known to be good for anything.
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_IOADDR suppresses the I/O address conflict checks, so
# that the PS/2 mouse driver doesn't conflict with the console driver.
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_IRQ suppresses the interrupt line conflict checks, so
# that multiple devices can share the same IRQ, provided that the
# hardware supports it (it usually doesn't).
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_MEMADDR suppresses the memory address conflict checks.
# This option is not known to be good for anything.
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# No problems are known to be caused by this option.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# BOUNCE_BUFFERS provides support for ISA DMA on machines with more
# than 16 megabytes of memory.  It doesn't hurt on other machines.
# Some broken EISA and VLB hardware may need this, too.
#
# DISKSLICE provides support for slicing up a disk into virtual disks.
# It isn't really ISA-specific, but the on-disk slice table is currently
# required to be a DOS partition table.
#
# DUMMY_NOPS disables extra delays for some bus operations.  The delays
# are mostly for older systems and aren't used consistently.  Probably
# works OK on most EISA bus machines.
#
# TUNE_1542 enables the automatic ISA bus speed selection for the
# Adaptec 1542 boards. Does not work for all boards, use it with caution.
#

# Options for `sc':
#
# NCONS specifies the number of virtual consoles.  Specification of
# this value is mandatory.  Due to a compiler bug, when compiling with
# GCC 2.6.0 this option must be a power of two.
#
# FAT_CURSOR specifies the use of a large block cursor rather than the
# hardware default underline.
#
# HARDFONTS allows the driver to load an ISO-8859-1 font to replace
# the default font in your display adapter's memory.
