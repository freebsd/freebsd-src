# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "sd3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned sd4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# controller	scbus0 at ahc0		# Single bus device
# controller	scbus1 at ahc1 bus 0	# Single bus device
# controller	scbus3 at ahc2 bus 0	# Twin bus device
# controller	scbus2 at ahc2 bus 1	# Twin bus device
# disk 		sd0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# disk		sd1 at scbus3 target 1
# disk		sd2 at scbus2 target 3
# tape		st1 at scbus1 target 6
# device	cd0 at scbus?

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

controller	scbus0	#base SCSI code
device		ch0	#SCSI media changers
device		sd0	#SCSI disks
device		st0	#SCSI tapes
device		cd0	#SCSI CD-ROMs
device		od0	#SCSI optical disk

# The previous devices (ch, sd, st, cd) are recognized by config.
# config doesn't (and shouldn't) know about these newer ones,
# so we have to specify that they are on a SCSI bus with the "at scbus?"
# clause.

device worm0 at scbus?	# SCSI worm
device pt0 at scbus?	# SCSI processor type
device sctarg0 at scbus? # SCSI target

# SCSI OPTIONS:

# SCSIDEBUG: When defined enables debugging macros
# NO_SCSI_SENSE: When defined disables sense descriptions (about 4k)
# SCSI_REPORT_GEOMETRY: Always report disk geometry at boot up instead
#                       of only when booting verbosely.

#
# Notes on the spigot:
#  The video spigot is at 0xad6.  This port address can not be changed.
#  The irq values may only be 10, 11, or 15
#  I/O memory is an 8kb region.  Possible values are:
#    0a0000, 0a2000, ..., 0fffff, f00000, f02000, ..., ffffff
#  Note that the start address must be on an even boundary.

# Notes on the Digiboard driver:
#
# The following flag values have special meanings:
#	0x01 - alternate layout of pins
#	0x02 - use the windowed PC/Xe in 64K mode

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  **This is NOT a Specialix supported Driver!**
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.
#  The Rev 1 host cards use a 64K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# PCI devices:
#
# The main PCI bus device is `pci'.  It provides auto-detection and
# configuration support for all devices on the PCI bus, using either
# configuration mode defined in the PCI specification.
#
# The `ncr' device provides support for the NCR 53C810 and 53C825
# self-contained SCSI host adapters.
#
# The `de' device provides support for the Digital Equipment DC21040
# self-contained Ethernet adapter.
#
# The `vx' device provides support for the 3Com 3C590
# early support
#
# The `fpa' device provides support for the Digital DEFPA PCI FDDI
# adapter. pseudo-device fddi is also needed.
#
# The PROBE_VERBOSE option enables a long listing of chip set registers
# for supported PCI chip sets (currently only intel Saturn and Mercury).
# 
# The 'meteor' device is a PCI video capture board. It can also have the
# following options:
#   options "METEOR_ALLOC_PAGES=xxx"	preallocate kernel pages for data entry
#	figure (ROWS*COLUMN*BYTES_PER_PIXEL*FRAME+PAGE_SIZE-1)/PAGE_SIZE
#   options METEOR_DEALLOC_PAGES	remove all allocated pages on close(2)
#   options "METEOR_DEALLOC_ABOVE=xxx"	remove all allocated pages above the
#	specified amount. If this value is below the allocated amount no action
#	taken
