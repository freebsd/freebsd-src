# Create a kernel.bin file...
# Copy the kernel to u-boot's booti image format (the elf headers are
# stripped and a custom binary head blob is prepended), saving the
# output in a temp file.  We also strip arm "marker" symbols which are
# used only by elf toolchains.  Read the symbols from kernel.full and pass
# them to arm_kernel_boothdr.awk, which generates a binary header blob
# that goes on the front of the stripped kernel.  Cat the header blob
# and the temp file together to make the kernel.bin file.
