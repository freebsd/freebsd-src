# GENERIC -- Generic kernel configuration file for FreeBSD/ia64
#
# For more information on this file, please read the handbook section on
# Kernel Configuration Files:
#
#    http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig-config.html
#
# The handbook is also available locally in /usr/share/doc/handbook
# if you've installed the doc distribution, otherwise always see the
# FreeBSD World Wide Web server (http://www.FreeBSD.org/) for the
# latest information.
#
# An exhaustive list of options and more detailed explanations of the
# device lines is also present in the ../../i386/conf/NOTES file.
# If you are in doubt as to the purpose or necessity of a line, check first
# in NOTES. Please note that this is the i386 NOTES, but it still contains
# valuable info for ia64 too.
