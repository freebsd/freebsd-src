 * Z_t = d X_t + (1 - d) * Z_(t-1); 0 < d <= 1, t >= 1; Roberts (1959).
 * t  : observation number in time.
 * d  : weight for current observation.
 * Xt : observations over time.
 * Zt : EWMA value after observation t.
 *
 * wmba_*_read seems to return up-to [u]long values; have to deal with 32/64bit.
 * According to the ath5k.h change log this seems to be a fix-(_p)recision impl.
 * assert 2/4 bits for frac.
 * Also all (_d) values seem to be pow2 which simplifies maths (shift by
 * d = ilog2(_d) instead of doing division (d = 1/_d)).  Keep it this way until
