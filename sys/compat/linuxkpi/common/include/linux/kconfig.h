/*
 * Checking if an option is defined would be easy if we could do CPP inside CPP.
 * The defined case whether -Dxxx or -Dxxx=1 are easy to deal with.  In either
 * case the defined value is "1". A more general -Dxxx=<c> case will require
 * more effort to deal with all possible "true" values. Hope we do not have
 * to do this as well.
 * The real problem is the undefined case.  To avoid this problem we do the
 * concat/varargs trick: "yyy" ## xxx can make two arguments if xxx is "1"
 * by having a #define for yyy_1 which is "ignore,".
 * Otherwise we will just get "yyy".
 * Need to be careful about variable substitutions in macros though.
 * This way we make a (true, false) problem a (don't care, true, false) or a
 * (don't care true, false).  Then we can use a variadic macro to only select
 * the always well known and defined argument #2.  And that seems to be
 * exactly what we need.  Use 1 for true and 0 for false to also allow
 * #if IS_*() checks pre-compiler checks which do not like #if true.
