 *     on P2P bridges if necessary, so that the requested resources can
 *     be used. Then, the card is marked as locking these resources and
 *     the IO and/or Memory accesse are enabled on the card (including

 *     segment, since P2P bridges don't differenciate VGA memory and IO
 *     afaik). You can indicate whether this blocking should be interruptible
 *     by a signal (for userland interface) or not.
 *     Must not be called at interrupt time or in atomic context.
 *     If the card already owns the resources, the function succeeds.
