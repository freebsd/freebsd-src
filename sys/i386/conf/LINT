# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "sd3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned sd4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# controller	scbus0 at ahc0		# Single bus device
# controller	scbus1 at ahc1 bus 0	# Single bus device
# controller	scbus3 at ahc2 bus 0	# Twin bus device
# controller	scbus2 at ahc2 bus 1	# Twin bus device
# disk 		sd0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# disk		sd1 at scbus3 target 1
# disk		sd2 at scbus2 target 3
# tape		st1 at scbus1 target 6
# device	cd0 at scbus?

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

controller	scbus0	#base SCSI code
device		ch0	#SCSI media changers
device		sd0	#SCSI disks
device		st0	#SCSI tapes
device		cd0	#SCSI CD-ROMs
device		od0	#SCSI optical disk

# The previous devices (ch, sd, st, cd) are recognized by config.
# config doesn't (and shouldn't) know about these newer ones,
# so we have to specify that they are on a SCSI bus with the "at scbus?"
# clause.

device worm0 at scbus?	# SCSI worm
device pt0 at scbus?	# SCSI processor type
device sctarg0 at scbus? # SCSI target

# SCSI OPTIONS:

# SCSIDEBUG: When defined enables debugging macros
# NO_SCSI_SENSE: When defined disables sense descriptions (about 4k)
# SCSI_REPORT_GEOMETRY: Always report disk geometry at boot up instead
#                       of only when booting verbosely.

# Micro Channel is not supported at all.

#
# Mandatory ISA devices: isa, sc or vt, npx
#
controller	isa0

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# BOUNCE_BUFFERS provides support for ISA DMA on machines with more
# than 16 megabytes of memory.  It doesn't hurt on other machines.
# Some broken EISA and VLB hardware may need this, too.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will read the amount of memory from the CMOS RAM,
# so the amount of memory will be limited to 64MB or 16MB depending on
# the BIOS.  The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of
# RAM, it would be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# TUNE_1542 enables the automatic ISA bus speed selection for the
# Adaptec 1542 boards. Does not work for all boards, use it with caution.
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to

#	0x04	don't use the npx registers to optimize copyin or copyout.
# The npx registers are normally used to optimize copying and zeroing when
# all of the following conditions are satisfied:
#	"I586_CPU" is an option
#	the cpu is an i586 (perhaps not a Pentium)
#	the probe for npx0 succeeds
#	INT 16 exception handling works.
# Then copying and zeroing using the npx registers is normally 30-100% faster.
# The flags can be used to control cases where it doesn't work or is slower.
# Setting them at boot time using userconfig works right (the optimizations
# are not used until later in the bootstrap when npx0 is attached).
#

#
# `iosiz' for npx0:
# This can be used instead of the MAXMEM option to set the memory size.  If
# it is nonzero, then it overrides both the MAXMEM option and the memory
# size reported by the BIOS.  Setting it at boot time using userconfig takes
# effect on the next reboot after the change has been recorded in the kernel

#
# specifies that drive 0 will be allowed to probe for 32 bit transfers and

#  Some APM implementations will not work with the `statistics clock'

#
# Notes on the spigot:
#  The video spigot is at 0xad6.  This port address can not be changed.
#  The irq values may only be 10, 11, or 15
#  I/O memory is an 8kb region.  Possible values are:
#    0a0000, 0a2000, ..., 0fffff, f00000, f02000, ..., ffffff
#    The start address must be on an even boundary.
#  Add the following option if you want to allow non-root users to be able
#  to access the spigot.  This option is not secure because it allows users
#  direct access to the I/O page. 
#  	options SPIGOT_UNSECURE
#

# Notes on the Digiboard driver:
#
# The following flag values have special meanings:
#	0x01 - alternate layout of pins
#	0x02 - use the windowed PC/Xe in 64K mode

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  **This is NOT a Specialix supported Driver!**
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.
#  The Rev 1 host cards use a 64K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# Notes on the Stallion stl and stli drivers:
#  See src/i386/isa/README.stl for complete instructions.
#  This is version 0.0.5alpha, unsupported by Stallion.
#  The stl driver has a secondary IO port hard coded at 0x280.  You need
