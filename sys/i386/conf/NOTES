# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI OPTIONS:

# SCSIDEBUG: When defined enables debugging macros
# NO_SCSI_SENSE: When defined disables sense descriptions (about 4k)

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.1 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "sd3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned sd4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# disk sd0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# disk sd1 at scbus0 target 1
# disk sd2 at scbus0 target 3
# tape st1 at scbus0 target 6
# device cd0 at scbus?

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.1) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

# HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# ISA and EISA devices:
# Currently there is no separate support for EISA.  There should be.
# Micro Channel is not supported at all.

#
# Mandatory ISA devices: isa, sc, npx
#
controller	isa0

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_DRQ suppresses the DMA conflict checks.  This option is
# included so that people with sound cards that support multiple emulations
# can setup different sound drivers on the same DMA channel.  There are no
# other known uses for this option.
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_IOADDR suppresses the I/O address conflict checks, so
# that the PS/2 mouse driver doesn't conflict with the console driver.
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_IRQ suppresses the interrupt line conflict checks, so
# that multiple devices can share the same IRQ, provided that the
# hardware supports it (it usually doesn't).
#
# ALLOW_CONFLICT_MEMADDR suppresses the memory address conflict checks.
# This option is not known to be good for anything.
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# No problems are known to be caused by this option.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# BOUNCE_BUFFERS provides support for ISA DMA on machines with more
# than 16 megabytes of memory.  It doesn't hurt on other machines.
# Some broken EISA and VLB hardware may need this, too.
#
# DUMMY_NOPS disables extra delays for some bus operations.  The delays
# are mostly for older systems and aren't used consistently.  Probably
# works OK on most EISA bus machines.
#
# TUNE_1542 enables the automatic ISA bus speed selection for the
# Adaptec 1542 boards. Does not work for all boards, use it with caution.
