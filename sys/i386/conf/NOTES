# SMP OPTIONS:
#
# APIC_IO enables the use of the IO APIC for Symmetric I/O.
#
# Notes:
#
#  An SMP kernel will ONLY run on an Intel MP spec. qualified motherboard.
#
#  Be sure to disable 'cpu I386_CPU' && 'cpu I486_CPU' for SMP kernels.
#
#  Check the 'Rogue SMP hardware' section to see if additional options
#   are required by your hardware.
#

# Mandatory:
options 	APIC_IO			# Symmetric (APIC) I/O

#
# Rogue SMP hardware:
#

# Bridged PCI cards:
#
# The MP tables of most of the current generation MP motherboards
#  do NOT properly support bridged PCI cards.  To use one of these
#  cards you should refer to ???

# CPU OPTIONS

#
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make
# parts of the system run faster.
# I386_CPU is mutually exclusive with the other CPU types.
#
#cpu		I386_CPU		
cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_ATHLON_SSE_HACK tries to enable SSE instructions when the BIOS has
# forgotten to enable them.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it. The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e. enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_ELAN enables support for AMDs ElanSC520 CPU.
#
# CPU_ENABLE_SSE enables SSE/MMX2 instructions support.  This is default
# on I686_CPU and above.
# CPU_DISABLE_SSE explicitly prevent I686_CPU from turning on SSE.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifed the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_UPGRADE_HW_CACHE eliminates unneeded cache flush instruction(s).
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 cpus.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being
# occupied by an ISA memory hole.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_CMPXCHG disables the CMPXCHG instruction on > i386 IA32 
# machines.  VmWare seems to emulate this instruction poorly, causing 
# the guest OS to run very slowly.  Enabling this with a SMP kernel
# will cause the kernel to be unusable.
#
# NOTE 1: The options, CPU_BTB_EN, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_IORT,
# CPU_LOOP_EN and CPU_RSTK_EN should not be used because of CPU bugs.
# These options may crash your system.
#
# NOTE 2: If CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS is not set, CPU cache is enabled
# in write-through mode when revision < 2.7.  If revision of Cyrix
# 6x86 >= 2.7, CPU cache is always enabled in write-back mode.
#
# NOTE 3: This option may cause failures for software that requires
# locked cycles in order to operate correctly.

# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities. The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with the
# sysctl variable kern.polling.enable (defaults off), and select
# the CPU fraction reserved to userland with the sysctl variable
# kern.polling.user_frac (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Only the "dc" "fxp" and "sis" devices support this mode of operation at
# the time of this writing.

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken
# keyboard controllers.

#	I586_CPU is an option
#	the cpu is an i586 (perhaps not a Pentium)
#	the probe for npx0 succeeds
#	INT 16 exception handling works.
# Then copying and zeroing using the npx registers is normally 30-100% faster.
# The flags can be used to control cases where it doesn't work or is slower.

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.

#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# Notes on the Sony Programmable I/O controller
#  This is a temporary driver that should someday be replaced by something
#  that hooks into the ACPI layer. The device is hooked to the PIIX4's
#  General Device 10 decoder, which means you have to fiddle with PCI
#  registers to map it in, even though it is otherwise treated here as
#  an ISA device. At the moment, the driver polls, although the device
#  is capable of generating interrupts. It largely undocumented.
#  The port location in the hint is where you WANT the device to be
#  mapped. 0x10a0 seems to be traditional. At the moment the jogdial
#  is the only thing truly supported, but aparently a fair percentage
#  of the Vaio extra features are controlled by this device.

# Notes on the Stallion stl and stli drivers:
#  See src/i386/isa/README.stl for complete instructions.
#  This is version 0.0.5alpha, unsupported by Stallion.
#  The stl driver has a secondary IO port hard coded at 0x280.  You need
#     to change src/i386/isa/stallion.c if you reconfigure this on the boards.
#  The "flags" and "msize" settings on the stli driver depend on the board:
#	EasyConnection 8/64 ISA:     flags 23         msize 0x1000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 EISA:    flags 24         msize 0x10000

# SysVR4 ABI emulation
#
# The svr4 ABI emulator can be statically compiled into the kernel or loaded as

# The STREAMS network emulation code can also be compiled statically or as a 
# module.  If loaded as a module, it must be loaded before the svr4 module
# (the /usr/sbin/svr4 script does this for you).  If compiling statically,
# the `streams' device must be configured into any kernel which also
# specifies COMPAT_SVR4.  It is possible to have a statically-configured 
# STREAMS device and a dynamically loadable svr4 emulator;  the /usr/sbin/svr4
# script understands that it doesn't need to load the `streams' module under
# those circumstances.
# Caveat:  At this time, `options KTRACE' is required for the svr4 emulator
# (whether static or dynamic).

# VM OPTIONS

# Disable the 4 MByte page PSE CPU feature.  The PSE feature allows the
# kernel to use a 4 MByte pages to map the kernel instead of 4k pages.
# This saves on the amount of memory needed for page tables needed to
# map the kernel.  You should only disable this feature as a temporary
# workaround if you are having problems with it enabled.
#
#options 	DISABLE_PSE

# Disable the global pages PGE CPU feature.  The PGE feature allows pages
# to be marked with the PG_G bit.  TLB entries for these pages are not
# flushed from the cache when %cr3 is reloaded.  This can make context
# switches less expensive.  You should only disable this feature as a
# temporary workaround if you are having problems with it enabled.
