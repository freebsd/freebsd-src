# SMP OPTIONS:
#
# The apic device enables the use of the I/O APIC for interrupt delivery.
# The apic device can be used in both UP and SMP kernels, but is required
# for SMP kernels.  Thus, the apic device is not strictly an SMP option,
# but it is a prerequisite for SMP.
#
# Notes:
#
# HTT CPUs should only be used if they are enabled in the BIOS.  For
# the ACPI case, ACPI only correctly tells us about any HTT CPUs if
# they are enabled.  However, most HTT systems do not list HTT CPUs
# in the MP Table if they are enabled, thus we guess at the HTT CPUs
# for the MP Table case.  However, we shouldn't try to guess and use
# these CPUs if HTT is disabled.  Thus, HTT guessing is only enabled
# for the MP Table if the user explicitly asks for it via the
# MPTABLE_FORCE_HTT option.  Do NOT use this option if you have HTT
# disabled in your BIOS.
#
# IPI_PREEMPTION instructs the kernel to preempt threads running on other
# CPUS if needed.  Relies on the PREEMPTION option

# Mandatory:
device		apic			# I/O apic

# Optional:

# CPU OPTIONS

#
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make
# parts of the system run faster.
#
cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_ATHLON_SSE_HACK tries to enable SSE instructions when the BIOS has
# forgotten to enable them.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it.  The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e., enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_DISABLE_CMPXCHG disables the CMPXCHG instruction on > i386 IA32
# machines.  VmWare 3.x seems to emulate this instruction poorly, causing
# the guest OS to run very slowly.  This problem appears to be fixed in
# VmWare 4.x, at least in version 4.5.2, so that enabling this option with
# VmWare 4.x will result in locking operations to be 20-30 times slower.
# Enabling this with an SMP kernel will cause the kernel to be unusable.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_SSE explicitly prevents I686_CPU from turning on SSE.
#
# CPU_ELAN enables support for AMDs ElanSC520 CPU.
#    CPU_ELAN_PPS enables precision timestamp code.
#    CPU_ELAN_XTAL sets the clock crystal frequency in Hz.
#
# CPU_ENABLE_LONGRUN enables support for Transmeta Crusoe LongRun
# technology which allows to restrict power consumption of the CPU by
# using group of hw.crusoe.* sysctls.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_GEODE is for the SC1100 Geode embedded processor.  This option
# is necessary because the i8254 timecounter is toast.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifies the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SOEKRIS enables support www.soekris.com hardware.
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_UPGRADE_HW_CACHE eliminates unneeded cache flush instruction(s).
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 CPUs.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being
# occupied by an ISA memory hole.
#
# NOTE 1: The options, CPU_BTB_EN, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_IORT,
# CPU_LOOP_EN and CPU_RSTK_EN should not be used because of CPU bugs.
# These options may crash your system.
#
# NOTE 2: If CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS is not set, CPU cache is enabled
# in write-through mode when revision < 2.7.  If revision of Cyrix
# 6x86 >= 2.7, CPU cache is always enabled in write-back mode.
#
# NOTE 3: This option may cause failures for software that requires
# locked cycles in order to operate correctly.

#####################################################################
# NETWORKING OPTIONS

#
# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities.  The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with help of
# the ifconfig(8) utility, and select the CPU fraction reserved to
# userland with the sysctl variable kern.polling.user_frac
# (default 50, range 0..100).
#
# Not all device drivers support this mode of operation at the time of
# this writing.  See polling(4) for more details.

# CLK_CALIBRATION_LOOP causes clock calibration to be run in a loop at

# calibrated relative to the RTC (mc146818a) and this option causes the
# calibration to be repeated.)

# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).
#
# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to

#  This is a temporary driver that should someday be replaced by something

# (the /usr/sbin/svr4 script does this for you).  If compiling statically,
# the `streams' device must be configured into any kernel which also
# specifies COMPAT_SVR4.  It is possible to have a statically-configured
# STREAMS device and a dynamically loadable svr4 emulator;  the /usr/sbin/svr4
# script understands that it doesn't need to load the `streams' module under
# those circumstances.
# Caveat:  At this time, `options KTRACE' is required for the svr4 emulator
# (whether static or dynamic).

# VM OPTIONS

# Disable the 4 MByte page PSE CPU feature.  The PSE feature allows the
# kernel to use 4 MByte pages to map the kernel instead of 4k pages.

# map the kernel.  You should only disable this feature as a temporary
# workaround if you are having problems with it enabled.
#
#options 	DISABLE_PSE

# Disable the global pages PGE CPU feature.  The PGE feature allows pages
# to be marked with the PG_G bit.  TLB entries for these pages are not
# flushed from the cache when %cr3 is reloaded.  This can make context
# switches less expensive.  You should only disable this feature as a
