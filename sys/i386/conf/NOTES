cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_ATHLON_SSE_HACK tries to enable SSE instructions when the BIOS has
# forgotten to enable them.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it. The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e. enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_ENABLE_SSE enables SSE/MMX2 instructions support.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifed the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_UPGRADE_HW_CACHE eliminates unneeded cache flush instruction(s).
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 cpus.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being

# the machine to recover from a panic
#
options 	DDB_UNATTENDED

#
# If using GDB remote mode to debug the kernel, there's a non-standard

# standard and you're on your own if you enable it.  See also the
# "remotechat" variables in the FreeBSD specific version of gdb.
#
options 	GDB_REMOTE_CHAT

#
# KTRACE enables the system-call tracing facility ktrace(2).
#
options 	KTRACE			#kernel tracing

#
# KTR is a kernel tracing mechanism imported from BSD/OS.  Currently it
# has no userland interface aside from a few sysctl's.  It is enabled with
# the KTR option.  The KTR_EXTEND option causes trace events to be generated
# as a string from snprintf rather than as a string and up to 5 argument
# pointers.  KTR_ENTRIES defines the number of entries in the circular trace
# buffer.  KTR_COMPILE defines the mask of events to compile into the kernel
# as defined by the KTR_* constants in <sys/ktr.h>.  KTR_MASK defines the
# initial value of the ktr_mask variable which determines at runtime what
# events to trace.  KTR_CPUMASK determines which CPU's log events, with
# bit X corresponding to cpu X.  KTR_VERBOSE enables dumping of KTR events
# to the console by default.  This functionality can be toggled via the
# debug.ktr_verbose sysctl and defaults to off if KTR_VERBOSE is not defined.

# enabled by default because of the extra time it would take to check
# for these conditions, which can only occur as a result of
# programming errors.
#
options 	INVARIANTS

#
# The INVARIANT_SUPPORT option makes us compile in support for
# verifying some of the internal structures.  It is a prerequisite for
# 'INVARIANTS', as enabling 'INVARIANTS' will make these functions be
# called.  The intent is that you can set 'INVARIANTS' for single
# source files (by changing the source file or specifying it on the
# command line) if you have 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' enabled.  Also, if you
# wish to build a kernel module with 'INVARIANTS', then adding
# 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' to your kernel will provide all the necessary
# infrastructure without the added overhead.
#
options 	INVARIANT_SUPPORT

#
# The DIAGNOSTIC option is used to enable extra debugging information
# from some parts of the kernel.  As this makes everything more noisy,
# it is disabled by default.
#
options 	DIAGNOSTIC

#
# REGRESSION causes optional kernel interfaces necessary only for regression
# testing to be enabled.  These interfaces may consitute security risks
# when enabled, as they permit processes to easily modify aspects of the
# run-time environment to reproduce unlikely or unusual (possibly normally
# impossible) scenarios.
#
options 	REGRESSION

#
# RESTARTABLE_PANICS allows one to continue from a panic as if it were
# a call to the debugger via the Debugger() function instead.  It is only
# useful if a kernel debugger is present.  To restart from a panic, reset
# the panicstr variable to NULL and continue execution.  This option is
# for development use only and should NOT be used in production systems
# to "workaround" a panic.

#
# WARNING:  IPFIREWALL defaults to a policy of "deny ip from any to any"
# and if you do not add other rules during startup to allow access,

# feature works properly.
#
# IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT causes the default rule (at boot) to

# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling
# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms
# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting
# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing
# and other activities. The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)
# potential increase in response times.
# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING
# to achieve smoother behaviour.
# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with the
# sysctl variable kern.polling.enable (defaults off), and select
# the CPU fraction reserved to userland with the sysctl variable
# kern.polling.user_frac (default 50, range 0..100).

# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

hint.scbus.0.at="ahc0"
hint.scbus.1.at="ahc1"
hint.scbus.1.bus="0"
hint.scbus.3.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.3.bus="0"
hint.scbus.2.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.2.bus="1"
hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
hint.da.0.target="0"
hint.da.0.unit="0"
hint.da.1.at="scbus3"
hint.da.1.target="1"
hint.da.2.at="scbus2"
hint.da.2.target="3"
hint.sa.1.at="scbus1"
hint.sa.1.target="6"

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The ch driver drives SCSI Media Changer ("jukebox") devices.
#
# The da driver drives SCSI Direct Access ("disk") and Optical Media
# ("WORM") devices.
#
# The sa driver drives SCSI Sequential Access ("tape") devices.
#
# The cd driver drives SCSI Read Only Direct Access ("cd") devices.
#
# The ses driver drives SCSI Envinronment Services ("ses") and
# SAF-TE ("SCSI Accessable Fault-Tolerant Enclosure") devices.
#
# The pt driver drives SCSI Processor devices.
#
# 
# Target Mode support is provided here but also requires that a SIM
# (SCSI Host Adapter Driver) provide support as well.
#
# The targ driver provides target mode support as a Processor type device.
# It exists to give the minimal context necessary to respond to Inquiry
# commands. There is a sample user application that shows how the rest
# of the command support might be done in /usr/share/examples/scsi_target.
#
# The targbh driver provides target mode support and exists to respond
# to incoming commands that do not otherwise have a logical unit assigned
# to them.
# 
# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration as the "pass" driver.

# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, FreeBSD will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).

# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to
# reset the CPU for reboot.  This is needed on some systems with broken

# The 'dpt' driver provides support for old DPT controllers (http://www.dpt.com/).
# These have hardware RAID-{0,1,5} support, and do multi-initiator I/O.
# The DPT controllers are commonly re-licensed under other brand-names -
# some controllers by Olivetti, Dec, HP, AT&T, SNI, AST, Alphatronic, NEC and
# Compaq are actually DPT controllers.
#
# See src/sys/dev/dpt for debugging and other subtle options.
#   DPT_MEASURE_PERFORMANCE Enables a set of (semi)invasive metrics. Various
#                           instruments are enabled.  The tools in
#                           /usr/sbin/dpt_* assume these to be enabled.
#   DPT_HANDLE_TIMEOUTS     Normally device timeouts are handled by the DPT.
#                           If you ant the driver to handle timeouts, enable
#                           this option.  If your system is very busy, this
#                           option will create more trouble than solve.
#   DPT_TIMEOUT_FACTOR      Used to compute the excessive amount of time to
#                           wait when timing out with the above option.
#  DPT_DEBUG_xxxx           These are controllable from sys/dev/dpt/dpt.h
#  DPT_LOST_IRQ             When enabled, will try, once per second, to catch
#                           any interrupt that got lost.  Seems to help in some

#                           cost, great benefit.
#  DPT_RESET_HBA            Make "reset" actually reset the controller
#                           instead of fudging it.  Only enable this if you

#		the 0x20 flag for that.  Currently, at most one unit can have
#		console support; the first one (in config file order) with
#		this flag set is preferred.  Setting this flag for sio0 gives

#  The flags takes the following meaning for apm0:
#    0x0020  Statclock is broken.
#  If apm is omitted, some systems require sysctl -w kern.timecounter.method=1
#  for correct timekeeping.

# Notes on the spigot:
#  The video spigot is at 0xad6.  This port address can not be changed.
#  The irq values may only be 10, 11, or 15
#  I/O memory is an 8kb region.  Possible values are:
#    0a0000, 0a2000, ..., 0fffff, f00000, f02000, ..., ffffff
#    The start address must be on an even boundary.
#  Add the following option if you want to allow non-root users to be able
#  to access the spigot.  This option is not secure because it allows users
#  direct access to the I/O page.
#  	options SPIGOT_UNSECURE

# Notes on the Comtrol Rocketport driver:
#
# The exact values used for rp0 depend on how many boards you have
# in the system.  The manufacturer's sample configs are listed as:
#
#               device  rp	# core driver support
#
#   Comtrol Rocketport ISA single card
#		hints.rp.0.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.0.port="0x280"
#
#   If instead you have two ISA cards, one installed at 0x100 and the
#   second installed at 0x180, then you should add the following to
#   your kernel probe hints:
#		hints.rp.0.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.0.port="0x100"
#		hints.rp.1.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.1.port="0x180"
#
#   For 4 ISA cards, it might be something like this:
#		hints.rp.0.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.0.port="0x180"
#		hints.rp.1.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.1.port="0x100"
#		hints.rp.2.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.2.port="0x340"
#		hints.rp.3.at="isa"
#		hints.rp.3.port="0x240"
#
#   And for PCI cards, you need no hints.

# Notes on the Digiboard driver:
#
# The following flag values have special meanings in dgb:
#	0x01 - alternate layout of pins
#	0x02 - use the windowed PC/Xe in 64K mode

# Notes on the Specialix SI/XIO driver:
#  The host card is memory, not IO mapped.
#  The Rev 1 host cards use a 64K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The Rev 2 host cards use a 32K chunk, on a 32K boundary.
#  The cards can use an IRQ of 11, 12 or 15.

# Notes on the Sony Programmable I/O controller
#  This is a temporary driver that should someday be replaced by something
#  that hooks into the ACPI layer. The device is hooked to the PIIX4's
#  General Device 10 decoder, which means you have to fiddle with PCI
#  registers to map it in, even though it is otherwise treated here as
#  an ISA device. At the moment, the driver polls, although the device
#  is capable of generating interrupts. It largely undocumented.
#  The port location in the hint is where you WANT the device to be
#  mapped. 0x10a0 seems to be traditional. At the moment the jogdial
#  is the only thing truly supported, but aparently a fair percentage
#  of the Vaio extra features are controlled by this device.

# Notes on the Stallion stl and stli drivers:
#  See src/i386/isa/README.stl for complete instructions.
#  This is version 0.0.5alpha, unsupported by Stallion.
#  The stl driver has a secondary IO port hard coded at 0x280.  You need
#     to change src/i386/isa/stallion.c if you reconfigure this on the boards.
#  The "flags" and "msize" settings on the stli driver depend on the board:
#	EasyConnection 8/64 ISA:     flags 23         msize 0x1000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 EISA:    flags 24         msize 0x10000
#	EasyConnection 8/64 MCA:     flags 25         msize 0x1000
#	ONboard ISA:                 flags 4          msize 0x10000
#	ONboard EISA:                flags 7          msize 0x10000
#	ONboard MCA:                 flags 3          msize 0x10000
#	Brumby:                      flags 2          msize 0x4000

#
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
# or
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC
# Specifes the default video capture mode.
# This is required for Dual Crystal (28&35Mhz) boards where PAL is used
# to prevent hangs during initialisation.  eg VideoLogic Captivator PCI.
#
# options 	BKTR_USE_PLL
# PAL or SECAM users who have a 28Mhz crystal (and no 35Mhz crystal)
# must enable PLL mode with this option. eg some new Bt878 cards.
#
# options 	BKTR_GPIO_ACCESS
# This enable IOCTLs which give user level access to the GPIO port.

# options 	BKTR_NO_MSP_RESET
# Prevents the MSP34xx reset. Good if you initialise the MSP in another OS first
#
# options 	BKTR_430_FX_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into Intel 430FX chipset compatibility mode.
#
# options 	BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into SIS/VIA chipset compatibility mode which is
# needed for some old SiS and VIA chipset motherboards.
# This also allows Bt878/879 chips to work on old OPTi (<1997) chipset
# motherboards and motherboards with bad or incomplete PCI 2.1 support.
# As a rough guess, old = before 1998
