# SMP OPTIONS:
#
# The apic device enables the use of the I/O APIC for interrupt delivery.
# The apic device can be used in both UP and SMP kernels, but is required
# for SMP kernels.  Thus, the apic device is not strictly an SMP option,
# but it is a prerequisite for SMP.
#
# Notes:
#
# HTT CPUs should only be used if they are enabled in the BIOS.  For
# the ACPI case, ACPI only correctly tells us about any HTT CPUs if
# they are enabled.  However, most HTT systems do not list HTT CPUs
# in the MP Table if they are enabled, thus we guess at the HTT CPUs
# for the MP Table case.  However, we shouldn't try to guess and use
# these CPUs if HTT is disabled.  Thus, HTT guessing is only enabled
# for the MP Table if the user explicitly asks for it via the
# MPTABLE_FORCE_HTT option.  Do NOT use this option if you have HTT
# disabled in your BIOS.
#
# IPI_PREEMPTION instructs the kernel to preempt threads running on other
# CPUS if needed.  Relies on the PREEMPTION option

# Mandatory:
device		apic			# I/O apic

# Optional:
options 	MPTABLE_FORCE_HTT	# Enable HTT CPUs with the MP Table

# CPU OPTIONS

#
# You must specify at least one CPU (the one you intend to run on);
# deleting the specification for CPUs you don't need to use may make
# parts of the system run faster.
#
cpu		I486_CPU
cpu		I586_CPU		# aka Pentium(tm)
cpu		I686_CPU		# aka Pentium Pro(tm)

#
# Options for CPU features.
#
# CPU_ATHLON_SSE_HACK tries to enable SSE instructions when the BIOS has
# forgotten to enable them.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_3X enables triple-clock mode on IBM Blue Lightning
# CPU if CPU supports it.  The default is double-clock mode on
# BlueLightning CPU box.
#
# CPU_BLUELIGHTNING_FPU_OP_CACHE enables FPU operand cache on IBM
# BlueLightning CPU.  It works only with Cyrix FPU, and this option
# should not be used with Intel FPU.
#
# CPU_BTB_EN enables branch target buffer on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK enables weak locking for the entire address space
# of Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX CPUs by setting the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1.
# Otherwise, the NO_LOCK bit of CCR1 is cleared.  (NOTE 3)
#
# CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE sets L1 cache of Cyrix 486DLC CPU in direct
# mapped mode.  Default is 2-way set associative mode.
#
# CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER disables load store serialize (i.e., enables
# reorder).  This option should not be used if you use memory mapped
# I/O device(s).
#
# CPU_ELAN enables support for AMDs ElanSC520 CPU.
#    CPU_ELAN_PPS enables precision timestamp code.
#    CPU_ELAN_XTAL sets the clock crystal frequency in Hz.
#
# CPU_ENABLE_LONGRUN enables support for Transmeta Crusoe LongRun
# technology which allows to restrict power consumption of the CPU by
# using group of hw.crusoe.* sysctls.
#
# CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU enables faster FPU exception handler.
#
# CPU_GEODE is for the SC1100 Geode embedded processor.  This option
# is necessary because the i8254 timecounter is toast.
#
# CPU_I486_ON_386 enables CPU cache on i486 based CPU upgrade products
# for i386 machines.
#
# CPU_IORT defines I/O clock delay time (NOTE 1).  Default values of
# I/O clock delay time on Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 are 0 and 7,respectively
# (no clock delay).
#
# CPU_L2_LATENCY specifies the L2 cache latency value.  This option is used
# only when CPU_PPRO2CELERON is defined and Mendocino Celeron is detected.
# The default value is 5.
#
# CPU_LOOP_EN prevents flushing the prefetch buffer if the destination
# of a jump is already present in the prefetch buffer on Cyrix 5x86(NOTE
# 1).
#
# CPU_PPRO2CELERON enables L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.  This option
# is useful when you use Socket 8 to Socket 370 converter, because most Pentium
# Pro BIOSs do not enable L2 cache of Mendocino Celeron CPUs.
#
# CPU_RSTK_EN enables return stack on Cyrix 5x86 (NOTE 1).
#
# CPU_SOEKRIS enables support www.soekris.com hardware.
#
# CPU_SUSP_HLT enables suspend on HALT.  If this option is set, CPU
# enters suspend mode following execution of HALT instruction.
#
# CPU_UPGRADE_HW_CACHE eliminates unneeded cache flush instruction(s).
#
# CPU_WT_ALLOC enables write allocation on Cyrix 6x86/6x86MX and AMD
# K5/K6/K6-2 CPUs.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS enables CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs with cache
# flush at hold state.
#
# CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS enables (1) CPU cache on Cyrix 486 CPUs
# without cache flush at hold state, and (2) write-back CPU cache on
# Cyrix 6x86 whose revision < 2.7 (NOTE 2).
#
# NO_F00F_HACK disables the hack that prevents Pentiums (and ONLY
# Pentiums) from locking up when a LOCK CMPXCHG8B instruction is
# executed.  This option is only needed if I586_CPU is also defined,
# and should be included for any non-Pentium CPU that defines it.
#
# NO_MEMORY_HOLE is an optimisation for systems with AMD K6 processors
# which indicates that the 15-16MB range is *definitely* not being
# occupied by an ISA memory hole.
#
# NOTE 1: The options, CPU_BTB_EN, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_IORT,
# CPU_LOOP_EN and CPU_RSTK_EN should not be used because of CPU bugs.
# These options may crash your system.
#
# NOTE 2: If CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS is not set, CPU cache is enabled
# in write-through mode when revision < 2.7.  If revision of Cyrix
# 6x86 >= 2.7, CPU cache is always enabled in write-back mode.
#
# NOTE 3: This option may cause failures for software that requires
# locked cycles in order to operate correctly.

envvar		hint.npx.0.flags="0x0"

#
# `flags' for npx0:
#	0x01	don't use the npx registers to optimize bcopy.
#	0x02	don't use the npx registers to optimize bzero.
#	0x04	don't use the npx registers to optimize copyin or copyout.
# The npx registers are normally used to optimize copying and zeroing when
# all of the following conditions are satisfied:
#	I586_CPU is an option
#	the cpu is an i586 (perhaps not a Pentium)
#	the probe for npx0 succeeds
#	INT 16 exception handling works.
# Then copying and zeroing using the npx registers is normally 30-100% faster.
# The flags can be used to control cases where it doesn't work or is slower.
# Setting them at boot time using hints works right (the optimizations
# are not used until later in the bootstrap when npx0 is attached).
# Flag 0x08 automatically disables the i586 optimized routines.

# VM OPTIONS

#
# Set the number of PV entries per process.  Increasing this can
# stop panics related to heavy use of shared memory.  However, that can
# (combined with large amounts of physical memory) cause panics at
# boot time due the kernel running out of VM space.
#
# If you're tweaking this, you might also want to increase the sysctls
# "vm.v_free_min", "vm.v_free_reserved", and "vm.v_free_target".
#
# The value below is the one more than the default.
#
options 	PMAP_SHPGPERPROC=201

#
# Number of initial kernel page table pages used for early bootstrap.
# This number should include enough pages to map the kernel, any
# modules or other data loaded with the kernel by the loader, and data
# structures allocated before the VM system is initialized such as the
# vm_page_t array.  Each page table page maps 4MB (2MB with PAE).
