/*
 * the problem with a full 32-bit stack segment is that 16-bit code
 * tends to do a pushf, which only pushes %sp, not %esp.  This value
 * is then popped off (into %esp) which causes a page fault because 
 * it is the wrong address.
 *
 * the reverse problem happens for 16-bit stack addresses; the kernel
 * code attempts to get the address of something on the stack, and the
 * value returned is the address relative to %ss, not %ds.
 *
 * we fix this by installing a temporary stack at page 0, so the
 * addresses are always valid in both 32 bit and 16 bit modes.
