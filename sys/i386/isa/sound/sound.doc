Instructions on using audio on a FreeBSD 2.1 (or 2.0-current) system.
See also /sys/i386/conf/LINT.

To enable sound driver support, the controller sound code must be included
in your config file:

# SB = SoundBlaster;  PAS = ProAudioSpectrum;  GUS = Gravis UltraSound
# Controls all sound devices
controller	snd0

Uncomment one or more of these device entries, depending on what type of
sound card you have:

# ProAudioSpectrum PCM and Midi - for PAS
#device pas0     at isa? port 0x388 irq 10 drq 6 vector pasintr

# SoundBlaster DSP driver - for SB, SB Pro, SB16, PAS(emulating SB)
#device sb0      at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 1 vector sbintr

# SoundBlaster 16 DSP driver - for SB16 - requires sb0 device
#device sbxvi0   at isa? drq 5

# SoundBlaster 16 MIDI - for SB16 - requires sb0 device
#device sbmidi0  at isa? port 0x300

# Gravis UltraSound - for GUS, GUS16, GUSMAX
#device gus0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 11 drq 1 flags 0x3 vector gusintr

# Gravis UltraSound 16 bit option - for GUS16 - requires gus0
#device gusxvi0 at isa? port 0x530 irq 7 drq 3 vector adintr

# MS Sound System (AD1848 Based Boards)
#device mss0 at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 1 vector adintr

# Yamaha OPL-2/OPL-3 FM - for SB, SB Pro, SB16, PAS
#device opl0     at isa? port 0x388

# MPU-401 - for MPU-401 standalone card
#device mpu0     at isa? port 0x330 irq 6 drq 0

# 6850 UART Midi
#device uart0 at isa? port 0x330 irq 5 vector "m6850intr"

You may add one or more of the following depending on what you do and don't
want compiled into your kernel.  Note:  Excluding things with EXCLUDE_... 
is NOT recommended unless you really know what you're doing.

#options 	EXCLUDE_AUDIO			# NO digital audio support
#options 	EXCLUDE_SEQUENCER		# NO sequencer support
#options	EXCLUDE_MIDI			# NO MIDI support whatsoever
#options 	EXCLUDE_SBPRO			# EXCLUDE SB Pro support
#options 	EXCLUDE_SB_EMULATION		# NO PAS SB emulation support
#options 	EXCLUDE_GUS_IODETECT		# NO GUS io detection
#options 	EXCLUDE_PRO_MIDI		# NO PAS MIDI support

Other Options:

#options	SYMPHONY_PAS
	Adds some code to make pas work with Symphony chipsets.  Only use
	this if your pas doesn't work and you have a Symphony chipset.

#options	BROKEN_BUS_CLOCK
	Some systems with the OPTI chipset and a PAS will require you to
	use this option.  Symptoms are that you will hear a lot of clicking and
	popping sounds, like a geiger counter, coming out of the PAS even when
	it is not playing anything.

#options	MOZART_PORT
	Adds support for Mozart (OAK OTI-601). (Part of the MSS driver)

#options	OPTI_MAD16_PORT
	Adds support for the OPTI MAD16 Chip. (Part of the MSS driver)

#options	__SGNXPRO__
	Adds support for the SG NX Pro mixer. (Part of the SB driver)

#options	JAZZ16
	Adds support for the MV Jazz16 (ProSonic etc). (Part of the SB Driver)

#options	SM_WAVE
	Adds support for the SoundMan Wave (Part of the SB Driver)
	Note:  You will need to do some work to get this to work.
	       See i386/isa/sound/configure.c

#options	SM_GAMES
	Adds support for the Logitech SoundMan Games (Part of the SB Driver)

#options	PAS_JOYSTICK_ENABLE
	Enables the gameport on the ProAudio Spectrum

NOTE:  The MPU-401 driver may or may not work, and is unfortunately
unverifiable since no one I know has one.  If you can test this,
please let me know!  Also note that you will have to change these
settings if your soundcard is set for a non-standard address or IRQ.
Please check your documentation (or verify with any provided DOS utilities
that may have come with your card) and set the IRQ or address fields
accordingly.


Also:  You can configure more then one card on a single DMA using 
ALLOW_CONFLICT_DMA.  This is useful for boards with more then one type of
emulation.


Probing problems:  Since the SB16 uses the same IRQ and addresses for
the different drivers, some of the snd dirvers will not be probed because
the kernel thinks there is a conflict.  This can be worked-around by
setting the ALLOW_CONFLICT_IOADDR or ALLOW_CONFLICT_IRQ options.
