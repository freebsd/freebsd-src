Changelog for version 2.5
-------------------------

Since 2.5-beta2
- Some fine tuning to the GUS v3.7 mixer code.
- Fixed speed limits for the plain SB (1.0 to 2.0).

Since 2.5-beta
- Fixed OPL-3 detection with SB. Caused problems with PAS16.
- GUS v3.7 mixer support.

Since 2.4
- Mixer support for Sound Galaxy NX Pro (define __SGNXPRO__ on your local.h).
- Fixed truncated sound on /dev/dsp when the device is closed.
- Linear volume mode for GUS
- Pitch bends larger than +/- 2 octaves.
- MIDI recording for SB and SB Pro. (Untested).
- Some other fixes.
- SB16 MIDI and DSP drivers only initialized if SB16 actually installed.
- Implemented better detection for OPL-3. This should be usefull if you
  have an old SB Pro (the non-OPL-3 one) or a SB 2.0 clone which has a OPL-3.
- SVR4.2 support by Ian Hartas. Initial ALPHA TEST version (untested).

Since 2.3b
- Fixed bug which made it impossible to make long recordings to disk.
  Recording was not restarted after a buffer overflow situation.
- Limited mixer support for GUS.
- Numerous improvements to the GUS driver by Andrew Robinson. Including
  some click removal etc.

Since 2.3
- Fixed some minor bugs in the SB16 driver.

Since 2.2b
- Full SB16 DSP support. 8/16 bit, mono/stereo
- The SCO and FreeBSD versions should be in sync now. There are some
  problems with SB16 and GUS in the freebsd versions.
  The DMA buffer allocation of the SCO version has been polished but
  there could still be some problems. At least it hogs memory.
  The DMA channel
  configuration method used in the sco/System is a hack.
- Support for the MPU emulation of the SB16.
- Some big arrays are now allocated boot time. This makes the bss segment
  smaller which makes it possible to use the full driver with
  NetBSD. These arrays are not allocated if no suitable soundcard is available.
- Fixed a bug in the compute_and_set_volume in gus_wave.c
- Fixed the too fast mono playback problem of SB Pro and PAS16.

Since 2.2
- Stereo recording for SB Pro. Somehow it was missing and nobody
  had noticed it earlier.
- Minor polishing.
- Interpreting of boot time arguments (sound=) for Linux.
- Breakup of sb_dsp.c. Parts of the code has been moved to
  sb_mixer.c and sb_midi.c

Since 2.1
- Preliminary support for SB16. 
  - The SB16 mixer is supported in it's native mode.
  - Digitized voice capability up to 44.1 kHz/8 bit/mono
    (16 bit and stereo support coming in the next release).
- Fixed some bugs in the digitized voice driver for PAS16.
- Proper initialization of the SB emulation of latest PAS16 models.

- Significantly improved /dev/dsp and /dev/audio support.
  - Now supports half duplex mode. It's now possible to record and
    playback without closing and reopening the device.
  - It's possible to use smaller buffers than earlier. There is a new
    ioctl(fd, SNDCTL_DSP_SUBDIVIDE, &n) where n should be 1, 2 or 4.
    This call instructs the driver to use smaller buffers. The default
    buffer size (0.5 to 1.0 seconds) is divided by n. Should be called
    immediately after opening the device.

Since 2.0
Just cosmetic changes.
