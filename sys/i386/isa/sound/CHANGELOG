Changelog for version 3.5-alpha7
--------------------------------

Since 3.5-alpha6
- Changed all #ifndef EXCLUDE_xx stuff to #ifdef CONFIG_xx. Modified
configure to handle this. 
- Removed initialization messages from the
modularized version. They can be enabled by using init_trace=1 in
the insmod command line (insmod sound init_trace=1).
- More AIX stuff.
- Added support for syncronizing dsp/audio devices with /dev/sequencer.
- mmap() support for dsp/audio devices.

Since 3.5-alpha5
- AIX port.
- Changed some xxx_PATCH macros in soundcard.h to work with
  big endian machines.

Since 3.5-alpha4
- Removed the 'setfx' stuff from the version distributed with kernel
  sources.

Since 3.5-alpha3
- Moved stuff from the 'setfx' program to the AudioTriX Pro driver.

Since 3.5-alpha2
- Modifications to makefile and configure.c. Unnecessary sources
  are no longer compiled. Newly created local.h is also copied to
  /etc/soundconf. "make oldconfig" reads /etc/soundconf and produces
  new local.h which is compatible with current version of the driver.
- Some fixes to the SB16 support.
- Fixed random protection fault in gus_wave.c

Since 3.5-alpha1
- Modified to work with Linux-1.3.33 and leater
- Some minor changes

Since 3.0.2
- Support for CS4232 based PnP cards (AcerMagic S23 etc).
- Full duplex support for some CS4231, CS4232 and AD1845 based cards
(GUA MAX, AudioTrix Pro, AcerMagic S23 and many MAD16/Mozart cards
having a codec mentioned above).
- Almost fully rewritten loadable modules support.
- Fixed some bugs.
- Huge amount of testing (more testing is still required).
- mmap() support (works with some cards). Requires much more testing.
- Sample/patch/program loading for TB Maui/Tropez. No initialization
since TB doesn't allow me to release that code.
- Using CS4231 compatible codecs as timer for /dev/music.

Since 3.0.1
- Added allocation of I/O ports, DMA channels and interrupts
to the initialization code. This may break modules support since
the driver may not free some resources on unload. Should be fixed soon.

Since 3.0
- Some important bug fixes. 
- select() for /dev/dsp and /dev/audio (Linux only).
(To use select() with read, you have to call read() to start
the recording. Calling write() kills recording immediately so
use select() carefully when you are writing a half duplex app.
Full duplex mode is not implemented yet.) Select works also with
/dev/sequencer and /dev/music. Maybe with /dev/midi## too.

Since 3.0-beta2
- Minor fixes.
- Added Readme.cards

Since 3.0-beta1
- Minor fixes to the modules support.
- Eliminated call to sb_free_irq() in ad1848.c
- Rewritten MAD16&Mozart support (not tested with MAD16 Pro).
- Fix to DMA initialization of PSS cards.
- Some fixes to ad1848/cs42xx mixer support (GUS MAX, MSS, etc.)
- Fixed some bugs in the PSS driver which caused I/O errors with
  the MSS mode (/dev/dsp).

Since 3.0-950506
- Recording with GUS MAX fixed. It works when the driver is configured
  to use two DMA channels with GUS MAX (16 bit ones recommended).

Since 3.0-94xxxx
- Too many changes

Since 3.0-940818
- Fixes for Linux 1.1.4x.
- Disables Disney Sound System with SG NX Pro 16 (less noise).

Since 2.90-2
- Fixes to soundcard.h
- Non blocking mode to /dev/sequencer
- Experimental detection code for Ensoniq Soundscape.

Since 2.90
- Minor and major bug fixes

Since pre-3.0-940712
- GUS MAX support
- Partially working MSS/WSS support (could work with some cards).
- Hardware u-Law and A-Law support with AD1848/CS4248 and CS4231 codecs
  (GUS MAX, GUS16, WSS etc). Hardware ADPCM is possible with GUS16 and
  GUS MAX, but it doesn't work yet.
Since pre-3.0-940426
- AD1848/CS4248/CS4231 codec support (MSS, GUS MAX, Aztec, Orchid etc).
This codec chip is used in various soundcards. This version is developed
for the 16 bit daughtercard of GUS. It should work with other cards also
if the following requirements are met:
	- The I/O, IRQ and DMA settings are jumper selectable or
	the card is initialized by booting DOS before booting Linux (etc.).
	- You add the IO, IRQ and DMA settings manually to the local.h.
	  (Just define GUS16_BASE, GUS16_IRQ and GUS16_DMA). Note that
	the base address bust be the base address of the codec chip not the
	card itself. For the GUS16 these are the same but most MSS compatible
	cards have the codec located at card_base+4.
- Some minor changes

Since 2.5 (******* MAJOR REWRITE ***********)

This version is based on v2.3. I have tried to maintain two versions
together so that this one should have the same features than v2.5.
Something may still be missing. If you notice such things, please let me
know.

The Readme.v30 contains more details.

- /dev/midi## devices.
- /dev/sequencer2

Since 2.5-beta2
- Some fine tuning to the GUS v3.7 mixer code.
- Fixed speed limits for the plain SB (1.0 to 2.0).

Since 2.5-beta
- Fixed OPL-3 detection with SB. Caused problems with PAS16.
- GUS v3.7 mixer support.

Since 2.4
- Mixer support for Sound Galaxy NX Pro (define __SGNXPRO__ on your local.h).
- Fixed truncated sound on /dev/dsp when the device is closed.
- Linear volume mode for GUS
- Pitch bends larger than +/- 2 octaves.
- MIDI recording for SB and SB Pro. (Untested).
- Some other fixes.
- SB16 MIDI and DSP drivers only initialized if SB16 actually installed.
- Implemented better detection for OPL-3. This should be useful if you
  have an old SB Pro (the non-OPL-3 one) or a SB 2.0 clone which has a OPL-3.
- SVR4.2 support by Ian Hartas. Initial ALPHA TEST version (untested).

Since 2.3b
- Fixed bug which made it impossible to make long recordings to disk.
  Recording was not restarted after a buffer overflow situation.
- Limited mixer support for GUS.
- Numerous improvements to the GUS driver by Andrew Robinson. Including
  some click removal etc.

Since 2.3
- Fixed some minor bugs in the SB16 driver.

Since 2.2b
- Full SB16 DSP support. 8/16 bit, mono/stereo
- The SCO and FreeBSD versions should be in sync now. There are some
  problems with SB16 and GUS in the freebsd versions.
  The DMA buffer allocation of the SCO version has been polished but
  there could still be some problems. At least it hogs memory.
  The DMA channel
  configuration method used in the sco/System is a hack.
- Support for the MPU emulation of the SB16.
- Some big arrays are now allocated boot time. This makes the bss segment
  smaller which makes it possible to use the full driver with
  NetBSD. These arrays are not allocated if no suitable soundcard is available.
- Fixed a bug in the compute_and_set_volume in gus_wave.c
- Fixed the too fast mono playback problem of SB Pro and PAS16.

Since 2.2
- Stereo recording for SB Pro. Somehow it was missing and nobody
  had noticed it earlier.
- Minor polishing.
- Interpreting of boot time arguments (sound=) for Linux.
- Breakup of sb_dsp.c. Parts of the code has been moved to
  sb_mixer.c and sb_midi.c

Since 2.1
- Preliminary support for SB16. 
  - The SB16 mixer is supported in its native mode.
  - Digitized voice capability up to 44.1 kHz/8 bit/mono
    (16 bit and stereo support coming in the next release).
- Fixed some bugs in the digitized voice driver for PAS16.
- Proper initialization of the SB emulation of latest PAS16 models.

- Significantly improved /dev/dsp and /dev/audio support.
  - Now supports half duplex mode. It's now possible to record and
    playback without closing and reopening the device.
  - It's possible to use smaller buffers than earlier. There is a new
    ioctl(fd, SNDCTL_DSP_SUBDIVIDE, &n) where n should be 1, 2 or 4.
    This call instructs the driver to use smaller buffers. The default
    buffer size (0.5 to 1.0 seconds) is divided by n. Should be called
    immediately after opening the device.

Since 2.0
Just cosmetic changes.
