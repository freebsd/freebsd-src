In this file I will try to build a database of cards supported by
this driver. I also include the command to use for manual configuration
of the card in case your BIOS is not PnP-aware. Of course it is
your responsibility to pick up free port ranges and irq and drq
channels.

For PnP cards, I also include the vendor_id and serial numbers of
cards I have encountered. Underscores in the PnP id mean that
(I believe) there is a large variety of values in those positions,
and the code in the audio driver generally masks those bits.

Finally, where available, I have put the URL where you can find the
data sheets of the chip.

To my knowledge, there are the following families of audio cards:

* WSS (also called MSS) and clones:
   these are true full duplex cards, have a very nice architecture and
   are well documented. Chipsets implementing these functionalities
   are made from Crystal, Analog Devices, Yamaha, OPTI.

* SB16 and clones:
   these cards have a higly asymmetric architecture, and are not very
   well suited to full duplex operation. Made by Creative, Realtek.
   There is no documentation on the newer codecs (Vibra16X and ALS100+),
   so they are not fully working.

* ESS
   ESS builds cards that implement a superset of SB16. They are
   often capable of full duplex, but my driver does not support them
   other than in full duplex emulation. My fault, since documentation
   on these cards _is_ available.

* PCI cards.
   I have no documentation on these cards, so they are unsupported by
   my driver. Note that CreativeLabs has recently (fall'97) acquired
   Ensoniq and the audio division of OPTI, both of which had a PCI
   audio chipset. I don't know if there are other manufacturers of PCI
   audio cards.

Finally, some people wrote patches for the following chips:

COMMENTS:
    Work like a charm. All modes, including full duplex, supported in
    MSS mode.

    Cards based on the 4237, and possibly the 4236 as well, connect
    the CD to AUX2. When used in MODE1/2 (as this driver does)
    there is no route in the input mixer from AUX2 to the ADC. So,
    to record directly from the CD, the only way is to set the
    input to SOUND_MASK_IMIX.

COMMENTS:
    This chip is reported as broken in the OSS documentation. As a
    matter of fact, on my Intel Zappa motherboard, I have problems in
    make it use the secondary DMA channel. I have it working in
    half duplex (both capture and playback) in SB3.2 emulation,
    and working in playback mode in MSS emulation.
    Also have reports from some user that it works ok.

PNP CONFIG:

COMMENTS:
    The data sheets of this chip are very cryptic and do not match
    what the cards I have seem to do. I have it working
    in WSS emulation, in full duplex and all modes.
    In SB emulation mode the driver does not work yet (maybe I do
    not initialize it the right way). It is not a major concern
    anyways.
    I am strongly convinced of a couple of bugs in the chip. I have
    sent email to OPTI but got no reply so far. The bugs are:
    - you cannot set both playback and capture format to use
      a companded mode (ULAW, ALAW). If you do, the card will screw
      up on the capture section.
      The driver has a partial fix in software: when using ULAW, it
      programs ULAW on the playback section, U8 on the capture, and
      does a conversion in software (much like the SBPro). Of course
      you lose 4-5 bits of dynamic range in the process.
    - in full duplex (and single DMA mode), the card occasionally
      misses interrupts, or generates spurious ones, or generates
      interrupts before setting the status bits in the registers.
      Spurious ints are not problematic since they can be easily
      ignored, but missing interrupts are a nightmare to handle...
      The only way to have this card work semi-reliably is to use
      auto-dma mode (which is the default mode of operation in the
      driver).
    In any case, these cards are very cheap and widely available and
    are a reasonable solution if you cannot find some other decent WSS
    device.

COMMENTS:
    SB16 really refers to a large number of different cards, starting
    from the original, non-PnP SB16, to more modern cards (SB16PnP,
    Vibra16C) and other including Wavetable Synthesis (AWE32, AWE64,
    etc.). All these cards have different PnP ID.  They have
    different synthesis devices, which we do not support, so we
    are not affected by these differences. Don't worry if the driver
    identifies the card as a different SB16 than the one you have.

    BEWARE -- all recent (1998 ?) SB16 use a new codec, Vibra16X,
    which is sufficiently different from the old one to not work with
    this driver in capture mode or in full duplex. Documentation is
    not available from Creative. I suggest to stay away from these
    cards (and from SB16 in general).

    Full duplex support of this card is tricky since one channel can
    work in 16-bit and the other in 8-bit mode. You will need to use
    the new set of ioctl to use separate data formats on the two
    channels (the vat driver does this). Of course, quality in 8-bit
    is much lower than in 16-bit.

    Full duplex operation is unsupported by Creative. It seems to
    work, although on my Vibra16C the command to stop DMA transfer
    seems to erroneously affect both channels instead of the one
    they are issued for. The driver has a workaround, but I cannot
    guarantee that it works for everybody. I have had several
    positive reports.

    are at http://multiverse.com/~rhh/awedrv

    This is a huge file containing a few pages scanned and converted
    to pdf. Not very detailed. Luckily, this chipset appears to do a
    good (i.e. bug-free) emulation of the WSS, so it is fully
    supported by the driver.

    pnp 1 0 os enable port0 0x220 port1 0x530 port2 0x388 port3 0x370 irq0 5 drq0 1 drq1 5

    this card emulates a WSS or SB. Have reports that it works, although
    it has incomplete mixer support (Yamaha defines an additional set
    of registers to control some mixer functions, such as the master
    output volume -- this is at 0x370 or 0x310). Currently we set
    the master volume to 100% for the PnP card. Will put in code to do the
    same for the non PnP card as soon as I find out how to tell
    the Yamaha from other cards.
    Driver reported to work also on
    Toshiba DynaBook Portege 300CT with OPL3SA-3(non-PNP), and on the
    Libretto50CT (has the non-PnP device).

    This code _cannot_ work on these cards as it is now, since I

    no data sheets available for these PCI cards, none of them is
    supported at the moment.
