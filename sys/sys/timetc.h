 * `struct timecounter' is the interface between the hardware which implements
 * a timecounter and the MI code which uses this to keep track of time.
 *
 * A timecounter is a binary counter which has two properties:
 *    * it runs at a fixed, known frequency.
 *    * it has sufficient bits to not roll over in less than approximately
 *      max(2 msec, 2/HZ seconds).  (The value 2 here is really 1 + delta,
 *      for some indeterminate value of delta.)
