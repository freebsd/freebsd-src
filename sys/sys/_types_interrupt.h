/**
 * @brief Driver interrupt filter return values
 *
 * If a driver provides an interrupt filter routine it must return an
 * integer consisting of oring together zero or more of the following
 * flags:
 *
 *	FILTER_STRAY	- this device did not trigger the interrupt
 *	FILTER_HANDLED	- the interrupt has been fully handled and can be EOId
 *	FILTER_SCHEDULE_THREAD - the threaded interrupt handler should be
 *			  scheduled to execute
 *
 * If the driver does not provide a filter, then the interrupt code will
 * act is if the filter had returned FILTER_SCHEDULE_THREAD.  Note that it
 * is illegal to specify any other flag with FILTER_STRAY and that it is
 * illegal to not specify either of FILTER_HANDLED or FILTER_SCHEDULE_THREAD
 * if FILTER_STRAY is not specified.

/**
 * @brief Driver interrupt service routines
 *
 * The filter routine is run in primary interrupt context and may not
 * block or use regular mutexes.  It may only use spin mutexes for
 * synchronization.  The filter may either completely handle the
 * interrupt or it may perform some of the work and defer more
 * expensive work to the regular interrupt handler.  If a filter
 * routine is not registered by the driver, then the regular interrupt
 * handler is always used to handle interrupts from this device.
 *
 * The regular interrupt handler executes in its own thread context
 * and may use regular mutexes.  However, it is prohibited from
 * sleeping on a sleep queue.

/**
 * @brief Interrupt type bits.
 *
 * These flags may be passed by drivers to bus_setup_intr(9) when
 * registering a new interrupt handler. The field is overloaded to
 * specify both the interrupt's type and any special properties.
 *
 * The INTR_TYPE* bits will be passed to intr_priority(9) to determine
 * the scheduling priority of the handler's ithread. Historically, each
 * type was assigned a unique scheduling preference, but now only
 * INTR_TYPE_CLK receives a default priority higher than other
 * interrupts. See sys/priority.h.
 *
 * Buses may choose to modify or augment these flags as appropriate,
 * e.g. nexus may apply INTR_EXCL.
