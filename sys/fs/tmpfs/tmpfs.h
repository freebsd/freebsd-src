 *
 * It is imporant to notice that directories do not have entries for . and

 * importantly, to remove redundancy. */

/* Each entry in a directory has a cookie that identifies it.  Cookies
 * supersede offsets within directories because, given how tmpfs stores
 * directories in memory, there is no such thing as an offset.  (Emulating
 * a real offset could be very difficult.)
 * 
 * The '.', '..' and the end of directory markers have fixed cookies which
 * cannot collide with the cookies generated by other entries.  The cookies
 * fot the other entries are generated based on the memory address on which
 * stores their information is stored.
 *
 * Ideally, using the entry's memory pointer as the cookie would be enough
 * to represent it and it wouldn't cause collisions in any system.
 * Unfortunately, this results in "offsets" with very large values which
 * later raise problems in the Linux compatibility layer (and maybe in other
 * places) as described in PR kern/32034.  Hence we need to workaround this
 * with a rather ugly hack.
 *
 * Linux 32-bit binaries, unless built with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, have off_t
 * set to 'long', which is a 32-bit *signed* long integer.  Regardless of
 * the macro value, GLIBC (2.3 at least) always uses the getdents64
 * system call (when calling readdir) which internally returns off64_t
 * offsets.  In order to make 32-bit binaries work, *GLIBC* converts the
 * 64-bit values returned by the kernel to 32-bit ones and aborts with
 * EOVERFLOW if the conversion results in values that won't fit in 32-bit
 * integers (which it assumes is because the directory is extremely large).
 * This wouldn't cause problems if we were dealing with unsigned integers,
 * but as we have signed integers, this check fails due to sign expansion.
 *
 * For example, consider that the kernel returns the 0xc1234567 cookie to
 * userspace in a off64_t integer.  Later on, GLIBC casts this value to
 * off_t (remember, signed) with code similar to:
 *     system call returns the offset in kernel_value;
 *     off_t casted_value = kernel_value;
 *     if (sizeof(off_t) != sizeof(off64_t) &&
 *         kernel_value != casted_value)
 *             error!
 * In this case, casted_value still has 0xc1234567, but when it is compared
 * for equality against kernel_value, it is promoted to a 64-bit integer and
 * becomes 0xffffffffc1234567, which is different than 0x00000000c1234567.
 * Then, GLIBC assumes this is because the directory is very large.
 *
 * Given that all the above happens in user-space, we have no control over
 * it; therefore we must workaround the issue here.  We do this by
 * truncating the pointer value to a 32-bit integer and hope that there
 * won't be collisions.  In fact, this will not cause any problems in
 * 32-bit platforms but some might arise in 64-bit machines (I'm not sure
 * if they can happen at all in practice).
 *
 * XXX A nicer solution shall be attempted. */
