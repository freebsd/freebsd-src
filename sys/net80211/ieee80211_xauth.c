 * This support is optional; it is only used when the 802.11 layer's
 * authentication mode is set to use 802.1x or WPA is enabled separately
 * (for WPA-PSK).  If compiled as a module this code does not need
 * to be present unless 802.1x/WPA is in use.

 * The authenticator hooks into the 802.11 layer.  At present we use none
 * of the available callbacks--the user mode authenticator process works
