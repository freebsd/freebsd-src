/*
 *  ALGORITHM
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many people for bug reports and testing.

 *  ALGORITHM
 *
 *      The "deflation" process uses several Huffman trees. The more
 *      common source values are represented by shorter bit sequences.
 *
 *      Each code tree is stored in a compressed form which is itself
 * a Huffman encoding of the lengths of all the code strings (in
 * ascending order by source values).  The actual code strings are
 * reconstructed from the lengths in the inflate process, as described

/*
   Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:

   1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output
      stream.
   2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.
   3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and
      15 bits for the actual data.
   4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero
      would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two
      codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).
   5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be
      sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would
      store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be
      too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow
      zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in
      length.
   6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the
      end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines
      288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287
      cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits
      defined for them.  Similarily, there are up to 30 distance codes.
      However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the
      Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.
   7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.
      The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).
   8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of
      literal codes sent minus 257.
   9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits
      (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output
      three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,
      you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.
  10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment
      only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)
  11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)
  12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285
      really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code
      since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length
      258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.
  13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a
      single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for
      a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between
      the two sets of lengths.

/*
   Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
   The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
   size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
   to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
   is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
   shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
   the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
   shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
   the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
   then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

   This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits
   below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
   length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for
   the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to
   those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the
   codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in
   bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested
   table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is
   used.

   There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a
   different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table
   codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight
   bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less
   than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being
   about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.
   The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and
   possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.
