/*
 * A sysctl(3) MIB for generic interface information.  This information
 * is exported in the net.link.generic branch, which has the following
 * structure:
 *
 * net.link.generic	.system			- system-wide control variables
 *						  and statistics (node)
 *			.ifdata.<ifindex>.general
 *						- what's in `struct ifdata'
 *						  plus some other info
 *			.ifdata.<ifindex>.linkspecific
 *						- a link-type-specific data
 *						  structure (as might be used
 *						  by an SNMP agent
 *
 * Perhaps someday we will make addresses accessible via this interface
 * as well (then there will be four such...).  The reason that the
 * index comes before the last element in the name is because it
 * seems more orthogonal that way, particularly with the possibility
 * of other per-interface data living down here as well (e.g., integrated
 * services stuff).
