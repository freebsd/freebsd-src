 * Pounded on heavily by Chris Torek (chris@mimsy.umd.edu, umcp-cs!chris).
 * N.B.: this belongs in netinet, not net, the way it stands now.
 * Should have a link-layer type designation, but wouldn't be
 * backwards-compatible.
 *
 * Converted to 4.3BSD Beta by Chris Torek.
 * Other changes made at Berkeley, based in part on code by Kirk Smith.
 * W. Jolitz added slip abort.
 *
 * Hacked almost beyond recognition by Van Jacobson (van@helios.ee.lbl.gov).
 * Added priority queuing for "interactive" traffic; hooks for TCP
 * header compression; ICMP filtering (at 2400 baud, some cretin
 * pinging you can use up all your bandwidth).  Made low clist behavior
 * more robust and slightly less likely to hang serial line.
 * Sped up a bunch of things.
 * 
 * Note that splimp() is used throughout to block both (tty) input
 * interrupts and network activity; thus, splimp must be >= spltty.

/*
 * SLMAX is a hard limit on input packet size.  To simplify the code
 * and improve performance, we require that packets fit in an mbuf
 * cluster, and if we get a compressed packet, there's enough extra
 * room to expand the header into a max length tcp/ip header (128
 * bytes).  So, SLMAX can be at most
 *	MCLBYTES - 128
 *
 * SLMTU is a hard limit on output packet size.  To insure good
 * interactive response, SLMTU wants to be the smallest size that
 * amortizes the header cost.  (Remember that even with
 * type-of-service queuing, we have to wait for any in-progress
 * packet to finish.  I.e., we wait, on the average, 1/2 * mtu /
 * cps, where cps is the line speed in characters per second.
 * E.g., 533ms wait for a 1024 byte MTU on a 9600 baud line.  The
 * average compressed header size is 6-8 bytes so any MTU > 90
 * bytes will give us 90% of the line bandwidth.  A 100ms wait is
 * tolerable (500ms is not), so want an MTU around 296.  (Since TCP
 * will send 256 byte segments (to allow for 40 byte headers), the
 * typical packet size on the wire will be around 260 bytes).  In
 * 4.3tahoe+ systems, we can set an MTU in a route so we do that &
 * leave the interface MTU relatively high (so we don't IP fragment
 * when acting as a gateway to someone using a stupid MTU).
 *
 * Similar considerations apply to SLIP_HIWAT:  It's the amount of
 * data that will be queued 'downstream' of us (i.e., in clists
 * waiting to be picked up by the tty output interrupt).  If we
 * queue a lot of data downstream, it's immune to our t.o.s. queuing.
 * E.g., if SLIP_HIWAT is 1024, the interactive traffic in mixed
 * telnet/ftp will see a 1 sec wait, independent of the mtu (the
 * wait is dependent on the ftp window size but that's typically
 * 1k - 4k).  So, we want SLIP_HIWAT just big enough to amortize
 * the cost (in idle time on the wire) of the tty driver running
 * off the end of its clists & having to call back slstart for a
 * new packet.  For a tty interface with any buffering at all, this
 * cost will be zero.  Even with a totally brain dead interface (like
 * the one on a typical workstation), the cost will be <= 1 character
 * time.  So, setting SLIP_HIWAT to ~100 guarantees that we'll lose
 * at most 1% while maintaining good interactive response.
