.Dt PXEBOOT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pxeboot
.Nd Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) bootloader
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a modified version of the system third-stage bootstrap
.Xr loader 8
configured to run under Intel's Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) system.
PXE is a form of smart boot ROM, built into Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 and
3Com 3c905c Ethernet cards, and Ethernet-equipped Intel motherboards.
PXE supports DHCP configuration and provides low-level NIC access services.
.Nm
retrieves the kernel, modules,
and other files either via NFS over UDP or by TFTP,
selectable through compile-time options.
In combination with a memory filesystem image or NFS-mounted root filesystem,
.Nm
allows for easy,
EEPROM-burner free construction of diskless machines.
.Pp
The
.Nm
binary is loaded just like any other boot file,
by specifying it in the DHCP server's configuration file.
Below is a sample configuration for the ISC DHCP v2 server:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option domain-name "example.com";
option routers 10.0.0.1;
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 10.0.0.255;
option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
server-name "DHCPserver";
server-identifier 10.0.0.1;

default-lease-time 120;
max-lease-time 120;

subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
       filename "pxeboot";
       range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.254;
}

.Ed
.Nm
recognizes
.Va next-server
and
.Va option root-path
directives as the server and path to NFS mount for file requests,
respectively, or the server to make TFTP requests to.
Note that
.Nm
expects to fetch
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
from the specified server before loading any other files.
.Pp
In all other respects,
.Nm
acts just like
.Xr loader 8 .
.Pp
As PXE is still in its infancy, some firmware versions may not work
properly.
.Nm
has been extensively tested on version 0.99 of Intel firmware;
pre-release versions of the newer 2.0 firmware are known to have
problems.
Check with the device's manufacturer for their latest stable release.
