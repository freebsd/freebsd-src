This is a bootstrap bootloader.  It is intended to be used when the
AT91RM9200 is running xmodem over DBGU.  It will download the next stage
of the booting process (or the recovery program) and jump to it.  It loads
the program at a 1MB offset into SDRAM.  Programs are expected to be
smaller than this and copy themselves to the right location.
