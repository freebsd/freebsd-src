.Sh NAME
.Nm color.4th
.Nd FreeBSD color-detection boot module.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to simplify color logic.
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 8
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include color.4th
.Pp
This line is present in
.Pa /boot/beastie.4th
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic loader_color?
Returns TRUE if the
.Ic loader_color
environment variable is set to
.Dq YES
(case-insensitive) or
.Dq 1 .
Otherwise returns FALSE.
.El
.Pp
The environment variables that effect its behavior are:
.Bl -tag -width bootfile -offset indent
.It Va loader_color
If set to
.Dq YES
(case-insensitive) or
.Dq 1 ,
causes
.Ic loader_color?
to return TRUE, indicating to many other modules that color should be used
whenever/wherever possible.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /boot/loader.4th -compact
.It Pa /boot/loader
The
.Xr loader 8 .
.It Pa /boot/color.4th
.Nm
itself.

bootstrapping script.
