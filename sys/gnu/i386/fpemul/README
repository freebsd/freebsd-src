wm-FPU-emu is an FPU emulator for Linux. It is derived from wm-emu387
which is my 80387 emulator for djgpp (gcc under msdos); wm-emu387 was
in turn based upon emu387 which was written by DJ Delorie for djgpp.
The interface to the Linux kernel is based upon the original Linux
math emulator by Linus Torvalds.

My target FPU for wm-FPU-emu is that described in the Intel486
Programmer's Reference Manual (1992 edition). Numerous facets of the
functioning of the FPU are not well covered in the Reference Manual;
in the absence of clear details I have made guesses about the most
reasonable behaviour. Recently, this situation has improved because
I now have some access to the results produced by a real 80486 FPU.

wm-FPU-emu does not implement all of the behaviour of the 80486 FPU. 
See "Limitations" later in this file for a partial list of some
differences.  I believe that the missing features are never used by
normal C or FORTRAN programs.

----------------------- Internals of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

Numeric algorithms:
(1) Add, subtract, and multiply. Nothing remarkable in these.
(2) Divide has been tuned to get reasonable performance. The algorithm
    is not the obvious one which most people seem to use, but is designed
    to take advantage of the characteristics of the 80386. I expect that
    it has been invented many times before I discovered it, but I have not
    seen it. It is based upon one of those ideas which one carries around
    for years without ever bothering to check it out.
(3) The sqrt function has been tuned to get good performance. It is based
    upon Newton's classic method. Performance was improved by capitalizing
    upon the properties of Newton's method, and the code is once again
    structured taking account of the 80386 characteristics.
(4) The trig, log, and exp functions are based in each case upon quasi-
    "optimal" polynomial approximations. My definition of "optimal" was
    based upon getting good accuracy with reasonable speed.

The code of the emulator is complicated slightly by the need to
account for a limited form of re-entrancy. Normally, the emulator will
emulate each FPU instruction to completion without interruption.
However, it may happen that when the emulator is accessing the user
memory space, swapping may be needed. In this case the emulator may be
temporarily suspended while disk i/o takes place. During this time
another process may use the emulator, thereby changing some static
variables (eg FPU_st0_ptr, etc). The code which accesses user memory
is confined to five files:
    fpu_entry.c
    reg_ld_str.c
    load_store.c
    get_address.c
    errors.c

----------------------- Limitations of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

There are a number of differences between the current wm-FPU-emu
(version beta 1.4) and the 80486 FPU (apart from bugs). Some of the
more important differences are listed below:

All internal computations are performed at 64 bit or higher precision
and rounded etc as required by the PC bits of the FPU control word.
Under the crt0 version for Linux current at March 1993, the FPU PC
bits specify 53 bits precision.

The precision flag (PE of the FPU status word) and the Roundup flag
(C1 of the status word) are now partially implemented. Does anyone
write code which uses these features?

The functions which load/store the FPU state are partially implemented,
but the implementation should be sufficient for handling FPU errors etc
in 32 bit protected mode.

The implementation of the exception mechanism is flawed for unmasked
interrupts.

Detection of certain conditions, such as denormal operands, is not yet
complete.

----------------------- Performance of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------

Speed.
-----

The speed of floating point computation with the emulator will depend
upon instruction mix. Relative performance is best for the instructions
which require most computation. The simple instructions are adversely
affected by the fpu instruction trap overhead.


Timing: Some simple timing tests have been made on the emulator functions.
The times include load/store instructions. All times are in microseconds
measured on a 33MHz 386 with 64k cache. The Turbo C tests were under
ms-dos, the next two columns are for emulators running with the djgpp
ms-dos extender. The final column is for wm-FPU-emu in Linux 0.97,
using libm4.0 (hard).

The performance under Linux is improved by the use of look-ahead code.
The following results show the improvement which is obtained under
Linux due to the look-ahead code. Also given are the times for the
original Linux emulator with the 4.1 'soft' lib.

 [ Linus' note: I changed look-ahead to be the default under linux, as
   there was no reason not to use it after I had edited it to be
   disabled during tracing ]

These figures are now somewhat out-of-date. The emulator has become
progressively slower for most functions as more of the 80486 features
have been implemented.


----------------------- Accuracy of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------


Accuracy: The following table gives the accuracy of the sqrt(), trig
and log functions. Each function was tested at about 400 points. Ideal
results would be 64 bits. The reduced accuracy of cos() and tan() for
arguments greater than pi/4 can be thought of as being due to the
precision of the argument x; e.g. an argument of pi/2-(1e-10) which is
accurate to 64 bits can result in a relative accuracy in cos() of about
64 + log2(cos(x)) = 31 bits. Results for the Turbo C emulator are given
in the last column.

sin(x)        1e-10 .. pi/2             63.0                         62.8
tan(x)        1e-10 .. pi/2-(1e-10)     62.4 (x <= pi/4)             62.1
                                        35.2 (x = pi/2-(1e-10))      31.9
exp(x)        0 .. 1                    63.1                         62.9

As of version 1.3 of the emulator, the accuracy of the basic
arithmetic has been improved (by a small fraction of a bit). Care has
been taken to ensure full accuracy of the rounding of the basic
arithmetic functions (+,-,*,/,and fsqrt), and they all now produce
results which are exact to the 64th bit (unless there are any bugs
left). To ensure this, it was necessary to effectively get information
of up to about 128 bits precision. The emulator now passes the
"paranoia" tests (compiled with gcc 2.3.3) for 'float' variables (24
bit precision numbers) when precision control is set to 24, 53 or 64
bits, and for 'double' variables (53 bit precision numbers) when
precision control is set to 53 bits (a properly performing FPU cannot
pass the 'paranoia' tests for 'double' variables when precision
control is set to 64 bits).
