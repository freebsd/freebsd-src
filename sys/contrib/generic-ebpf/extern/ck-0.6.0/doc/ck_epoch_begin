.Dt CK_EPOCH_BEGIN 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_epoch_begin
.Nd begin epoch-protected segment of execution
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_epoch.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_epoch_begin "ck_epoch_record_t *record" "ck_epoch_section_t *section"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_epoch_begin 3
function will mark the beginning of an epoch-protected code section.
An epoch-protected code section is delimited by a call to the
.Fn ck_epoch_end 3
function. Though recursion is allowed for epoch-protected sections,
recursive calls will be associated with the
.Fn ck_epoch_begin 3
that is at the top of the call stack. If a section is passed, then
recursion on a record will cause the epoch to be refreshed on entry
of every protected section.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function has no return value.
.Sh ERRORS
The object pointed to by
.Fa epoch
must have been previously initiated via
.Fn ck_epoch_init 3 .
The object pointed to by
.Fa record
must have been previously registered via
.Fn ck_epoch_register 3 .
