.Dt CK_HS_PUT_UNIQUE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_hs_put_unique
.Nd unconditionally store unique key into a hash set
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_hs.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_hs_put_unique "ck_hs_t *hs" "unsigned long hash" "const void *key"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_hs_put_unique 3
function will store the key specified by the
.Fa key
argument in the hash set pointed to by the
.Fa hs
argument. The key specified by
.Fa key
is expected to have the hash value specified by the
.Fa hash
argument (which was previously generated using the
.Xr CK_HS_HASH 3
macro).
.Pp
If the call to
.Fn ck_hs_put 3
was successful then the key specified by
.Fa key
was successfully stored in the hash set pointed to by
.Fa hs .
The function will cause undefined behavior if a key with an
equivalent value is already present in the hash set. For replacement
semantics, please see the
.Xr ck_hs_set 3
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn ck_hs_put_unique 3
returns true and otherwise returns false on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa key
or
.Fa hs
are uninitialized. The function will also
return false if the hash set could not be enlarged
to accomodate key insertion. The function will
result in undefined behavior if called for an
already inserted key value.
