.Dt CK_PR_FENCE_STORE_LOAD 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_pr_fence_store_load
.Nd enforce ordering of store operations to load operations
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_pr.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_store_load void
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_strict_store_load void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_pr_fence_store_load
function enforces the ordering of any memory store,
.Fn ck_pr_store
and atomic read-modify-write operations to load
operations relative to the invocation of the function. This function
always serve as an implicit compiler barrier.
A fence will currently always be emitted for this
operation, including for TSO memory model targets.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal -offset indent

#include <ck_pr.h>

static int a = 0;
static int b = 0;

void
function(void)
{
	unsigned int snapshot_b;

	ck_pr_store_int(&a, 1);

	/*
	 * Guarantee that the store to a is completed
	 * with respect to load from b.
	 */
	ck_pr_fence_store_load();
	snapshot_b = ck_pr_load_int(&b, 2);
	return;
}

.Sh RETURN VALUES
This function has no return value.
