XEN NOTICE
==========

This copyright applies to all files within this subdirectory and its
subdirectories:
  include/public/*.h
  include/public/hvm/*.h
  include/public/io/*.h

The intention is that these files can be freely copied into the source
tree of an operating system when porting that OS to run on Xen. Doing
so does *not* cause the OS to become subject to the terms of the GPL.

All other files in the Xen source distribution are covered by version
2 of the GNU General Public License except where explicitly stated
otherwise within individual source files.
