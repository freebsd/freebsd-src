 * manual adjustment of the RX internal delay to work properly.  The default
 * RX delay provided by the driver (1.95ns) is too high, but applying a 50%
 * reduction seems to mitigate the issue.
 *
 * It is worth noting the adjustment is not necessary on BeagleV Starlight SBC,
 * which uses a Microchip PHY.  Hence, most likely the Motorcomm PHY is the one
 * responsible for the misbehaviour, not the GMAC.
