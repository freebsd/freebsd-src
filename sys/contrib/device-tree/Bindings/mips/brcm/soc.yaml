    Boards Broadcom cable/DSL/settop SoC shall have the following properties.
    The experimental -viper variants are for running Linux on the 3384's
    BMIPS4355 cable modem CPU instead of the BMIPS5000 application processor.

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: '/'

  compatible:
    enum:
      - brcm,bcm3368
      - brcm,bcm3384
      - brcm,bcm33843

      mips-hpt-frequency:
        description: MIPS counter high precision timer frequency.
         This is common to all CPUs in the system so it lives
         under the "cpus" node.

      brcm,bmips-cbr-reg:
        description: Reference address of the CBR.
          Some SoC suffer from a BUG where CBR(Core Base Register)
          address might be badly or never initialized by the Bootloader
          or reading it from co-processor registers, if the system boots
          from secondary CPU, results in invalid address.
          The CBR address is always the same on the SoC hence it
          can be provided in DT to handle these broken case.
