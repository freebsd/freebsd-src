* Microsemi MIPS CPUs

Boards with a SoC of the Microsemi MIPS family shall have the following
properties:

Required properties:
- compatible: "mscc,ocelot", "mscc,luton", "mscc,serval" or "mscc,jr2"


* Other peripherals:

o CPU chip regs:

The SoC has a few registers (DEVCPU_GCB:CHIP_REGS) handling miscellaneous
functionalities: chip ID, general purpose register for software use, reset
controller, hardware status and configuration, efuses.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mscc,ocelot-chip-regs", "simple-mfd", "syscon"
- reg : Should contain registers location and length

Example:
	syscon@71070000 {
		compatible = "mscc,ocelot-chip-regs", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		reg = <0x71070000 0x1c>;
	};

o HSIO regs:

The SoC has a few registers (HSIO) handling miscellaneous functionalities:
configuration and status of PLL5, RCOMP, SyncE, SerDes configurations and
status, SerDes muxing and a thermal sensor.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mscc,ocelot-hsio", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
- reg : Should contain registers location and length

Example:
	syscon@10d0000 {
		compatible = "mscc,ocelot-hsio", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x10d0000 0x10000>;
	};
