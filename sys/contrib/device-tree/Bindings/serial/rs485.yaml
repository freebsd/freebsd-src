title: RS485 serial communications

description: The RTS signal is capable of automatically controlling line
  direction for the built-in half-duplex mode. The properties described
  hereafter shall be given to a half-duplex capable UART node.

    items:
      items:
        - description: Delay between rts signal and beginning of data sent in
            milliseconds. It corresponds to the delay before sending data.
          default: 0
          maximum: 100
        - description: Delay between end of data sent and rts signal in milliseconds.
            It corresponds to the delay after sending data and actual release
            of the line.
          default: 0
          maximum: 100

  rs485-rts-active-high:
    description: drive RTS high when sending (this is the default).

  rs485-rts-active-low:
    description: drive RTS low when sending (default is high).
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag

  rs485-rx-active-high:
    description: Polarity of receiver enable signal (when separate from RTS).
      True indicates active high (default is low).

  rs485-rx-during-tx-gpios:
    description: Output GPIO pin that sets the state of rs485-rx-during-tx. This
      signal can be used to control the RX part of an RS485 transceiver. Thereby
      the active state enables RX during TX.
