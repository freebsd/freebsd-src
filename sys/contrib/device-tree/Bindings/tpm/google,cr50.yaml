title: Google Security Chip H1 (running Cr50 firmware)

maintainers:
  - Andrey Pronin <apronin@chromium.org>

description: |
  Google has designed a family of security chips called "Titan".
  One member is the H1 built into Chromebooks and running Cr50 firmware:
  https://www.osfc.io/2018/talks/google-secure-microcontroller-and-ccd-closed-case-debugging/

  The chip provides several functions, including TPM 2.0 like functionality.
  It communicates over SPI or IÂ²C using the FIFO protocol described in the
  TCG PC Client Platform TPM Profile Specification for TPM 2.0 (PTP), sec 6:
