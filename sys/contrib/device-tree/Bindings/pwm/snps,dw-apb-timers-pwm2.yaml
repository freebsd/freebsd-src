title: Synopsys DW-APB timers PWM controller

description:
  This describes the DesignWare APB timers module when used in the PWM
  mode. The IP core can be generated with various options which can
  control the functionality, the number of PWMs available and other
  internal controls the designer requires.

  The IP block has a version register so this can be used for detection
  instead of having to encode the IP version number in the device tree
  compatible.
