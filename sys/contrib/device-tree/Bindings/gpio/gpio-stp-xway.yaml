title: Lantiq SoC Serial To Parallel (STP) GPIO controller

description: |
  The Serial To Parallel (STP) is found on MIPS based Lantiq socs. It is a
  peripheral controller used to drive external shift register cascades. At most
  3 groups of 8 bits can be driven. The hardware is able to allow the DSL modem
  and Ethernet PHYs to drive some bytes of the cascade automatically.
