title: STMicroelectonics Port Expander (STMPE) GPIO Block

description:
  STMicroelectronics Port Expander (STMPE) is a series of slow
  bus controllers for various expanded peripherals such as GPIO, keypad,
  touchscreen, ADC, PWM or rotator. It can contain one or several different
  peripherals connected to SPI or I2C. These bindings pertain to the
  GPIO portions of these expanders.
