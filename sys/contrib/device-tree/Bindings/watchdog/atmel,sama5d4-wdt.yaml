      present if you want to stop the watchdog when the CPU is in idle state.
      CAUTION: This property should be used with care, it actually makes the
      watchdog not counting when the CPU is in idle state, therefore the
      watchdog reset time depends on mean CPU usage and will not reset at all
      if the CPU stop working while it is in idle state, which is probably
      not what you want.
