description:
  Versal watchdog intellectual property uses window watchdog mode.
  Window watchdog timer(WWDT) contains closed(first) and open(second)
  window with 32 bit width. Write to the watchdog timer within
  predefined window periods of time. This means a period that is not
  too soon and a period that is not too late. The WWDT has to be
  restarted within the open window time. If software tries to restart
  WWDT outside of the open window time period, it generates a reset.
