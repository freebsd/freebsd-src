* Dialog Semiconductor DA9062/61 Watchdog Timer

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following valid compatible string lines:
	"dlg,da9061-watchdog", "dlg,da9062-watchdog"
	"dlg,da9062-watchdog"

Optional properties:
- dlg,use-sw-pm: Add this property to disable the watchdog during suspend.
	Only use this option if you can't use the watchdog automatic suspend
	function during a suspend (see register CONTROL_B).
- dlg,wdt-sd: Set what happens on watchdog timeout. If this bit is set the
	watchdog timeout triggers SHUTDOWN, if cleared the watchdog triggers
	POWERDOWN. Can be 0 or 1. Only use this option if you want to change the
	default chip's OTP setting for WATCHDOG_SD bit. If this property is NOT
	set the WATCHDOG_SD bit and on timeout watchdog behavior will match the
	chip's OTP settings.

Example: DA9062

	pmic0: da9062@58 {
		watchdog {
			compatible = "dlg,da9062-watchdog";
		};
	};

Example: DA9061 using a fall-back compatible for the DA9062 watchdog driver

		watchdog {
			compatible = "dlg,da9061-watchdog", "dlg,da9062-watchdog";
		};
