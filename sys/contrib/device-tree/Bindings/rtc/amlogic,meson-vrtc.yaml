title: Amlogic Virtual RTC (VRTC)

description: |
  This is a Linux interface to an RTC managed by firmware, hence it's
  virtual from a Linux perspective.  The interface is 1 register where
  an alarm time (in seconds) is to be written.
  The alarm register is a simple scratch register shared between the
  application processors (AP) and the secure co-processor (SCP.)  When
  the AP suspends, the SCP will use the value of this register to
  program an always-on timer before going sleep. When the timer expires,
  the SCP will wake up and will then wake the AP.
