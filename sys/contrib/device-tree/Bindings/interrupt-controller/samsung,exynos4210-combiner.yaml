title: Samsung Exynos SoC Interrupt Combiner Controller

description: |
  Samsung's Exynos4 architecture includes a interrupt combiner controller which
  can combine interrupt sources as a group and provide a single interrupt
  request for the group. The interrupt request from each group are connected to
  a parent interrupt controller, such as GIC in case of Exynos4210.

  The interrupt combiner controller consists of multiple combiners. Up to eight
  interrupt sources can be connected to a combiner. The combiner outputs one
  combined interrupt for its eight interrupt sources. The combined interrupt is
  usually connected to a parent interrupt controller.

  A single node in the device tree is used to describe the interrupt combiner
  controller module (which includes multiple combiners). A combiner in the
  interrupt controller module shares config/control registers with other
  combiners. For example, a 32-bit interrupt enable/disable config register can
  accommodate up to 4 interrupt combiners (with each combiner supporting up to
  8 interrupt sources).
