title: Qualcomm SMD Edge communication channel nodes

description:
  Qualcomm SMD subnode represents a remote subsystem or a remote processor of
  some sort - or in SMD language an "edge". The name of the edges are not
  important.

  In turn, subnodes of the "edges" represent devices tied to SMD channels on
  that "edge". The names of the devices are not important. The properties of
  these nodes are defined by the individual bindings for the SMD devices.
