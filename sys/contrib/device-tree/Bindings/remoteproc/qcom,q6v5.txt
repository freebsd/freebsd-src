	Definition: reference to the clocks that match clock-names

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: The clocks needed depend on the compatible string:
	qcom,ipq8074-wcss-pil:
		    no clock names required
	qcom,qcs404-wcss-pil:
		    must be "xo", "gcc_abhs_cbcr", "gcc_abhs_cbcr",
		    "gcc_axim_cbcr", "lcc_ahbfabric_cbc", "tcsr_lcc_cbc",
		    "lcc_abhs_cbc", "lcc_tcm_slave_cbc", "lcc_abhm_cbc",
		    "lcc_axim_cbc", "lcc_bcr_sleep"

- resets:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the list of 3 reset-controllers for the
		    wcss sub-system

- reset-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "wcss_aon_reset", "wcss_reset", "wcss_q6_reset"
		    for the wcss sub-system

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to wcss reserved-memory region.

For the compatible string below the following supplies are required:
  "qcom,qcs404-wcss-pil"
- cx-supply:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the regulators to be held on behalf of the
		    booting of the Hexagon core

- qcom,smem-states:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the smem state for requesting the Hexagon to
		    shut down

- qcom,smem-state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "stop"

- qcom,halt-regs:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: a phandle reference to a syscon representing TCSR followed
		    by the three offsets within syscon for q6, wcss and nc
		    halt registers.

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reserved-memory for the region

The Hexagon node may also have an subnode named either "smd-edge" or
"glink-edge" that describes the communication edge, channels and devices
related to the Hexagon.  See ../soc/qcom/qcom,smd.yaml and
../soc/qcom/qcom,glink.txt for details on how to describe these.
