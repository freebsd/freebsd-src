= Qualcomm QFPROM device tree bindings =

This binding is intended to represent QFPROM which is found in most QCOM SOCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,qfprom"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of qfprom, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	qfprom: qfprom@700000 {
		compatible 	= "qcom,qfprom";
		reg		= <0x00700000 0x8000>;
		...
		/* Data cells */
		tsens_calibration: calib@404 {
			reg = <0x4404 0x10>;
		};
	};


= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

For example:

	tsens {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&tsens_calibration>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};
