  cirrus,enable-soft-reset:
    description: |
      The CS4271 requires its LRCLK and MCLK to be stable before its RESET
      line is de-asserted. That also means that clocks cannot be changed
      without putting the chip back into hardware reset, which also requires
      a complete re-initialization of all registers.

      One (undocumented) workaround is to assert and de-assert the PDN bit
      in the MODE2 register. This workaround can be enabled with this DT
      property.

      Note that this is not needed in case the clocks are stable
      throughout the entire runtime of the codec.
