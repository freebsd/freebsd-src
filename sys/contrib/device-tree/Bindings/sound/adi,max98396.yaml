description:
  The MAX98396 is a mono Class-DG speaker amplifier with I/V sense.
  The device provides a PCM interface for audio data and a standard
  I2C interface for control data communication.
  The MAX98397 is a variant of MAX98396 with wide input supply range.

  adi,interleave-mode:
    description:
      For cases where a single combined channel for the I/V sense data
      is not sufficient, the device can also be configured to share
      a single data output channel on alternating frames.
      In this configuration, the current and voltage data will be frame
      interleaved on a single output channel.

  adi,dmon-stuck-enable:
    description:
      Enables the "data monitor stuck" feature. Once the data monitor is
      enabled, it actively monitors the selected input data (from DIN) to the
      speaker amplifier. Once a data error is detected, the data monitor
      automatically places the device into software shutdown.
    type: boolean

    description:
      Sets the threshold for the "data monitor stuck" feature, in bits.
    enum: [9, 11, 13, 15]
    default: 15

  adi,dmon-magnitude-enable:
    description:
      Enables the "data monitor magnitude" feature. Once the data monitor is
      enabled, it actively monitors the selected input data (from DIN) to the
      speaker amplifier. Once a data error is detected, the data monitor
      automatically places the device into software shutdown.
