ROHM BD28623MUV Class D speaker amplifier for digital input

This codec does not have any control buses such as I2C, it detect format and
rate of I2S signal automatically. It has two signals that can be connected
to GPIOs: reset and mute.

Required properties:
- compatible      : should be "rohm,bd28623"
- #sound-dai-cells: should be 0.
- VCCA-supply     : regulator phandle for the VCCA supply
- VCCP1-supply    : regulator phandle for the VCCP1 supply
- VCCP2-supply    : regulator phandle for the VCCP2 supply

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios     : GPIO specifier for the active low reset line
- mute-gpios      : GPIO specifier for the active low mute line

Example:

	codec {
		compatible = "rohm,bd28623";
		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;

		VCCA-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
		VCCP1-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
		VCCP2-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		mute-gpios = <&gpio 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
