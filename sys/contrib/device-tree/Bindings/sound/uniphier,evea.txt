Required properties:
- compatible      : should be "socionext,uniphier-evea".
- reg             : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- clock-names     : should include following entries:
                    "evea", "exiv"
- clocks          : a list of phandle, should contain an entry for each
                    entries in clock-names.
- reset-names     : should include following entries:
                    "evea", "exiv", "adamv"
- resets          : a list of phandle, should contain reset entries of
                    reset-names.
- #sound-dai-cells: should be 1.

Example:

	codec {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-evea";
		reg = <0x57900000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "evea", "exiv";
		clocks = <&sys_clk 41>, <&sys_clk 42>;
		reset-names = "evea", "exiv", "adamv";
		resets = <&sys_rst 41>, <&sys_rst 42>, <&adamv_rst 0>;
		#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
	};
