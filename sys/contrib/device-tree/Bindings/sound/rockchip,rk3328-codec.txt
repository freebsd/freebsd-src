* Rockchip Rk3328 internal codec

Required properties:

- compatible: "rockchip,rk3328-codec"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- rockchip,grf: the phandle of the syscon node for GRF register.
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: should be "pclk".
- spk-depop-time-ms: speak depop time msec.

Optional properties:

- mute-gpios: GPIO specifier for external line driver control (typically the
              dedicated GPIO_MUTE pin)

Example for rk3328 internal codec:

codec: codec@ff410000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3328-codec";
	reg = <0x0 0xff410000 0x0 0x1000>;
	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
	clocks = <&cru PCLK_ACODEC>;
	clock-names = "pclk";
	mute-gpios = <&grf_gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	spk-depop-time-ms = 100;
};
