Texas Instruments TAS2562 Smart PA

The TAS2562 is a mono, digital input Class-D audio amplifier optimized for
efficiently driving high peak power into small loudspeakers.
Integrated speaker voltage and current sense provides for
real time monitoring of loudspeaker behavior.

Required properties:
 - #address-cells  - Should be <1>.
 - #size-cells     - Should be <0>.
 - compatible:	   - Should contain "ti,tas2562", "ti,tas2563".
 - reg:		   - The i2c address. Should be 0x4c, 0x4d, 0x4e or 0x4f.
 - ti,imon-slot-no:- TDM TX current sense time slot.
 - ti,vmon-slot-no:- TDM TX voltage sense time slot. This slot must always be
		     greater then ti,imon-slot-no.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the interrupt controller which provides
                    the interrupt.
- interrupts: (GPIO) interrupt to which the chip is connected.
- shut-down-gpio: GPIO used to control the state of the device.

Examples:
tas2562@4c {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        compatible = "ti,tas2562";
        reg = <0x4c>;

        interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
        interrupts = <14>;

	shut-down-gpio = <&gpio1 15 0>;
        ti,imon-slot-no = <0>;
        ti,vmon-slot-no = <1>;
};
