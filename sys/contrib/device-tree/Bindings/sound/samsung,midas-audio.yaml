      List of the connections between audio components; each entry is
      a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink, the second
      being the connection's source; valid names for sources and sinks are
      the WM1811's pins (as documented in its binding), and the jacks
      on the board: HP, SPK, Main Mic, Sub Mic, Headset Mic.
      Deprecated, use audio-routing.
