title: AMD CDX bus controller

description: |
  CDX bus controller for AMD devices is implemented to dynamically
  detect CDX bus and devices using the firmware.
  The CDX bus manages multiple FPGA based hardware devices, which
  can support network, crypto or any other specialized type of
  devices. These FPGA based devices can be added/modified dynamically
  on run-time.

  All devices on the CDX bus will have a unique streamid (for IOMMU)
  and a unique device ID (for MSI) corresponding to a requestor ID
  (one to one associated with the device). The streamid and deviceid
  are used to configure SMMU and GIC-ITS respectively.

  iommu-map property is used to define the set of stream ids
  corresponding to each device and the associated IOMMU.

  The MSI writes are accompanied by sideband data (Device ID).
  The msi-map property is used to associate the devices with the
  device ID as well as the associated ITS controller.

  rproc property (xlnx,rproc) is used to identify the remote processor
  with which APU (Application Processor Unit) interacts to find out
  the bus and device configuration.
