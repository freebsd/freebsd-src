Qualcomm Hardware Mutex Block:

The hardware block provides mutexes utilized between different processors on
the SoC as part of the communication protocol used by these processors.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,sfpb-mutex",
		    "qcom,tcsr-mutex"

- syscon:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: one cell containing:
		    syscon phandle
		    offset of the hwmutex block within the syscon
		    stride of the hwmutex registers

- #hwlock-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1, the specified cell represent the lock id
		    (hwlock standard property, see hwlock.txt)

Example:

	tcsr_mutex_block: syscon@fd484000 {
		compatible = "syscon";
		reg = <0xfd484000 0x2000>;
	};

	hwlock@fd484000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-mutex";
		syscon = <&tcsr_mutex_block 0 0x80>;

		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
	};
