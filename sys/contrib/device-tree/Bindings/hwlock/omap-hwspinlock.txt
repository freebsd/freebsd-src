TI HwSpinlock for OMAP and K3 based SoCs
=========================================

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of the following,
			  "ti,omap4-hwspinlock" for
				OMAP44xx, OMAP54xx, AM33xx, AM43xx, DRA7xx SoCs
			  "ti,am654-hwspinlock" for
				K3 AM65x and J721E SoCs
- reg:			Contains the hwspinlock module register address space
			(base address and length)
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the hwspinlock device
			(for OMAP architecture based SoCs only)
- #hwlock-cells:	Should be 1. The OMAP hwspinlock users will use a
			0-indexed relative hwlock number as the argument
			specifier value for requesting a specific hwspinlock
			within a hwspinlock bank.

Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

Example:

1. OMAP4 SoCs
hwspinlock: spinlock@4a0f6000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-hwspinlock";
	reg = <0x4a0f6000 0x1000>;
	ti,hwmods = "spinlock";
	#hwlock-cells = <1>;
};

2. AM65x SoCs and J721E SoCs
&cbass_main {
	cbass_main_navss: interconnect0 {
		hwspinlock: spinlock@30e00000 {
			compatible = "ti,am654-hwspinlock";
			reg = <0x00 0x30e00000 0x00 0x1000>;
			#hwlock-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
};
