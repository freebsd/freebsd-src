title: Common i2c bus multiplexer/switch properties.

description: |+
  An i2c bus multiplexer/switch will have several child busses that are numbered
  uniquely in a device dependent manner.  The nodes for an i2c bus
  multiplexer/switch will have one child node for each child bus.

  For i2c multiplexers/switches that have child nodes that are a mixture of both
  i2c child busses and other child nodes, the 'i2c-mux' subnode can be used for
  populating the i2c child busses.  If an 'i2c-mux' subnode is present, only
  subnodes of this will be considered as i2c child busses.
