    description:
      Phandle to the global status and enable interrupt registers shared
      between each I2C engine controller instance. It enables the I2C
      engine controller to act as both a master or slave by being able to
      arm and respond to interrupts from its engine. Each bit in the
      registers represent the respective bit position.
