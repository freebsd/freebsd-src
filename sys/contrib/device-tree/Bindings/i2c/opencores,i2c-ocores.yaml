  clock-frequency:
    description: |
      clock-frequency property is meant to control the bus frequency for i2c bus
      drivers, but it was incorrectly used to specify i2c controller input clock
      frequency. So the following rules are set to fix this situation:
      - if clock-frequency is present and neither opencores,ip-clock-frequency nor
        clocks are, then clock-frequency specifies i2c controller clock frequency.
        This is to keep backwards compatibility with setups using old DTB. i2c bus
        frequency is fixed at 100 KHz.
      - if clocks is present it specifies i2c controller clock. clock-frequency
        property specifies i2c bus frequency.
      - if opencores,ip-clock-frequency is present it specifies i2c controller
        clock frequency. clock-frequency property specifies i2c bus frequency.
