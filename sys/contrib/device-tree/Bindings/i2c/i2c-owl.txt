Actions Semiconductor Owl I2C controller

Required properties:

- compatible        : Should be one of the following:
		      - "actions,s700-i2c" for S700 SoC
		      - "actions,s900-i2c" for S900 SoC
- reg               : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- #address-cells    : Should be 1.
- #size-cells       : Should be 0.
- interrupts        : A single interrupt specifier.
- clocks            : Phandle of the clock feeding the I2C controller.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency   : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. As only Normal and
                      Fast modes are supported, possible values are 100000 and
                      400000.
Examples:

        i2c0: i2c@e0170000 {
                compatible = "actions,s900-i2c";
                reg = <0 0xe0170000 0 0x1000>;
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 25 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                clocks = <&clock CLK_I2C0>;
                clock-frequency = <100000>;
        };
