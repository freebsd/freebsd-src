STMicroelectronics STiH41x USB PHY binding
------------------------------------------

This file contains documentation for the usb phy found in STiH415/6 SoCs from
STMicroelectronics.

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "st,stih416-usb-phy" or "st,stih415-usb-phy"
- st,syscfg	: should be a phandle of the syscfg node
- clock-names	: must contain "osc_phy"
- clocks	: must contain an entry for each name in clock-names.
See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- #phy-cells	: must be 0 for this phy
See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt

Example:

usb2_phy: usb2phy@0 {
	compatible	= "st,stih416-usb-phy";
	#phy-cells	= <0>;
	st,syscfg	= <&syscfg_rear>;
	clocks		= <&clk_sysin>;
	clock-names	= "osc_phy";
};
