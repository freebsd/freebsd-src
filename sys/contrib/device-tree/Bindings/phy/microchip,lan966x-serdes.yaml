title: Microchip Lan966x Serdes controller

maintainers:
  - Horatiu Vultur <horatiu.vultur@microchip.com>

description: |
  Lan966x has 7 interfaces, consisting of 2 copper transceivers(CU),
  3 SERDES6G and 2 RGMII interfaces. Two of the SERDES6G support QSGMII.
  Also it has 8 logical Ethernet ports which can be connected to these
  interfaces. The Serdes controller will allow to configure these interfaces
  and allows to "mux" the interfaces to different ports.

  For simple selection of the interface that is used with a port, the
  following macros are defined CU(X), SERDES6G(X), RGMII(X). Where X is a
  number that represents the index of that interface type. For example
  CU(1) means use interface copper transceivers 1. SERDES6G(2) means use
  interface SerDes 2.
