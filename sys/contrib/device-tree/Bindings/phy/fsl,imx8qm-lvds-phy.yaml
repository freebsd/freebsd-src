title: Mixel LVDS PHY for Freescale i.MX8qm SoC

description: |
  The Mixel LVDS PHY IP block is found on Freescale i.MX8qm SoC.
  It converts two groups of four 7/10 bits of CMOS data into two
  groups of four data lanes of LVDS data streams. A phase-locked
  transmit clock is transmitted in parallel with each group of
  data streams over a fifth LVDS link. Every cycle of the transmit
  clock, 56/80 bits of input data are sampled and transmitted
  through the two groups of LVDS data streams. Together with the
  transmit clocks, the two groups of LVDS data streams form two
  LVDS channels.

  The Mixel LVDS PHY found on Freescale i.MX8qm SoC is controlled
  by Control and Status Registers(CSR) module in the SoC. The CSR
  module, as a system controller, contains the PHY's registers.
