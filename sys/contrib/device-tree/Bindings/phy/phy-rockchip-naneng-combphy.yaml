  rockchip,enable-ssc:
    type: boolean
    description:
      The option SSC can be enabled for U3, SATA and PCIE.
      Most commercially available platforms use SSC to reduce EMI.

  rockchip,ext-refclk:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Many PCIe connections, especially backplane connections,
      require a synchronous reference clock between the two link partners.
      To achieve this a common clock source, referred to as REFCLK in
      the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification,
      should be used by both ends of the PCIe link.
      In PCIe mode one can choose to use an internal or an external reference
      clock.
      By default the internal clock is selected. The PCIe PHY provides a 100MHz
      differential clock output(optional with SSC) for system applications.
      When selecting this option an externally 100MHz differential
      reference clock needs to be provided to the PCIe PHY.
