title: Microsemi Ocelot SerDes muxing

description: |
  On Microsemi Ocelot, there is a handful of registers in HSIO address
  space for setting up the SerDes to switch port muxing.

  A SerDes X can be "muxed" to work with switch port Y or Z for example.
  One specific SerDes can also be used as a PCIe interface.

  Hence, a SerDes represents an interface, be it an Ethernet or a PCIe one.

  There are two kinds of SerDes: SERDES1G supports 10/100Mbps in
  half/full-duplex and 1000Mbps in full-duplex mode while SERDES6G supports
  10/100Mbps in half/full-duplex and 1000/2500Mbps in full-duplex mode.

  Also, SERDES6G number (aka "macro") 0 is the only interface supporting
  QSGMII.

  This is a child of the HSIO syscon ("mscc,ocelot-hsio", see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mips/mscc.txt) on the Microsemi Ocelot.

      The first number defines the input port to use for a given SerDes macro.
      The second defines the macro to use. They are defined in
