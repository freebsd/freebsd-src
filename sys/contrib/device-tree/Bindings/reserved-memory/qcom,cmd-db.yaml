title: Qualcomm Command DB

description: |
  Command DB is a database that provides a mapping between resource key and the
  resource address for a system resource managed by a remote processor. The data
  is stored in a shared memory region and is loaded by the remote processor.

  Some of the Qualcomm Technologies Inc SoC's have hardware accelerators for
  controlling shared resources. Depending on the board configuration the shared
  resource properties may change. These properties are dynamically probed by the
  remote processor and made available in the shared memory.
