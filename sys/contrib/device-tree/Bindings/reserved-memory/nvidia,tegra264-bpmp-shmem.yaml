title: Tegra CPU-NS - BPMP IPC reserved memory

maintainers:

description: |
  Define a memory region used for communication between CPU-NS and BPMP.
  Typically this node is created by the bootloader as the physical address
  has to be known to both CPU-NS and BPMP for correct IPC operation.
  The memory region is defined using a child node under /reserved-memory.
  The sub-node is named shmem@<address>.
