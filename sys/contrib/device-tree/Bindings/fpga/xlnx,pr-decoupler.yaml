title: Xilinx LogiCORE Partial Reconfig Decoupler/AXI shutdown manager Softcore

description: |
  The Xilinx LogiCORE Partial Reconfig(PR) Decoupler manages one or more
  decouplers/fpga bridges. The controller can decouple/disable the bridges
  which prevents signal changes from passing through the bridge. The controller
  can also couple / enable the bridges which allows traffic to pass through the
  bridge normally.
  Xilinx LogiCORE Dynamic Function eXchange(DFX) AXI shutdown manager Softcore
  is compatible with the Xilinx LogiCORE pr-decoupler. The Dynamic Function
  eXchange AXI shutdown manager prevents AXI traffic from passing through the
  bridge. The controller safely handles AXI4MM and AXI4-Lite interfaces on a
  Reconfigurable Partition when it is undergoing dynamic reconfiguration,
  preventing the system deadlock that can occur if AXI transactions are
  interrupted by DFX.
  Please refer to fpga-region.txt and fpga-bridge.txt in this directory for
  common binding part and usage.
