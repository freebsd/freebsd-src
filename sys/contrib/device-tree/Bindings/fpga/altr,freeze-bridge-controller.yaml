title: Altera Freeze Bridge Controller

description:
  The Altera Freeze Bridge Controller manages one or more freeze bridges.
  The controller can freeze/disable the bridges which prevents signal
  changes from passing through the bridge. The controller can also
  unfreeze/enable the bridges which allows traffic to pass through the bridge
  normally.
