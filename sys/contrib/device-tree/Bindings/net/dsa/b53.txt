   Switch Register Access block base, the second is the port 5/4 mux
   configuration register and the third one is the SGMII configuration
   and status register base address.

   order: port 0-5, 7-8 link status change, then the integrated PHY interrupt,
   then the timestamping interrupt and the sleep timer interrupts for ports
   5,7,8.

Optional properties for BCM585xx/586xx/88312 SoCs:

  - reg-names: a total of 3 names matching the 3 base register address, must
    be in the following order:
	"srab"
	"mux_config"
	"sgmii_config"

  - interrupt-names: a total of 13 names matching the 13 interrupts specified
    must be in the following order:
	"link_state_p0"
	"link_state_p1"
	"link_state_p2"
	"link_state_p3"

required and optional properties.

Examples:

Ethernet switch connected via MDIO to the host, CPU port wired to eth0:

	eth0: ethernet@10001000 {
		compatible = "brcm,unimac";
		reg = <0x10001000 0x1000>;

		fixed-link {
			speed = <1000>;
			full-duplex;
		};
	};

	mdio0: mdio@10000000 {
		compatible = "brcm,unimac-mdio";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		switch0: ethernet-switch@1e {
			compatible = "brcm,bcm53125";
			reg = <30>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				port0@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "lan1";
				};

				port1@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan2";
				};

				port5@5 {
					reg = <5>;
					label = "cable-modem";
					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
					};
					phy-mode = "rgmii-txid";
				};

				port8@8 {
					reg = <8>;
					label = "cpu";
					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
					};
					phy-mode = "rgmii-txid";
					ethernet = <&eth0>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
