description:
  PHY packages are multi-port Ethernet PHY of the same family
  and each Ethernet PHY is affected by the global configuration
  of the PHY package.

  Each reg of the PHYs defined in the PHY package node is
  absolute and describe the real address of the Ethernet PHY on
  the MDIO bus.

    pattern: "^ethernet-phy-package@[a-f0-9]+$"

  reg:
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 31
    description:
      The base ID number for the PHY package.
      Commonly the ID of the first PHY in the PHY package.

      Some PHY in the PHY package might be not defined but
      still occupy ID on the device (just not attached to
      anything) hence the PHY package reg might correspond
      to a not attached PHY (offset 0).
