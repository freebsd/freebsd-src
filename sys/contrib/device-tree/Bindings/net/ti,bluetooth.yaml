  This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
  attached TI Bluetooth devices. The following chips are included in this
  binding:

  * TI CC256x Bluetooth devices
  * TI WiLink 7/8 (wl12xx/wl18xx) Shared Transport BT/FM/GPS devices

  TI WiLink devices have a UART interface for providing Bluetooth, FM radio,
  and GPS over what's called "shared transport". The shared transport is
  standard BT HCI protocol with additional channels for the other functions.

  TI WiLink devices also have a separate WiFi interface as described in
  wireless/ti,wlcore.yaml.

  This bindings follows the UART slave device binding in ../serial/serial.yaml.
