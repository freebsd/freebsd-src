title: MDIO bus multiplexer found in Broadcom iProc based SoCs.

description:
  This MDIO bus multiplexer defines buses that could be internal as well as
  external to SoCs and could accept MDIO transaction compatible to C-22 or
  C-45 Clause. When child bus is selected, one needs to select these two
  properties as well to generate desired MDIO transaction on appropriate bus.
