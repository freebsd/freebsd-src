Broadcom BCM43xx Fullmac wireless SDIO devices

This node provides properties for controlling the Broadcom wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
connects the device to the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "brcm,bcm4329-fmac".

Optional properties:
 - brcm,drive-strength : drive strength used for SDIO pins on device in mA
	(default = 6).
 - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt (host-wake).
	When not specified the device will use in-band SDIO interrupts.
 - interrupt-names : name of the out-of-band interrupt, which must be set
	to "host-wake".

Example:

mmc3: mmc@1c12000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mmc3_pins_a>;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_vmmc3>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	non-removable;

	brcmf: wifi@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		compatible = "brcm,bcm4329-fmac";
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <10 8>; /* PH10 / EINT10 */
		interrupt-names = "host-wake";
	};
};
