* MediaTek mt76xx devices

This node provides properties for configuring the MediaTek mt76xx wireless
device. The node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI
controller to which the wireless chip is connected.

Alternatively, it can specify the wireless part of the MT7628/MT7688 or
MT7622 SoC. For SoC, use the following compatible strings:

compatible:
- "mediatek,mt7628-wmac" for MT7628/MT7688
- "mediatek,mt7622-wmac" for MT7622

properties:
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: Main device interrupt

MT7622 specific properties:
- power-domains: phandle to the power domain that the WMAC is part of
- mediatek,infracfg: phandle to the infrastructure bus fabric syscon node

Optional properties:

- ieee80211-freq-limit: See ieee80211.txt
- mediatek,mtd-eeprom: Specify a MTD partition + offset containing EEPROM data
- big-endian: if the radio eeprom partition is written in big-endian, specify
  this property
- mediatek,eeprom-merge-otp: Merge EEPROM data with OTP data. Can be used on
  boards where the flash calibration data is generic and specific calibration
  data should be pulled from the OTP ROM

The MAC address can as well be set with corresponding optional properties
defined in net/ethernet.txt.

Optional nodes:
- led: Properties for a connected LED
  Optional properties:
    - led-sources: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

MT7628 example:

wmac: wmac@10300000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7628-wmac";
	reg = <0x10300000 0x100000>;

	interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
	interrupts = <6>;

	mediatek,mtd-eeprom = <&factory 0x0000>;
};

MT7622 example:

wmac: wmac@18000000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7622-wmac";
	reg = <0 0x18000000 0 0x100000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 211 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	mediatek,infracfg = <&infracfg>;

	power-domains = <&scpsys MT7622_POWER_DOMAIN_WB>;
};
