    description: |
      Interrupts are broken on some GPY2xx PHYs in that they keep the
      interrupt line asserted for a random amount of time even after the
      interrupt status register is cleared. Thus it is blocking the
      interrupt line which is usually bad for shared lines. By default,
      interrupts are disabled for this PHY and polling mode is used. If one
      can live with the consequences, this property can be used to enable
      interrupt handling.

      Affected PHYs (as far as known) are GPY215B and GPY215C.
