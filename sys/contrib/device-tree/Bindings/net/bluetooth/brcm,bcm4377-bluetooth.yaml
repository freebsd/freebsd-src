description:
  This binding describes Broadcom BCM4377 family PCIe-attached bluetooth chips
  usually found in Apple machines. The Wi-Fi part of the chip is described in
  bindings/net/wireless/brcm,bcm4329-fmac.yaml.

  brcm,board-type:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
    description: Board type of the Bluetooth chip. This is used to decouple
      the overall system board from the Bluetooth module and used to construct
      firmware and calibration data filenames.
      On Apple platforms, this should be the Apple module-instance codename
      prefixed by "apple,", e.g. "apple,atlantisb".
    pattern: '^apple,.*'

  brcm,taurus-cal-blob:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint8-array
    description: A per-device calibration blob for the Bluetooth radio. This
      should be filled in by the bootloader from platform configuration
      data, if necessary, and will be uploaded to the device.
      This blob is used if the chip stepping of the Bluetooth module does not
      support beamforming.
