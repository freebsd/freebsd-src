description: |
  The ADIN1110 is a low power single port 10BASE-T1L MAC-
  PHY designed for industrial Ethernet applications. It integrates
  an Ethernet PHY core with a MAC and all the associated analog
  circuitry, input and output clock buffering.

  The ADIN2111 is a low power, low complexity, two-Ethernet ports
  switch with integrated 10BASE-T1L PHYs and one serial peripheral
  interface (SPI) port. The device is designed for industrial Ethernet
  applications using low power constrained nodes and is compliant
  with the IEEE 802.3cg-2019 Ethernet standard for long reach
  10 Mbps single pair Ethernet (SPE).

  The device has a 4-wire SPI interface for communication
  between the MAC and host processor.
