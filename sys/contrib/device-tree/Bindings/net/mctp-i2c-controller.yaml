title: MCTP I2C transport

description: |
  An mctp-i2c-controller defines a local MCTP endpoint on an I2C controller.
  MCTP I2C is specified by DMTF DSP0237.

  An mctp-i2c-controller must be attached to an I2C adapter which supports
  slave functionality. I2C busses (either directly or as subordinate mux
  busses) are attached to the mctp-i2c-controller with a 'mctp-controller'
  property on each used bus. Each mctp-controller I2C bus will be presented
  to the host system as a separate MCTP I2C instance.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: mctp-i2c-controller

  reg:
    minimum: 0x40000000
    maximum: 0x4000007f
    description: |
      7 bit I2C address of the local endpoint.
      I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS (1<<30) flag must be set.
