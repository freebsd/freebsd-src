Broadcom V3D GPU

Only the Broadcom V3D 3.x and newer GPUs are covered by this binding.
For V3D 2.x, see brcm,bcm-vc4.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,7268-v3d" or "brcm,7278-v3d"
- reg:		Physical base addresses and lengths of the register areas
- reg-names:	Names for the register areas.  The "hub" and "core0"
		  register areas are always required.  The "gca" register area
		  is required if the GCA cache controller is present.  The
		  "bridge" register area is required if an external reset
		  controller is not present.
- interrupts:	The interrupt numbers.  The first interrupt is for the hub,
		  while the following interrupts are separate interrupt lines
		  for the cores (if they don't share the hub's interrupt).
		  See bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional properties:
- clocks:	The core clock the unit runs on
- resets:	The reset line for v3d, if not using a mapping of the bridge
		  See bindings/reset/reset.txt
