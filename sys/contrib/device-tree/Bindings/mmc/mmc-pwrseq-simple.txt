* The simple MMC power sequence provider

The purpose of the simple MMC power sequence provider is to supports a set of
common properties between various SOC designs. It thus enables us to use the
same provider for several SOC designs.

Required properties:
- compatible : contains "mmc-pwrseq-simple".

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios : contains a list of GPIO specifiers. The reset GPIOs are asserted
	at initialization and prior we start the power up procedure of the card.
	They will be de-asserted right after the power has been provided to the
	card.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for the entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entry:
  "ext_clock" (External clock provided to the card).
- post-power-on-delay-ms : Delay in ms after powering the card and
	de-asserting the reset-gpios (if any)
- power-off-delay-us : Delay in us after asserting the reset-gpios (if any)
	during power off of the card.

Example:

	sdhci0_pwrseq {
		compatible = "mmc-pwrseq-simple";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		clocks = <&clk_32768_ck>;
		clock-names = "ext_clock";
	}
