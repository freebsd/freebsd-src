* ZTE specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage
  Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the ZTE specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "zte,zx296718-dw-mshc": for ZX SoCs

Example:

	mmc1: mmc@1110000 {
		compatible = "zte,zx296718-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x01110000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 15 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		fifo-depth = <32>;
		data-addr = <0x200>;
		fifo-watermark-aligned;
		bus-width = <4>;
		clock-frequency = <50000000>;
		clocks = <&topcrm SD0_AHB>, <&topcrm SD0_WCLK>;
		clock-names = "biu", "ciu";
		max-frequency = <50000000>;
		cap-sdio-irq;
		cap-sd-highspeed;
	};
