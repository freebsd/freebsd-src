* Freescale MXS MMC controller

The Freescale MXS Synchronous Serial Ports (SSP) can act as a MMC controller
to support MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the mxsmmc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-mmc".  The supported chips include
  imx23 and imx28.
- interrupts: Should contain ERROR interrupt number
- dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
  and SSP DMA channel ID.
  Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
- dma-names: Must be "rx-tx".

Examples:

ssp0: ssp@80010000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-mmc";
	reg = <0x80010000 2000>;
	interrupts = <96>;
	dmas = <&dma_apbh 0>;
	dma-names = "rx-tx";
	bus-width = <8>;
};
