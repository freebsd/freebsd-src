title: Texas Instruments OMAP compatible OPP supply

description:
  OMAP5, DRA7, and AM57 families of SoCs have Class 0 AVS eFuse
  registers, which contain OPP-specific voltage information tailored
  for the specific device. This binding provides the information
  needed to describe such a hardware values and relate them to program
  the primary regulator during an OPP transition.

  Also, some supplies may have an associated vbb-supply, an Adaptive
  Body Bias regulator, which must transition in a specific sequence
  w.r.t the vdd-supply and clk when making an OPP transition. By
  supplying two regulators to the device that will undergo OPP
  transitions, we can use the multi-regulator support implemented by
  the OPP core to describe both regulators the platform needs. The
  OPP core binding Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp-v2.yaml
  provides further information (refer to Example 4 Handling multiple
  regulators).
