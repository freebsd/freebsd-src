title: Generic OPP (Operating Performance Points) v1

description: |+
  Devices work at voltage-current-frequency combinations and some implementations
  have the liberty of choosing these. These combinations are called Operating
  Performance Points aka OPPs. This document defines bindings for these OPPs
  applicable across wide range of devices. For illustration purpose, this document
  uses CPU as a device.

  This binding only supports voltage-frequency pairs.
