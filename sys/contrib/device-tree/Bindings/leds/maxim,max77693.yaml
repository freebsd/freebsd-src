title: Maxim MAX77693 MicroUSB and Companion Power Management IC LEDs

maintainers:

description: |
  This is a part of device tree bindings for Maxim MAX77693 MicroUSB Integrated
  Circuit (MUIC).

  There are two LED outputs available - FLED1 and FLED2. Each of them can
  control a separate LED or they can be connected together to double the
  maximum current for a single connected LED. One LED is represented by one
  child node.

  See also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/maxim,max77693.yaml for
  additional information and example.

  maxim,boost-mode:
    description:
      In boost mode the device can produce up to 1.2A of total current on both
      outputs. The maximum current on each output is reduced to 625mA then. If
      not enabled explicitly, boost setting defaults to LEDS_BOOST_FIXED in
      case both current sources are used.
      See LEDS_BOOST_* in include/dt-bindings/leds/common.h.
