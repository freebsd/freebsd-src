description: |
  This controller is present on BCM6318, BCM6328, BCM6362 and BCM63268.
  In these SoCs it's possible to control LEDs both as GPIOs or by hardware.
  However, on some devices there are Serial LEDs (LEDs connected to a 74x164
  controller), which can either be controlled by software (exporting the 74x164
  as spi-gpio. See
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/fairchild,74hc595.yaml), or by hardware
  using this driver.
  Some of these Serial LEDs are hardware controlled (e.g. ethernet LEDs) and
  exporting the 74x164 as spi-gpio prevents those LEDs to be hardware
  controlled, so the only chance to keep them working is by using this driver.

  BCM6328 LED controller has a HWDIS register, which controls whether a LED
  should be controlled by a hardware signal instead of the MODE register value,
  with 0 meaning hardware control enabled and 1 hardware control disabled. This
  is usually 1:1 for hardware to LED signals, but through the activity/link
  registers you have some limited control over rerouting the LEDs (as
  explained later in brcm,link-signal-sources). Even if a LED is hardware
  controlled you are still able to make it blink or light it up if it isn't,
  but you can't turn it off if the hardware decides to light it up. For this
  reason, hardware controlled LEDs aren't registered as LED class devices.

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the brcm,bcm6328-leds device.
