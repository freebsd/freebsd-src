title: Qualcomm PM8058 PMIC LED

description: |
  The Qualcomm PM8058 contains an LED block for up to six LEDs:: three normal
  LEDs, two "flash" LEDs and one "keypad backlight" LED. The names are quoted
  because sometimes these LED drivers are used for wildly different things than
  flash or keypad backlight:: their names are more of a suggestion than a
  hard-wired usecase.

  Hardware-wise the different LEDs support slightly different output currents.
  The "flash" LEDs do not need to charge nor do they support external triggers.
  They are just powerful LED drivers.
