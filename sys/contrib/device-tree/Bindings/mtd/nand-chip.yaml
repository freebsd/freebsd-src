  This file covers the generic description of a NAND chip. It implies that the
  bus interface should not be taken into account: both raw NAND devices and
  SPI-NAND devices are concerned by this description.

  nand-ecc-engine:
    description: |
      A phandle on the hardware ECC engine if any. There are
      basically three possibilities:
      1/ The ECC engine is part of the NAND controller, in this
      case the phandle should reference the parent node.
      2/ The ECC engine is part of the NAND part (on-die), in this
      case the phandle should reference the node itself.
      3/ The ECC engine is external, in this case the phandle should
      reference the specific ECC engine node.

  secure-regions:
    description:
      Regions in the NAND chip which are protected using a secure element
      like Trustzone. This property contains the start address and size of
      the secure regions present.
