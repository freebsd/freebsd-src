description: |
  The NAND controller should be represented with its own DT node, and
  all NAND chips attached to this controller should be defined as
  children nodes of the NAND controller. This representation should be
  enforced even for simple controllers supporting only one chip.

properties:

    pattern: "^nand-controller(@.*)?"

    const: 1

  "#size-cells":

  cs-gpios:
    description:
      Array of chip-select available to the controller. The first
      entries are a 1:1 mapping of the available chip-select on the
      NAND controller (even if they are not used). As many additional
      chip-select as needed may follow and should be phandles of GPIO
      lines. 'reg' entries of the NAND chip subnodes become indexes of
      this array when this property is present.
