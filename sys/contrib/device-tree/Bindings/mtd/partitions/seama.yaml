title: Seattle Image Partitions

description: The SEAttle iMAge (SEAMA) partition is a type of partition
  used for NAND flash devices. This type of flash image is found in some
  D-Link routers such as DIR-645, DIR-842, DIR-859, DIR-860L, DIR-885L,
  DIR890L and DCH-M225, as well as in WD and NEC routers on the ath79
  (MIPS), Broadcom BCM53xx, and RAMIPS platforms. This partition type
  does not have children defined in the device tree, they need to be
  detected by software.
