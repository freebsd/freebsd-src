title: Binman entries

description: |
  This corresponds to a binman 'entry'. It is a single partition which holds
  data of a defined type.

  Binman uses the type to indicate what data file / type to place in the
  partition. There are quite a number of binman-specific entry types, such as
  section, fill and files, to be added later.
