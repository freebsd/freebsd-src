title: TP-Link SafeLoader partitions

description: |
  TP-Link home routers store various data on flash (e.g. bootloader,
  flash layout, firmware, product info, configuration, calibration
  data). That requires flash partitioning.

  Flash space layout of TP-Link devices is stored on flash itself using
  a custom ASCII-based format. That format was first found in TP-Link
  devices with a custom SafeLoader bootloader. Later it was adapted to
  CFE and U-Boot bootloaders.

  Partitions specified in partitions table cover whole flash space. Some
  contain static data that shouldn't get modified (device's MAC or WiFi
  calibration data). Others are semi-static (like kernel). Finally some
  partitions contain fully changeable content (like rootfs).

  This binding describes partitioning method and defines offset of ASCII
  based partitions table. That offset is picked at manufacturing process
  and doesn't change.
