description:
  The ESM (Error Signaling Module) is an IP block on TI K3 devices
  that allows handling of safety events somewhat similar to what interrupt
  controller would do. The safety signals have their separate paths within
  the SoC, and they are handled by the ESM, which routes them to the proper
  destination, which can be system reset, interrupt controller, etc. In the
  simplest configuration the signals are just routed to reset the SoC.
