Renesas R-Car LVDS Encoder
==========================

These DT bindings describe the LVDS encoder embedded in the Renesas R-Car
Gen2, R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G SoCs.

Required properties:

- compatible : Shall contain one of
  - "renesas,r8a7743-lvds" for R8A7743 (RZ/G1M) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7744-lvds" for R8A7744 (RZ/G1N) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a774a1-lvds" for R8A774A1 (RZ/G2M) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a774b1-lvds" for R8A774B1 (RZ/G2N) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a774c0-lvds" for R8A774C0 (RZ/G2E) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7790-lvds" for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7791-lvds" for R8A7791 (R-Car M2-W) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7793-lvds" for R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7795-lvds" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a7796-lvds" for R8A7796 (R-Car M3-W) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77965-lvds" for R8A77965 (R-Car M3-N) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77970-lvds" for R8A77970 (R-Car V3M) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77980-lvds" for R8A77980 (R-Car V3H) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77990-lvds" for R8A77990 (R-Car E3) compatible LVDS encoders
  - "renesas,r8a77995-lvds" for R8A77995 (R-Car D3) compatible LVDS encoders

- reg: Base address and length for the memory-mapped registers
- clocks: A list of phandles + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
  the clock-names property.
- clock-names: Name of the clocks. This property is model-dependent.
  - The functional clock, which mandatory for all models, shall be listed
    first, and shall be named "fck".
  - On R8A77990, R8A77995 and R8A774C0, the LVDS encoder can use the EXTAL or
    DU_DOTCLKINx clocks. Those clocks are optional. When supplied they must be
    named "extal" and "dclkin.x" respectively, with "x" being the DU_DOTCLKIN
    numerical index.
  - When the clocks property only contains the functional clock, the
    clock-names property may be omitted.
- resets: A phandle + reset specifier for the module reset

Required nodes:

The LVDS encoder has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the
OF graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 corresponds to the parallel RGB input
- Video port 1 corresponds to the LVDS output

Each port shall have a single endpoint.

Optional properties:

- renesas,companion : phandle to the companion LVDS encoder. This property is
  mandatory for the first LVDS encoder on D3 and E3 SoCs, and shall point to
  the second encoder to be used as a companion in dual-link mode. It shall not
  be set for any other LVDS encoder.


Example:

	lvds0: lvds@feb90000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a77990-lvds";
		reg = <0 0xfeb90000 0 0x20>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 727>;
		power-domains = <&sysc R8A77990_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;
		resets = <&cpg 727>;

		renesas,companion = <&lvds1>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				lvds0_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&du_out_lvds0>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				lvds0_out: endpoint {
				};
			};
		};
	};
