SN65DSI86 DSI to eDP bridge chip
--------------------------------

This is the binding for Texas Instruments SN65DSI86 bridge.
http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn65dsi86&fileType=pdf

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ti,sn65dsi86"
- reg: i2c address of the chip, 0x2d as per datasheet
- enable-gpios: gpio specification for bridge_en pin (active high)

- vccio-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the digital IOs.
- vpll-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the displayport PLL.
- vcca-supply: A 1.2V supply that powers up the analog circuits.
- vcc-supply: A 1.2V supply that powers up the digital core.

Optional properties:
- interrupts-extended: Specifier for the SN65DSI86 interrupt line.

- gpio-controller: Marks the device has a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells    : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and
                   the second cell is used to specify flags.
                   See ../../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
- #pwm-cells : Should be one. See ../../pwm/pwm.yaml for description of
               the cell formats.

- clock-names: should be "refclk"
- clocks: Specification for input reference clock. The reference
	  clock rate must be 12 MHz, 19.2 MHz, 26 MHz, 27 MHz or 38.4 MHz.

- data-lanes: See ../../media/video-interface.txt
- lane-polarities: See ../../media/video-interface.txt

- suspend-gpios: specification for GPIO1 pin on bridge (active low)

Required nodes:
This device has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the
OF graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for DSI input
- Video port 1 for eDP output
