Synopsys DesignWare HDMI TX Encoder
===================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
TX Encoder (DWC HDMI TX). It doesn't constitue a device tree binding
specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
device tree bindings.

When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.

- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC HDMI TX registers.

- reg-io-width: Width of the registers specified by the reg property. The
  value is expressed in bytes and must be equal to 1 or 4 if specified. The
  register width defaults to 1 if the property is not present.

- interrupts: Reference to the DWC HDMI TX interrupt.

- clocks: References to all the clocks specified in the clock-names property
  as specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt.

- clock-names: The DWC HDMI TX uses the following clocks.

  - "iahb" is the bus clock for either AHB and APB (mandatory).
  - "isfr" is the internal register configuration clock (mandatory).
  - "cec" is the HDMI CEC controller main clock (optional).

- ports: The connectivity of the DWC HDMI TX with the rest of the system is
  expressed in using ports as specified in the device graph bindings defined
  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. The numbering of the ports
  is platform-specific.
