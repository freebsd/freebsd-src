      HDMI audio is configured only if this property is found.
      If HDMI audio is configured, the sii902x device becomes an I2S and/or
      S/PDIF audio codec component (e.g. a digital audio sink), that can be
      used in configuring full audio devices with simple-card or
      audio-graph-card bindings. See their binding documents on how to describe
      the way the
      sii902x device is connected to the rest of the audio system:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.yaml
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/audio-graph-card.yaml
      Note: In case of the audio-graph-card binding the used port index should
      be 3.

      Each integer indicates which I2S pin is connected to which audio FIFO.
      The first integer selects the I2S audio pin for the first audio FIFO#0
      (HDMI channels 1&2), the second for FIFO#1 (HDMI channels 3&4), and so
      on. There are 4 FIFOs and 4 I2S pins (SD0 - SD3). Any I2S pin can be
      connected to any FIFO, but there can be no gaps. E.g. an I2S pin must be
      mapped to FIFO#0 and FIFO#1 before mapping a channel to FIFO#2. The
      default value is <0>, describing SD0 pin being routed to HDMI audio
      FIFO#0.
