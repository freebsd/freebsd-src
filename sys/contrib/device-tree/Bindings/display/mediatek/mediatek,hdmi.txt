Mediatek HDMI Encoder
=====================

The Mediatek HDMI encoder can generate HDMI 1.4a or MHL 2.0 signals from
its parallel input.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi".
- the supported chips are mt2701, mt7623 and mt8173
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "pixel", "pll", "bclk", and "spdif".
- phys: phandle link to the HDMI PHY node.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt for details.
- phy-names: must contain "hdmi"
- mediatek,syscon-hdmi: phandle link and register offset to the system
  configuration registers. For mt8173 this must be offset 0x900 into the
  MMSYS_CONFIG region: <&mmsys 0x900>.
- ports: A node containing input and output port nodes with endpoint
  definitions as documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
- port@0: The input port in the ports node should be connected to a DPI output
  port.
- port@1: The output port in the ports node should be connected to the input
  port of a connector node that contains a ddc-i2c-bus property, or to the
  input port of an attached bridge chip, such as a SlimPort transmitter.

HDMI CEC
========

The HDMI CEC controller handles hotplug detection and CEC communication.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-cec"
- the supported chips are mt7623 and mt8173
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
- clocks: device clock

HDMI DDC
========

The HDMI DDC i2c controller is used to interface with the HDMI DDC pins.
The Mediatek's I2C controller is used to interface with I2C devices.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi-ddc"
- the supported chips are mt7623 and mt8173
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: device clock
- clock-names: Should be "ddc-i2c".
