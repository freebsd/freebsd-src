title: DisplayPort AUX bus

description:
  DisplayPort controllers provide a control channel to the sinks that
  are hooked up to them. This is the DP AUX bus. Over the DP AUX bus
  we can query properties about a sink and also configure it. In
  particular, DP sinks support DDC over DP AUX which allows tunneling
  a standard I2C DDC connection over the AUX channel.

  To model this relationship, DP sinks should be placed as children
  of the DP controller under the "aux-bus" node.

  At the moment, this binding only handles the eDP case. It is
  possible it will be extended in the future to handle the DP case.
  For DP, presumably a connector would be listed under the DP AUX
  bus instead of a panel.
