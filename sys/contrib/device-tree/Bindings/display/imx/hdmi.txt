Freescale i.MX6 DWC HDMI TX Encoder
===================================

The HDMI transmitter is a Synopsys DesignWare HDMI 1.4 TX controller IP
with a companion PHY IP.

These DT bindings follow the Synopsys DWC HDMI TX bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/bridge/dw_hdmi.txt with the
following device-specific properties.


Required properties:

- compatible : Shall be one of "fsl,imx6q-hdmi" or "fsl,imx6dl-hdmi".
- reg: See dw_hdmi.txt.
- interrupts: HDMI interrupt number
- clocks: See dw_hdmi.txt.
- clock-names: Shall contain "iahb" and "isfr" as defined in dw_hdmi.txt.
- ports: See dw_hdmi.txt. The DWC HDMI shall have between one and four ports,
  numbered 0 to 3, corresponding to the four inputs of the HDMI multiplexer.
  Each port shall have a single endpoint.
- gpr : Shall contain a phandle to the iomuxc-gpr region containing the HDMI
  multiplexer control register.

Optional properties

- ddc-i2c-bus: The HDMI DDC bus can be connected to either a system I2C master
  or the functionally-reduced I2C master contained in the DWC HDMI. When
  connected to a system I2C master this property contains a phandle to that
  I2C master controller.


Example:

	gpr: iomuxc-gpr@20e0000 {
		/* ... */
	};

        hdmi: hdmi@120000 {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                compatible = "fsl,imx6q-hdmi";
                reg = <0x00120000 0x9000>;
                interrupts = <0 115 0x04>;
                gpr = <&gpr>;
                clocks = <&clks 123>, <&clks 124>;
                clock-names = "iahb", "isfr";
                ddc-i2c-bus = <&i2c2>;

                port@0 {
                        reg = <0>;

                        hdmi_mux_0: endpoint {
                                remote-endpoint = <&ipu1_di0_hdmi>;
                        };
                };

                port@1 {
                        reg = <1>;

                        hdmi_mux_1: endpoint {
                                remote-endpoint = <&ipu1_di1_hdmi>;
                        };
                };
        };
