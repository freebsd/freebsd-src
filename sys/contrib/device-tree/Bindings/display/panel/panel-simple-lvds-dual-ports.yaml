description: |
  This binding file is a collection of the LVDS panels that
  has dual LVDS ports and requires only a single power-supply.
  The first port receives odd pixels, and the second port receives even pixels.
  There are optionally a backlight and an enable GPIO.
  The panel may use an OF graph binding for the association to the display,
  or it may be a direct child node of the display.

  If the panel is more advanced a dedicated binding file is required.
