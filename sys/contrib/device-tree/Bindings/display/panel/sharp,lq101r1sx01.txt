Sharp Microelectronics 10.1" WQXGA TFT LCD panel

This panel requires a dual-channel DSI host to operate. It supports two modes:
- left-right: each channel drives the left or right half of the screen
- even-odd: each channel drives the even or odd lines of the screen

Each of the DSI channels controls a separate DSI peripheral. The peripheral
driven by the first link (DSI-LINK1), left or even, is considered the primary
peripheral and controls the device. The 'link2' property contains a phandle
to the peripheral driven by the second link (DSI-LINK2, right or odd).

Note that in video mode the DSI-LINK1 interface always provides the left/even
pixels and DSI-LINK2 always provides the right/odd pixels. In command mode it
is possible to program either link to drive the left/even or right/odd pixels
but for the sake of consistency this binding assumes that the same assignment
is chosen as for video mode.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sharp,lq101r1sx01"
- reg: DSI virtual channel of the peripheral

Required properties (for DSI-LINK1 only):
- link2: phandle to the DSI peripheral on the secondary link. Note that the
  presence of this property marks the containing node as DSI-LINK1.
- power-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage

Optional properties (for DSI-LINK1 only):
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel

Example:

	dsi@54300000 {
		panel: panel@0 {
			compatible = "sharp,lq101r1sx01";
			reg = <0>;

			link2 = <&secondary>;

			power-supply = <...>;
			backlight = <...>;
		};
	};

	dsi@54400000 {
		secondary: panel@0 {
			compatible = "sharp,lq101r1sx01";
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
