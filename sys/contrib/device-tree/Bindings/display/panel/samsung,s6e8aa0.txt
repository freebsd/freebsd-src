Samsung S6E8AA0 AMOLED LCD 5.3 inch panel

Required properties:
  - compatible: "samsung,s6e8aa0"
  - reg: the virtual channel number of a DSI peripheral
  - vdd3-supply: core voltage supply
  - vci-supply: voltage supply for analog circuits
  - reset-gpios: a GPIO spec for the reset pin
  - display-timings: timings for the connected panel as described by [1]

Optional properties:
  - power-on-delay: delay after turning regulators on [ms]
  - reset-delay: delay after reset sequence [ms]
  - init-delay: delay after initialization sequence [ms]
  - panel-width-mm: physical panel width [mm]
  - panel-height-mm: physical panel height [mm]
  - flip-horizontal: boolean to flip image horizontally
  - flip-vertical: boolean to flip image vertically

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in [2]. This
node should describe panel's video bus.
