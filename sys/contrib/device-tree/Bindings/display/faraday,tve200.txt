* Faraday TV Encoder TVE200

Required properties:

- compatible: must be one of:
	"faraday,tve200"
	"cortina,gemini-tvc", "faraday,tve200"

- reg: base address and size of the control registers block

- interrupts: contains an interrupt specifier for the interrupt
	line from the TVE200

- clock-names: should contain "PCLK" for the clock line clocking the
	silicon and "TVE" for the 27MHz clock to the video driver

- clocks: contains phandle and clock specifier pairs for the entries
	in the clock-names property. See
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional properties:

- resets: contains the reset line phandle for the block

Required sub-nodes:

- port: describes LCD panel signals, following the common binding
	for video transmitter interfaces; see
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
	This port should have the properties:
	reg = <0>;
	It should have one endpoint connected to a remote endpoint where
	the display is connected.

Example:

display-controller@6a000000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "faraday,tve200";
	reg = <0x6a000000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	resets = <&syscon GEMINI_RESET_TVC>;
	clocks = <&syscon GEMINI_CLK_GATE_TVC>,
		 <&syscon GEMINI_CLK_TVC>;
	clock-names = "PCLK", "TVE";

	port@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		display_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
		};
	};
};
