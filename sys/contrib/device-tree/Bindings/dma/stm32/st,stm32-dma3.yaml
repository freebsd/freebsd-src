title: STMicroelectronics STM32 DMA3 Controller

description: |
  The STM32 DMA3 is a direct memory access controller with different features
  depending on its hardware configuration.
  It is either called LPDMA (Low Power), GPDMA (General Purpose) or HPDMA (High
  Performance).
  Its hardware configuration registers allow to dynamically expose its features.

  GPDMA and HPDMA support 16 independent DMA channels, while only 4 for LPDMA.
  GPDMA and HPDMA support 256 DMA requests from peripherals, 8 for LPDMA.

  Bindings are generic for these 3 STM32 DMA3 configurations.

  DMA clients connected to the STM32 DMA3 controller must use the format
  described in "#dma-cells" property description below, using a three-cell
  specifier for each channel.

  "#dma-cells":
    const: 3
    description: |
      Specifies the number of cells needed to provide DMA controller specific
      information.
      The first cell is the request line number.
      The second cell is a 32-bit mask specifying the DMA channel requirements:
        -bit 0-1: The priority level
          0x0: low priority, low weight
          0x1: low priority, mid weight
          0x2: low priority, high weight
          0x3: high priority
        -bit 4-7: The FIFO requirement for queuing source/destination transfers
          0x0: no FIFO requirement/any channel can fit
          0x2: FIFO of 8 bytes (2^2+1)
          0x4: FIFO of 32 bytes (2^4+1)
          0x6: FIFO of 128 bytes (2^6+1)
          0x7: FIFO of 256 bytes (2^7+1)
      The third cell is a 32-bit mask specifying the DMA transfer requirements:
        -bit 0: The source incrementing burst
          0x0: fixed burst
          0x1: contiguously incremented burst
        -bit 1: The source allocated port
          0x0: port 0 is allocated to the source transfer
          0x1: port 1 is allocated to the source transfer
        -bit 4: The destination incrementing burst
          0x0: fixed burst
          0x1: contiguously incremented burst
        -bit 5: The destination allocated port
          0x0: port 0 is allocated to the destination transfer
          0x1: port 1 is allocated to the destination transfer
        -bit 8: The type of hardware request
          0x0: burst
          0x1: block
        -bit 9: The control mode
          0x0: DMA controller control mode
          0x1: peripheral control mode
        -bit 12-13: The transfer complete event mode
          0x0: at block level, transfer complete event is generated at the end
               of a block
          0x2: at LLI level, the transfer complete event is generated at the end
               of the LLI transfer
               including the update of the LLI if any
          0x3: at channel level, the transfer complete event is generated at the
               end of the last LLI
