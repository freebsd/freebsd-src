title: BCM2835 DMA controller

maintainers:

description:
  The BCM2835 DMA controller has 16 channels in total. Only the lower
  13 channels have an associated IRQ. Some arbitrary channels are used by the
  VideoCore firmware (1,3,6,7 in the current firmware version). The channels
  0, 2 and 3 have special functionality and should not be used by the driver.
