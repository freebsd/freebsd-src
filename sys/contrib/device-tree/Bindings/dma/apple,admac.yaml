title: Apple Audio DMA Controller (ADMAC)

description: |
  Apple's Audio DMA Controller (ADMAC) is used to fetch and store audio samples
  on SoCs from the "Apple Silicon" family.

  The controller has been seen with up to 24 channels. Even-numbered channels
  are TX-only, odd-numbered are RX-only. Individual channels are coupled to
  fixed device endpoints.

    description:
      Interrupts that correspond to the 4 IRQ outputs of the controller. Usually
      only one of the controller outputs will be connected as an usable interrupt
      source. The remaining interrupts will be left without a valid value, e.g.
      in an interrupts-extended list the disconnected positions will contain
      an empty phandle reference <0>.
