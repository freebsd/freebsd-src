title: Common Properties for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
  receiver devices

description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to Global Navigation
  Satellite System receivers.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^gnss(@.*)?$"

  lna-supply:
    description: A separate regulator supplying power for the Low Noise
      Amplifier (LNA). This is an amplifier connected between the GNSS
      device and the receiver antenna.

  enable-gpios:
    description: A GPIO line that will enable the GNSS receiver when
      asserted. If this line is active low, the GPIO phandle should
      consequently be tagged with the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag so the operating
      system can rely on asserting the line to enable the GNSS device.
    maxItems: 1

  timepulse-gpios:
    description: When a timepulse is provided to the GNSS device using a
      GPIO line, this is used.
    maxItems: 1

additionalProperties: true
