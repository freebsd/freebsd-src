description:
  CPUFREQ HW is a hardware engine used by MediaTek SoCs to
  manage frequency in hardware. It is capable of controlling
  frequency for multiple clusters.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: mediatek,cpufreq-hw

  reg:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 2
    description:
      Addresses and sizes for the memory of the HW bases in
      each frequency domain. Each entry corresponds to
      a register bank for each frequency domain present.

  "#performance-domain-cells":
    description:
      Number of cells in a performance domain specifier.
      Set const to 1 here for nodes providing multiple
      performance domains.
    const: 1

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
