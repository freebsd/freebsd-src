description: |
  The Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC and Versal has several different resets.

  The PS reset subsystem is responsible for handling the external reset
  input to the device and that all internal reset requirements are met
  for the system (as a whole) and for the functional units.

  Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
  controller binding usage. Device nodes that need access to reset
  lines should specify them as a reset phandle in their corresponding
  node as specified in reset.txt.
