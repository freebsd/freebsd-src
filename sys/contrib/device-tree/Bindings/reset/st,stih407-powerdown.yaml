title: STMicroelectronics STi family Sysconfig Peripheral Powerdown Reset Controller

description: |
  This binding describes a reset controller device that is used to enable and
  disable on-chip peripheral controllers such as USB and SATA, using
  "powerdown" control bits found in the STi family SoC system configuration
  registers. These have been grouped together into a single reset controller
  device for convenience.

  The actual action taken when powerdown is asserted is hardware dependent.
  However, when asserted it may not be possible to access the hardware's
  registers and after an assert/deassert sequence the hardware's previous state
  may no longer be valid.

    const: st,stih407-powerdown
