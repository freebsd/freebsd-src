title: TI-SCI reset controller

maintainers:
  - Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>

description: |
  Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the Power Management Micro
  Controller (PMMC) on Keystone 66AK2G SoC) that are responsible for controlling
  the state of the various hardware modules present on the SoC. Communication
  between the host processor running an OS and the system controller happens
  through a protocol called TI System Control Interface (TI-SCI protocol).

  This reset controller node uses the TI SCI protocol to perform the reset
  management of various hardware modules present on the SoC. Must be a child
  node of the associated TI-SCI system controller node.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^reset-controller$"

  compatible:
    const: ti,sci-reset

  "#reset-cells":
    const: 2
    description:
      The two cells represent values that the TI-SCI controller defines.

      The first cell should contain the device ID.

      The second cell should contain the reset mask corresponding to the device
      used by system controller.

      Please see https://software-dl.ti.com/tisci/esd/latest/index.html for
      protocol documentation for the values to be used for different devices.
