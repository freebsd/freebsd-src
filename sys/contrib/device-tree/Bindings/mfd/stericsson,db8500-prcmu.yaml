description:
  The DB8500 Power Reset and Control Management Unit is an XP70 8-bit
  microprocessor that is embedded in the always-on power domain of the
  DB8500 SoCs to manage the low power states, powering up and down parts
  of the silicon, and controlling reset of different IP blocks.

    description: The device is compatible both to the device-specific
      compatible "stericsson,db8500-prcmu" and "syscon". The latter
      compatible is needed for the device to be exposed as a system
      controller so that arbitrary registers can be access by
      different operating system components.
