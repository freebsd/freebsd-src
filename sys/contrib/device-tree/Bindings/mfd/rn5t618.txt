* Ricoh RN5T567/RN5T618 PMIC

Ricoh RN5T567/RN5T618/RC5T619 is a power management IC family which
integrates 3 to 5 step-down DCDC converters, 7 to 10 low-dropout regulators,
GPIOs, and a watchdog timer. It can be controlled through an I2C interface.
The RN5T618/RC5T619 provides additionally a Li-ion battery charger,
fuel gauge, and an ADC.
The RC5T619 additionnally includes USB charger detection and an RTC.

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be one of
		"ricoh,rn5t567"
		"ricoh,rn5t618"
		"ricoh,rc5t619"
 - reg: the I2C slave address of the device

Optional properties:
 - interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ
   See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
 - system-power-controller:
   See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power-controller.txt

Sub-nodes:
 - regulators: the node is required if the regulator functionality is
   needed. The valid regulator names are: DCDC1, DCDC2, DCDC3, DCDC4
   (RN5T567/RC5T619), LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6, LDO7, LDO8,
   LDO9, LDO10, LDORTC1 and LDORTC2.
   LDO7-10 are specific to RC5T619.
   The common bindings for each individual regulator can be found in:
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Example:

	pmic@32 {
		compatible = "ricoh,rn5t618";
		reg = <0x32>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio5>;
		interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		system-power-controller;

		regulators {
			DCDC1 {
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1050000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1050000>;
			};

			DCDC2 {
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1175000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1175000>;
			};
		};
	};
