* Device tree bindings for Atmel Timer Counter Blocks
- compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-tcb", "simple-mfd", "syscon".
  <chip> can be "at91rm9200" or "at91sam9x5"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- #address-cells: has to be 1
- #size-cells: has to be 0
- interrupts: Should contain all interrupts for the TC block
  Note that you can specify several interrupt cells if the TC
  block has one interrupt per channel.
- clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.
	Required elements: "t0_clk", "slow_clk"
	Optional elements: "t1_clk", "t2_clk"
- clocks: phandles to input clocks.

The TCB can expose multiple subdevices:
 * a timer
   - compatible: Should be "atmel,tcb-timer"
   - reg: Should contain the TCB channels to be used. If the
     counter width is 16 bits (at91rm9200-tcb), two consecutive
     channels are needed. Else, only one channel will be used.

Examples:

One interrupt per TC block:
	tcb0: timer@fff7c000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-tcb", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xfff7c000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <18 4>;
		clocks = <&tcb0_clk>, <&clk32k>;
		clock-names = "t0_clk", "slow_clk";

		timer@0 {
			compatible = "atmel,tcb-timer";
			reg = <0>, <1>;
		};

		timer@2 {
			compatible = "atmel,tcb-timer";
			reg = <2>;
		};
	};

One interrupt per TC channel in a TC block:
	tcb1: timer@fffdc000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-tcb", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xfffdc000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <26 4>, <27 4>, <28 4>;
		clocks = <&tcb1_clk>, <&clk32k>;
		clock-names = "t0_clk", "slow_clk";
	};
