        - description: Minimum frequency for given clock in Hz
        - description: Maximum frequency for given clock in Hz
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      Preferred is operating-points-v2.

      Array of <min max> operating frequencies in Hz stored in the same order
      as the clocks property. If either this property or operating-points-v2 is
      not defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed that the
      frequency is set by the parent clock or a fixed rate clock source.

  operating-points-v2:
    description:
      Preferred over freq-table-hz.
      If present, each OPP must contain array of frequencies stored in the same
      order for each clock.  If clock frequency in the array is "0" then it is
      assumed that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a fixed rate
      clock source.

  lanes-per-direction:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [1, 2]
    default: 2
    description:
      Number of lanes available per direction.  Note that it is assume same
      number of lanes is used both directions at once.

  vdd-hba-supply:
    description:
      Phandle to UFS host controller supply regulator node.

  vcc-supply:
    description:
      Phandle to VCC supply regulator node.

  vccq-supply:
    description:
      Phandle to VCCQ supply regulator node.

  vccq2-supply:
    description:
      Phandle to VCCQ2 supply regulator node.

  vcc-supply-1p8:
    type: boolean
    description:
      For embedded UFS devices, valid VCC range is 1.7-1.95V or 2.7-3.6V. This
      boolean property when set, specifies to use low voltage range of
      1.7-1.95V. Note for external UFS cards this property is invalid and valid
      VCC range is always 2.7-3.6V.

  vcc-max-microamp:
    description:
      Specifies max. load that can be drawn from VCC supply.

  vccq-max-microamp:
    description:
      Specifies max. load that can be drawn from VCCQ supply.

  vccq2-max-microamp:
    description:
      Specifies max. load that can be drawn from VCCQ2 supply.
