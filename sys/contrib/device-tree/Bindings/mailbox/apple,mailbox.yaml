description:
  The Apple mailbox consists of two FIFOs used to exchange 64+32 bit
  messages between the main CPU and a co-processor. Multiple instances
  of this mailbox can be found on Apple SoCs.
  One of the two FIFOs is used to send data to a co-processor while the other
  FIFO is used for the other direction.
  Various clients implement different IPC protocols based on these simple
  messages and shared memory buffers.

          ASC mailboxes are the most common variant found on the M1 used
          for example for the display controller, the system management
          controller and the NVMe coprocessor.

          M3 mailboxes are an older variant with a slightly different MMIO
          interface still found on the M1. It is used for the Thunderbolt
