title: Renesas RAA215300 Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC)

description: |
  The RAA215300 is a high-performance, low-cost 9-channel PMIC designed for
  32-bit and 64-bit MCU and MPU applications. It supports DDR3, DDR3L, DDR4,
  and LPDDR4 memory power requirements. The internally compensated regulators,
  built-in Real-Time Clock (RTC), 32kHz crystal oscillator, and coin cell
  battery charger provide a highly integrated, small footprint power solution
  ideal for System-On-Module (SOM) applications. A spread spectrum feature
  provides an ease-of-use solution for noise-sensitive audio or RF applications.

  This device exposes two devices via I2C. One for the integrated RTC IP, and
  one for everything else.
