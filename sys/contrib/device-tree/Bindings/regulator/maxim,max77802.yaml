  This is a part of device tree bindings for Maxim MAX77802 Power Management
  Integrated Circuit (PMIC).

  The Maxim MAX77686 provides 10 high-efficiency Buck and 32 Low-DropOut (LDO)
  regulators.

  See also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/maxim,max77802.yaml for
  additional information and example.

  Certain regulators support "regulator-initial-mode" and "regulator-mode".
  The valid modes list is defined in the dt-bindings/regulator/maxim,max77802.h
  and their meaning is::
    1 - Normal regulator voltage output mode.
    3 - Low Power which reduces the quiescent current down to only 1uA

  The standard "regulator-mode" property can only be used for regulators that
  support changing their mode to Low Power Mode during suspend. These
  regulators are:: bucks 2-4 and LDOs 1-35. Also, it only takes effect if the
  regulator has been enabled for the given suspend state using
  "regulator-on-in-suspend" and has not been disabled for that state using
  "regulator-off-in-suspend".
