Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. RPMh Regulators

rpmh-regulator devices support PMIC regulator management via the Voltage
Regulator Manager (VRM) and Oscillator Buffer (XOB) RPMh accelerators.  The APPS
processor communicates with these hardware blocks via a Resource State
Coordinator (RSC) using command packets.  The VRM allows changing three
parameters for a given regulator: enable state, output voltage, and operating
mode.  The XOB allows changing only a single parameter for a given regulator:
its enable state.  Despite its name, the XOB is capable of controlling the
enable state of any PMIC peripheral.  It is used for clock buffers, low-voltage
switches, and LDO/SMPS regulators which have a fixed voltage and mode.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

RPMh regulators must be described in two levels of device nodes.  The first
level describes the PMIC containing the regulators and must reside within an
RPMh device node.  The second level describes each regulator within the PMIC
which is to be used on the board.  Each of these regulators maps to a single
RPMh resource.

The names used for regulator nodes must match those supported by a given PMIC.
Supported regulator node names:
	PM8005:		smps1 - smps4
	PM8009:		smps1 - smps2, ldo1 - ldo7
	PM8150:		smps1 - smps10, ldo1 - ldo18
	PM8150L:	smps1 - smps8, ldo1 - ldo11, bob, flash, rgb
	PM8350:		smps1 - smps12, ldo1 - ldo10,
	PM8350C:	smps1 - smps10, ldo1 - ldo13, bob
	PM8998:		smps1 - smps13, ldo1 - ldo28, lvs1 - lvs2
	PMI8998:	bob
	PM6150:         smps1 - smps5, ldo1 - ldo19
	PM6150L:        smps1 - smps8, ldo1 - ldo11, bob
	PMX55:		smps1 - smps7, ldo1 - ldo16

Other properties defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
may also be used.  regulator-initial-mode and regulator-allowed-modes may be
specified for VRM regulators using mode values from
include/dt-bindings/regulator/qcom,rpmh-regulator.h.  regulator-allow-bypass
may be specified for BOB type regulators managed via VRM.
regulator-allow-set-load may be specified for LDO type regulators managed via
VRM.
