    description: The address of the BMC on the IPMB bus.  Defaults to 0x20.

  retry-time:

    description: |
      Time between retries of sends, in milliseconds.  Defaults to 250.

  max-retries:

    description: Number of retries before a failure is declared.  Defaults to 1.

    description: |
      The slave i2c device.  If not present, the main device is used. This
      lets you use two devices on the IPMB, one for master and one for slave,
      in case you have a slave device that can only be a slave.  The slave
      will receive messages and the master will transmit.
