    default: 0
    description:
      Estimated number of bits of true entropy per 1024 bits read from the rng.
      Defaults to zero which causes the kernel's default quality to be used
      instead.  Note that the default quality is usually zero which disables
      using this rng to automatically fill the kernel's entropy pool.

      Base address to sample from. Currently 'reg' must be at least four bytes
      wide and 32-bit aligned.
