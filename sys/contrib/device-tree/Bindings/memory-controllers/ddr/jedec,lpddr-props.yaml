title: Common properties for LPDDR types

description:
  Different LPDDR types generally use the same properties and only differ in the
  range of legal values for each. This file defines the common parts that can be
  reused for each type. Nodes using this schema should generally be nested under
  an LPDDR channel node.

properties:
  compatible:
    description:
      Compatible strings can be either explicit vendor names and part numbers
      (e.g. elpida,ECB240ABACN), or generated strings of the form
      lpddrX-YY,ZZZZ where X is the LPDDR version, YY is the manufacturer ID
      (from MR5) and ZZZZ is the revision ID (from MR6 and MR7). Both IDs are
      formatted in lower case hexadecimal representation with leading zeroes.
      The latter form can be useful when LPDDR nodes are created at runtime by
      boot firmware that doesn't have access to static part number information.
