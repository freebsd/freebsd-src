title: LPDDR channel with chip/rank topology description

description:
  An LPDDR channel is a completely independent set of LPDDR pins (DQ, CA, CS,
  CK, etc.) that connect one or more LPDDR chips to a host system. The main
  purpose of this node is to overall LPDDR topology of the system, including the
  amount of individual LPDDR chips and the ranks per chip.

    enum:
      - jedec,lpddr2-channel
      - jedec,lpddr3-channel
      - jedec,lpddr4-channel
      - jedec,lpddr5-channel

  io-width:
    description:
      The number of DQ pins in the channel. If this number is different
      from (a multiple of) the io-width of the LPDDR chip, that means that
      multiple instances of that type of chip are wired in parallel on this
      channel (with the channel's DQ pins split up between the different
      chips, and the CA, CS, etc. pins of the different chips all shorted
      together).  This means that the total physical memory controlled by a
      channel is equal to the sum of the densities of each rank on the
      connected LPDDR chip, times the io-width of the channel divided by
      the io-width of the LPDDR chip.

    description:
      Each physical LPDDR chip may have one or more ranks. Ranks are
      internal but fully independent sub-units of the chip. Each LPDDR bus
      transaction on the channel targets exactly one rank, based on the
      state of the CS pins. Different ranks may have different densities and
      timing requirements.
