description:
  This binding is meant for the child nodes of the GPMC node. The node
  represents any device connected to the GPMC bus. It may be a Flash chip,
  RAM chip or Ethernet controller, etc. These properties are meant for
  configuring the GPMC settings/timings and will accompany the bindings
  supported by the respective device.
