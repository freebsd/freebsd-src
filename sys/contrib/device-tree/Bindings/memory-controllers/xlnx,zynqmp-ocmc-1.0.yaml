description: |
  The OCM supports 64-bit wide ECC functionality to detect multi-bit errors
  and recover from a single-bit memory fault.On a write, if all bytes are
  being written, the ECC is generated and written into the ECC RAM along with
  the write-data that is written into the data RAM. If one or more bytes are
  not written, then the read operation results in an correctable error or
  uncorrectable error.
