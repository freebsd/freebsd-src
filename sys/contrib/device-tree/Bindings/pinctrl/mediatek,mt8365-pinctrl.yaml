          A pinctrl node should contain at least one subnode representing the
          pinctrl groups available on the machine. Each subnode will list the
          pins it needs, and how they should be configured, with regard to muxer
          configuration, pullups, drive strength, input enable/disable and input
          schmitt.

              Describe the specific driving setup property.
              For I2C pins, the existing generic driving setup can only support
              2/4/6/8/10/12/14/16mA driving. But in specific driving setup, they
              can support 0.125/0.25/0.5/1mA adjustment. If we enable specific
              driving setup, the existing generic setup will be disabled.
              The specific driving setup is controlled by E1E0EN.
              When E1=0/E0=0, the strength is 0.125mA.
              When E1=0/E0=1, the strength is 0.25mA.
              When E1=1/E0=0, the strength is 0.5mA.
              When E1=1/E0=1, the strength is 1mA.
              EN is used to enable or disable the specific driving setup.
              Valid arguments are described as below:
              0: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 0, 0)
              1: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 0, 1)
              2: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 1, 0)
              3: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 1, 1)
              4: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 0, 0)
              5: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 0, 1)
              6: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 1, 0)
              7: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 1, 1)
              So the valid arguments are from 0 to 7.
