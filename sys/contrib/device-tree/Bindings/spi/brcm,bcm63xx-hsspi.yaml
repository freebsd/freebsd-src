description: |
  Broadcom Broadband SoC supports High Speed SPI master controller since the
  early MIPS based chips such as BCM6328 and BCM63268.  This initial rev 1.0
  controller was carried over to recent ARM based chips, such as BCM63138,
  BCM4908 and BCM6858. The old MIPS based chip should continue to use the
  brcm,bcm6328-hsspi compatible string. The recent ARM based chip is required to
  use the brcm,bcmbca-hsspi-v1.0 as part of its compatible string list as
  defined below to match the specific chip along with ip revision info.

  This rev 1.0 controller has a limitation that can not keep the chip select line
  active between the SPI transfers within the same SPI message. This can
  terminate the transaction to some SPI devices prematurely. The issue can be
  worked around by either the controller's prepend mode or using the dummy chip
  select workaround. Driver automatically picks the suitable mode based on
  transfer type so it is transparent to the user.

  The newer SoCs such as BCM6756, BCM4912 and BCM6855 include an updated SPI
  controller rev 1.1 that add the capability to allow the driver to control chip
  select explicitly. This solves the issue in the old controller.
