title: Analog Devices AXI SPI Engine Controller

description: |
  The AXI SPI Engine controller is part of the SPI Engine framework[1] and
  allows memory mapped access to the SPI Engine control bus. This allows it
  to be used as a general purpose software driven SPI controller as well as
  some optional advanced acceleration and offloading capabilities.
