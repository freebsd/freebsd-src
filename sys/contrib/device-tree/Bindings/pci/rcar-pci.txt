	    "renesas,pcie-r8a77990" for the R8A77990 SoC;
	    "renesas,pcie-rcar-gen2" for a generic R-Car Gen2 or
				     RZ/G1 compatible device.
	    "renesas,pcie-rcar-gen3" for a generic R-Car Gen3 or
				     RZ/G2 compatible device.

	    When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	    SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	    followed by the generic version.

- reg: base address and length of the PCIe controller registers.
- #address-cells: set to <3>
- #size-cells: set to <2>
- bus-range: PCI bus numbers covered
- device_type: set to "pci"
- ranges: ranges for the PCI memory and I/O regions.
- dma-ranges: ranges for the inbound memory regions.
- interrupts: two interrupt sources for MSI interrupts, followed by interrupt
	source for hardware related interrupts (e.g. link speed change).
- #interrupt-cells: set to <1>
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: standard PCI properties
	to define the mapping of the PCIe interface to interrupt numbers.
- clocks: from common clock binding: clock specifiers for the PCIe controller
	and PCIe bus clocks.
- clock-names: from common clock binding: should be "pcie" and "pcie_bus".

Optional properties:
- phys: from common PHY binding: PHY phandle and specifier (only make sense
	for R-Car gen3 SoCs where the PCIe PHYs have their own register blocks).
- phy-names: from common PHY binding: should be "pcie".
