description:
  ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) integrates one or more CPU cores with a shared
  L3 memory system, control logic and external interfaces to form a multicore
  cluster. The PMU enables gathering various statistics on the operation of the
  DSU. The PMU provides independent 32-bit counters that can count any of the
  supported events, along with a 64-bit cycle counter. The PMU is accessed via
  CPU system registers and has no MMIO component.
