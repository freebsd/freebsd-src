max17040_battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : "maxim,max17040", "maxim,max17041", "maxim,max17043",
		"maxim,max17044", "maxim,max17048", "maxim,max17049",
		"maxim,max17058", "maxim,max17059" or "maxim,max77836-battery"
 - reg: i2c slave address

Optional properties :
- maxim,alert-low-soc-level :	The alert threshold that sets the state of
				charge level (%) where an interrupt is
				generated. Can be configured from 1 up to 32
				(%). If skipped the power up default value of
				4 (%) will be used.
- maxim,double-soc : 		Certain devices return double the capacity.
				Specify this boolean property to divide the
				reported value in 2 and thus normalize it.
				SOC == State of Charge == Capacity.
- maxim,rcomp :			A value to compensate readings for various
				battery chemistries and operating temperatures.
				max17040,41 have 2 byte rcomp, default to
				0x97 0x00. All other devices have one byte
				rcomp, default to 0x97.
- interrupts : 			Interrupt line see Documentation/devicetree/
				bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
- wakeup-source :		This device has wakeup capabilities. Use this
				property to use alert low SOC level interrupt
				as wake up source.

Optional properties support interrupt functionality for alert low state of
charge level, present in some ICs in the same family, and should be used with
compatible "maxim,max77836-battery".

Example:

	battery-fuel-gauge@36 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77836-battery";
		reg = <0x36>;
		maxim,alert-low-soc-level = <10>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio7>;
		interrupts = <2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		wakeup-source;
	};

	battery-fuel-gauge@36 {
		compatible = "maxim,max17048";
		reg = <0x36>;
		maxim,rcomp = /bits/ 8 <0x56>;
		maxim,alert-low-soc-level = <10>;
		maxim,double-soc;
	};
