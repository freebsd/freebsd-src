description:
  Basic battery capacity meter, which only reports basic battery data
  via ADC channels and optionally indicate that the battery is full by
  polling a GPIO line.

  The voltage is expected to be measured between the battery terminals
  and mandatory. The optional current/power channel is expected to
  monitor the current/power flowing out of the battery. Last but not
  least the temperature channel is supposed to measure the battery
  temperature.
