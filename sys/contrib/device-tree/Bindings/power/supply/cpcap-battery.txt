Motorola CPCAP PMIC battery driver binding

Required properties:
- compatible: Shall be "motorola,cpcap-battery"
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for each name in interrupt-names
- interrupt-names: Should contain the following entries:
		   "lowbph", "lowbpl", "chrgcurr1", "battdetb"
- io-channels: IIO ADC channel specifier for each name in io-channel-names
- io-channel-names: Should contain the following entries:
		    "battdetb", "battp", "chg_isense", "batti"
- power-supplies: List of phandles for power-supplying devices, as
		  described in power_supply.txt. Typically a reference
		  to cpcap_charger.

Example:

cpcap_battery: battery {
	compatible = "motorola,cpcap-battery";
	interrupts-extended = <
		&cpcap 5 0 &cpcap 3 0
		&cpcap 20 0 &cpcap 54 0
	>;
	interrupt-names =
		"lowbph", "lowbpl",
		"chrgcurr1", "battdetb";
	io-channels = <&cpcap_adc 0 &cpcap_adc 1
		       &cpcap_adc 5 &cpcap_adc 6>;
	io-channel-names = "battdetb", "battp",
			   "chg_isense", "batti";
	power-supplies = <&cpcap_charger>;
};
