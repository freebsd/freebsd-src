Binding for NXP ISP1704 USB Charger Detection

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
 * "nxp,isp1704"
- nxp,enable-gpio: Should contain a phandle + gpio-specifier
  to the GPIO pin connected to the chip's enable pin.
- usb-phy: Should contain a phandle to the USB PHY
  the ISP1704 is connected to.

Example:

isp1704 {
	compatible = "nxp,isp1704";
	nxp,enable-gpio = <&gpio3 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	usb-phy = <&usb2_phy>;
};
