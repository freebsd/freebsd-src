Devicetree bindings for Maxim DS2760
====================================

The ds2760 is a w1 slave device and must hence have its sub-node in DT
under a w1 bus master node.

The device exposes a power supply, so the details described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/power_supply.txt apply.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "maxim,ds2760"

Optional properties:
- power-supplies:	Refers to one or more power supplies connected to
			this battery.
- maxim,pmod-enabled:	This boolean property enables the DS2760 to enter
			sleep mode when the DQ line goes low for greater
			than 2 seconds and leave sleep Mode when the DQ
			line goes high.
- maxim,cache-time-ms:	Time im milliseconds to cache the data for. When
			this time expires, the values are read again from
			the hardware. Defaults to 1000.
- rated-capacity-microamp-hours:
			The rated capacity of the battery, in mAh.
			If not specified, the value stored in the
			non-volatile chip memory is used.
