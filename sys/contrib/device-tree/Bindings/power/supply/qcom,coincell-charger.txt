Qualcomm Coincell Charger:

The hardware block controls charging for a coincell or capacitor that is
used to provide power backup for certain features of the power management
IC (PMIC)

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be: "qcom,pm8941-coincell"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: base address of the coincell charger registers

- qcom,rset-ohms:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: resistance (in ohms) for current-limiting resistor
		must be one of: 800, 1200, 1700, 2100

- qcom,vset-millivolts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: voltage (in millivolts) to apply for charging
		must be one of: 2500, 3000, 3100, 3200

- qcom,charger-disable:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <boolean>
	Definition: defining this property disables charging

This charger is a sub-node of one of the 8941 PMIC blocks, and is specified
as a child node in DTS of that node.  See ../mfd/qcom,spmi-pmic.txt and
../mfd/qcom-pm8xxx.txt

Example:

	pm8941@0 {
		coincell@2800 {
			compatible = "qcom,pm8941-coincell";
			reg = <0x2800>;

			qcom,rset-ohms = <2100>;
			qcom,vset-millivolts = <3000>;
		};
	};
