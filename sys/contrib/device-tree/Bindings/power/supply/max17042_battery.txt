max17042_battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : one of the following
 * "maxim,max17042"
 * "maxim,max17047"
 * "maxim,max17050"
 * "maxim,max17055"

Optional properties :
 - maxim,rsns-microohm : Resistance of rsns resistor in micro Ohms
                         (datasheet-recommended value is 10000).
   Defining this property enables current-sense functionality.

Optional threshold properties :
 If skipped the condition won't be reported.
 - maxim,cold-temp :      Temperature threshold to report battery
                          as cold (in tenths of degree Celsius).
 - maxim,over-heat-temp : Temperature threshold to report battery
                          as over heated (in tenths of degree Celsius).
 - maxim,dead-volt :      Voltage threshold to report battery
                          as dead (in mV).
 - maxim,over-volt :      Voltage threshold to report battery
                          as over voltage (in mV).

Example:

	battery-charger@36 {
		compatible = "maxim,max17042";
		reg = <0x36>;
		maxim,rsns-microohm = <10000>;
		maxim,over-heat-temp = <600>;
		maxim,over-volt = <4300>;
	};
