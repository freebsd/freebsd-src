Binding for TI bq2415x Li-Ion Charger

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
 * "ti,bq24150"
 * "ti,bq24150"
 * "ti,bq24150a"
 * "ti,bq24151"
 * "ti,bq24151a"
 * "ti,bq24152"
 * "ti,bq24153"
 * "ti,bq24153a"
 * "ti,bq24155"
 * "ti,bq24156"
 * "ti,bq24156a"
 * "ti,bq24158"
- reg:			   integer, i2c address of the device.
- ti,current-limit:	   integer, initial maximum current charger can pull
			   from power supply in mA.
- ti,weak-battery-voltage: integer, weak battery voltage threshold in mV.
			   The chip will use slow precharge if battery voltage
			   is below this value.
- ti,battery-regulation-voltage: integer, maximum charging voltage in mV.
- ti,charge-current:	   integer, maximum charging current in mA.
- ti,termination-current:  integer, charge will be terminated when current in
			   constant-voltage phase drops below this value (in mA).
- ti,resistor-sense:	   integer, value of sensing resistor in milliohm.

Optional properties:
- ti,usb-charger-detection: phandle to usb charger detection device.
			    (required for auto mode)

Example from Nokia N900:

bq24150a {
	compatible = "ti,bq24150a";
	reg = <0x6b>;

	ti,current-limit = <100>;
	ti,weak-battery-voltage = <3400>;
	ti,battery-regulation-voltage = <4200>;
	ti,charge-current = <650>;
	ti,termination-current = <100>;
	ti,resistor-sense = <68>;

	ti,usb-charger-detection = <&isp1704>;
};
