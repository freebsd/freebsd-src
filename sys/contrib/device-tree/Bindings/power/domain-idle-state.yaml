description:
  A domain idle state node represents the state parameters that will be used to
  select the state when there are no active components in the PM domain.

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: domain-idle-states

patternProperties:

    type: object

    description:
      Each state node represents a domain idle state description.

    properties:
      compatible:
        const: domain-idle-state

      entry-latency-us:
        description:
          The worst case latency in microseconds required to enter the idle
          state. Note that, the exit-latency-us duration may be guaranteed only
          after the entry-latency-us has passed.

      exit-latency-us:
        description:
          The worst case latency in microseconds required to exit the idle
          state.

      min-residency-us:
        description:
          The minimum residency duration in microseconds after which the idle
          state will yield power benefits, after overcoming the overhead while
          entering the idle state.

      arm,psci-suspend-param:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        description: |
          power_state parameter to pass to the ARM PSCI suspend call.

          Device tree nodes that require usage of PSCI CPU_SUSPEND function
          (i.e. idle states node with entry-method property is set to "psci")
          must specify this property.
