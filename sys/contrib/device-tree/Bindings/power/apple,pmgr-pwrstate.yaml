description: |
  Apple SoCs include PMGR blocks responsible for power management,
  which can control various clocks, resets, power states, and
  performance features. This binding describes the device power
  state registers, which control power states and resets.

  Each instance of a power controller within the PMGR syscon node
  represents a generic power domain provider, as documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power-domain.yaml.
  The provider controls a single SoC block. The power hierarchy is
  represented via power-domains relationships between these nodes.

  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/apple/apple,pmgr.yaml
  for the top-level PMGR node documentation.
