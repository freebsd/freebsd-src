description:
  The KPSS ACC provides clock, power manager, and reset control to a Krait CPU.
  There is one ACC register region per CPU within the KPSS remapped region as
  well as an alias register region that remaps accesses to the ACC associated
  with the CPU accessing the region. ACC v2 is currently used as a
  power-manager for enabling the cpu.
