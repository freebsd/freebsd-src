title: Generic SYSCON mapped register poweroff driver

maintainers:

description: |+
  This is a generic poweroff driver using syscon to map the poweroff register.
  The poweroff is generally performed with a write to the poweroff register
  defined by the register map pointed by syscon reference plus the offset
  with the value and mask defined in the poweroff node.
  Default will be little endian mode, 32 bit access only.
  The SYSCON register map is normally retrieved from the parental dt-node. So
  the SYSCON poweroff node should be represented as a sub-node of a "syscon",
  "simple-mfd" node.

  compatible:
    const: syscon-poweroff

  mask:

    description: Update only the register bits defined by the mask (32 bit).

    description:
      Phandle to the register map node. This property is deprecated in favor of
      the syscon-poweroff node being a child of a system controller node.
