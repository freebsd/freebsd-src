description: >
  Drive a GPIO line that can be used to restart the system from a restart handler.

  This binding supports level and edge triggered reset.  At driver load time, the driver will
  request the given gpio line and install a restart handler. If the optional properties
  'open-source' is not found, the GPIO line will be driven in the inactive state.  Otherwise its
  not driven until the restart is initiated.

  When the system is restarted, the restart handler will be invoked in priority order.  The GPIO
  is configured as an output, and driven active, triggering a level triggered reset condition.
  This will also cause an inactive->active edge condition, triggering positive edge triggered
  reset. After a delay specified by active-delay, the GPIO is set to inactive, thus causing an
  active->inactive edge, triggering negative edge triggered reset. After a delay specified by
  inactive-delay, the GPIO is driven active again.  After a delay specified by wait-delay, the
  restart handler completes allowing other restart handlers to be attempted.
