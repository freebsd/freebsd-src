title: GPIO controlled power off

description: >
  System power off support via a GPIO line. When a shutdown is
  executed the operating system is expected to switch the GPIO
  from inactive to active. After a delay (active-delay-ms) it
  is expected to be switched back to inactive. After another
  delay (inactive-delay-ms) it is configured as active again.
  Finally the operating system assumes the power off failed if
  the system is still running after waiting some time (timeout-ms).

      Initially configure the GPIO line as an input. Only reconfigure
      it to an output when the power-off sequence is initiated. If this optional
      property is not specified, the GPIO is initialized as an output in its inactive state.
