title: HID over I2C Devices

description: |+
  HID over I2C provides support for various Human Interface Devices over the
  I2C bus. These devices can be for example touchpads, keyboards, touch screens
  or sensors.

  The specification has been written by Microsoft and is currently available here:
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh852380.aspx

  If this binding is used, the kernel module i2c-hid will handle the communication
  with the device and the generic hid core layer will handle the protocol.
