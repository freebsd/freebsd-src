title: PWM vibrator

maintainers:

description: >
  Registers a PWM device as vibrator. It is expected, that the vibrator's
  strength increases based on the duty cycle of the enable PWM channel
  (100% duty cycle meaning strongest vibration, 0% meaning no vibration).

  The binding supports an optional direction PWM channel, that can be
  driven at fixed duty cycle. If available this is can be used to increase
  the vibration effect of some devices.
