  vdd-supply:
    description: Digital power supply regulator on the VDD pin.
      In older device trees this can be the accidental name for the analog
      supply on the VCCA pin, and in that case the deprecated vddo-supply is
      used for the digital power supply.

  vddo-supply:
    description: Deprecated name for the digital power supply, use vdd-supply
      as this reflects the real name of the pin. If this supply is present,
      the vdd-supply represents VCCA instead of VDD. Implementers should first
      check for this property, and if it is present assume that the vdd-supply
      represents the analog supply.

      If the touch-keys are enabled, controller firmware will assign some
      touch sense lines to those keys.
