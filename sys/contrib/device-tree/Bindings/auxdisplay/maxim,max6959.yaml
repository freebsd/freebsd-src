title: MAX6958/6959 7-segment LED display controller

description:
  The Maxim MAX6958/6959 7-segment LED display controller provides
  an I2C interface to up to four 7-segment LED digits. The MAX6959,
  in comparison to MAX6958, adds input support. Type of the chip can
  be autodetected via specific register read, and hence the features
  may be enabled in the driver at run-time, in case they are requested
  via Device Tree. A given hardware is simple and does not provide
  any additional pins, such as reset or power enable.
