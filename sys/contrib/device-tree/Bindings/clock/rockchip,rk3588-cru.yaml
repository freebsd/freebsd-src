title: Rockchip rk3588 Family Clock and Reset Control Module

description: |
  The RK3588 clock controller generates the clock and also implements a reset
  controller for SoC peripherals. For example it provides SCLK_UART2 and
  PCLK_UART2, as well as SRST_P_UART2 and SRST_S_UART2 for the second UART
  module.
  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. All available clock and reset IDs
  are defined as preprocessor macros in dt-binding headers.
