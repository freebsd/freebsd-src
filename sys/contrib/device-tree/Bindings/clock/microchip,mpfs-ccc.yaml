description: |
  Microchip PolarFire SoC has 4 Clock Conditioning Circuitry blocks. Each of
  these blocks contains two PLLs and 2 DLLs & are located in the four corners of
  the FPGA. For more information see "PolarFire SoC FPGA Clocking Resources" at:
  https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-8F0CC4C0-0317-4262-89CA-CE7773ED1931-en-US-1/index.html

      The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
      ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.
      See include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,mpfs-clock.h for the full list of
      PolarFire clock IDs.
