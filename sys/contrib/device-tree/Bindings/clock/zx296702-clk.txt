Device Tree Clock bindings for ZTE zx296702

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"zte,zx296702-topcrm-clk":
		zx296702 top clock selection, divider and gating

	"zte,zx296702-lsp0crpm-clk" and
	"zte,zx296702-lsp1crpm-clk":
		zx296702 device level clock selection and gating

- reg: Address and length of the register set

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/zx296702-clock.h
for the full list of zx296702 clock IDs.
