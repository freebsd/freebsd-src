title: Rockchip RK3036 Clock and Reset Unit (CRU)

description: |
  The RK3036 clock controller generates and supplies clocks to various
  controllers within the SoC and also implements a reset controller for SoC
  peripherals.
  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
  preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/rk3036-cru.h headers and can be
  used in device tree sources. Similar macros exist for the reset sources in
  these files.
  There are several clocks that are generated outside the SoC. It is expected
  that they are defined using standard clock bindings with following
  clock-output-names:
    - "xin24m"     - crystal input       - required
    - "ext_i2s"    - external I2S clock  - optional
    - "rmii_clkin" - external EMAC clock - optional
