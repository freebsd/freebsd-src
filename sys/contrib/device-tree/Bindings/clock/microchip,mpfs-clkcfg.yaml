description: |
  Microchip PolarFire clock control (CLKCFG) is an integrated clock controller,
  which gates and enables all peripheral clocks.

  This device tree binding describes 33 gate clocks.  Clocks are referenced by
  user nodes by the CLKCFG node phandle and the clock index in the group, from
  0 to 32.

          clock config registers:
          These registers contain enable, reset & divider tables for the, cpu,
          axi, ahb and rtc/mtimer reference clocks as well as enable and reset
          for the peripheral clocks.

    description: |
      The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
      ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.
      See include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,mpfs-clock.h for the full list of
      PolarFire clock IDs.

  resets:
    maxItems: 1

  '#reset-cells':
    description:
      The AHB/AXI peripherals on the PolarFire SoC have reset support, so from
      CLK_ENVM to CLK_CFM. The reset consumer should specify the desired
      peripheral via the clock ID in its "resets" phandle cell.
      See include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,mpfs-clock.h for the full list of
      PolarFire clock IDs.
