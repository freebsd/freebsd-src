title: Apple SoCs' NCO block

description: |
  The NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) block found on Apple SoCs
  such as the t8103 (M1) is a programmable clock generator performing
  fractional division of a high frequency input clock.

  It carries a number of independent channels and is typically used for
  generation of audio bitclocks.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - enum:
          - apple,t6000-nco

          - apple,t8112-nco
      - const: apple,nco

  clocks:
    description:
      Specifies the reference clock from which the output clocks
      are derived through fractional division.
