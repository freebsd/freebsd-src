* Renesas R8A7779 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7779. It includes one PLL and
several fixed ratio dividers.
The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be "renesas,r8a7779-cpg-clocks"
  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

  - clocks: Reference to the parent clock
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1
  - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "plla",
    "z", "zs", "s", "s1", "p", "b", "out".
  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
"power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.


Examples
--------

  - CPG device node:

	cpg_clocks: cpg_clocks@ffc80000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7779-cpg-clocks";
		reg = <0xffc80000 0x30>;
		clocks = <&extal_clk>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "plla", "z", "zs", "s", "s1", "p",
		                     "b", "out";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
	};


  - CPG/MSTP Clock Domain member device node:

	sata: sata@fc600000 {
		compatible = "renesas,sata-r8a7779", "renesas,rcar-sata";
		reg = <0xfc600000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <0 100 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp1_clks R8A7779_CLK_SATA>;
		power-domains = <&cpg_clocks>;
	};
