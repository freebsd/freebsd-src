title: Rockchip RK3188/RK3066 Clock and Reset Unit (CRU)

description: |
  The RK3188/RK3066 clock controller generates and supplies clocks to various
  controllers within the SoC and also implements a reset controller for SoC
  peripherals.
  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
  preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/rk3188-cru.h and
  dt-bindings/clock/rk3066-cru.h headers and can be used in device tree sources.
  Similar macros exist for the reset sources in these files.
  There are several clocks that are generated outside the SoC. It is expected
  that they are defined using standard clock bindings with following
  clock-output-names:
    - "xin24m"    - crystal input                 - required
    - "xin32k"    - RTC clock                     - optional
    - "xin27m"    - 27mhz crystal input on RK3066 - optional
    - "ext_hsadc" - external HSADC clock          - optional
    - "ext_cif0"  - external camera clock         - optional
    - "ext_rmii"  - external RMII clock           - optional
    - "ext_jtag"  - external JTAG clock           - optional
