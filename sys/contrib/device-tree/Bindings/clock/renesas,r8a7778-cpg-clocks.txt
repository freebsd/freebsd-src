* Renesas R8A7778 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7778. It includes two PLLs and
several fixed ratio dividers.
The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be "renesas,r8a7778-cpg-clocks"
  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1
  - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are
    "plla", "pllb", "b", "out", "p", "s", and "s1".
  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
"power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.


Examples
--------

  - CPG device node:

	cpg_clocks: cpg_clocks@ffc80000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7778-cpg-clocks";
		reg = <0xffc80000 0x80>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&extal_clk>;
		clock-output-names = "plla", "pllb", "b",
				     "out", "p", "s", "s1";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
	};


  - CPG/MSTP Clock Domain member device node:

	sdhi0: sd@ffe4c000 {
		compatible = "renesas,sdhi-r8a7778";
		reg = <0xffe4c000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 87 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp3_clks R8A7778_CLK_SDHI0>;
		power-domains = <&cpg_clocks>;
	};
