title: Silicon Labs Si5351A/B/C programmable I2C clock generators

description: |
  The Silicon Labs Si5351A/B/C are programmable I2C clock generators with up to
  8 outputs. Si5351A also has a reduced pin-count package (10-MSOP) where only 3
  output clocks are accessible. The internal structure of the clock generators
  can be found in [1].

                1 - do not reset when PLL rate is adjusted

            In mode 1, the PLL is only reset if the silabs,pll-reset is
            specified in one of the clock output child nodes that also sources
            the PLL. This mode may be preferable if output clocks are expected
            to be adjusted without glitches.
