description: |
  SB Remote Management Interface (SB-RMI) is an SMBus compatible
  interface that reports AMD SoC's Power (normalized Power) using,
  Mailbox Service Request and resembles a typical 8-pin remote power
  sensor's I2C interface to BMC. The power attributes in hwmon
  reports power in microwatts.

      I2C bus address of the device as specified in Section SBI SMBus Address
      of the SoC register reference. The SB-RMI address is normally 78h for
      socket 0 and 70h for socket 1, but it could vary based on hardware
      address select pins.
