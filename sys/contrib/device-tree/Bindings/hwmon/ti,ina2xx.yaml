  shunt-resistor:

      Shunt resistor value in micro-Ohm.

  ti,shunt-gain:
    description: |
      Programmable gain divisor for the shunt voltage accuracy and range. This
      property only applies to devices that have configurable PGA/ADCRANGE. The
      gain value is used configure the gain and to convert the shunt voltage,
      current and power register values when reading measurements from the
      device.

      For devices that have a configurable PGA (e.g. INA209, INA219, INA220),
      the gain value maps directly with the PG bits of the config register.

      For devices that have ADCRANGE configuration (e.g. INA238) a shunt-gain
      value of 1 maps to ADCRANGE=1 where no gain divisor is applied to the
      shunt voltage, and a value of 4 maps to ADCRANGE=0 such that a wider
      voltage range is used.

      The default value is device dependent, and is defined by the reset value
      of PGA/ADCRANGE in the respective configuration registers.

  vs-supply:
    description: phandle to the regulator that provides the VS supply typically
      in range from 2.7 V to 5.5 V.

  ti,alert-polarity-active-high:
    description: Alert pin is asserted based on the value of Alert polarity Bit
      of Mask/Enable register. Default value is Normal (0 which maps to
      active-low open collector). The other value is Inverted
      (1 which maps to active-high open collector). Specify this property to set
      the alert polarity to active-high.
