Murata ZPA2326 pressure sensor

Pressure sensor from Murata with SPI and I2C bus interfaces.

Required properties:
- compatible: "murata,zpa2326"
- reg: the I2C address or SPI chip select the device will respond to

Recommended properties for SPI bus usage:
- spi-max-frequency: maximum SPI bus frequency as documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Optional properties:
- vref-supply: an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VREF
  power to the sensor
- vdd-supply: an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
  power to the sensor
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ as documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Example:

zpa2326@5c {
	compatible = "murata,zpa2326";
	reg = <0x5c>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <12>;
	vdd-supply = <&ldo_1v8_gnss>;
};
