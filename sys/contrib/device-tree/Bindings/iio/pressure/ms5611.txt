MEAS ms5611 family pressure sensors

Pressure sensors from MEAS Switzerland with SPI and I2C bus interfaces.

Required properties:
- compatible: "meas,ms5611" or "meas,ms5607"
- reg: the I2C address or SPI chip select the device will respond to

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
  power to the sensor.

Example:

ms5607@77 {
	compatible = "meas,ms5607";
	reg = <0x77>;
	vdd-supply = <&ldo_3v3_gnss>;
};
