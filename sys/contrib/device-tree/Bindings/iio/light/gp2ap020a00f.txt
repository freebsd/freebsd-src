* Sharp GP2AP020A00F I2C Proximity/ALS sensor

The proximity detector sensor requires power supply
for its built-in led. It is also defined by this binding.

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "sharp,gp2ap020a00f"
  - reg : the I2C slave address of the light sensor
  - interrupts : interrupt specifier for the sole interrupt generated
		 by the device
  - vled-supply : VLED power supply, as covered in ../regulator/regulator.txt

Example:

gp2ap020a00f@39 {
	compatible = "sharp,gp2ap020a00f";
	reg = <0x39>;
	interrupts = <2 0>;
	vled-supply = <...>;
};
