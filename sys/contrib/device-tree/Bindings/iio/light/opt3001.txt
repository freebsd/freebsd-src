* Texas Instruments OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor

The driver supports interrupt-driven and interrupt-less operation, depending
on whether an interrupt property has been populated into the DT. Note that
the optional generation of IIO events on rising/falling light threshold changes
requires the use of interrupts. Without interrupts, only the simple reading
of the current light value is supported through the IIO API.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "ti,opt3001"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:
  - interrupts: interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ (configure for falling edge)

Example:

opt3001@44 {
	compatible = "ti,opt3001";
	reg = <0x44>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
};
