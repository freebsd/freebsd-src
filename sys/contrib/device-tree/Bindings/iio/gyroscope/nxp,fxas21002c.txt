* NXP FXAS21002C Gyroscope device tree bindings

http://www.nxp.com/products/sensors/gyroscopes/3-axis-digital-gyroscope:FXAS21002C

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "nxp,fxas21002c"
  - reg : the I2C address of the sensor or SPI chip select number for the
          device.
  - vdd-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the sensor.
  - vddio-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the bus.

Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios : gpio used to reset the device, see gpio/gpio.txt
  - interrupts : device support 2 interrupts, INT1 and INT2,
                 the interrupts can be triggered on rising or falling edges.
                 See interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - interrupt-names: should contain "INT1" or "INT2", the gyroscope interrupt
                     line in use.
  - drive-open-drain: the interrupt/data ready line will be configured
                      as open drain, which is useful if several sensors share
                      the same interrupt line. This is a boolean property.
                      (This binding is taken from pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt)

Example:

gyroscope@20 {
	compatible = "nxp,fxas21002c";
	reg = <0x20>;
	vdd-supply = <&reg_peri_3p15v>;
	vddio-supply = <&reg_peri_3p15v>;
};
