description: |
  The PAC1921 is a power/current monitoring device with an analog output
  and I2C/SMBus interface.

  Datasheet can be found here:
  https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PAC1921-Data-Sheet-DS20005293E.pdf

properties:
  compatible:
    const: microchip,pac1921

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  vdd-supply: true

  "#io-channel-cells":
    const: 1

  shunt-resistor-micro-ohms:
    description:
      Value in micro Ohms of the shunt resistor connected between
      the SENSE+ and SENSE- inputs, across which the current is measured.
      Value is needed to compute the scaling of the measured current.

  label:
    description: Unique name to identify which device this is.

  read-integrate-gpios:
    description:
      READ/INT input pin to control the current state of the device, either in
      the INTEGRATE state when driven high, or in the READ state when driven low.
      When not connected the pin is floating and it can be overridden by the
      INT_EN register bit after asserting the READ/INT_OVR register bit.
