description: |
  The LMP92064 is a two channel ADC intended for combined voltage and current
  measurements.

  The device contains two ADCs to allow simultaneous sampling of voltage and
  current and thus of instantaneous power consumption.

  shunt-resistor-micro-ohms:
    description: |
      Value of the shunt resistor (in µΩ) connected between INCP and INCN,
      across which current is measured. Used to provide correct scaling of the
      raw ADC measurement.
