* Maxim max9611/max9612 current sense amplifier with 12-bits ADC interface

Maxim max9611/max9612 is an high-side current sense amplifier with integrated
12-bits ADC communicating over I2c bus.
The device node for this driver shall be a child of a I2c controller.

Required properties
  - compatible: Should be "maxim,max9611" or "maxim,max9612"
  - reg: The 7-bits long I2c address of the device
  - shunt-resistor-micro-ohms: Value, in micro Ohms, of the current sense shunt
			        resistor

Example:

&i2c4 {
	csa: adc@7c {
		compatible = "maxim,max9611";
		reg = <0x7c>;

		shunt-resistor-micro-ohms = <5000>;
	};
};

This device node describes a current sense amplifier sitting on I2c4 bus
with address 0x7c (read address is 0xf9, write address is 0xf8).
A sense resistor of 0,005 Ohm is installed between RS+ and RS- current-sensing
inputs.
