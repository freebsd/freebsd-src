* Texas Instruments' ads124s08 and ads124s06 ADC chip

Required properties:
 - compatible :
	"ti,ads124s08"
	"ti,ads124s06"
 - reg : spi chip select number for the device

Recommended properties:
 - spi-max-frequency : Definition as per
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
 - spi-cpha : Definition as per
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Optional properties:
 - reset-gpios : GPIO pin used to reset the device.

Example:
adc@0 {
	compatible = "ti,ads124s08";
	reg = <0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	spi-cpha;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio1 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};
