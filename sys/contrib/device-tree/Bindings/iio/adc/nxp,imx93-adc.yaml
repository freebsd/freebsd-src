description:
  The ADC on iMX93 is a 8-channel 12-bit 1MS/s ADC with 4 channels
  connected to pins. it support normal and inject mode, include
  One-Shot and Scan (continuous) conversions. Programmable DMA
  enables for each channel  Also this ADC contain alternate analog
  watchdog thresholds, select threshold through input ports. And
  also has Self-test logic and Software-initiated calibration.
