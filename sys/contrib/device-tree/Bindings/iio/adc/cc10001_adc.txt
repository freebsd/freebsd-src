* Cosmic Circuits - Analog to Digital Converter (CC-10001-ADC)

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "cosmic,10001-adc"
  - reg: Should contain adc registers location and length.
  - clock-names: Should contain "adc".
  - clocks: Should contain a clock specifier for each entry in clock-names
  - vref-supply: The regulator supply ADC reference voltage.

Optional properties:
  - adc-reserved-channels: Bitmask of reserved channels,
    i.e. channels that cannot be used by the OS.

Example:
adc: adc@18101600 {
	compatible = "cosmic,10001-adc";
	reg = <0x18101600 0x24>;
	adc-reserved-channels = <0x2>;
	clocks = <&adc_clk>;
	clock-names = "adc";
	vref-supply = <&reg_1v8>;
};
