description: |
  • 10-bits resolution for 16 voltage channels.
  • The device split into two individual engine and each contains 8 voltage
  channels.
  • Channel scanning can be non-continuous.
  • Programmable ADC clock frequency.
  • Programmable upper and lower threshold for each channels.
  • Interrupt when larger or less than threshold for each channels.
  • Support hysteresis for each channels.
  • Built-in a compensating method.
  • Built-in a register to trim internal reference voltage.
  • Internal or External reference voltage.
  • Support 2 Internal reference voltage 1.2v or 2.5v.
  • Integrate dividing circuit for battery sensing.
