* Mediatek AUXADC - Analog to Digital Converter on Mediatek mobile soc (mt65xx/mt81xx/mt27xx)
===============

The Auxiliary Analog/Digital Converter (AUXADC) is an ADC found
in some Mediatek SoCs which among other things measures the temperatures
in the SoC. It can be used directly with register accesses, but it is also
used by thermal controller which reads the temperatures from the AUXADC
directly via its own bus interface. See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/mediatek-thermal.txt
for the Thermal Controller which holds a phandle to the AUXADC.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of:
    - "mediatek,mt2701-auxadc": For MT2701 family of SoCs
    - "mediatek,mt2712-auxadc": For MT2712 family of SoCs
    - "mediatek,mt6765-auxadc": For MT6765 family of SoCs
    - "mediatek,mt7622-auxadc": For MT7622 family of SoCs
    - "mediatek,mt8173-auxadc": For MT8173 family of SoCs
    - "mediatek,mt8183-auxadc", "mediatek,mt8173-auxadc": For MT8183 family of SoCs
  - reg: Address range of the AUXADC unit.
  - clocks: Should contain a clock specifier for each entry in clock-names
  - clock-names: Should contain "main".
  - #io-channel-cells: Should be 1, see ../iio-bindings.txt

Example:

auxadc: adc@11001000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt2701-auxadc";
	reg = <0 0x11001000 0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_AUXADC>;
	clock-names = "main";
	#io-channel-cells = <1>;
};
