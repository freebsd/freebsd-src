description: |
  RTDs (Resistance Temperature Detectors) are a kind of temperature sensors
  used to get a linear voltage to temperature reading within a give range
  (usually 0 to 100 degrees Celsius).

  When an io-channel measures the output voltage across an RTD such as a
  PT1000, the interesting measurement is almost always the corresponding
  temperature, not the voltage output. This binding describes such a circuit.

  The general transfer function here is (using SI units)

    V = R(T) * iexc
    R(T) = r0 * (1 + alpha * T)
    T = 1 / (alpha * r0 * iexc) * (V - r0 * iexc)

  The following circuit matches what's in the examples section.

      alpha can also be expressed in micro-ohms per ohm Celsius. It's a linear
      approximation of the resistance versus temperature relationship
      between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius.

      alpha = (R_100 - R_0) / (100 * R_0)

      Where, R_100 is the resistance of the sensor at 100 degrees Celsius, and
      R_0 (or r-naught-ohms) is the resistance of the sensor at 0 degrees
      Celsius.

      Pure platinum has an alpha of 3925. Industry standards such as IEC60751
      and ASTM E-1137 specify an alpha of 3850.

  r-naught-ohms:
    description: |
      Resistance of the sensor at 0 degrees Celsius.
      Common values are 100 for PT100, 500 for PT500, and 1000 for PT1000
