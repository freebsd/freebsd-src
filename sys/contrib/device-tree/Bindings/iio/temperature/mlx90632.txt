* Melexis MLX90632 contactless Infra Red temperature sensor

Link to datasheet: https://www.melexis.com/en/documents/documentation/datasheets/datasheet-mlx90632

There are various applications for the Infra Red contactless temperature sensor
and MLX90632 is most suitable for consumer applications where measured object
temperature is in range between -20 to 200 degrees Celsius with relative error
of measurement below 1 degree Celsius in object temperature range for
industrial applications. Since it can operate and measure ambient temperature
in range of -20 to 85 degrees Celsius it is suitable also for outdoor use.

Be aware that electronics surrounding the sensor can increase ambient
temperature. MLX90632 can be calibrated to reduce the housing effect via
already existing EEPROM parameters.

Since measured object emissivity effects Infra Red energy emitted, emissivity
should be set before requesting the object temperature.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "melexis,mlx90632"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor (default 0x3a)

Example:

mlx90632@3a {
	compatible = "melexis,mlx90632";
	reg = <0x3a>;
};
