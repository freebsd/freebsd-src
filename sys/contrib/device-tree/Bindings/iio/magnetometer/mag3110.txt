* FREESCALE MAG3110 magnetometer sensor

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "fsl,mag3110"
  - reg : the I2C address of the magnetometer

Optional properties:

  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt client
  node bindings.

  - vdd-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the sensor.
  - vddio-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the sensor's IO.

Example:

magnetometer@e {
	compatible = "fsl,mag3110";
	reg = <0x0e>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_i2c3_mag3110_int>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
	interrupts = <16 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
