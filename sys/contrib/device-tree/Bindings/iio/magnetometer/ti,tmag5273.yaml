title: TI TMAG5273 Low-Power Linear 3D Hall-Effect Sensor

maintainers:

description:
  The TI TMAG5273 is a low-power linear 3D Hall-effect sensor. This device
  integrates three independent Hall-effect sensors in the X, Y, and Z axes.
  The device has an integrated temperature sensor available. The TMAG5273
  can be configured through the I2C interface to enable any combination of
  magnetic axes and temperature measurements. An integrated angle calculation
  engine (CORDIC) provides full 360Â° angular position information for both
  on-axis and off-axis angle measurement topologies. The angle calculation is
  performed using two user-selected magnetic axes.

  vcc-supply:
    description:
      A regulator providing 1.7 V to 3.6 V supply voltage on the VCC pin,
      typically 3.3 V.

  interrupts:
    description:
      The low active interrupt can be configured to be fixed width or latched.
      Interrupt events can be configured to be generated from magnetic
      thresholds or when a conversion is completed.
