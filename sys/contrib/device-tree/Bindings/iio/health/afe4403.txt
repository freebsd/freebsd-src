Texas Instruments AFE4403 Heart rate and Pulse Oximeter

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "ti,afe4403".
 - reg			: SPI chip select address of device.
 - tx-supply		: Regulator supply to transmitting LEDs.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device ADC_RDY pin is
			  connected to. For details refer to,
			  ../../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

Optional properties:
 - reset-gpios		: GPIO used to reset the device.
			  For details refer to, ../../gpio/gpio.txt.

For other required and optional properties of SPI slave nodes
please refer to ../../spi/spi-bus.txt.

Example:

&spi0 {
	heart_mon@0 {
		compatible = "ti,afe4403";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;

		tx-supply = <&vbat>;

		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
};
