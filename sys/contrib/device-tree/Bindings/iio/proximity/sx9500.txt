Semtech's SX9500 capacitive proximity button device driver

Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "semtech,sx9500"
	- reg: i2c address where to find the device
	- interrupts : the sole interrupt generated by the device

	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
	interrupt client node bindings.

Optional properties:
	- reset-gpios: Reference to the GPIO connected to the device's active
	  low reset pin.

Example:

sx9500@28 {
	compatible = "semtech,sx9500";
	reg = <0x28>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
	interrupts = <16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio2 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};
