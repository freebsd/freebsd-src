  Awinic's AW96103/AW96105 proximity sensor.
  The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a metric that measures
  the degree of absorption of electromagnetic radiation emitted by
  wireless devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, by human tissue.
  In mobile phone applications, the proximity sensor is primarily
  used to detect the proximity of the human body to the phone. When the
  phone approaches the human body, it will actively reduce the transmit
  power of the antenna to keep the SAR within a safe range. Therefore,
  we also refer to the proximity sensor as a SAR sensor.
