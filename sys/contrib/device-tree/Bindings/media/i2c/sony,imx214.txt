* Sony 1/3.06-Inch 13.13Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Sony imx214 is a 1/3.06-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 4224H x 3200V. It is programmable through an I2C
interface.
Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, through 2 or 4 lanes at a maximum
throughput of 1.2Gbps/lane.


Required Properties:
- compatible: Shall be "sony,imx214".
- reg: I2C bus address of the device. Depending on how the sensor is wired,
       it shall be <0x10> or <0x1a>;
- enable-gpios: GPIO descriptor for the enable pin.
- vdddo-supply: Chip digital IO regulator (1.8V).
- vdda-supply: Chip analog regulator (2.7V).
- vddd-supply: Chip digital core regulator (1.12V).
- clocks: Reference to the xclk clock.
- clock-frequency: Frequency of the xclk clock.

Optional Properties:
- flash-leds: See ../video-interfaces.txt
- lens-focus: See ../video-interfaces.txt

The imx214 device node shall contain one 'port' child node with
an 'endpoint' subnode. For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Required Properties on endpoint:
- data-lanes: check ../video-interfaces.txt
- link-frequencies: check ../video-interfaces.txt
- remote-endpoint: check ../video-interfaces.txt

Example:

	camera-sensor@1a {
		compatible = "sony,imx214";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		vdddo-supply = <&pm8994_lvs1>;
		vddd-supply = <&camera_vddd_1v12>;
		vdda-supply = <&pm8994_l17>;
		lens-focus = <&ad5820>;
		enable-gpios = <&msmgpio 25 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mmcc CAMSS_MCLK0_CLK>;
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		port {
			imx214_ep: endpoint {
				data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
				link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <480000000>;
				remote-endpoint = <&csiphy0_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
