* Omnivision OV7720/OV7725 CMOS sensor

The Omnivision OV7720/OV7725 sensor supports multiple resolutions output,
such as VGA, QVGA, and any size scaling down from CIF to 40x30. It also can
support the YUV422, RGB565/555/444, GRB422 or raw RGB output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: shall be one of
	"ovti,ov7720"
	"ovti,ov7725"
- clocks: reference to the xclk input clock.

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the RSTB pin which is
  active low, if any.
- powerdown-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the PWDN pin which is
  active high, if any.

The device node shall contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
subnode for its digital output video port, in accordance with the video
interface bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/
video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c0 {
	ov772x: camera@21 {
		compatible = "ovti,ov7725";
		reg = <0x21>;
		reset-gpios = <&axi_gpio_0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		powerdown-gpios = <&axi_gpio_0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		clocks = <&xclk>;

		port {
			ov772x_0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&vcap1_in0>;
			};
		};
	};
};
