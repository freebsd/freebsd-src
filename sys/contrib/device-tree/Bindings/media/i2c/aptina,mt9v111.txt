* Aptina MT9V111 CMOS sensor
----------------------------

The Aptina MT9V111 is a 1/4-Inch VGA-format digital image sensor with a core
based on Aptina MT9V011 sensor and an integrated Image Flow Processor (IFP).

The sensor has an active pixel array of 640x480 pixels and can output a number
of image resolution and formats controllable through a simple two-wires
interface.

Required properties:
--------------------

- compatible: shall be "aptina,mt9v111".
- clocks: reference to the system clock input provider.

Optional properties:
--------------------

- enable-gpios: output enable signal, pin name "OE#". Active low.
- standby-gpios: low power state control signal, pin name "STANDBY".
  Active high.
- reset-gpios: chip reset signal, pin name "RESET#". Active low.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node with one 'endpoint' child
sub-node for its digital output video port, in accordance with the video
interface bindings defined in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

Example:
--------

        &i2c1 {
                camera@48 {
                        compatible = "aptina,mt9v111";
                        reg = <0x48>;

                        clocks = <&camera_clk>;

                        port {
                                mt9v111_out: endpoint {
                                        remote-endpoint = <&ceu_in>;
                                };
                        };
                };
        };
