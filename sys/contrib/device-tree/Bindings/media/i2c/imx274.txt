* Sony 1/2.5-Inch 8.51Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Sony imx274 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 3864H x 2202V. It is programmable through I2C
interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.
Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes
at 1440 Mbps.


Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "sony,imx274" for imx274 sensor
- reg: I2C bus address of the device

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: Sensor reset GPIO

The imx274 device node should contain one 'port' child node with
an 'endpoint' subnode. For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
	sensor@1a {
		compatible = "sony,imx274";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio_sensor 0 0>;
		port {
			sensor_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csiss_in>;
			};
		};
	};
