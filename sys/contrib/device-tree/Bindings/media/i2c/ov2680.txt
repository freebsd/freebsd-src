* Omnivision OV2680 MIPI CSI-2 sensor

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ovti,ov2680".
- clocks: reference to the xvclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xvclk".
- DOVDD-supply: Digital I/O voltage supply.
- DVDD-supply: Digital core voltage supply.
- AVDD-supply: Analog voltage supply.

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the powerdown/reset pin,
               if any. This is an active low signal to the OV2680.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, and this port must have a single endpoint in accordance with
 the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Endpoint node required properties for CSI-2 connection are:
- remote-endpoint: a phandle to the bus receiver's endpoint node.
- clock-lanes: should be set to <0> (clock lane on hardware lane 0).
- data-lanes: should be set to <1> (one CSI-2 lane supported).

Example:

&i2c2 {
	ov2680: camera-sensor@36 {
		compatible = "ovti,ov2680";
		reg = <0x36>;
		clocks = <&osc>;
		clock-names = "xvclk";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		DOVDD-supply = <&sw2_reg>;
		DVDD-supply = <&sw2_reg>;
		AVDD-supply = <&reg_peri_3p15v>;

		port {
			ov2680_to_mipi: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_from_sensor>;
				clock-lanes = <0>;
				data-lanes = <1>;
			};
		};
	};
};
