Renesas R-Car Fine Display Processor (FDP1)
-------------------------------------------

The FDP1 is a de-interlacing module which converts interlaced video to
progressive video. It is capable of performing pixel format conversion between
YCbCr/YUV formats and RGB formats. Only YCbCr/YUV formats are supported as
an input to the module.

Required properties:

 - compatible: must be "renesas,fdp1"
 - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
 - interrupts : interrupt specifier for the FDP1 instance
 - clocks: reference to the functional clock

Optional properties:

 - power-domains: reference to the power domain that the FDP1 belongs to, if
                  any.
 - renesas,fcp: a phandle referencing the FCP that handles memory accesses
                for the FDP1. Not needed on Gen2, mandatory on Gen3.

Please refer to the binding documentation for the clock and/or power domain
providers for more details.


Device node example
