ARM sp804 Dual Timers
---------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,sp804" & "arm,primecell"
- interrupts: Should contain the list of Dual Timer interrupts. This is the
	interrupt for timer 1 and timer 2. In the case of a single entry, it is
	the combined interrupt or if "arm,sp804-has-irq" is present that
	specifies which timer interrupt is connected.
- reg: Should contain location and length for dual timer register.
- clocks: clocks driving the dual timer hardware. This list should be 1 or 3
	clocks.	With 3 clocks, the order is timer0 clock, timer1 clock,
	apb_pclk. A single clock can also be specified if the same clock is
	used for all clock inputs.

Optional properties:
- arm,sp804-has-irq = <#>: In the case of only 1 timer irq line connected, this
	specifies if the irq connection is for timer 1 or timer 2. A value of 1
	or 2 should be used.

Example:

	timer0: timer@fc800000 {
		compatible = "arm,sp804", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0xfc800000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 0 4>, <0 1 4>;
		clocks = <&timclk1 &timclk2 &pclk>;
		clock-names = "timer1", "timer2", "apb_pclk";
	};
