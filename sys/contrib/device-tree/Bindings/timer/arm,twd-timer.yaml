title: ARM Timer-Watchdog Timer

maintainers:
  - Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

description:
  ARM 11MP, Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A9 are often associated with a per-core
  Timer-Watchdog (aka TWD), which provides both a per-cpu local timer
  and watchdog.

  The TWD is usually attached to a GIC to deliver its two per-processor
  interrupts.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - arm,cortex-a9-twd-timer
      - arm,cortex-a5-twd-timer
      - arm,arm11mp-twd-timer

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    maxItems: 1

  always-on:
    description:
      If present, the timer is powered through an always-on power domain,
      therefore it never loses context.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - interrupts
