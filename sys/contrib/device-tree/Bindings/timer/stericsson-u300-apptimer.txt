Required properties:

- compatible : should be "stericsson,u300-apptimer"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : A list of 4 interrupts; one for each subtimer. These
  are, in order: OS (operating system), DD (device driver) both

timer {
	compatible = "stericsson,u300-apptimer";
	reg = <0xc0014000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <24 25 26 27>;
