Rockchip SuperSpeed DWC3 USB SoC controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	should contain "rockchip,rk3399-dwc3" for rk3399 SoC
- clocks:	A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
		clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  "ref_clk"	Controller reference clk, have to be 24 MHz
  "suspend_clk"	Controller suspend clk, have to be 24 MHz or 32 KHz
  "bus_clk"	Master/Core clock, have to be >= 62.5 MHz for SS
		operation and >= 30MHz for HS operation
  "grf_clk"	Controller grf clk

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Phy documentation is provided in the following places:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.yaml - USB2.0 PHY
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-rockchip-typec.txt     - Type-C PHY
