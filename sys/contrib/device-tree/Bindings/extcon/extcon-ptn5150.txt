* PTN5150 CC (Configuration Channel) Logic device

PTN5150 is a small thin low power CC logic chip supporting the USB Type-C
connector application with CC control logic detection and indication functions.
It is interfaced to the host controller using an I2C interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nxp,ptn5150"
- reg: specifies the I2C slave address of the device
- int-gpio: should contain a phandle and GPIO specifier for the GPIO pin
	connected to the PTN5150's INTB pin.
- vbus-gpio: should contain a phandle and GPIO specifier for the GPIO pin which
	is used to control VBUS.
- pinctrl-names : a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0 : phandle referencing pin configuration of interrupt and vbus
	control.

Example:
	ptn5150@1d {
		compatible = "nxp,ptn5150";
		reg = <0x1d>;
		int-gpio = <&msmgpio 78 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		vbus-gpio = <&msmgpio 148 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&ptn5150_default>;
		status = "okay";
	};
