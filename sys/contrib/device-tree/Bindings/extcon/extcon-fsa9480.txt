FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR FSA9480 MICROUSB SWITCH

The FSA9480 is a USB port accessory detector and switch. The FSA9480 is fully
controlled using I2C and enables USB data, stereo and mono audio, video,
microphone, and UART data to use a common connector port.

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be one of
   "fcs,fsa9480"
   "fcs,fsa880"
 - reg : Specifies i2c slave address. Must be 0x25.
 - interrupts : Should contain one entry specifying interrupt signal of
   interrupt parent to which interrupt pin of the chip is connected.

 Example:
	musb@25 {
		compatible = "fcs,fsa9480";
		reg = <0x25>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gph2>;
		interrupts = <7 0>;
	};
