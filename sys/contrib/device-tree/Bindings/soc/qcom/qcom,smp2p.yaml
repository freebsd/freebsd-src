description:
  The Shared Memory Point to Point (SMP2P) protocol facilitates communication
  of a single 32-bit value between two processors.  Each value has a single
  writer (the local side) and a single reader (the remote side).  Values are
  uniquely identified in the system by the directed edge (local processor ID to
  remote processor ID) and a string identifier.
