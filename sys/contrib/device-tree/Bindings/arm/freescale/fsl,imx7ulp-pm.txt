Freescale i.MX7ULP Power Management Components
----------------------------------------------

The Multi-System Mode Controller (MSMC) is responsible for sequencing
the MCU into and out of all stop and run power modes. Specifically, it
monitors events to trigger transitions between power modes while
controlling the power, clocks, and memories of the MCU to achieve the
power consumption and functionality of that mode.

The WFI or WFE instruction is used to invoke a Sleep, Deep Sleep or
Standby modes for either Cortex family. Run, Wait, and Stop are the
common terms used for the primary operating modes of Kinetis
microcontrollers.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "fsl,imx7ulp-smc1".
- reg:		Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets.

Example:
smc1: smc1@40410000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx7ulp-smc1";
	reg = <0x40410000 0x1000>;
};
