Freescale i.MX7ULP System Integration Module
----------------------------------------------
The system integration module (SIM) provides system control and chip configuration
registers. In this module, chip revision information is located in JTAG ID register,
and a set of registers have been made available in DGO domain for SW use, with the
objective to maintain its value between system resets.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "fsl,imx7ulp-sim".
- reg:		Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets.

Example:
sim: sim@410a3000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx7ulp-sim", "syscon";
	reg = <0x410a3000 0x1000>;
};
