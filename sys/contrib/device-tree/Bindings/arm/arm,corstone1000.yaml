description: |+
  ARM's Corstone1000 includes pre-verified Corstone SSE-710 subsystem that
  provides a flexible compute architecture that combines Cortex‑A and Cortex‑M
  processors.

  Support for Cortex‑A32, Cortex‑A35 and Cortex‑A53 processors. Two expansion
  systems for M-Class (or other) processors for adding sensors, connectivity,
  video, audio and machine learning at the edge System and security IPs to build
  a secure SoC for a range of rich IoT applications, for example gateways, smart
  cameras and embedded systems.

  Integrated Secure Enclave providing hardware Root of Trust and supporting
  seamless integration of the optional CryptoCell™-312 cryptographic
  accelerator.
