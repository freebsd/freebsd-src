Texas Instruments K3 Multicore SoC architecture device tree bindings
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Platforms based on Texas Instruments K3 Multicore SoC architecture
shall follow the following scheme:

SoCs
----

Each device tree root node must specify which exact SoC in K3 Multicore SoC
architecture it uses, using one of the following compatible values:

- AM654
  compatible = "ti,am654";

- J721E
  compatible = "ti,j721e";

Boards
------

In addition, each device tree root node must specify which one or more
of the following board-specific compatible values:

- AM654 EVM
  compatible = "ti,am654-evm", "ti,am654";
