description: |
  CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
  specification and can be connected in various topologies to suit a particular
  SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as
  sinks, links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows
  through the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected
  sink.

  The CoreSight Trace Port Interface Unit captures trace data from the trace bus
  and outputs it to an external trace port.
