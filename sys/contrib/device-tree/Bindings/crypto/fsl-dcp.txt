- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-dcp"
- reg : Should contain MXS DCP registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain MXS DCP interrupt numbers, VMI IRQ and DCP IRQ
               must be supplied, optionally Secure IRQ can be present, but

- clock-names : Must be "dcp".

Example:

dcp: crypto@80028000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-dcp", "fsl,imx23-dcp";
	reg = <0x80028000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <52 53>;
};
