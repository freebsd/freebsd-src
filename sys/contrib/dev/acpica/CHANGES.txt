----------------------------------------
21 October 2005. Summary of changes for version 20051021:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for the EM64T and other x86-64 processors.
This essentially entails recognizing that these processors
support non-aligned memory transfers. Previously, all 64-bit
processors were assumed to lack hardware support for non-aligned
transfers.

Completed conversion of the Resource Manager to nearly full table-
driven operation. Specifically, the resource conversion code
(convert AML to internal format and the reverse) and the debug
code to dump internal resource descriptors are fully table-
driven, reducing code and data size and improving
maintainability.

The OSL interfaces for Acquire and Release Lock now use a 64-bit
flag word on 64-bit processors instead of a fixed 32-bit word.
(With assistance from Alexey Starikovskiy)

Implemented support within the resource conversion code for the
Type-Specific byte within the various ACPI 3.0 *WordSpace macros.

Fixed some issues within the resource conversion code for the
type-specific flags for both Memory and I/O address resource
descriptors. For Memory, implemented support for the MTP and TTP
flags. For I/O, split the TRS and TTP flags into two separate
fields.

Code and Data Size: The current and previous library sizes for
the core subsystem are shown below. These are the code and data
sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
32-bit compiler. These values do not include any ACPI driver or
OSPM code. The debug version of the code includes the debug
output trace mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.
Note that these values will vary depending on the efficiency of
the compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.1K Code, 12.1K Data,  89.2K Total
    Debug Version:     168.0K Code, 68.3K Data, 236.3K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  76.1K Code, 12.2K Data,  88.3K Total
    Debug Version:     163.5K Code, 67.0K Data, 230.5K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Relaxed a compiler restriction that disallowed a ResourceIndex
byte if the corresponding ResourceSource string was not also
present in a resource descriptor declaration. This restriction
caused problems with existing AML/ASL code that includes the
Index byte without the string. When such AML was disassembled, it
could not be compiled without modification. Further, the modified
code created a resource template with a different size than the
original, breaking code that used fixed offsets into the resource
template buffer.

Removed a recent feature of the disassembler to ignore a lone
ResourceIndex byte. This byte is now emitted if present so that
the exact AML can be reproduced when the disassembled code is
recompiled.

Improved comments and text alignment for the resource descriptor
code emitted by the disassembler.

Implemented disassembler support for the ACPI 3.0 AccessSize
field within a Register() resource descriptor.

----------------------------------------
30 September 2005. Summary of changes for version 20050930:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Completed a major overhaul of the Resource Manager code -
specifically, optimizations in the area of the AML/internal
resource conversion code. The code has been optimized to simplify
and eliminate duplicated code, CPU stack use has been decreased
by optimizing function parameters and local variables, and naming
conventions across the manager have been standardized for clarity
and ease of maintenance (this includes function, parameter,
variable, and struct/typedef names.) The update may force changes
in some driver code, depending on how resources are handled by
the host OS.

All Resource Manager dispatch and information tables have been
moved to a single location for clarity and ease of maintenance.
One new file was created, named "rsinfo.c".

The ACPI return macros (return_ACPI_STATUS, etc.) have been
modified to guarantee that the argument is not evaluated twice,
making them less prone to macro side-effects. However, since
there exists the possibility of additional stack use if a
particular compiler cannot optimize them (such as in the debug
generation case), the original macros are optionally available.
Note that some invocations of the return_VALUE macro may now
cause size mismatch warnings; the return_UINT8 and return_UINT32
macros are provided to eliminate these. (From Randy Dunlap)

Implemented a new mechanism to enable debug tracing for
individual control methods. A new external interface,
AcpiDebugTrace, is provided to enable this mechanism. The intent
is to allow the host OS to easily enable and disable tracing for
problematic control methods. This interface can be easily exposed
to a user or debugger interface if desired. See the file
psxface.c for details.

AcpiUtCallocate will now return a valid pointer if a length of
zero is specified - a length of one is used and a warning is
issued. This matches the behavior of AcpiUtAllocate.

Code and Data Size: The current and previous library sizes for
the core subsystem are shown below. These are the code and data
sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
32-bit compiler. These values do not include any ACPI driver or
OSPM code. The debug version of the code includes the debug
output trace mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.
Note that these values will vary depending on the efficiency of
the compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.5K Code, 12.0K Data,  89.5K Total
    Debug Version:     168.1K Code, 68.4K Data, 236.5K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.1K Code, 12.1K Data,  89.2K Total
    Debug Version:     168.0K Code, 68.3K Data, 236.3K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

A remark is issued if the effective compile-time length of a
package or buffer is zero. Previously, this was a warning.

----------------------------------------
16 September 2005. Summary of changes for version 20050916:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem within the Resource Manager where support for the
Generic Register descriptor was not fully implemented. This
descriptor is now fully recognized, parsed, disassembled, and
displayed.

Completely restructured the Resource Manager code to utilize
table-driven dispatch and lookup, eliminating many of the large
switch() statements. This reduces overall subsystem code size and
code complexity. Affects the resource parsing and construction,
disassembly, and debug dump output.

Cleaned up and restructured the debug dump output for all
resource descriptors. Improved readability of the output and
reduced code size.

Fixed a problem where changes to internal data structures caused
the optional ACPI_MUTEX_DEBUG code to fail compilation if
specified.

Code and Data Size: The current and previous library sizes for
the core subsystem are shown below. These are the code and data
sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
32-bit compiler. These values do not include any ACPI driver or
OSPM code. The debug version of the code includes the debug
output trace mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.
Note that these values will vary depending on the efficiency of
the compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.4K Code, 11.8K Data,  90.2K Total
    Debug Version:     169.6K Code, 69.9K Data, 239.5K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.5K Code, 12.0K Data,  89.5K Total
    Debug Version:     168.1K Code, 68.4K Data, 236.5K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Updated the disassembler to automatically insert an
EndDependentFn() macro into the ASL stream if this macro is
missing in the original AML code, simplifying compilation of the
resulting ASL module.

Fixed a problem in the disassembler where a disassembled
ResourceSource string (within a large resource descriptor) was
not surrounded by quotes and not followed by a comma, causing
errors when the resulting ASL module was compiled. Also, escape
sequences within a ResourceSource string are now handled
correctly (especially "\\")

----------------------------------------
02 September 2005. Summary of changes for version 20050902:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem with the internal Owner ID allocation and
deallocation mechanisms for control method execution and
recursive method invocation. This should eliminate the
OWNER_ID_LIMIT exceptions and "Invalid OwnerId" messages seen on
some systems. Recursive method invocation depth is currently
limited to 255. (Alexey Starikovskiy)

Completely eliminated all vestiges of support for the "module-
level executable code" until this support is fully implemented
and debugged. This should eliminate the NO_RETURN_VALUE
exceptions seen during table load on some systems that invoke
this support.

Fixed a problem within the resource manager code where the
transaction flags for a 64-bit address descriptor were handled
incorrectly in the type-specific flag byte.

Consolidated duplicate code within the address descriptor
resource manager code, reducing overall subsystem code size.

Fixed a fault when using the AML debugger "disassemble" command
to disassemble individual control methods.

Removed references to the "release_current" directory within the
Unix release package.

Code and Data Size: The current and previous core subsystem
library sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes
for the acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
compiler. These values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM
code. The debug version of the code includes the debug output
trace mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note
that these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.7K Data,  90.3K Total
    Debug Version:     170.0K Code, 69.9K Data, 239.9K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.4K Code, 11.8K Data,  90.2K Total
    Debug Version:     169.6K Code, 69.9K Data, 239.5K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented an error check for illegal duplicate values in the
interrupt and dma lists for the following ASL macros: Dma(),
Irq(), IrqNoFlags(), and Interrupt().

Implemented error checking for the Irq() and IrqNoFlags() macros
to detect too many values in the interrupt list (16 max) and
invalid values in the list (range 0 - 15)

The maximum length string literal within an ASL file is now
restricted to 200 characters as per the ACPI specification.

Fixed a fault when using the -ln option (generate namespace
listing).

Implemented an error check to determine if a DescriptorName
within a resource descriptor has already been used within the
current scope.

----------------------------------------
15 August 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050815:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented a full bytewise compare to determine if a table load
request is attempting to load a duplicate table. The compare is
performed if the table signatures and table lengths match. This
will allow different tables with the same OEM Table ID and
revision to be loaded - probably against the ACPI specification,
but discovered in the field nonetheless.

Added the changes.txt logfile to each of the zipped release
packages.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.7K Data,  90.3K Total
    Debug Version:     167.0K Code, 69.9K Data, 236.9K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.7K Data,  90.3K Total
    Debug Version:     170.0K Code, 69.9K Data, 239.9K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem where incorrect AML code could be generated for
Package objects if optimization is disabled (via the -oa switch).

Fixed a problem with where incorrect AML code is generated for
variable-length packages when the package length is not specified
and the number of initializer values is greater than 255.

----------------------------------------
29 July 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050729:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support to ignore an attempt to install/load a
particular ACPI table more than once. Apparently there exists
BIOS code that repeatedly attempts to load the same SSDT upon
certain events. With assistance from Venkatesh Pallipadi.

Restructured the main interface to the AML parser in order to
correctly handle all exceptional conditions. This will prevent
leakage of the OwnerId resource and should eliminate the
AE_OWNER_ID_LIMIT exceptions seen on some machines. With
assistance from Alexey Starikovskiy.

Support for "module level code" has been disabled in this version
due to a number of issues that have appeared on various machines.
The support can be enabled by defining
ACPI_ENABLE_MODULE_LEVEL_CODE during subsystem compilation. When
the issues are fully resolved, the code will be enabled by
default again.

Modified the internal functions for debug print support to define
the FunctionName parameter as a (const char *) for compatibility
with compiler built-in macros such as __FUNCTION__, etc.

Linted the entire ACPICA source tree for both 32-bit and 64-bit.

Implemented support to display an object count summary for the
AML Debugger commands Object and Methods.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.6K Data,  90.2K Total
    Debug Version:     170.0K Code, 69.7K Data, 239.7K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.7K Data,  90.3K Total
    Debug Version:     167.0K Code, 69.9K Data, 236.9K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a regression that appeared in the 20050708 version of the
compiler where an error message was inadvertently emitted for
invocations of the _OSI reserved control method.

----------------------------------------
08 July 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050708:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The use of the CPU stack in the debug version of the subsystem
has been considerably reduced. Previously, a debug structure was
declared in every function that used the debug macros. This
structure has been removed in favor of declaring the individual
elements as parameters to the debug functions. This reduces the
cumulative stack use during nested execution of ACPI function
calls at the cost of a small increase in the code size of the
debug version of the subsystem. With assistance from Alexey
Starikovskiy and Len Brown.

Added the ACPI_GET_FUNCTION_NAME macro to enable the compiler-
dependent headers to define a macro that will return the current
function name at runtime (such as __FUNCTION__ or _func_, etc.)
The function name is used by the debug trace output. If
ACPI_GET_FUNCTION_NAME is not defined in the compiler-dependent
header, the function name is saved on the CPU stack (one pointer
per function.) This mechanism is used because apparently there
exists no standard ANSI-C defined macro that that returns the
function name.

Redesigned and reimplemented the "Owner ID" mechanism used to
track namespace objects created/deleted by ACPI tables and
control method execution. A bitmap is now used to allocate and
free the IDs, thus solving the wraparound problem present in the
previous implementation. The size of the namespace node
descriptor was reduced by 2 bytes as a result (Alexey
Starikovskiy).

Removed the UINT32_BIT and UINT16_BIT types that were used for
the bitfield flag definitions within the headers for the
predefined ACPI tables. These have been replaced by UINT8_BIT in
order to increase the code portability of the subsystem. If the
use of UINT8 remains a problem, we may be forced to eliminate
bitfields entirely because of a lack of portability.

Enhanced the performance of the AcpiUtUpdateObjectReference
procedure. This is a frequently used function and this
improvement increases the performance of the entire subsystem
(Alexey Starikovskiy).

Fixed several possible memory leaks and the inverse - premature
object deletion (Alexey Starikovskiy).

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.5K Data,  90.1K Total
    Debug Version:     165.2K Code, 69.6K Data, 234.8K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.6K Data,  90.2K Total
    Debug Version:     170.0K Code, 69.7K Data, 239.7K Total

----------------------------------------
24 June 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050624:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Modified the new OSL cache interfaces to use ACPI_CACHE_T as the
type for the host-defined cache object. This allows the OSL
implementation to define and type this object in any manner
desired, simplifying the OSL implementation. For example,
ACPI_CACHE_T is defined as kmem_cache_t for Linux, and should be
defined in the OS-specific header file for other operating
systems as required.

Changed the interface to AcpiOsAcquireObject to directly return
the requested object as the function return (instead of
ACPI_STATUS.) This change was made for performance reasons, since
this is the purpose of the interface in the first place.
AcpiOsAcquireObject is now similar to the AcpiOsAllocate
interface.

Implemented a new AML debugger command named Businfo. This
command displays information about all devices that have an
associate _PRT object. The _ADR, _HID, _UID, and _CID are
displayed for these devices.

Modified the initialization sequence in AcpiInitializeSubsystem
to call the OSL interface AcpiOslInitialize first, before any
local initialization. This change was required because the global
initialization now calls OSL interfaces.

Enhanced the Dump command to display the entire contents of
Package objects (including all sub-objects and their values.)

Restructured the code base to split some files because of size
and/or because the code logically belonged in a separate file.
New files are listed below. All makefiles and project files
included in the ACPI CA release have been updated.
    utilities/utcache.c           /* Local cache interfaces */
    utilities/utmutex.c           /* Local mutex support */
    utilities/utstate.c           /* State object support */
    interpreter/parser/psloop.c   /* Main AML parse loop */

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.9K Total
    Debug Version:     164.0K Code, 69.1K Data, 233.1K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.6K Code, 11.5K Data,  90.1K Total
    Debug Version:     165.2K Code, 69.6K Data, 234.8K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a regression introduced in version 20050513 where the use
of a Package object within a Case() statement caused a compile
time exception. The original behavior has been restored (a
Match() operator is emitted.)

----------------------------------------
17 June 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050617:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Moved the object cache operations into the OS interface layer
(OSL) to allow the host OS to handle these operations if desired
(for example, the Linux OSL will invoke the slab allocator). This
support is optional; the compile time define ACPI_USE_LOCAL_CACHE
may be used to utilize the original cache code in the ACPI CA
core. The new OSL interfaces are shown below. See utalloc.c for
an example implementation, and acpiosxf.h for the exact interface
definitions. With assistance from Alexey Starikovskiy.
    AcpiOsCreateCache
    AcpiOsDeleteCache
    AcpiOsPurgeCache
    AcpiOsAcquireObject
    AcpiOsReleaseObject

Modified the interfaces to AcpiOsAcquireLock and
AcpiOsReleaseLock to return and restore a flags parameter. This
fits better with many OS lock models. Note: the current execution
state (interrupt handler or not) is no longer passed to these
interfaces. If necessary, the OSL must determine this state by
itself, a simple and fast operation. With assistance from Alexey
Starikovskiy.

Fixed a problem in the ACPI table handling where a valid XSDT was
assumed present if the revision of the RSDP was 2 or greater.
According to the ACPI specification, the XSDT is optional in all
cases, and the table manager therefore now checks for both an
RSDP >=2 and a valid XSDT pointer. Otherwise, the RSDT pointer is
used. Some ACPI 2.0 compliant BIOSs contain only the RSDT.

Fixed an interpreter problem with the Mid() operator in the case
of an input string where the resulting output string is of zero
length. It now correctly returns a valid, null terminated string
object instead of a string object with a null pointer.

Fixed a problem with the control method argument handling to
allow a store to an Arg object that already contains an object of
type Device. The Device object is now correctly overwritten.
Previously, an error was returned.

Enhanced the debugger Find command to emit object values in
addition to the found object pathnames. The output format is the
same as the dump namespace command.

Enhanced the debugger Set command. It now has the ability to set
the value of any Named integer object in the namespace
(Previously, only method locals and args could be set.)

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.1K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.7K Total
    Debug Version:     164.0K Code, 69.3K Data, 233.3K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.9K Total
    Debug Version:     164.0K Code, 69.1K Data, 233.1K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a regression in the disassembler where if/else/while
constructs were output incorrectly. This problem was introduced
in the previous release (20050526). This problem also affected
the single-step disassembly in the debugger.

Fixed a problem where compiling the reserved _OSI method would
randomly (but rarely) produce compile errors.

Enhanced the disassembler to emit compilable code in the face of
incorrect AML resource descriptors. If the optional
ResourceSourceIndex is present, but the ResourceSource is not, do
not emit the ResourceSourceIndex in the disassembly. Otherwise,
the resulting code cannot be compiled without errors.

----------------------------------------
26 May 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050526:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support to execute Type 1 and Type 2 AML opcodes
appearing at the module level (not within a control method.)
These opcodes are executed exactly once at the time the table is
loaded. This type of code was legal up until the release of ACPI
2.0B (2002) and is now supported within ACPI CA in order to
provide backwards compatibility with earlier BIOS
implementations. This eliminates the "Encountered executable code
at module level" warning that was previously generated upon
detection of such code.

Fixed a problem in the interpreter where an AE_NOT_FOUND
exception could inadvertently be generated during the lookup of
namespace objects in the second pass parse of ACPI tables and
control methods. It appears that this problem could occur during
the resolution of forward references to namespace objects.

Added the ACPI_MUTEX_DEBUG #ifdef to the AcpiUtReleaseMutex
function, corresponding to the same #ifdef in the
AcpiUtAcquireMutex function. This allows the deadlock detection
debug code to be compiled out in the normal case, improving mutex
performance (and overall subsystem performance) considerably.

Implemented a handful of miscellaneous fixes for possible memory
leaks on error conditions and error handling control paths. These
fixes were suggested by FreeBSD and the Coverity Prevent source
code analysis tool.

Added a check for a null RSDT pointer in AcpiGetFirmwareTable
(tbxfroot.c) to prevent a fault in this error case.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.2K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     163.7K Code, 69.3K Data, 233.0K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.1K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.7K Total
    Debug Version:     164.0K Code, 69.3K Data, 233.3K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented support to allow Type 1 and Type 2 ASL operators to
appear at the module level (not within a control method.) These
operators will be executed once at the time the table is loaded.
This type of code was legal up until the release of ACPI 2.0B
(2002) and is now supported by the iASL compiler in order to
provide backwards compatibility with earlier BIOS ASL code.

The ACPI integer width (specified via the table revision ID or
the -r override, 32 or 64 bits) is now used internally during
compile-time constant folding to ensure that constants are
truncated to 32 bits if necessary. Previously, the revision ID
value was only emitted in the AML table header.

An error message is now generated for the Mutex and Method
operators if the SyncLevel parameter is outside the legal range
of 0 through 15.

Fixed a problem with the Method operator ParameterTypes list
handling (ACPI 3.0). Previously, more than 2 types or 2 arguments
generated a syntax error.  The actual underlying implementation
of method argument typechecking is still under development,
however.

----------------------------------------
13 May 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050513:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for PCI Express root bridges -- added support
for device PNP0A08 in the root bridge search within
AcpiEvPciConfigRegionSetup.

The interpreter now automatically truncates incoming 64-bit
constants to 32 bits if currently executing out of a 32-bit ACPI
table (Revision < 2). This also affects the iASL compiler
constant folding. (Note: as per below, the iASL compiler no
longer allows 64-bit constants within 32-bit tables.)

Fixed a problem where string and buffer objects with "static"
pointers (pointers to initialization data within an ACPI table)
were not handled consistently. The internal object copy operation
now always copies the data to a newly allocated buffer,
regardless of whether the source object is static or not.

Fixed a problem with the FromBCD operator where an implicit
result conversion was improperly performed while storing the
result to the target operand. Since this is an "explicit
conversion" operator, the implicit conversion should never be
performed on the output.

Fixed a problem with the CopyObject operator where a copy to an
existing named object did not always completely overwrite the
existing object stored at name. Specifically, a buffer-to-buffer
copy did not delete the existing buffer.

Replaced "InterruptLevel" with "InterruptNumber" in all GPE
interfaces and structs for consistency.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

The compiler now emits a warning if an attempt is made to
generate a 64-bit integer constant from within a 32-bit ACPI
table (Revision < 2). The integer is truncated to 32 bits.

Fixed a problem with large package objects: if the static length
of the package is greater than 255, the "variable length package"
opcode is emitted. Previously, this caused an error. This
requires an update to the ACPI spec, since it currently
(incorrectly) states that packages larger than 255 elements are
not allowed.

The disassembler now correctly handles variable length packages
and packages larger than 255 elements.

----------------------------------------
08 April 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050408:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed three cases in the interpreter where an "index" argument to
an ASL function was still (internally) 32 bits instead of the
required 64 bits. This was the Index argument to the Index, Mid,
and Match operators.

The "strupr" function is now permanently local (AcpiUtStrupr),
since this is not a POSIX-defined function and not present in
most kernel-level C libraries. All references to the C library
strupr function have been removed from the headers.

Completed the deployment of static functions/prototypes. All
prototypes with the static attribute have been moved from the
headers to the owning C file.

Implemented an extract option (-e) for the AcpiBin utility (AML
binary utility). This option allows the utility to extract
individual ACPI tables from the output of AcpiDmp. It provides
the same functionality of the acpixtract.pl perl script without
the worry of setting the correct perl options. AcpiBin runs on
Windows and has not yet been generated/validated in the
Linux/Unix environment (but should be soon).

Updated and fixed the table dump option for AcpiBin (-d). This
option converts a single ACPI table to a hex/ascii file, similar
to the output of AcpiDmp.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     163.7K Code, 69.3K Data, 233.0K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Disassembler fix: Added a check to ensure that the table length
found in the ACPI table header within the input file is not
longer than the actual input file size. This indicates some kind
of file or table corruption.

----------------------------------------
29 March 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050329:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

An error is now generated if an attempt is made to create a
Buffer Field of length zero (A CreateField with a length operand
of zero.)

The interpreter now issues a warning whenever executable code at
the module level is detected during ACPI table load. This will
give some idea of the prevalence of this type of code.

Implemented support for references to named objects (other than
control methods) within package objects.

Enhanced package object output for the debug object. Package
objects are now completely dumped, showing all elements.

Enhanced miscellaneous object output for the debug object. Any
object can now be written to the debug object (for example, a
device object can be written, and the type of the object will be
displayed.)

The "static" qualifier has been added to all local functions
across both the core subsystem and the iASL compiler.

The number of "long" lines (> 80 chars) within the source has
been significantly reduced, by about 1/3.

Cleaned up all header files to ensure that all CA/iASL functions
are prototyped (even static functions) and the formatting is
consistent.

Two new header files have been added, acopcode.h and acnames.h.

Removed several obsolete functions that were no longer used.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     165.4K Code, 69.7K Data, 236.1K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.0K Code, 11.6K Data,  89.6K Total
    Debug Version:     163.5K Code, 69.3K Data, 232.8K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem with the resource descriptor generation/support.
For the ResourceSourceIndex and the ResourceSource fields, both
must be present, or both must be not present - can't have one
without the other.

The compiler now returns non-zero from the main procedure if any
errors have occurred during the compilation.


----------------------------------------
09 March 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050309:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The string-to-buffer implicit conversion code has been modified
again after a change to the ACPI specification.  In order to
match the behavior of the other major ACPI implementation, the
target buffer is no longer truncated if the source string is
smaller than an existing target buffer. This change requires an
update to the ACPI spec, and should eliminate the recent
AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT issues.

The "implicit return" support was rewritten to a new algorithm
that solves the general case. Rather than attempt to determine
when a method is about to exit, the result of every ASL operator
is saved momentarily until the very next ASL operator is
executed. Therefore, no matter how the method exits, there will
always be a saved implicit return value. This feature is only
enabled with the AcpiGbl_EnableInterpreterSlack flag, and should
eliminate AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE errors when enabled.

Implemented implicit conversion support for the predicate
(operand) of the If, Else, and While operators. String and Buffer
arguments are automatically converted to Integers.

Changed the string-to-integer conversion behavior to match the
new ACPI errata: "If no integer object exists, a new integer is
created. The ASCII string is interpreted as a hexadecimal
constant. Each string character is interpreted as a hexadecimal
value (`0'-`9', `A'-`F', `a', `f'), starting with the first
character as the most significant digit, and ending with the
first non-hexadecimal character or end-of-string." This means
that the first non-hex character terminates the conversion and
this is the code that was changed.

Fixed a problem where the ObjectType operator would fail (fault)
when used on an Index of a Package which pointed to a null
package element. The operator now properly returns zero
(Uninitialized) in this case.

Fixed a problem where the While operator used excessive memory by
not properly popping the result stack during execution. There was
no memory leak after execution, however. (Code provided by Valery
Podrezov.)

Fixed a problem where references to control methods within
Package objects caused the method to be invoked, instead of
producing a reference object pointing to the method.

Restructured and simplified the pswalk.c module
(AcpiPsDeleteParseTree) to improve performance and reduce code
size. (Code provided by Alexey Starikovskiy.)

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     165.4K Code, 69.6K Data, 236.0K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     165.4K Code, 69.7K Data, 236.1K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem with the Return operator with no arguments. Since
the AML grammar for the byte encoding requires an operand for the
Return opcode, the compiler now emits a Return(Zero) for this
case.  An ACPI specification update has been written for this
case.

For tables other than the DSDT, namepath optimization is
automatically disabled. This is because SSDTs can be loaded
anywhere in the namespace, the compiler has no knowledge of
where, and thus cannot optimize namepaths.

Added "ProcessorObj" to the ObjectTypeKeyword list. This object
type was inadvertently omitted from the ACPI specification, and
will require an update to the spec.

The source file scan for ASCII characters is now optional (-a).
This change was made because some vendors place non-ascii
characters within comments. However, the scan is simply a brute-
force byte compare to ensure all characters in the file are in
the range 0x00 to 0x7F.

Fixed a problem with the CondRefOf operator where the compiler
was inappropriately checking for the existence of the target.
Since the point of the operator is to check for the existence of
the target at run-time, the compiler no longer checks for the
target existence.

Fixed a problem where errors generated from the internal AML
interpreter during constant folding were not handled properly,
causing a fault.

Fixed a problem with overly aggressive range checking for the
Stall operator. The valid range (max 255) is now only checked if
the operand is of type Integer. All other operand types cannot be
statically checked.

Fixed a problem where control method references within the RefOf,
DeRefOf, and ObjectType operators were not treated properly. They
are now treated as actual references, not method invocations.

Fixed and enhanced the "list namespace" option (-ln). This option
was broken a number of releases ago.

Improved error handling for the Field, IndexField, and BankField
operators. The compiler now cleanly reports and recovers from
errors in the field component (FieldUnit) list.

Fixed a disassembler problem where the optional
ResourceDescriptor fields TRS and TTP were not always handled
correctly.

Disassembler - Comments in output now use "//" instead of "/*"

----------------------------------------
28 February 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050228:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where the result of an Index() operator (an
object reference) must increment the reference count on the
target object for the life of the object reference.

Implemented AML Interpreter and Debugger support for the new ACPI
3.0 Extended Address (IO, Memory, Space), QwordSpace, DwordSpace,
and WordSpace resource descriptors.

Implemented support in the _OSI method for the ACPI 3.0 "Extended
Address Space Descriptor" string, indicating interpreter support
for the descriptors above.

Implemented header support for the new ACPI 3.0 FADT flag bits.

Implemented header support for the new ACPI 3.0 PCI Express bits
for the PM1 status/enable registers.

Updated header support for the MADT processor local Apic struct
and MADT platform interrupt source struct for new ACPI 3.0
fields.

Implemented header support for the SRAT and SLIT ACPI tables.

Implemented the -s switch in AcpiExec to enable the
"InterpeterSlack" flag at runtime.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.2K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.7K Total
    Debug Version:     164.9K Code, 69.2K Data, 234.1K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     165.4K Code, 69.6K Data, 236.0K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem with the internal 64-bit String-to-integer
conversion with strings less than two characters long.

Fixed a problem with constant folding where the result of the
Index() operator can not be considered a constant. This means
that Index() cannot be a type3 opcode and this will require an
update to the ACPI specification.

Disassembler: Implemented support for the TTP, MTP, and TRS
resource descriptor fields. These fields were inadvertently
ignored and not output in the disassembly of the resource
descriptor.


 ----------------------------------------
11 February 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050211:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented ACPI 3.0 support for implicit conversion within the
Match() operator. MatchObjects can now be of type integer,
buffer, or string instead of just type integer.  Package elements
are implicitly converted to the type of the MatchObject. This
change aligns the behavior of Match() with the behavior of the
other logical operators (LLess(), etc.) It also requires an
errata change to the ACPI specification as this support was
intended for ACPI 3.0, but was inadvertently omitted.

Fixed a problem with the internal implicit "to buffer"
conversion. Strings that are converted to buffers will cause
buffer truncation if the string is smaller than the target
buffer. Integers that are converted to buffers will not cause
buffer truncation, only zero extension (both as per the ACPI
spec.) The problem was introduced when code was added to truncate
the buffer, but this should not be performed in all cases, only
the string case.

Fixed a problem with the Buffer and Package operators where the
interpreter would get confused if two such operators were used as
operands to an ASL operator (such as
LLess(Buffer(1){0},Buffer(1){1}). The internal result stack was
not being popped after the execution of these operators,
resulting in an AE_NO_RETURN_VALUE exception.

Fixed a problem with constructs of the form
Store(Index(...),...). The reference object returned from Index
was inadvertently resolved to an actual value. This problem was
introduced in version 20050114 when the behavior of Store() was
modified to restrict the object types that can be used as the
source operand (to match the ACPI specification.)

Reduced excessive stack use within the AcpiGetObjectInfo
procedure.

Added a fix to aclinux.h to allow generation of AcpiExec on
Linux.

Updated the AcpiSrc utility to add the FADT_DESCRIPTOR_REV2_MINUS
struct.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Non-Debug Version:  78.1K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.6K Total
    Debug Version:     164.8K Code, 69.2K Data, 234.0K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.2K Code, 11.5K Data,  89.7K Total
    Debug Version:     164.9K Code, 69.2K Data, 234.1K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a code generation problem in the constant folding
optimization code where incorrect code was generated if a
constant was reduced to a buffer object (i.e., a reduced type 5
opcode.)

Fixed a typechecking problem for the ToBuffer operator. Caused by
an incorrect return type in the internal opcode information
table.

----------------------------------------
25 January 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050125:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a recently introduced problem with the Global Lock where
the underlying semaphore was not created.  This problem was
introduced in version 20050114, and caused an AE_AML_NO_OPERAND
exception during an Acquire() operation on _GL.

The local object cache is now optional, and is disabled by
default. Both AcpiExec and the iASL compiler enable the cache
because they run in user mode and this enhances their
performance. #define ACPI_ENABLE_OBJECT_CACHE to enable the local
cache.

Fixed an issue in the internal function AcpiUtEvaluateObject
concerning the optional "implicit return" support where an error
was returned if no return object was expected, but one was
implicitly returned. AE_OK is now returned in this case and the
implicitly returned object is deleted. AcpiUtEvaluateObject is
only occasionally used, and only to execute reserved methods such
as _STA and _INI where the return type is known up front.

Fixed a few issues with the internal convert-to-integer code. It
now returns an error if an attempt is made to convert a null
string, a string of only blanks/tabs, or a zero-length buffer.
This affects both implicit conversion and explicit conversion via
the ToInteger() operator.

The internal debug code in AcpiUtAcquireMutex has been commented
out. It is not needed for normal operation and should increase
the performance of the entire subsystem. The code remains in case
it is needed for debug purposes again.

The AcpiExec source and makefile are included in the Unix/Linux
package for the first time.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.4K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.9K Total
    Debug Version:     165.4K Code,  69.4K Data,  234.8K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.1K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.6K Total
    Debug Version:     164.8K Code,  69.2K Data,  234.0K Total

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Switch/Case support: A warning is now issued if the type of the
Switch value cannot be determined at compile time. For example,
Switch(Arg0) will generate the warning, and the type is assumed
to be an integer. As per the ACPI spec, use a construct such as
Switch(ToInteger(Arg0)) to eliminate the warning.

Switch/Case support: Implemented support for buffer and string
objects as the switch value.  This is an ACPI 3.0 feature, now
that LEqual supports buffers and strings.

Switch/Case support: The emitted code for the LEqual()
comparisons now uses the switch value as the first operand, not
the second. The case value is now the second operand, and this
allows the case value to be implicitly converted to the type of
the switch value, not the other way around.

Switch/Case support: Temporary variables are now emitted
immediately within the control method, not at the global level.
This means that there are now 36 temps available per-method, not
36 temps per-module as was the case with the earlier
implementation (_T_0 through _T_9 and _T_A through _T_Z.)

----------------------------------------
14 January 2005.  Summary of changes for version 20050114:

Added 2005 copyright to all module headers.  This affects every
module in the core subsystem, iASL compiler, and the utilities.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed an issue with the String-to-Buffer conversion code where
the string null terminator was not included in the buffer after
conversion, but there is existing ASL that assumes the string
null terminator is included. This is the root of the
ACPI_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT regression. This problem was introduced in
the previous version when the code was updated to correctly set
the converted buffer size as per the ACPI specification. The ACPI
spec is ambiguous and will be updated to specify that the null
terminator must be included in the converted buffer. This also
affects the ToBuffer() ASL operator.

Fixed a problem with the Mid() ASL/AML operator where it did not
work correctly on Buffer objects. Newly created sub-buffers were
not being marked as initialized.

Fixed a problem in AcpiTbFindTable where incorrect string
compares were performed on the OemId and OemTableId table header
fields.  These fields are not null terminated, so strncmp is now
used instead of strcmp.

Implemented a restriction on the Store() ASL/AML operator to
align the behavior with the ACPI specification.  Previously, any
object could be used as the source operand.  Now, the only
objects that may be used are Integers, Buffers, Strings,
Packages, Object References, and DDB Handles.  If necessary, the
original behavior can be restored by enabling the
EnableInterpreterSlack flag.

Enhanced the optional "implicit return" support to allow an
implicit return value from methods that are invoked externally
via the AcpiEvaluateObject interface.  This enables implicit
returns from the _STA and _INI methods, for example.

Changed the Revision() ASL/AML operator to return the current
version of the AML interpreter, in the YYYYMMDD format.
Previously, it incorrectly returned the supported ACPI version
(This is the function of the _REV method).

Updated the _REV predefined method to return the currently
supported version of ACPI, now 3.

Implemented batch mode option for the AcpiExec utility (-b).

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

----------------------------------------
10 December 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041210:

ACPI 3.0 support is nearing completion in both the iASL compiler
and the ACPI CA core subsystem.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem in the ToDecimalString operator where the
resulting string length was incorrectly calculated. The length is
now calculated exactly, eliminating incorrect AE_STRING_LIMIT
exceptions.

Fixed a problem in the ToHexString operator to allow a maximum
200 character string to be produced.

Fixed a problem in the internal string-to-buffer and buffer-to-
buffer copy routine where the length of the resulting buffer was
not truncated to the new size (if the target buffer already
existed).

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     164.7K Code,  68.5K Data,  233.2K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.3K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.8K Total
    Debug Version:     165.3K Code,  69.4K Data,  234.7K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented the new ACPI 3.0 resource template macros -
DWordSpace, ExtendedIO, ExtendedMemory, ExtendedSpace,
QWordSpace, and WordSpace. Includes support in the disassembler.

Implemented support for the new (ACPI 3.0) parameter to the
Register macro, AccessSize.

Fixed a problem where the _HE resource name for the Interrupt
macro was referencing bit 0 instead of bit 1.

Implemented check for maximum 255 interrupts in the Interrupt
macro.

Fixed a problem with the predefined resource descriptor names
where incorrect AML code was generated if the offset within the
resource buffer was 0 or 1.  The optimizer shortened the AML code
to a single byte opcode but did not update the surrounding
package lengths.

Changes to the Dma macro:  All channels within the channel list
must be in the range 0-7.  Maximum 8 channels can be specified.
BusMaster operand is optional (default is BusMaster).

Implemented check for maximum 7 data bytes for the VendorShort
macro.

The ReadWrite parameter is now optional for the Memory32 and
similar macros.

----------------------------------------
03 December 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041203:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The low-level field insertion/extraction code (exfldio) has been
completely rewritten to eliminate unnecessary complexity, bugs,
and boundary conditions.

Fixed a problem in the ToInteger, ToBuffer, ToHexString, and
ToDecimalString operators where the input operand could be
inadvertently deleted if no conversion was necessary (e.g., if
the input to ToInteger was an Integer object.)

Fixed a problem with the ToDecimalString and ToHexString where an
incorrect exception code was returned if the resulting string
would be > 200 chars.  AE_STRING_LIMIT is now returned.

Fixed a problem with the Concatenate operator where AE_OK was
always returned, even if the operation failed.

Fixed a problem in oswinxf (used by AcpiExec and iASL) to allow >
128 semaphores to be allocated.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     164.7K Code,  68.5K Data,  233.2K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed typechecking for the ObjectType and SizeOf operators.
Problem was recently introduced in 20041119.

Fixed a problem with the ToUUID macro where the upper nybble of
each buffer byte was inadvertently set to zero.

----------------------------------------
19 November 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041119:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem in the internal ConvertToInteger routine where
new integers were not truncated to 32 bits for 32-bit ACPI
tables. This routine converts buffers and strings to integers.

Implemented support to store a value to an Index() on a String
object. This is an ACPI 2.0 feature that had not yet been
implemented.

Implemented new behavior for storing objects to individual
package elements (via the Index() operator). The previous
behavior was to invoke the implicit conversion rules if an object
was already present at the index.  The new behavior is to simply
delete any existing object and directly store the new object.
Although the ACPI specification seems unclear on this subject,
other ACPI implementations behave in this manner.  (This is the
root of the AE_BAD_HEX_CONSTANT issue.)

Modified the RSDP memory scan mechanism to support the extended
checksum for ACPI 2.0 (and above) RSDPs. Note that the search
continues until a valid RSDP signature is found with a valid
checksum.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

----------------------------------------
05 November 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041105:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for FADT revision 2.  This was an interim
table (between ACPI 1.0 and ACPI 2.0) that adds support for the
FADT reset register.

Implemented optional support to allow uninitialized LocalX and
ArgX variables in a control method.  The variables are
initialized to an Integer object with a value of zero.  This
support is enabled by setting the AcpiGbl_EnableInterpreterSlack
flag to TRUE.

Implemented support for Integer objects for the SizeOf operator.
Either 4 or 8 is returned, depending on the current integer size
(32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the parent table revision).

Fixed a problem in the implementation of the SizeOf and
ObjectType operators where the operand was resolved to a value
too early, causing incorrect return values for some objects.

Fixed some possible memory leaks during exceptional conditions.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     165.2K Code,  68.6K Data,  233.8K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented support for all ACPI 3.0 reserved names and methods.

Implemented all ACPI 3.0 grammar elements in the front-end,
including support for semicolons.

Implemented the ACPI 3.0 Function() and ToUUID() macros

Fixed a problem in the disassembler where a Scope() operator
would not be emitted properly if the target of the scope was in
another table.

----------------------------------------
15 October 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041015:

Note:  ACPI CA is currently undergoing an in-depth and complete
formal evaluation to test/verify the following areas. Other
suggestions are welcome. This will result in an increase in the
frequency of releases and the number of bug fixes in the next few
months.
  - Functional tests for all ASL/AML operators
  - All implicit/explicit type conversions
  - Bit fields and operation regions
  - 64-bit math support and 32-bit-only "truncated" math support
  - Exceptional conditions, both compiler and interpreter
  - Dynamic object deletion and memory leaks
  - ACPI 3.0 support when implemented
  - External interfaces to the ACPI subsystem


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed two alignment issues on 64-bit platforms - within debug
statements in AcpiEvGpeDetect and AcpiEvCreateGpeBlock. Removed
references to the Address field within the non-aligned ACPI
generic address structure.

Fixed a problem in the Increment and Decrement operators where
incorrect operand resolution could result in the inadvertent
modification of the original integer when the integer is passed
into another method as an argument and the arg is then
incremented/decremented.

Fixed a problem in the FromBCD operator where the upper 32-bits
of a 64-bit BCD number were truncated during conversion.

Fixed a problem in the ToDecimal operator where the length of the
resulting string could be set incorrectly too long if the input
operand was a Buffer object.

Fixed a problem in the Logical operators (LLess, etc.) where a
NULL byte (0) within a buffer would prematurely terminate a
compare between buffer objects.

Added a check for string overflow (>200 characters as per the
ACPI specification) during the Concatenate operator with two
string operands.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     164.6K Code,  68.5K Data,  233.1K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  78.0K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.5K Total
    Debug Version:     164.8K Code,  68.6K Data,  233.4K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Allow the use of the ObjectType operator on uninitialized Locals
and Args (returns 0 as per the ACPI specification).

Fixed a problem where the compiler would fault if there was a
syntax error in the FieldName of all of the various
CreateXXXField operators.

Disallow the use of lower case letters within the EISAID macro,
as per the ACPI specification.  All EISAID strings must be of the
form "UUUNNNN" Where U is an uppercase letter and N is a hex
digit.


----------------------------------------
06 October 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20041006:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for the ACPI 3.0 Timer operator. This ASL
function implements a 64-bit timer with 100 nanosecond
granularity.

Defined a new OSL interface, AcpiOsGetTimer. This interface is
used to implement the ACPI 3.0 Timer operator.  This allows the
host OS to implement the timer with the best clock available.
Also, it keeps the core subsystem out of the clock handling
business, since the host OS (usually) performs this function.

Fixed an alignment issue on 64-bit platforms. The
HwLowLevelRead(Write) functions use a 64-bit address which is
part of the packed ACPI Generic Address Structure. Since the
structure is non-aligned, the alignment macros are now used to
extract the address to a local variable before use.

Fixed a problem where the ToInteger operator assumed all input
strings were hexadecimal. The operator now handles both decimal
strings and hex strings (prefixed with "0x").

Fixed a problem where the string length in the string object
created as a result of the internal ConvertToString procedure
could be incorrect. This potentially affected all implicit
conversions and also the ToDecimalString and ToHexString
operators.

Fixed two problems in the ToString operator. If the length
parameter was zero, an incorrect string object was created and
the value of the input length parameter was inadvertently changed
from zero to Ones.

Fixed a problem where the optional ResourceSource string in the
ExtendedIRQ resource macro was ignored.

Simplified the interfaces to the internal division functions,
reducing code size and complexity.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.9K Code,  11.4K Data,   89.3K Total
    Debug Version:     164.5K Code,  68.3K Data,  232.8K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.8K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.3K Total
    Debug Version:     164.6K Code,  68.5K Data,  233.1K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented support for the ACPI 3.0 Timer operator.

Fixed a problem where the Default() operator was inadvertently
ignored in a Switch/Case block.  This was a problem in the
translation of the Switch statement to If...Else pairs.

Added support to allow a standalone Return operator, with no
parentheses (or operands).

Fixed a problem with code generation for the ElseIf operator
where the translated Else...If parse tree was improperly
constructed leading to the loss of some code.

----------------------------------------
22 September 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040922:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem with the implementation of the LNot() operator
where "Ones" was not returned for the TRUE case. Changed the code
to return Ones instead of (!Arg) which was usually 1. This change
affects iASL constant folding for this operator also.

Fixed a problem in AcpiUtInitializeBuffer where an existing
buffer was not initialized properly -- Now zero the entire buffer
in this case where the buffer already exists.

Changed the interface to AcpiOsSleep from (UINT32 Seconds, UINT32
Milliseconds) to simply (ACPI_INTEGER Milliseconds). This
simplifies all related code considerably. This will require
changes/updates to all OS interface layers (OSLs.)

Implemented a new external interface,
AcpiInstallExceptionHandler, to allow a system exception handler
to be installed. This handler is invoked upon any run-time
exception that occurs during control method execution.

Added support for the DSDT in AcpiTbFindTable. This allows the
DataTableRegion() operator to access the local copy of the DSDT.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code. The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size. Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.8K Code,  11.4K Data,   89.2K Total
    Debug Version:     164.2K Code,  68.2K Data,  232.4K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.9K Code,  11.4K Data,   89.3K Total
    Debug Version:     164.5K Code,  68.3K Data,  232.8K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem with constant folding and the LNot operator. LNot
was returning 1 in the TRUE case, not Ones as per the ACPI
specification. This could result in the generation of an
incorrect folded/reduced constant.

End-Of-File is now allowed within a "//"-style comment.  A parse
error no longer occurs if such a comment is at the very end of
the input ASL source file.

Implemented the "-r" option to override the Revision in the table
header. The initial use of this option will be to simplify the
evaluation of the AML interpreter by allowing a single ASL source
module to be compiled for either 32-bit or 64-bit integers.


----------------------------------------
27 August 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040827:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

- Implemented support for implicit object conversion in the non-
numeric logical operators (LEqual, LGreater, LGreaterEqual,
LLess, LLessEqual, and LNotEqual.)  Any combination of
Integers/Strings/Buffers may now be used; the second operand is
implicitly converted on the fly to match the type of the first
operand.  For example:

    LEqual (Source1, Source2)

Source1 and Source2 must each evaluate to an integer, a string,
or a buffer. The data type of Source1 dictates the required type
of Source2. Source2 is implicitly converted if necessary to match
the type of Source1.

- Updated and corrected the behavior of the string conversion
support.  The rules concerning conversion of buffers to strings
(according to the ACPI specification) are as follows:

ToDecimalString - explicit byte-wise conversion of buffer to
string of decimal values (0-255) separated by commas. ToHexString
- explicit byte-wise conversion of buffer to string of hex values
(0-FF) separated by commas. ToString - explicit byte-wise
conversion of buffer to string.  Byte-by-byte copy with no
transform except NULL terminated. Any other implicit buffer-to-
string conversion - byte-wise conversion of buffer to string of
hex values (0-FF) separated by spaces.

- Fixed typo in definition of AcpiGbl_EnableInterpreterSlack.

- Fixed a problem in AcpiNsGetPathnameLength where the returned
length was one byte too short in the case of a node in the root
scope.  This could cause a fault during debug output.

- Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     164.2K Code,  68.2K Data,  232.4K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

- Fixed a Linux generation error.


----------------------------------------
16 August 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040816:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Designed and implemented support within the AML interpreter for
the so-called "implicit return".  This support returns the result
of the last ASL operation within a control method, in the absence
of an explicit Return() operator.  A few machines depend on this
behavior, even though it is not explicitly supported by the ASL
language.  It is optional support that can be enabled at runtime
via the AcpiGbl_EnableInterpeterSlack flag.

Removed support for the PCI_Config address space from the
internal low level hardware interfaces (AcpiHwLowLevelRead and
AcpiHwLowLevelWrite).  This support was not used internally, and
would not work correctly anyway because the PCI bus number and
segment number were not supported.  There are separate interfaces
for PCI configuration space access because of the unique
interface.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  77.9K Code,  11.5K Data,   89.4K Total
    Debug Version:     164.1K Code,  68.3K Data,  232.4K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem where constants in ASL expressions at the root
level (not within a control method) could be inadvertently
truncated during code generation.  This problem was introduced in
the 20040715 release.


----------------------------------------
15 July 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040715:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Restructured the internal HW GPE interfaces to pass/track the
current state of interrupts (enabled/disabled) in order to avoid
possible deadlock and increase flexibility of the interfaces.

Implemented a "lexicographical compare" for String and Buffer
objects within the logical operators -- LGreater, LLess,
LGreaterEqual, and LLessEqual -- as per further clarification to
the ACPI specification.  Behavior is similar to C library
"strcmp".

Completed a major reduction in CPU stack use for the
AcpiGetFirmwareTable external function.  In the 32-bit non-debug
case, the stack use has been reduced from 168 bytes to 32 bytes.

Deployed a new run-time configuration flag,
AcpiGbl_EnableInterpreterSlack, whose purpose is to allow the AML
interpreter to forgive certain bad AML constructs.  Default
setting is FALSE.

Implemented the first use of AcpiGbl_EnableInterpreterSlack in
the Field IO support code.  If enabled, it allows field access to
go beyond the end of a region definition if the field is within
the region length rounded up to the next access width boundary (a
common coding error.)

Renamed OSD_HANDLER to ACPI_OSD_HANDLER, and
OSD_EXECUTION_CALLBACK to ACPI_OSD_EXEC_CALLBACK for consistency
with other ACPI symbols.  Also, these symbols are lowercased by
the latest version of the AcpiSrc tool.

The prototypes for the PCI interfaces in acpiosxf.h have been
updated to rename "Register" to simply "Reg" to prevent certain
compilers from complaining.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     164.1K Code,  68.2K Data,  232.3K Total


2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented full support for Package objects within the Case()
operator.  Note: The Break() operator is currently not supported
within Case blocks (TermLists) as there is some question about
backward compatibility with ACPI 1.0 interpreters.

Fixed a problem where complex terms were not supported properly
within the Switch() operator.

Eliminated extraneous warning for compiler-emitted reserved names
of the form "_T_x".  (Used in Switch/Case operators.)

Eliminated optimization messages for "_T_x" objects and small
constants within the DefinitionBlock operator.


----------------------------------------
15 June 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040615:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for Buffer and String objects (as per ACPI
2.0) for the following ASL operators:  LEqual, LGreater, LLess,
LGreaterEqual, and LLessEqual.

All directory names in the entire source package are lower case,
as they were in earlier releases.

Implemented "Disassemble" command in the AML debugger that will
disassemble a single control method.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented support for Buffer and String objects (as per ACPI
2.0) for the following ASL operators:  LEqual, LGreater, LLess,
LGreaterEqual, and LLessEqual.

All directory names in the entire source package are lower case,
as they were in earlier releases.

Fixed a fault when using the -g or -d<nofilename> options if the
FADT was not found.

Fixed an issue with the Windows version of the compiler where
later versions of Windows place the FADT in the registry under
the name "FADT" and not "FACP" as earlier versions did.  This
applies when using the -g or -d<nofilename> options.  The
compiler now looks for both strings as necessary.

Fixed a problem with compiler namepath optimization where a
namepath within the Scope() operator could not be optimized if
the namepath was a subpath of the current scope path.

----------------------------------------
27 May 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040527:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Completed a new design and implementation for EBDA (Extended BIOS
Data Area) support in the RSDP scan code.  The original code
improperly scanned for the EBDA by simply scanning from memory
location 0 to 0x400.  The correct method is to first obtain the
EBDA pointer from within the BIOS data area, then scan 1K of
memory starting at the EBDA pointer.  There appear to be few if
any machines that place the RSDP in the EBDA, however.

Integrated a fix for a possible fault during evaluation of
BufferField arguments.  Obsolete code that was causing the
problem was removed.

Found and fixed a problem in the Field Support Code where data
could be corrupted on a bit field read that starts on an aligned
boundary but does not end on an aligned boundary.  Merged the
read/write "datum length" calculation code into a common
procedure.

Rolled in a couple of changes to the FreeBSD-specific header.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a generation warning produced by some overly-verbose
compilers for a 64-bit constant.

----------------------------------------
14 May 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040514:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where hardware GPE enable bits sometimes not set
properly during and after GPE method execution.  Result of 04/27
changes.

Removed extra "clear all GPEs" when sleeping/waking.

Removed AcpiHwEnableGpe and AcpiHwDisableGpe, replaced by the
single AcpiHwWriteGpeEnableReg. Changed a couple of calls to the
functions above to the new AcpiEv* calls as appropriate.

ACPI_OS_NAME was removed from the OS-specific headers.  The
default name is now "Microsoft Windows NT" for maximum
compatibility.  However this can be changed by modifying the
acconfig.h file.

Allow a single invocation of AcpiInstallNotifyHandler for a
handler that traps both types of notifies (System, Device).  Use
ACPI_ALL_NOTIFY flag.

Run _INI methods on ThermalZone objects.  This is against the
ACPI specification, but there is apparently ASL code in the field
that has these _INI methods, and apparently "other" AML
interpreters execute them.

Performed a full 16/32/64 bit lint that resulted in some small
changes.

Added a sleep simulation command to the AML debugger to test
sleep code.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

----------------------------------------
27 April 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040427:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Completed a major overhaul of the GPE handling within ACPI CA.
There are now three types of GPEs:  wake-only, runtime-only, and
combination wake/run.  The only GPEs allowed to be combination
wake/run are for button-style devices such as a control-method
power button, control-method sleep button, or a notebook lid
switch.  GPEs that have an _Lxx or _Exx method and are not
referenced by any _PRW methods are marked for "runtime" and
hardware enabled.  Any GPE that is referenced by a _PRW method is
marked for "wake" (and disabled at runtime).  However, at sleep
time, only those GPEs that have been specifically enabled for
wake via the AcpiEnableGpe interface will actually be hardware
enabled.

A new external interface has been added, AcpiSetGpeType(), that
is meant to be used by device drivers to force a GPE to a
particular type.  It will be especially useful for the drivers
for the button devices mentioned above.

Completed restructuring of the ACPI CA initialization sequence so
that default operation region handlers are installed before GPEs
are initialized and the _PRW methods are executed.  This will
prevent errors when the _PRW methods attempt to access system
memory or I/O space.

GPE enable/disable no longer reads the GPE enable register.  We
now keep the enable info for runtime and wake separate and in the
GPE_EVENT_INFO.  We thus no longer depend on the hardware to
maintain these bits.

Always clear the wake status and fixed/GPE status bits before
sleep, even for state S5.

Improved the AML debugger output for displaying the GPE blocks
and their current status.

Added new strings for the _OSI method, of the form "Windows 2001
SPx" where x = 0,1,2,3,4.

Fixed a problem where the physical address was incorrectly
calculated when the Load() operator was used to directly load
from an Operation Region (vs. loading from a Field object.)  Also
added check for minimum table length for this case.

Fix for multiple mutex acquisition.  Restore original thread
SyncLevel on mutex release.

Added ACPI_VALID_SXDS flag to the AcpiGetObjectInfo interface for
consistency with the other fields returned.

Shrunk the ACPI_GPE_EVENT_INFO structure by 40%.  There is one
such structure for each GPE in the system, so the size of this
structure is important.

CPU stack requirement reduction:  Cleaned up the method execution
and object evaluation paths so that now a parameter structure is
passed, instead of copying the various method parameters over and
over again.

In evregion.c:  Correctly exit and reenter the interpreter region
if and only if dispatching an operation region request to a user-
installed handler.  Do not exit/reenter when dispatching to a
default handler (e.g., default system memory or I/O handlers)


Notes for updating drivers for the new GPE support.  The
following changes must be made to ACPI-related device drivers
that are attached to one or more GPEs: (This information will be
added to the ACPI CA Programmer Reference.)

1) AcpiInstallGpeHandler no longer automatically enables the GPE,
you must explicitly call AcpiEnableGpe.
2) There is a new interface called AcpiSetGpeType. This should be
called before enabling the GPE.  Also, this interface will
automatically disable the GPE if it is currently enabled.
3) AcpiEnableGpe no longer supports a GPE type flag.

Specific drivers that must be changed:
1) EC driver:
    AcpiInstallGpeHandler (NULL, GpeNum, ACPI_GPE_EDGE_TRIGGERED,
AeGpeHandler, NULL);
    AcpiSetGpeType (NULL, GpeNum, ACPI_GPE_TYPE_RUNTIME);
    AcpiEnableGpe (NULL, GpeNum, ACPI_NOT_ISR);

2) Button Drivers (Power, Lid, Sleep):
Run _PRW method under parent device
If _PRW exists: /* This is a control-method button */
    Extract GPE number and possibly GpeDevice
    AcpiSetGpeType (GpeDevice, GpeNum, ACPI_GPE_TYPE_WAKE_RUN);
    AcpiEnableGpe (GpeDevice, GpeNum, ACPI_NOT_ISR);

For all other devices that have _PRWs, we automatically set the
GPE type to ACPI_GPE_TYPE_WAKE, but the GPE is NOT automatically
(wake) enabled.  This must be done on a selective basis, usually
requiring some kind of user app to allow the user to pick the
wake devices.


Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

----------------------------------------
02 April 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040402:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed an interpreter problem where an indirect store through an
ArgX parameter was incorrectly applying the "implicit conversion
rules" during the store.  From the ACPI specification: "If the
target is a method local or argument (LocalX or ArgX), no
conversion is performed and the result is stored directly to the
target".  The new behavior is to disable implicit conversion
during ALL stores to an ArgX.

Changed the behavior of the _PRW method scan to ignore any and
all errors returned by a given _PRW.  This prevents the scan from
aborting from the failure of any single _PRW.

Moved the runtime configuration parameters from the global init
procedure to static variables in acglobal.h.  This will allow the
host to override the default values easily.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

iASL now fully disassembles SSDTs.  However, External()
statements are not generated automatically for unresolved symbols
at this time.  This is a planned feature for future
implementation.

Fixed a scoping problem in the disassembler that occurs when the
type of the target of a Scope() operator is overridden.  This
problem caused an incorrectly nested internal namespace to be
constructed.

Any warnings or errors that are emitted during disassembly are
now commented out automatically so that the resulting file can be
recompiled without any hand editing.

----------------------------------------
26 March 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040326:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for "wake" GPEs via interaction between GPEs
and the _PRW methods.  Every GPE that is pointed to by one or
more _PRWs is identified as a WAKE GPE and by default will no
longer be enabled at runtime.  Previously, we were blindly
enabling all GPEs with a corresponding _Lxx or _Exx method - but
most of these turn out to be WAKE GPEs anyway.  We believe this
has been the cause of thousands of "spurious" GPEs on some
systems.

This new GPE behavior is can be reverted to the original behavior
(enable ALL GPEs at runtime) via a runtime flag.

Fixed a problem where aliased control methods could not access
objects properly.  The proper scope within the namespace was not
initialized (transferred to the target of the aliased method)
before executing the target method.

Fixed a potential race condition on internal object deletion on
the return object in AcpiEvaluateObject.

Integrated a fix for resource descriptors where both _MEM and
_MTP were being extracted instead of just _MEM.  (i.e. bitmask
was incorrectly too wide, 0x0F instead of 0x03.)

Added a special case for ACPI_ROOT_OBJECT in AcpiUtGetNodeName,
preventing a fault in some cases.

Updated Notify() values for debug statements in evmisc.c

Return proper status from AcpiUtMutexInitialize, not just simply
AE_OK.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The

----------------------------------------
11 March 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040311:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where errors occurring during the parse phase of
control method execution did not abort cleanly.  For example,
objects created and installed in the namespace were not deleted.
This caused all subsequent invocations of the method to return
the AE_ALREADY_EXISTS exception.

Implemented a mechanism to force a control method to "Serialized"
execution if the method attempts to create namespace objects.
(The root of the AE_ALREADY_EXISTS problem.)

Implemented support for the predefined _OSI "internal" control
method.  Initial supported strings are "Linux", "Windows 2000",
"Windows 2001", and "Windows 2001.1", and can be easily upgraded
for new strings as necessary.  This feature will allow "other"
operating systems to execute the fully tested, "Windows" code
path through the ASL code

Global Lock Support:  Now allows multiple acquires and releases
with any internal thread.  Removed concept of "owning thread" for
this special mutex.

Fixed two functions that were inappropriately declaring large
objects on the CPU stack:  PsParseLoop, NsEvaluateRelative.
Reduces the stack usage during method execution considerably.

Fixed a problem in the ACPI 2.0 FACS descriptor (actbl2.h) where
the S4Bios_f field was incorrectly defined as UINT32 instead of
UINT32_BIT.

Fixed a problem where AcpiEvGpeDetect would fault if there were
no GPEs defined on the machine.

Implemented two runtime options:  One to force all control method
execution to "Serialized" to mimic Windows behavior, another to
disable _OSI support if it causes problems on a given machine.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

compiler to fault.

----------------------------------------
20 February 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040220:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented execution of _SxD methods for Device objects in the
GetObjectInfo interface.

Fixed calls to _SST method to pass the correct arguments.

Added a call to _SST on wake to restore to "working" state.

Check for End-Of-Buffer failure case in the WalkResources
interface.

Integrated fix for 64-bit alignment issue in acglobal.h by moving
two structures to the beginning of the file.

After wake, clear GPE status register(s) before enabling GPEs.

After wake, clear/enable power button.  (Perhaps we should
clear/enable all fixed events upon wake.)

Fixed a couple of possible memory leaks in the Namespace manager.

Integrated latest acnetbsd.h file.

----------------------------------------
11 February 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040211:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Completed investigation and implementation of the call-by-
reference mechanism for control method arguments.

Fixed a problem where a store of an object into an indexed
package could fail if the store occurs within a different method
than the method that created the package.

Fixed a problem where the ToDecimal operator could return
incorrect results.

Fixed a problem where the CopyObject operator could fail on some
of the more obscure objects (e.g., Reference objects.)

Improved the output of the Debug object to display buffer,
package, and index objects.

Fixed a problem where constructs of the form "RefOf (ArgX)" did
not return the expected result.

Added permanent ACPI_REPORT_ERROR macros for all instances of the
ACPI_AML_INTERNAL exception.

Integrated latest version of acfreebsd.h

----------------------------------------
16 January 2004.  Summary of changes for version 20040116:

The purpose of this release is primarily to update the copyright
years in each module, thus causing a huge number of diffs.  There
are a few small functional changes, however.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Improved error messages when there is a problem finding one or
more of the required base ACPI tables

Reintroduced the definition of APIC_HEADER in actbl.h

Changed definition of MADT_ADDRESS_OVERRIDE to 64 bits (actbl.h)

Removed extraneous reference to NewObj in dsmthdat.c

2) iASL compiler

Fixed a problem introduced in December that disabled the correct
disassembly of Resource Templates


----------------------------------------
03 December 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20031203:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Changed the initialization of Operation Regions during subsystem
init to perform two entire walks of the ACPI namespace; The first
to initialize the regions themselves, the second to execute the
_REG methods.  This fixed some interdependencies across _REG
methods found on some machines.

Fixed a problem where a Store(Local0, Local1) could simply update
the object reference count, and not create a new copy of the
object if the Local1 is uninitialized.

Implemented support for the _SST reserved method during sleep
transitions.

Implemented support to clear the SLP_TYP and SLP_EN bits when
waking up, this is apparently required by some machines.

When sleeping, clear the wake status only if SleepState is not
S5.

Fixed a problem in AcpiRsExtendedIrqResource() where an incorrect
pointer arithmetic advanced a string pointer too far.

Fixed a problem in AcpiTbGetTablePtr() where a garbage pointer
could be returned if the requested table has not been loaded.

Within the support for IRQ resources, restructured the handling
of
the active and edge/level bits.

Fixed a few problems in AcpiPsxExecute() where memory could be
leaked under certain error conditions.

Improved error messages for the cases where the ACPI mode could
not be entered.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler
and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Implemented a fix for the iASL disassembler where a bad index was
generated.  This was most noticeable on 64-bit platforms


----------------------------------------
29 October 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20031029:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where a level-triggered GPE with an associated
_Lxx control method was incorrectly cleared twice.

Fixed a problem with the Field support code where an access can
occur beyond the end-of-region if the field is non-aligned but
extends to the very end of the parent region (resulted in an
AE_AML_REGION_LIMIT exception.)

Fixed a problem with ACPI Fixed Events where an RT Clock handler
would not get invoked on an RTC event.  The RTC event bitmasks
for
the PM1 registers were not being initialized properly.

Implemented support for executing _STA and _INI methods for
Processor objects.  Although this is currently not part of the
ACPI specification, there is existing ASL code that depends on
the
init-time execution of these methods.

Implemented and deployed a GetDescriptorName function to decode
the various types of internal descriptors.  Guards against null
descriptors during debug output also.

Implemented and deployed a GetNodeName function to extract the 4-
character namespace node name.  This function simplifies the
debug
and error output, as well as guarding against null pointers
during
output.

Implemented and deployed the ACPI_FORMAT_UINT64 helper macro to
simplify the debug and error output of 64-bit integers.  This
macro replaces the HIDWORD and LODWORD macros for dumping these
integers.

Updated the implementation of the Stall() operator to only call
AcpiOsStall(), and also return an error if the operand is larger
than 255.  This preserves the required behavior of not
relinquishing the processor, as would happen if AcpiOsSleep() was
called for "long stalls".

Constructs of the form "Store(LocalX,LocalX)" where LocalX is not
initialized are now treated as NOOPs.

Cleaned up a handful of warnings during 64-bit generation.

Fixed a reported error where and incorrect GPE number was passed
to the GPE dispatch handler.  This value is only used for error
output, however.  Used this opportunity to clean up and
streamline
the GPE dispatch code.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler
and the compiler options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Updated the iASL compiler to return an error if the operand to
the
Stall() operator is larger than 255.


----------------------------------------
02 October 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20031002:


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem with Index Fields where the index was not
incremented for fields that require multiple writes to the
index/data registers (Fields that are wider than the data
register.)

Fixed a problem with all Field objects where a write could go
beyond the end-of-field if the field was larger than the access
granularity and therefore required multiple writes to complete
the
request.  An extra write beyond the end of the field could happen
inadvertently.

Fixed a problem with Index Fields where a BUFFER_OVERFLOW error
would incorrectly be returned if the width of the Data Register
was larger than the specified field access width.

Completed fixes for LoadTable() and Unload() and verified their
operation.  Implemented full support for the "DdbHandle" object
throughout the ACPI CA subsystem.

Implemented full support for the MADT and ECDT tables in the ACPI
CA header files.  Even though these tables are not directly
consumed by ACPI CA, the header definitions are useful for ACPI
device drivers.

Integrated resource descriptor fixes posted to the Linux ACPI
list.  This included checks for minimum descriptor length, and
support for trailing NULL strings within descriptors that have
optional string elements.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The

mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler

    Debug Version:     157.9K Code,  64.8K Data,  222.7K Total


2) iASL Compiler:

Implemented detection of non-ASCII characters within the input
source ASL file.  This catches attempts to compile binary (AML)
files early in the compile, with an informative error message.

Fixed a problem where the disassembler would fault if the output
filename could not be generated or if the output file could not
be
opened.

----------------------------------------
18 September 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030918:


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Found and fixed a longstanding problem with the late execution of
the various deferred AML opcodes (such as Operation Regions,
Buffer Fields, Buffers, and Packages).  If the name string
specified for the name of the new object placed the object in a
scope other than the current scope, the initialization/execution
of the opcode failed.  The solution to this problem was to
implement a mechanism where the late execution of such opcodes
does not attempt to lookup/create the name a second time in an
incorrect scope.  This fixes the "region size computed
incorrectly" problem.

Fixed a call to AcpiHwRegisterWrite in hwregs.c that was causing
a
Global Lock AE_BAD_PARAMETER error.

Fixed several 64-bit issues with prototypes, casting and data
types.

Removed duplicate prototype from acdisasm.h

Fixed an issue involving EC Operation Region Detach (Shaohua Li)

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The

2) Linux:

Fixed the AcpiOsSleep implementation in osunixxf.c to pass the
correct sleep time in seconds.

----------------------------------------
14 July 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030619:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Parse SSDTs in order discovered, as opposed to reverse order
(Hrvoje Habjanic)

Fixes from FreeBSD and NetBSD. (Frank van der Linden, Thomas
Klausner,
   Nate Lawson)


2) Linux:

Dynamically allocate SDT list (suggested by Andi Kleen)

proc function return value cleanups (Andi Kleen)

Correctly handle NMI watchdog during long stalls (Andrew Morton)

Make it so acpismp=force works (reported by Andrew Morton)


----------------------------------------
19 June 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030619:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fix To/FromBCD, eliminating the need for an arch-specific
#define.

Do not acquire a semaphore in the S5 shutdown path.

Fix ex_digits_needed for 0. (Takayoshi Kochi)

Fix sleep/stall code reversal. (Andi Kleen)

Revert a change having to do with control method calling
semantics.

2) Linux:

acpiphp update (Takayoshi Kochi)

Export acpi_disabled for sonypi (Stelian Pop)

Mention acpismp=force in config help

Re-add acpitable.c and acpismp=force. This improves backwards
compatibility and also cleans up the code to a significant
degree.

Add ASUS Value-add driver (Karol Kozimor and Julien Lerouge)

----------------------------------------
22 May 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030522:

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Found and fixed a reported problem where an AE_NOT_FOUND error
occurred occasionally during _BST evaluation.  This turned out to
be an Owner ID allocation issue where a called method did not get
a new ID assigned to it.  Eventually, (after 64k calls), the
Owner
ID UINT16 would wraparound so that the ID would be the same as
the
caller's and the called method would delete the caller's
namespace.

Implemented extended error reporting for control methods that are
aborted due to a run-time exception.  Output includes the exact
AML instruction that caused the method abort, a dump of the
method
locals and arguments at the time of the abort, and a trace of all
nested control method calls.

Modified the interpreter to allow the creation of buffers of zero
length from the AML code. Implemented new code to ensure that no
attempt is made to actually allocate a memory buffer (of length
zero) - instead, a simple buffer object with a NULL buffer
pointer
and length zero is created.  A warning is no longer issued when
the AML attempts to create a zero-length buffer.

Implemented a workaround for the "leading asterisk issue" in
_HIDs, _UIDs, and _CIDs in the AML interpreter.  One leading
asterisk is automatically removed if present in any HID, UID, or
CID strings.  The iASL compiler will still flag this asterisk as
an error, however.

Implemented full support for _CID methods that return a package
of
multiple CIDs (Compatible IDs).  The AcpiGetObjectInfo()
interface
now additionally returns a device _CID list if present.  This
required a change to the external interface in order to pass an
ACPI_BUFFER object as a parameter since the _CID list is of
variable length.

Fixed a problem with the new AE_SAME_HANDLER exception where
handler initialization code did not know about this exception.

Code and Data Size: Current and previous core subsystem library
sizes are shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and
these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The
debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler
and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux:

Fixed a bug in which we would reinitialize the ACPI interrupt
after it was already working, thus disabling all ACPI and the
IRQs
for any other device sharing the interrupt. (Thanks to Stian
Jordet)

Toshiba driver update (John Belmonte)

Return only 0 or 1 for our interrupt handler status (Andrew
Morton)


3) iASL Compiler:

Fixed a reported problem where multiple (nested) ElseIf()
statements were not handled correctly by the compiler, resulting
in incorrect warnings and incorrect AML code.  This was a problem
in both the ASL parser and the code generator.


4) Documentation:

Added changes to existing interfaces, new exception codes, and
new
text concerning reference count object management versus garbage
collection.

----------------------------------------
09 May 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030509.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Changed the subsystem initialization sequence to hold off
installation of address space handlers until the hardware has
been
initialized and the system has entered ACPI mode.  This is
because
the installation of space handlers can cause _REG methods to be
run.  Previously, the _REG methods could potentially be run
before
ACPI mode was enabled.

Fixed some memory leak issues related to address space handler
and
notify handler installation.  There were some problems with the
reference count mechanism caused by the fact that the handler
objects are shared across several namespace objects.

Fixed a reported problem where reference counts within the
namespace were not properly updated when named objects created by
method execution were deleted.

Fixed a reported problem where multiple SSDTs caused a deletion
issue during subsystem termination.  Restructured the table data
structures to simplify the linked lists and the related code.

Fixed a problem where the table ID associated with secondary
tables (SSDTs) was not being propagated into the namespace
objects
created by those tables.  This would only present a problem for
tables that are unloaded at run-time, however.

Updated AcpiOsReadable and AcpiOsWritable to use the ACPI_SIZE
type as the length parameter (instead of UINT32).

Solved a long-standing problem where an ALREADY_EXISTS error
appears on various systems.  This problem could happen when there
are multiple PCI_Config operation regions under a single PCI root
bus.  This doesn't happen very frequently, but there are some
systems that do this in the ASL.

Fixed a reported problem where the internal DeleteNode function
was incorrectly handling the case where a namespace node was the
first in the parent's child list, and had additional peers (not
the only child, but first in the list of children.)

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are

below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will
vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux:

Allow ":" in OS override string (Ducrot Bruno)

Kobject fix (Greg KH)


3 iASL Compiler/Disassembler:

Fixed a problem in the generation of the C source code files (AML
is emitted in C source statements for BIOS inclusion) where the
Ascii dump that appears within a C comment at the end of each
line
could cause a compile time error if the AML sequence happens to
have an open comment or close comment sequence embedded.


----------------------------------------
24 April 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030424.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Support for big-endian systems has been implemented.  Most of the
support has been invisibly added behind big-endian versions of
the
ACPI_MOVE_* macros.

Fixed a problem in AcpiHwDisableGpeBlock() and
AcpiHwClearGpeBlock() where an incorrect offset was passed to the
low level hardware write routine.  The offset parameter was
actually eliminated from the low level read/write routines
because
they had become obsolete.

Fixed a problem where a handler object was deleted twice during
the removal of a fixed event handler.


2) Linux:

A fix for SMP systems with link devices was contributed by
Compaq's Dan Zink.

(2.5) Return whether we handled the interrupt in our IRQ handler.
(Linux ISRs no longer return void, so we can propagate the
handler
return value from the ACPI CA core back to the OS.)


3) Documentation:

The ACPI CA Programmer Reference has been updated to reflect new
interfaces and changes to existing interfaces.

----------------------------------------
28 March 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030328.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The GPE Block Device support has been completed.  New interfaces
are AcpiInstallGpeBlock and AcpiRemoveGpeBlock.  The Event
interfaces (enable, disable, clear, getstatus) have been split
into separate interfaces for Fixed Events and General Purpose
Events (GPEs) in order to support GPE Block Devices properly.

Fixed a problem where the error message "Failed to acquire
semaphore" would appear during operations on the embedded
controller (EC).

shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these

----------------------------------------
28 February 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030228.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The GPE handling and dispatch code has been completely overhauled
in preparation for support of GPE Block Devices (ID ACPI0006).
This affects internal data structures and code only; there should
be no differences visible externally.  One new file has been
added, evgpeblk.c

The FADT fields GPE0_BLK_LEN and GPE1_BLK_LEN are now the only
fields that are used to determine the GPE block lengths.  The
REGISTER_BIT_WIDTH field of the X_GPEx_BLK extended address
structures are ignored.  This is per the ACPI specification but
it
isn't very clear.  The full 256 Block 0/1 GPEs are now supported
(the use of REGISTER_BIT_WIDTH limited the number of GPEs to
128).

In the SCI interrupt handler, removed the read of the PM1_CONTROL
register to look at the SCI_EN bit.  On some machines, this read
causes an SMI event and greatly slows down SCI events.  (This may
in fact be the cause of slow battery status response on some
systems.)

Fixed a problem where a store of a NULL string to a package
object
could cause the premature deletion of the object.  This was seen
during execution of the battery _BIF method on some systems,
resulting in no battery data being returned.

Added AcpiWalkResources interface to simplify parsing of resource
lists.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will
vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

S3 fixes (Ole Rohne)

Update ACPI PHP driver with to use new acpi_walk_resource API
(Bjorn Helgaas)

Add S4BIOS support (Pavel Machek)

Map in entire table before performing checksum (John Stultz)

Expand the mem= cmdline to allow the specification of reserved
and
ACPI DATA blocks (Pavel Machek)

Never use ACPI on VISWS

Fix derive_pci_id (Ducrot Bruno, Alvaro Lopez)

Revert a change that allowed P_BLK lengths to be 4 or 5. This is
causing us to think that some systems support C2 when they really
don't.

Do not count processor objects for non-present CPUs (Thanks to
Dominik Brodowski)


3) iASL Compiler:

Fixed a problem where ASL include files could not be found and
opened.

Added support for the _PDC reserved name.


----------------------------------------
22 January 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030122.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Added a check for constructs of the form:  Store (Local0, Local0)
where Local0 is not initialized.  Apparently, some BIOS
programmers believe that this is a NOOP.  Since this store
doesn't
do anything anyway, the new prototype behavior will ignore this
error.  This is a case where we can relax the strict checking in
the interpreter in the name of compatibility.


2) Linux

The AcpiSrc Source Conversion Utility has been released with the
Linux package for the first time.  This is the utility that is
used to convert the ACPI CA base source code to the Linux
version.

(Both) Handle P_BLK lengths shorter than 6 more gracefully

(Both) Move more headers to include/acpi, and delete an unused
header.

(Both) Move drivers/acpi/include directory to include/acpi

(Both) Boot functions don't use cmdline, so don't pass it around

(Both) Remove include of unused header (Adrian Bunk)

(Both) acpiphp.h includes both linux/acpi.h and acpi_bus.h. Since
the
former now also includes the latter, acpiphp.h only needs the
one,
now.

(2.5) Make it possible to select method of bios restoring after
S3
resume. [=> no more ugly ifdefs] (Pavel Machek)

(2.5) Make proc write interfaces work (Pavel Machek)

(2.5) Properly init/clean up in cpufreq/acpi (Dominik Brodowski)

(2.5) Break out ACPI Perf code into its own module, under cpufreq
(Dominik Brodowski)

(2.4) S4BIOS support (Ducrot Bruno)

(2.4) Fix acpiphp_glue.c for latest ACPI struct changes (Sergio
Visinoni)


3) iASL Compiler:

Added support to disassemble SSDT and PSDTs.

Implemented support to obtain SSDTs from the Windows registry if
available.


----------------------------------------
09 January 2003.  Summary of changes for version 20030109.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Changed the behavior of the internal Buffer-to-String conversion
function.  The current ACPI specification states that the
contents
of the buffer are "converted to a string of two-character
hexadecimal numbers, each separated by a space".  Unfortunately,
this definition is not backwards compatible with existing ACPI
1.0
implementations (although the behavior was not defined in the
ACPI
1.0 specification).  The new behavior simply copies data from the
buffer to the string until a null character is found or the end
of
the buffer is reached.  The new String object is always null
terminated.  This problem was seen during the generation of _BIF
battery data where incorrect strings were returned for battery
type, etc.  This will also require an errata to the ACPI
specification.

Renamed all instances of NATIVE_UINT and NATIVE_INT to
ACPI_NATIVE_UINT and ACPI_NATIVE_INT, respectively.

Copyright in all module headers (both Linux and non-Linux) has be
updated to 2003.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug

(2.4) Fix to handle dynamic size of mp_irqs (Joerg Prante)

(2.5) Replace pr_debug (Randy Dunlap)

(2.5) Remove usage of CPUFREQ_ALL_CPUS (Dominik Brodowski)

(Both) Eliminate spawning of thread from timer callback, in favor
of schedule_work()

(Both) Show Lid status in /proc (Zdenek OGAR Skalak)

(Both) Added define for Fixed Function HW region (Matthew Wilcox)

(Both) Add missing statics to button.c (Pavel Machek)

Several changes have been made to the source code translation
utility that generates the Linux Code in order to make the code
more "Linux-like":

All typedefs on structs and unions have been removed in keeping
with the Linux coding style.

Removed the non-Linux SourceSafe module revision number from each
module header.

Completed major overhaul of symbols to be lowercased for linux.
Doubled the number of symbols that are lowercased.

Fixed a problem where identifiers within procedure headers and
within quotes were not fully lower cased (they were left with a
starting capital.)

Some C macros whose only purpose is to allow the generation of 16-
bit code are now completely removed in the Linux code, increasing
readability and maintainability.

----------------------------------------

12 December 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021212.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where the creation of a zero-length AML Buffer
would cause a fault.

Fixed a problem where a Buffer object that pointed to a static
AML
buffer (in an ACPI table) could inadvertently be deleted, causing
memory corruption.

Fixed a problem where a user buffer (passed in to the external
ACPI CA interfaces) could be overwritten if the buffer was too
small to complete the operation, causing memory corruption.

Fixed a problem in the Buffer-to-String conversion code where a
string of length one was always returned, regardless of the size
of the input Buffer object.

Removed the NATIVE_CHAR data type across the entire source due to
lack of need and lack of consistent use.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug

----------------------------------------
05 December 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021205.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where a store to a String or Buffer object could
cause corruption of the DSDT if the object type being stored was
the same as the target object type and the length of the object
being stored was equal to or smaller than the original (existing)
target object.  This was seen to cause corruption of battery _BIF
buffers if the _BIF method modified the buffer on the fly.

Fixed a problem where an internal error was generated if a
control
method invocation was used in an OperationRegion, Buffer, or
Package declaration.  This was caused by the deferred parsing of
the control method and thus the deferred creation of the internal
method object.  The solution to this problem was to create the
internal method object at the moment the method is encountered in
the first pass - so that subsequent references to the method will
able to obtain the required parameter count and thus properly
parse the method invocation.  This problem presented itself as an
AE_AML_INTERNAL during the pass 1 parse phase during table load.

Fixed a problem where the internal String object copy routine did
not always allocate sufficient memory for the target String
object
and caused memory corruption.  This problem was seen to cause
"Allocation already present in list!" errors as memory allocation
became corrupted.

Implemented a new function for the evaluation of namespace
objects
that allows the specification of the allowable return object
types.  This simplifies a lot of code that checks for a return
object of one or more specific objects returned from the
evaluation (such as _STA, etc.)  This may become and external
function if it would be useful to ACPI-related drivers.

Completed another round of prefixing #defines with "ACPI_" for
clarity.

Completed additional code restructuring to allow more modular
linking for iASL compiler and AcpiExec.  Several files were split
creating new files.  New files:  nsparse.c dsinit.c evgpe.c

Implemented an abort mechanism to terminate an executing control
method via the AML debugger.  This feature is useful for
debugging
control methods that depend (wait) for specific hardware
responses.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will
vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Fixed a compiler code generation problem for "Interrupt" Resource
Descriptors.  If specified in the ASL, the optional "Resource
Source Index" and "Resource Source" fields were not inserted into
the correct location within the AML resource descriptor, creating
an invalid descriptor.

Fixed a disassembler problem for "Interrupt" resource
descriptors.
The optional "Resource Source Index" and "Resource Source" fields
were ignored.


----------------------------------------
22 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021122.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a reported problem where an object stored to a Method Local
or Arg was not copied to a new object during the store - the
object pointer was simply copied to the Local/Arg.  This caused
all subsequent operations on the Local/Arg to also affect the
original source of the store operation.

Fixed a problem where a store operation to a Method Local or Arg
was not completed properly if the Local/Arg contained a reference
(from RefOf) to a named field.  The general-purpose store-to-
namespace-node code is now used so that this case is handled
automatically.

Fixed a problem where the internal object copy routine would
cause
a protection fault if the object being copied was a Package and
contained either 1) a NULL package element or 2) a nested sub-
package.

Fixed a problem with the GPE initialization that resulted from an
ambiguity in the ACPI specification.  One section of the
specification states that both the address and length of the GPE
block must be zero if the block is not supported.  Another
section
implies that only the address need be zero if the block is not
supported.  The code has been changed so that both the address
and
the length must be non-zero to indicate a valid GPE block (i.e.,
if either the address or the length is zero, the GPE block is
invalid.)

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will
vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

Cleaned up EC driver. Exported an external EC read/write
interface. By going through this, other drivers (most notably
sonypi) will be able to serialize access to the EC.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Implemented support to optionally generate include files for both
ASM and C (the -i switch).  This simplifies BIOS development by
automatically creating include files that contain external
declarations for the symbols that are created within the
(optionally generated) ASM and C AML source files.


----------------------------------------
15 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021115.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a memory leak problem where an error during resolution of
method arguments during a method invocation from another method
failed to cleanup properly by deleting all successfully resolved
argument objects.

Fixed a problem where the target of the Index() operator was not
correctly constructed if the source object was a package.  This
problem has not been detected because the use of a target operand
with Index() is very rare.

Fixed a problem with the Index() operator where an attempt was
made to delete the operand objects twice.

Fixed a problem where an attempt was made to delete an operand
twice during execution of the CondRefOf() operator if the target
did not exist.

Implemented the first of perhaps several internal create object
functions that create and initialize a specific object type.
This
consolidates duplicated code wherever the object is created, thus
shrinking the size of the subsystem.

Implemented improved debug/error messages for errors that occur
during nested method invocations.  All executing method pathnames
are displayed (with the error) as the call stack is unwound -
thus
simplifying debug.

Fixed a problem introduced in the 10/02 release that caused
premature deletion of a buffer object if a buffer was used as an
ASL operand where an integer operand is required (Thus causing an
implicit object conversion from Buffer to Integer.)  The change
in
the 10/02 release was attempting to fix a memory leak (albeit
incorrectly.)

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will
vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     152.7K Code,  63.2K Data,  215.5K Total


2) Linux

Changed the implementation of the ACPI semaphores to use down()
instead of down_interruptable().  It is important that the
execution of ACPI control methods not be interrupted by signals.
Methods must run to completion, or the system may be left in an
unknown/unstable state.

Fixed a compilation error when CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is not
set.
(Shawn Starr)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler


Changed the default location of output files.  All output files
are now placed in the current directory by default instead of in
the directory of the source file.  This change may affect some
existing makefiles, but it brings the behavior of the compiler in
line with other similar tools.  The location of the output files
can be overridden with the -p command line switch.


----------------------------------------
11 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021111.


0) ACPI Specification 2.0B is released and is now available at:
http://www.acpi.info/index.html


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for the ACPI 2.0 SMBus Operation Regions.
This includes the early detection and handoff of the request to
the SMBus region handler (avoiding all of the complex field
support code), and support for the bidirectional return packet
from an SMBus write operation.  This paves the way for the
development of SMBus drivers in each host operating system.

Fixed a problem where the semaphore WAIT_FOREVER constant was
defined as 32 bits, but must be 16 bits according to the ACPI
specification.  This had the side effect of causing ASL
Mutex/Event timeouts even though the ASL code requested a wait
forever.  Changed all internal references to the ACPI timeout
parameter to 16 bits to prevent future problems.  Changed the
name
of WAIT_FOREVER to ACPI_WAIT_FOREVER.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug

2) Linux

Module loading/unloading fixes (John Cagle)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Added support for the SMBBlockProcessCall keyword (ACPI 2.0)

Implemented support for the disassembly of all SMBus protocol
keywords (SMBQuick, SMBWord, etc.)

----------------------------------------
01 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021101.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where platforms that have a GPE1 block but no
GPE0
block were not handled correctly.  This resulted in a "GPE
overlap" error message.  GPE0 is no longer required.

Removed code added in the previous release that inserted nodes
into the namespace in alphabetical order.  This caused some side-
effects on various machines.  The root cause of the problem is
still under investigation since in theory, the internal ordering
of the namespace nodes should not matter.


Enhanced error reporting for the case where a named object is not
found during control method execution.  The full ACPI namepath
(name reference) of the object that was not found is displayed in
this case.

Note: as a result of the overhaul of the namespace object types
in
the previous release, the namespace nodes for the predefined
scopes (_TZ, _PR, etc.) are now of the type ACPI_TYPE_LOCAL_SCOPE
instead of ACPI_TYPE_ANY.  This simplifies the namespace
management code but may affect code that walks the namespace tree
looking for specific object types.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug

2) Linux

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous release where the
Processor and Thermal objects were not recognized and installed
in
/proc.  This was related to the scope type change described
above.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Implemented the -g option to get all of the required ACPI tables
from the registry and save them to files (Windows version of the
compiler only.)  The required tables are the FADT, FACS, and
DSDT.

Added ACPI table checksum validation during table disassembly in
order to catch corrupted tables.


----------------------------------------
22 October 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021022.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented a restriction on the Scope operator that the target
must already exist in the namespace at the time the operator is
encountered (during table load or method execution).  In other
words, forward references are not allowed and Scope() cannot
create a new object. This changes the previous behavior where the
interpreter would create the name if not found.  This new
behavior
correctly enables the search-to-root algorithm during namespace
lookup of the target name.  Because of this upsearch, this fixes
the known Compaq _SB_.OKEC problem and makes both the AML
interpreter and iASL compiler compatible with other ACPI
implementations.

Completed a major overhaul of the internal ACPI object types for
the ACPI Namespace and the associated operand objects.  Many of
these types had become obsolete with the introduction of the two-
pass namespace load.  This cleanup simplifies the code and makes
the entire namespace load mechanism much clearer and easier to
understand.

Improved debug output for tracking scope opening/closing to help
diagnose scoping issues.  The old scope name as well as the new
scope name are displayed.  Also improved error messages for
problems with ASL Mutex objects and error messages for GPE
problems.

Cleaned up the namespace dump code, removed obsolete code.

All string output (for all namespace/object dumps) now uses the
common ACPI string output procedure which handles escapes
properly
and does not emit non-printable characters.

Fixed some issues with constants in the 64-bit version of the
local C library (utclib.c)


2) Linux

EC Driver:  No longer attempts to acquire the Global Lock at
interrupt level.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Implemented ACPI 2.0B grammar change that disallows all Type 1
and
2 opcodes outside of a control method.  This means that the
"executable" operators (versus the "namespace" operators) cannot
be used at the table level; they can only be used within a
control
method.

Implemented the restriction on the Scope() operator where the
target must already exist in the namespace at the time the
operator is encountered (during ASL compilation). In other words,
forward references are not allowed and Scope() cannot create a
new
object.  This makes the iASL compiler compatible with other ACPI
implementations and makes the Scope() implementation adhere to
the
ACPI specification.

Fixed a problem where namepath optimization for the Alias
operator
was optimizing the wrong path (of the two namepaths.)  This
caused
a "Missing alias link" error message.

Fixed a problem where an "unknown reserved name" warning could be
incorrectly generated for names like "_SB" when the trailing
underscore is not used in the original ASL.

Fixed a problem where the reserved name check did not handle
NamePaths with multiple NameSegs correctly.  The first nameseg of
the NamePath was examined instead of the last NameSeg.


----------------------------------------

02 October 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem version 20021002:

Fixed a problem where a store/copy of a string to an existing
string did not always set the string length properly in the
String
object.

Fixed a reported problem with the ToString operator where the
behavior was identical to the ToHexString operator instead of
just
simply converting a raw buffer to a string data type.

Fixed a problem where CopyObject and the other "explicit"
conversion operators were not updating the internal namespace
node
type as part of the store operation.

Fixed a memory leak during implicit source operand conversion
where the original object was not deleted if it was converted to
a
new object of a different type.

Enhanced error messages for all problems associated with
namespace
lookups.  Common procedure generates and prints the lookup name
as
well as the formatted status.

Completed implementation of a new design for the Alias support
within the namespace.  The existing design did not handle the
case
where a new object was assigned to one of the two names due to
the
use of an explicit conversion operator, resulting in the two
names
pointing to two different objects.  The new design simply points
the Alias name to the original name node - not to the object.
This results in a level of indirection that must be handled in
the
name resolution mechanism.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

Clarified some warning/error messages.


----------------------------------------
18 September 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem version 20020918:

Fixed a reported problem with reference chaining (via the Index()
and RefOf() operators) in the ObjectType() and SizeOf()
operators.
The definition of these operators includes the dereferencing of
all chained references to return information on the base object.

Fixed a problem with stores to indexed package elements - the
existing code would not complete the store if an "implicit
conversion" was not performed.  In other words, if the existing
object (package element) was to be replaced completely, the code
didn't handle this case.

Relaxed typechecking on the ASL "Scope" operator to allow the
target name to refer to an object of type Integer, String, or
Buffer, in addition to the scoping object types (Device,
predefined Scopes, Processor, PowerResource, and ThermalZone.)
This allows existing AML code that has workarounds for a bug in
Windows to function properly.  A warning is issued, however.
This
affects both the AML interpreter and the iASL compiler. Below is
an example of this type of ASL code:

      Name(DEB,0x00)
      Scope(DEB)
      {

Fixed some reported problems with 64-bit integer support in the
local implementation of C library functions (clib.c)


2) Linux

Use ACPI fix map region instead of IOAPIC region, since it is
undefined in non-SMP.

Ensure that the SCI has the proper polarity and trigger, even on
systems that do not have an interrupt override entry in the MADT.

2.5 big driver reorganization (Pat Mochel)

Use early table mapping code from acpitable.c (Andi Kleen)

New blacklist entries (Andi Kleen)

Blacklist improvements. Split blacklist code out into a separate
file. Move checking the blacklist to very early. Previously, we
would use ACPI tables, and then halfway through init, check the
blacklist -- too late. Now, it's early enough to completely fall-
back to non-ACPI.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler version 20020918:

Fixed a problem where the typechecking code didn't know that an
alias could point to a method.  In other words, aliases were not
being dereferenced during typechecking.


----------------------------------------
29 August 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020829:

If the target of a Scope() operator already exists, it must be an
object type that actually opens a scope -- such as a Device,
Method, Scope, etc.  This is a fatal runtime error.  Similar
error
check has been added to the iASL compiler also.

Tightened up the namespace load to disallow multiple names in the
same scope.  This previously was allowed if both objects were of
the same type.  (i.e., a lookup was the same as entering a new
name).


2) Linux

Ensure that the ACPI interrupt has the proper trigger and
polarity.

local_irq_disable is extraneous. (Matthew Wilcox)

Make "acpi=off" actually do what it says, and not use the ACPI
interpreter *or* the tables.

Added arch-neutral support for parsing SLIT and SRAT tables
(Kochi
Takayoshi)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler  Version 20020829:

Implemented namepath optimization for name declarations.  For
example, a declaration like "Method (\_SB_.ABCD)" would get
optimized to "Method (ABCD)" if the declaration is within the
\_SB_ scope.  This optimization is in addition to the named
reference path optimization first released in the previous
version. This would seem to complete all possible optimizations
for namepaths within the ASL/AML.

If the target of a Scope() operator already exists, it must be an
object type that actually opens a scope -- such as a Device,
Method, Scope, etc.

Implemented a check and warning for unreachable code in the same
block below a Return() statement.

Fixed a problem where the listing file was not generated if the
compiler aborted if the maximum error count was exceeded (200).

Fixed a problem where the typechecking of method return values
was
broken.  This includes the check for a return value when the
method is invoked as a TermArg (a return value is expected.)

Fixed a reported problem where EOF conditions during a quoted
string or comment caused a fault.


----------------------------------------
15 August 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020815:

Fixed a reported problem where a Store to a method argument that
contains a reference did not perform the indirect store
correctly.
This problem was created during the conversion to the new
reference object model - the indirect store to a method argument
code was not updated to reflect the new model.

Reworked the ACPI mode change code to better conform to ACPI 2.0,
handle corner cases, and improve code legibility (Kochi
Takayoshi)

Fixed a problem with the pathname parsing for the carat (^)
prefix.  The heavy use of the carat operator by the new namepath
optimization in the iASL compiler uncovered a problem with the
AML
interpreter handling of this prefix.  In the case where one or
more carats precede a single nameseg, the nameseg was treated as
standalone and the search rule (to root) was inadvertently
applied.  This could cause both the iASL compiler and the
interpreter to find the wrong object or to miss the error that
should occur if the object does not exist at that exact pathname.

Found and fixed the problem where the HP Pavilion DSDT would not
load.  This was a relatively minor tweak to the table loading
code
(a problem caused by the unexpected encounter with a method
invocation not within a control method), but it does not solve
the
overall issue of the execution of AML code at the table level.
This investigation is still ongoing.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

Remove redundant slab.h include (Brad Hards)

Fix several bugs in thermal.c (Herbert Nachtnebel)

Make CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT work properly (Pavel Machek)

Change acpi_system_suspend to use updated irq functions (Pavel
Machek)

Export acpi_get_firmware_table (Matthew Wilcox)

Use proper root proc entry for ACPI (Kochi Takayoshi)

Fix early-boot table parsing (Bjorn Helgaas)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Reworked the compiler options to make them more consistent and to
use two-letter options where appropriate.  We were running out of
sensible letters.   This may break some makefiles, so check the
current options list by invoking the compiler with no parameters.

Completed the design and implementation of the ASL namepath
optimization option for the compiler.  This option optimizes all
references to named objects to the shortest possible path.  The
first attempt tries to utilize a single nameseg (4 characters)
and
the "search-to-root" algorithm used by the interpreter.  If that
cannot be used (because either the name is not in the search path
or there is a conflict with another object with the same name),
the pathname is optimized using the carat prefix (usually a
shorter string than specifying the entire path from the root.)

Implemented support to obtain the DSDT from the Windows registry
(when the disassembly option is specified with no input file).
Added this code as the implementation for AcpiOsTableOverride in
the Windows OSL.  Migrated the 16-bit code (used in the AcpiDump
utility) to scan memory for the DSDT to the AcpiOsTableOverride
function in the DOS OSL to make the disassembler truly OS
independent.

Implemented a new option to disassemble and compile in one step.
When used without an input filename, this option will grab the
DSDT from the local machine, disassemble it, and compile it in
one
step.

Added a warning message for invalid escapes (a backslash followed
by any character other than the allowable escapes).  This catches
the quoted string error "\_SB_" (which should be "\\_SB_" ).
Also, there are numerous instances in the ACPI specification
where
this error occurs.

Added a compiler option to disable all optimizations.  This is
basically the "compatibility mode" because by using this option,
the AML code will come out exactly the same as other ASL
compilers.

Added error messages for incorrectly ordered dependent resource
functions.  This includes: missing EndDependentFn macro at end of
dependent resource list, nested dependent function macros (both
start and end), and missing StartDependentFn macro.  These are
common errors that should be caught at compile time.

Implemented _OSI support for the disassembler and compiler.  _OSI
must be included in the namespace for proper disassembly (because
the disassembler must know the number of arguments.)

Added an "optimization" message type that is optional (off by
default).  This message is used for all optimizations - including
constant folding, integer optimization, and namepath
optimization.

----------------------------------------
25 July 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020725:

The AML Disassembler has been enhanced to produce compilable ASL
code and has been integrated into the iASL compiler (see below)
as
well as the single-step disassembly for the AML debugger and the
disassembler for the AcpiDump utility.  All ACPI 2.0A opcodes,
resource templates and macros are fully supported.  The
disassembler has been tested on over 30 different AML files,
producing identical AML when the resulting disassembled ASL file
is recompiled with the same ASL compiler.

Modified the Resource Manager to allow zero interrupts and zero
dma channels during the GetCurrentResources call.  This was
causing problems on some platforms.

Added the AcpiOsRedirectOutput interface to the OSL to simplify
output redirection for the AcpiOsPrintf and AcpiOsVprintf
interfaces.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     142.9K Code,  58.7K Data,  201.6K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  69.1K Code,   8.2K Data,   77.3K Total
    Debug Version:     149.4K Code,  61.6K Data,  211.0K Total


2) Linux

Fixed a panic in the EC driver (Dominik Brodowski)

Implemented checksum of the R/XSDT itself during Linux table scan
(Richard Schaal)


3) iASL compiler

The AML disassembler is integrated into the compiler.  The "-d"
option invokes the disassembler  to completely disassemble an
input AML file, producing as output a text ASL file with the
extension ".dsl" (to avoid name collisions with existing .asl
source files.)  A future enhancement will allow the disassembler
to obtain the BIOS DSDT from the registry under Windows.

Fixed a problem with the VendorShort and VendorLong resource
descriptors where an invalid AML sequence was created.

Implemented a fix for BufferData term in the ASL parser.  It was
inadvertently defined twice, allowing invalid syntax to pass and
causing reduction conflicts.

Fixed a problem where the Ones opcode could get converted to a
value of zero if "Ones" was used where a byte, word or dword
value
was expected.  The 64-bit value is now truncated to the correct
size with the correct value.


----------------------------------------
02 July 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020702:

The Table Manager code has been restructured to add several new
features.  Tables that are not required by the core subsystem
(other than the FADT, DSDT, FACS, PSDTs, etc.) are no longer
validated in any way and are returned from AcpiGetFirmwareTable
if
requested.  The AcpiOsTableOverride interface is now called for
each table that is loaded by the subsystem in order to allow the
host to override any table it chooses.  Previously, only the DSDT
could be overridden.  Added one new files, tbrsdt.c and
tbgetall.c.

Fixed a problem with the conversion of internal package objects
to
external objects (when a package is returned from a control
method.)  The return buffer length was set to zero instead of the
proper length of the package object.

Fixed a reported problem with the use of the RefOf and DeRefOf
operators when passing reference arguments to control methods.  A
new type of Reference object is used internally for references
produced by the RefOf operator.

Added additional error messages in the Resource Manager to
explain
AE_BAD_DATA errors when they occur during resource parsing.

Split the AcpiEnableSubsystem into two primitives to enable a
finer granularity initialization sequence.  These two calls
should
be called in this order: AcpiEnableSubsystem (flags),
AcpiInitializeObjects (flags).  The flags parameter remains the
same.


2) Linux

Updated the ACPI utilities module to understand the new style of
fully resolved package objects that are now returned from the
core
subsystem.  This eliminates errors of the form:

    ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0.PPB_._PRT]
    acpi_utils-0430 [145] acpi_evaluate_reference:
        Invalid element in package (not a device reference)

The method evaluation utility uses the new buffer allocation
scheme instead of calling AcpiEvaluate Object twice.

Added support for ECDT. This allows the use of the Embedded
Controller before the namespace has been fully initialized, which
is necessary for ACPI 2.0 support, and for some laptops to
initialize properly. (Laptops using ECDT are still rare, so only
limited testing was performed of the added functionality.)

Fixed memory leaks in the EC driver.

Eliminated a brittle code structure in acpi_bus_init().

Eliminated the acpi_evaluate() helper function in utils.c. It is
no longer needed since acpi_evaluate_object can optionally
allocate memory for the return object.

Implemented fix for keyboard hang when getting battery readings
on
some systems (Stephen White)

PCI IRQ routing update (Dominik Brodowski)

Fix an ifdef to allow compilation on UP with LAPIC but no IOAPIC
support

----------------------------------------
11 June 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020611:

Fixed a reported problem where constants such as Zero and One
appearing within _PRT packages were not handled correctly within
the resource manager code.  Originally reported against the ASL
compiler because the code generator now optimizes integers to
their minimal AML representation (i.e. AML constants if
possible.)
The _PRT code now handles all AML constant opcodes correctly
(Zero, One, Ones, Revision).

Fixed a problem with the Concatenate operator in the AML
interpreter where a buffer result object was incorrectly marked
as
not fully evaluated, causing a run-time error of AE_AML_INTERNAL.

All package sub-objects are now fully resolved before they are
returned from the external ACPI interfaces.  This means that name
strings are resolved to object handles, and constant operators
(Zero, One, Ones, Revision) are resolved to Integers.

Implemented immediate resolution of the AML Constant opcodes
(Zero, One, Ones, Revision) to Integer objects upon detection
within the AML stream. This has simplified and reduced the
generated code size of the subsystem by eliminating about 10
switch statements for these constants (which previously were
contained in Reference objects.)  The complicating issues are
that
the Zero opcode is used as a "placeholder" for unspecified
optional target operands and stores to constants are defined to
be
no-ops.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below. These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

Added preliminary support for obtaining _TRA data for PCI root
bridges (Bjorn Helgaas).


3) iASL Compiler Version X2046:

Fixed a problem where the "_DDN" reserved name was defined to be
a
control method with one argument.  There are no arguments, and
_DDN does not have to be a control method.

Fixed a problem with the Linux version of the compiler where the
source lines printed with error messages were the wrong lines.
This turned out to be the "LF versus CR/LF" difference between
Windows and Unix.  This appears to be the longstanding issue
concerning listing output and error messages.

Fixed a problem with the Linux version of compiler where opcode
names within error messages were wrong.  This was caused by a
slight difference in the output of the Flex tool on Linux versus
Windows.

Fixed a problem with the Linux compiler where the hex output
files
contained some garbage data caused by an internal buffer overrun.


----------------------------------------
17 May 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020517:

Implemented a workaround to an BIOS bug discovered on the HP
OmniBook where the FADT revision number and the table size are
inconsistent (ACPI 2.0 revision vs. ACPI 1.0 table size).  The
new
behavior is to fallback to using only the ACPI 1.0 fields of the
FADT if the table is too small to be a ACPI 2.0 table as claimed
by the revision number.  Although this is a BIOS bug, this is a
case where the workaround is simple enough and with no side
effects, so it seemed prudent to add it.  A warning message is
issued, however.

Implemented minimum size checks for the fixed-length ACPI tables
-
- the FADT and FACS, as well as consistency checks between the
revision number and the table size.

Fixed a reported problem in the table override support where the
new table pointer was incorrectly treated as a physical address
instead of a logical address.

Eliminated the use of the AE_AML_ERROR exception and replaced it
with more descriptive codes.

Fixed a problem where an exception would occur if an ASL Field
was
defined with no named Field Units underneath it (used by some
index fields).

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

Much work done on ACPI init (MADT and PCI IRQ routing support).
(Paul D. and Dominik Brodowski)

Fix PCI IRQ-related panic on boot (Sam Revitch)

Set BM_ARB_DIS when entering a sleep state (Ducrot Bruno)

Fix "MHz" typo (Dominik Brodowski)

Fix RTC year 2000 issue (Dominik Brodowski)

Preclude multiple button proc entries (Eric Brunet)

Moved arch-specific code out of include/platform/aclinux.h

3) iASL Compiler Version X2044:

Implemented error checking for the string used in the EISAID
macro
(Usually used in the definition of the _HID object.)  The code
now
strictly enforces the PnP format - exactly 7 characters, 3
uppercase letters and 4 hex digits.

If a raw string is used in the definition of the _HID object
(instead of the EISAID macro), the string must contain all
alphanumeric characters (e.g., "*PNP0011" is not allowed because
of the asterisk.)

Implemented checking for invalid use of ACPI reserved names for
most of the name creation operators (Name, Device, Event, Mutex,
OperationRegion, PowerResource, Processor, and ThermalZone.)
Previously, this check was only performed for control methods.

Implemented an additional check on the Name operator to emit an
error if a reserved name that must be implemented in ASL as a
control method is used.  We know that a reserved name must be a
method if it is defined with input arguments.

The warning emitted when a namespace object reference is not
found
during the cross reference phase has been changed into an error.
The "External" directive should be used for names defined in
other
modules.


4) Tools and Utilities

The 16-bit tools (adump16 and aexec16) have been regenerated and
tested.

Fixed a problem with the output of both acpidump and adump16
where
the indentation of closing parentheses and brackets was not
aligned properly with the parent block.


----------------------------------------
03 May 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020503:

Added support a new OSL interface that allows the host operating
system software to override the DSDT found in the firmware -
AcpiOsTableOverride.  With this interface, the OSL can examine
the
version of the firmware DSDT and replace it with a different one
if desired.

Added new external interfaces for accessing ACPI registers from
device drivers and other system software - AcpiGetRegister and
AcpiSetRegister.  This was simply an externalization of the
existing AcpiHwBitRegister interfaces.

Fixed a regression introduced in the previous build where the
ASL/AML CreateField operator always returned an error,
"destination must be a NS Node".

Extended the maximum time (before failure) to successfully enable
ACPI mode to 3 seconds.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

Enhanced ACPI init code for SMP. We are now fully MPS and $PIR-
free. While 3 out of 4 of our in-house systems work fine, the
last
one still hangs when testing the LAPIC timer.

Renamed many files in 2.5 kernel release to omit "acpi_" from the
name.

Added warning on boot for Presario 711FR.

Sleep improvements (Pavel Machek)

ACPI can now be built without CONFIG_PCI enabled.

IA64: Fixed memory map functions (JI Lee)


3) iASL Compiler Version X2043:

Added support to allow the compiler to be integrated into the MS
VC++ development environment for one-button compilation of single
files or entire projects -- with error-to-source-line mapping.

Implemented support for compile-time constant folding for the
Type3, Type4, and Type5 opcodes first defined in the ACPI 2.0
specification.  This allows the ASL writer to use expressions
instead of Integer/Buffer/String constants in terms that must
evaluate to constants at compile time and will also simplify the
emitted AML in any such sub-expressions that can be folded
(evaluated at compile-time.)  This increases the size of the
compiler significantly because a portion of the ACPI CA AML
interpreter is included within the compiler in order to pre-
evaluate constant expressions.


Fixed a problem with the "Unicode" ASL macro that caused the
compiler to fault.  (This macro is used in conjunction with the
_STR reserved name.)

Implemented an AML opcode optimization to use the Zero, One, and
Ones opcodes where possible to further reduce the size of integer
constants and thus reduce the overall size of the generated AML
code.

Implemented error checking for new reserved terms for ACPI
version
2.0A.

Implemented the -qr option to display the current list of ACPI
reserved names known to the compiler.

Implemented the -qc option to display the current list of ASL
operators that are allowed within constant expressions and can
therefore be folded at compile time if the operands are
constants.


4) Documentation

Updated the Programmer's Reference for new interfaces, data
types,
and memory allocation model options.

Updated the iASL Compiler User Reference to apply new format and
add information about new features and options.

----------------------------------------
19 April 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020419:

The source code base for the Core Subsystem has been completely
cleaned with PC-lint (FlexLint) for both 32-bit and 64-bit
versions.  The Lint option files used are included in the
/acpi/generate/lint directory.

Implemented enhanced status/error checking across the entire
Hardware manager subsystem.  Any hardware errors (reported from
the OSL) are now bubbled up and will abort a running control
method.

Fixed a problem where the per-ACPI-table integer width (32 or 64)
was stored only with control method nodes, causing a fault when
non-control method code was executed during table loading.  The
solution implemented uses a global variable to indicate table
width across the entire ACPI subsystem.  Therefore, ACPI CA does
not support mixed integer widths across different ACPI tables
(DSDT, SSDT).

Fixed a problem where NULL extended fields (X fields) in an ACPI
2.0 ACPI FADT caused the table load to fail.  Although the
existing ACPI specification is a bit fuzzy on this topic, the new
behavior is to fall back on a ACPI 1.0 field if the corresponding
ACPI 2.0 X field is zero (even though the table revision
indicates
a full ACPI 2.0 table.)  The ACPI specification will be updated
to
clarify this issue.

Fixed a problem with the SystemMemory operation region handler
where memory was always accessed byte-wise even if the AML-
specified access width was larger than a byte.  This caused
problems on systems with memory-mapped I/O.  Memory is now
accessed with the width specified.  On systems that do not
support
non-aligned transfers, a check is made to guarantee proper
address
alignment before proceeding in order to avoid an AML-caused
alignment fault within the kernel.


Fixed a problem with the ExtendedIrq resource where only one byte
of the 4-byte Irq field was extracted.

Fixed the AcpiExDigitsNeeded() procedure to support _UID.  This
function was out of date and required a rewrite.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

PCI IRQ routing fixes (Dominik Brodowski)


3) iASL Compiler Version X2042:

Implemented an additional compile-time error check for a field
unit whose size + minimum access width would cause a run-time
access beyond the end-of-region.  Previously, only the field size
itself was checked.

The Core subsystem and iASL compiler now share a common parse
object in preparation for compile-time evaluation of the type
3/4/5 ASL operators.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 03_29_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020329:

Implemented support for late evaluation of TermArg operands to
Buffer and Package objects.  This allows complex expressions to
be
used in the declarations of these object types.

Fixed an ACPI 1.0 compatibility issue when reading Fields. In
ACPI
1.0, if the field was larger than 32 bits, it was returned as a
buffer - otherwise it was returned as an integer.  In ACPI 2.0,
the field is returned as a buffer only if the field is larger
than
64 bits.  The TableRevision is now considered when making this
conversion to avoid incompatibility with existing ASL code.

Implemented logical addressing for AcpiOsGetRootPointer.  This
allows an RSDP with either a logical or physical address.  With
this support, the host OS can now override all ACPI tables with
one logical RSDP.  Includes implementation of  "typed" pointer
support to allow a common data type for both physical and logical
pointers internally.  This required a change to the
AcpiOsGetRootPointer interface.

Implemented the use of ACPI 2.0 Generic Address Structures for
all
GPE, Fixed Event, and PM Timer I/O.  This allows the use of
memory
mapped I/O for these ACPI features.

Initialization now ignores not only non-required tables (All
tables other than the FADT, FACS, DSDT, and SSDTs), but also does
not validate the table headers of unrecognized tables.

Fixed a problem where a notify handler could only be
installed/removed on an object of type Device.  All "notify"
objects are now supported -- Devices, Processor, Power, and
Thermal.

Removed most verbosity from the ACPI_DB_INFO debug level.  Only
critical information is returned when this debug level is
enabled.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

  Previous Release
    Non-Debug Version:  65.4K Code,   6.2K Data,   71.6K Total
    Debug Version:     138.0K Code,  56.6K Data,  194.6K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  66.6K Code,   6.5K Data,   73.1K Total
    Debug Version:     139.8K Code,  57.4K Data,  197.2K Total


2) Linux:

The processor driver (acpi_processor.c) now fully supports ACPI
2.0-based processor performance control (e.g. Intel(R)
SpeedStep(TM) technology) Note that older laptops that only have
the Intel "applet" interface are not supported through this.  The
'limit' and 'performance' interface (/proc) are fully functional.
[Note that basic policy for controlling performance state
transitions will be included in the next version of ospmd.]  The
idle handler was modified to more aggressively use C2, and PIIX4
errata handling underwent a complete overhaul (big thanks to
Dominik Brodowski).

Added support for ACPI-PCI device binding (acpi_pci_root.c). _ADR-
based devices in the ACPI namespace are now dynamically bound
(associated) with their PCI counterparts (e.g. PCI1->01:00.0).
This allows, among other things, ACPI to resolve bus numbers for
subordinate PCI bridges.

Enhanced PCI IRQ routing to get the proper bus number for _PRT
entries defined underneath PCI bridges.

Added IBM 600E to bad bios list due to invalid _ADR value for
PIIX4 PCI-ISA bridge, resulting in improper PCI IRQ routing.

In the process of adding full MADT support (e.g. IOAPIC) for IA32
(acpi.c, mpparse.c) -- stay tuned.

Added back visual differentiation between fixed-feature and
control-method buttons in dmesg.  Buttons are also subtyped (e.g.
button/power/PWRF) to simplify button identification.

We no longer use -Wno-unused when compiling debug. Please ignore
any "_THIS_MODULE defined but not used" messages.

Can now shut down the system using "magic sysrq" key.


3) iASL Compiler version 2041:

Fixed a problem where conversion errors for hex/octal/decimal
constants were not reported.

Implemented a fix for the General Register template Address
field.
This field was 8 bits when it should be 64.

Fixed a problem where errors/warnings were no longer being
emitted
within the listing output file.

Implemented the ACPI 2.0A restriction on ACPI Table Signatures to
exactly 4 characters, alphanumeric only.




----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 03_08_02


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020308:

Fixed a problem with AML Fields where the use of the "AccessAny"
keyword could cause an interpreter error due to attempting to
read
or write beyond the end of the parent Operation Region.

Fixed a problem in the SystemMemory Operation Region handler
where
an attempt was made to map memory beyond the end of the region.
This was the root cause of the "AE_ERROR" and "AE_NO_MEMORY"
errors on some Linux systems.

Fixed a problem where the interpreter/namespace "search to root"
algorithm was not functioning for some object types.  Relaxed the
internal restriction on the search to allow upsearches for all
external object types as well as most internal types.


2) Linux:

We now use safe_halt() macro versus individual calls to sti |
hlt.

Writing to the processor limit interface should now work. "echo
1"
will increase the limit, 2 will decrease, and 0 will reset to the
default.


3) ASL compiler:

Fixed segfault on Linux version.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 02_25_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:


Fixed a problem where the GPE bit masks were not initialized
properly, causing erratic GPE behavior.

Implemented limited support for multiple calling conventions.
The
code can be generated with either the VPL (variable parameter
list, or "C") convention, or the FPL (fixed parameter list, or
"Pascal") convention.  The core subsystem is about 3.4% smaller
when generated with FPL.


2) Linux

Re-add some /proc/acpi/event functionality that was lost during
the rewrite

Resolved issue with /proc events for fixed-feature buttons
showing
up as the system device.

Fixed checks on C2/C3 latencies to be inclusive of maximum
values.

Replaced AE_ERRORs in acpi_osl.c with more specific error codes.

Changed ACPI PRT option from "pci=noacpi-routing" to "pci=noacpi"

Fixed limit interface & usage to fix bugs with passive cooling
hysterisis.

Restructured PRT support.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_14_02


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support in AcpiLoadTable to allow loading of FACS and
FADT tables.

Suport for the now-obsolete interim 0.71 64-bit ACPI tables has
been removed.  All 64-bit platforms should be migrated to the
ACPI
2.0 tables.  The actbl71.h header has been removed from the
source
tree.

All C macros defined within the subsystem have been prefixed with
"ACPI_" to avoid collision with other system include files.

Removed the return value for the two AcpiOsPrint interfaces,
since
it is never used and causes lint warnings for ignoring the return
value.

Added error checking to all internal mutex acquire and release
calls.  Although a failure from one of these interfaces is
probably a fatal system error, these checks will cause the
immediate abort of the currently executing method or interface.

Fixed a problem where the AcpiSetCurrentResources interface could
fault.  This was a side effect of the deployment of the new
memory
allocation model.

Fixed a couple of problems with the Global Lock support
introduced
in the last major build.  The "common" (1.0/2.0) internal FACS
was
being overwritten with the FACS signature and clobbering the
Global Lock pointer.  Also, the actual firmware FACS was being
unmapped after construction of the "common" FACS, preventing
access to the actual Global Lock field within it.  The "common"
internal FACS is no longer installed as an actual ACPI table; it
is used simply as a global.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

    Non-Debug Version:  65.2K Code,   6.2K Data,   71.4K Total
    Debug Version:     136.9K Code,  56.4K Data,  193.3K Total
  Current Release:

    Debug Version:     138.0K Code,  56.6K Data,  194.6K Total


2) Linux

Updated Linux-specific code for core macro and OSL interface
changes described above.

Improved /proc/acpi/event. It now can be opened only once and has
proper poll functionality.

Fixed and restructured power management (acpi_bus).

Only create /proc "view by type" when devices of that class
exist.

Fixed "charging/discharging" bug (and others) in acpi_battery.

Improved thermal zone code.


3) ASL Compiler, version X2039:


Implemented the new compiler restriction on ASL String hex/octal
escapes to non-null, ASCII values.  An error results if an
invalid
value is used.  (This will require an ACPI 2.0 specification
change.)

AML object labels that are output to the optional C and ASM
source
are now prefixed with both the ACPI table signature and table ID
to help guarantee uniqueness within a large BIOS project.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_01_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

ACPI 2.0 support is complete in the entire Core Subsystem and the
ASL compiler. All new ACPI 2.0 operators are implemented and all
other changes for ACPI 2.0 support are complete.  With
simultaneous code and data optimizations throughout the
subsystem,
ACPI 2.0 support has been implemented with almost no additional
cost in terms of code and data size.

Implemented a new mechanism for allocation of return buffers.  If
the buffer length is set to ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER, the buffer will
be allocated on behalf of the caller.  Consolidated all return
buffer validation and allocation to a common procedure.  Return
buffers will be allocated via the primary OSL allocation
interface
since it appears that a separate pool is not needed by most
users.
If a separate pool is required for these buffers, the caller can
still use the original mechanism and pre-allocate the buffer(s).

Implemented support for string operands within the DerefOf
operator.

Restructured the Hardware and Event managers to be table driven,
simplifying the source code and reducing the amount of generated
code.

Split the common read/write low-level ACPI register bitfield
procedure into a separate read and write, simplifying the code
considerably.

Obsoleted the AcpiOsCallocate OSL interface.  This interface was
used only a handful of times and didn't have enough critical mass
for a separate interface.  Replaced with a common calloc
procedure
in the core.

Fixed a reported problem with the GPE number mapping mechanism
that allows GPE1 numbers to be non-contiguous with GPE0.
Reorganized the GPE information and shrunk a large array that was
originally large enough to hold info for all possible GPEs (256)
to simply large enough to hold all GPEs up to the largest GPE
number on the machine.

Fixed a reported problem with resource structure alignment on 64-
bit platforms.

Changed the AcpiEnableEvent and AcpiDisableEvent external
interfaces to not require any flags for the common case of
enabling/disabling a GPE.

Implemented support to allow a "Notify" on a Processor object.

Most TBDs in comments within the source code have been resolved
and eliminated.

Fixed a problem in the interpreter where a standalone parent
prefix (^) was not handled correctly in the interpreter and
debugger.

Removed obsolete and unnecessary GPE save/restore code.

Implemented Field support in the ASL Load operator.  This allows
a
table to be loaded from a named field, in addition to loading a
table directly from an Operation Region.

Implemented timeout and handle support in the external Global
Lock
interfaces.

Fixed a problem in the AcpiDump utility where pathnames were no
longer being generated correctly during the dump of named
objects.

Modified the AML debugger to give a full display of if/while
predicates instead of just one AML opcode at a time.  (The
predicate can have several nested ASL statements.)  The old
method
was confusing during single stepping.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below. These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

2) Linux

 Implemented fix for PIIX reverse throttling errata (Processor
driver)

Added new Limit interface (Processor and Thermal drivers)

New thermal policy (Thermal driver)

Many updates to /proc

Battery "low" event support (Battery driver)

Supports ACPI PCI IRQ routing (PCI Link and PCI root drivers)

IA32 - IA64 initialization unification, no longer experimental

Menuconfig options redesigned

3) ASL Compiler, version X2037:

Implemented several new output features to simplify integration
of
AML code into  firmware: 1) Output the AML in C source code with
labels for each named ASL object.  The    original ASL source
code
is interleaved as C comments. 2) Output the AML in ASM source
code
with labels and interleaved ASL    source. 3) Output the AML in
raw hex table form, in either C or ASM.

Implemented support for optional string parameters to the
LoadTable operator.

Completed support for embedded escape sequences within string
literals.  The compiler now supports all single character escapes
as well as the Octal and Hex escapes.  Note: the insertion of a
null byte into a string literal (via the hex/octal escape) causes
the string to be immediately terminated.  A warning is issued.

Fixed a problem where incorrect AML was generated for the case
where an ASL namepath consists of a single parent prefix (

) with no trailing name segments.

The compiler has been successfully generated with a 64-bit C
compiler.




----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_18_01

1) Linux

Enhanced blacklist with reason and severity fields. Any table's
signature may now be used to identify a blacklisted system.

Call _PIC control method to inform the firmware which interrupt
model the OS is using. Turn on any disabled link devices.

Cleaned up busmgr /proc error handling (Andreas Dilger)

 2) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented ACPI 2.0 semantics for the "Break" operator (Exit
from
while loop)

Completed implementation of the ACPI 2.0 "Continue",
"ConcatenateResTemplate", "DataTableRegion", and "LoadTable"
operators.  All new ACPI 2.0 operators are now implemented in
both
the ASL compiler and the AML interpreter.  The only remaining
ACPI
2.0 task is support for the String data type in the DerefOf
operator.  Fixed a problem with AcquireMutex where the status
code
was lost if the caller had to actually wait for the mutex.

Increased the maximum ASL Field size from 64K bits to 4G bits.

Completed implementation of the external Global Lock interfaces -
-
AcpiAcquireGlobalLock and AcpiReleaseGlobalLock.  The Timeout and
Handler parameters were added.

Completed another pass at removing warnings and issues when
compiling with 64-bit compilers.  The code now compiles cleanly
with the Intel 64-bit C/C++ compiler.  Most notably, the pointer
add and subtract (diff) macros have changed considerably.

Created and deployed a new ACPI_SIZE type that is 64-bits wide on
64-bit platforms, 32-bits on all others.  This type is used
wherever memory allocation and/or the C sizeof() operator is
used,
and affects the OSL memory allocation interfaces AcpiOsAllocate
and AcpiOsCallocate.

Implemented sticky user breakpoints in the AML debugger.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below. These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size. Note that these values will vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

 3) ASL Compiler, version X2034:

Now checks for (and generates an error if detected) the use of a
Break or Continue statement without an enclosing While statement.

Successfully generated the compiler with the Intel 64-bit C
compiler.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_05_01

 1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The ACPI 2.0 CopyObject operator is fully implemented.  This
operator creates a new copy of an object (and is also used to
bypass the "implicit conversion" mechanism of the Store
operator.)

The ACPI 2.0 semantics for the SizeOf operator are fully
implemented.  The change is that performing a SizeOf on a
reference object causes an automatic dereference of the object to
tha actual value before the size is evaluated. This behavior was
undefined in ACPI 1.0.

The ACPI 2.0 semantics for the Extended IRQ resource descriptor
have been implemented.  The interrupt polarity and mode are now
independently set.

Fixed a problem where ASL Constants (Zero, One, Ones, Revision)
appearing in Package objects were not properly converted to
integers when the internal Package was converted to an external
object (via the AcpiEvaluateObject interface.)

Fixed a problem with the namespace object deletion mechanism for
objects created by control methods.  There were two parts to this
problem: 1) Objects created during the initialization phase
method
parse were not being deleted, and 2) The object owner ID
mechanism
to track objects was broken.

Fixed a problem where the use of the ASL Scope operator within a
control method would result in an invalid opcode exception.

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where the buffer
length required for the _PRT structure was not being returned
correctly.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown
below. These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism and
has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values will
vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

     Debug Version:     136.2K Code,  55.6K Data,  191.8K Total

 2) Linux:

Updated all files to apply cleanly against 2.4.16.

Added basic PCI Interrupt Routing Table (PRT) support for IA32
(acpi_pci.c), and unified the PRT code for IA32 and IA64.  This
version supports both static and dyanmic PRT entries, but dynamic
entries are treated as if they were static (not yet
reconfigurable).  Architecture- specific code to use this data is
absent on IA32 but should be available shortly.

Changed the initialization sequence to start the ACPI interpreter
(acpi_init) prior to initialization of the PCI driver (pci_init)
in init/main.c.  This ordering is required to support PRT and
facilitate other (future) enhancement.  A side effect is that the
ACPI bus driver and certain device drivers can no longer be
loaded
as modules.

Modified the 'make menuconfig' options to allow PCI Interrupt
Routing support to be included without the ACPI Bus and other
device drivers.

 3) ASL Compiler, version X2033:

Fixed some issues with the use of the new CopyObject and
DataTableRegion operators.  Both are fully functional.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_20_01

 20 November 2001.  Summary of changes for this release.

 1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Updated Index support to match ACPI 2.0 semantics.  Storing a
Integer, String, or Buffer to an Index of a Buffer will store
only
the least-significant byte of the source to the Indexed buffer
byte.  Multiple writes are not performed.

Fixed a problem where the access type used in an AccessAs ASL
operator was not recorded correctly into the field object.

Fixed a problem where ASL Event objects were created in a
signalled state. Events are now created in an unsignalled state.

The internal object cache is now purged after table loading and
initialization to reduce the use of dynamic kernel memory -- on
the assumption that object use is greatest during the parse phase
of the entire table (versus the run-time use of individual
control
methods.)

ACPI 2.0 variable-length packages are now fully operational.

Code and Data Size: Code and Data optimizations have permitted
new
feature development with an actual reduction in the library size.
Current core subsystem library sizes are shown below.  These are
the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do not
include
any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version of the code
includes the debug output trace mechanism and has a larger code
and data size.  Note that these values will vary depending on the
efficiency of the compiler and the compiler options used during
generation.

     Debug Version:     135.1K Code,  55.4K Data,  190.5K Total

 2) Linux:

Enhanced the ACPI boot-time initialization code to allow the use
of Local APIC tables for processor enumeration on IA-32, and to
pave the way for a fully MPS-free boot (on SMP systems) in the
near future.  This functionality replaces
arch/i386/kernel/acpitables.c, which was introduced in an earlier
2.4.15-preX release.  To enable this feature you must add
"acpi_boot=on" to the kernel command line -- see the help entry
for CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT for more information.  An IA-64 release is
in
the works...

Restructured the configuration options to allow boot-time table
parsing support without inclusion of the ACPI Interpreter (and
other) code.

NOTE: This release does not include fixes for the reported
events,
power-down, and thermal passive cooling issues (coming soon).

 3) ASL Compiler:

Added additional typechecking for Fields within restricted access
Operation Regions.  All fields within EC and CMOS regions must be
declared with ByteAcc. All fields withing SMBus regions must be
declared with the BufferAcc access type.

Fixed a problem where the listing file output of control methods
no longer interleaved the actual AML code with the ASL source
code.



----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_09_01

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented ACPI 2.0-defined support for writes to fields with a
Buffer, String, or Integer source operand that is smaller than
the
target field. In these cases, the source operand is zero-extended
to fill the target field.

Fixed a problem where a Field starting bit offset (within the
parent operation region) was calculated incorrectly if the
alignment of the field differed from the access width.  This
affected CreateWordField, CreateDwordField, CreateQwordField, and
possibly other fields that use the "AccessAny" keyword.

Fixed a problem introduced in the 11_02_01 release where indirect
stores through method arguments did not operate correctly.

2) Linux:

Implemented boot-time ACPI table parsing support
(CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT) for IA32 and IA64 UP/SMP systems.  This code
facilitates the use of ACPI tables (e.g. MADT, SRAT) rather than
legacy BIOS interfaces (e.g. MPS) for the configuration of system
processors, memory, and interrupts during setup_arch().  Note
that
this patch does not include the required architecture-specific
changes required to apply this information -- subsequent patches
will be posted for both IA32 and IA64 to achieve this.

Added low-level sleep support for IA32 platforms, courtesy of Pat
Mochel. This allows IA32 systems to transition to/from various
sleeping states (e.g. S1, S3), although the lack of a centralized
driver model and power-manageable drivers will prevent its
(successful) use on most systems.

Revamped the ACPI 'menuconfig' layout: created new "ACPI Support"
submenu, unified IA32 and IA64 options, added new "Boot using
ACPI
tables" option, etc.

Increased the default timeout for the EC driver from 1ms to 10ms
(1000 cycles of 10us) to try to address AE_TIME errors during EC
transactions.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_02_01

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

ACPI 2.0 Support: Implemented ACPI 2.0 64-bit Field access
(QWordAcc keyword). All ACPI 2.0 64-bit support is now
implemented.

OSL Interfaces: Several of the OSL (AcpiOs*) interfaces required
changes to support ACPI 2.0 Qword field access.  Read/Write
PciConfiguration(), Read/Write Memory(), and Read/Write Port()
now
accept an ACPI_INTEGER (64 bits) as the value parameter.  Also,
the value parameter for the address space handler interface is
now
an ACPI_INTEGER.  OSL implementations of these interfaces must
now
handle the case where the Width parameter is 64.

Index Fields: Fixed a problem where unaligned bit assembly and
disassembly for IndexFields was not supported correctly.

Index and Bank Fields:  Nested Index and Bank Fields are now
supported. During field access, a check is performed to ensure
that the value written to an Index or Bank register is not out of
the range of the register.  The Index (or Bank) register is
written before each access to the field data. Future support will
include allowing individual IndexFields to be wider than the
DataRegister width.

Fields: Fixed a problem where the AML interpreter was incorrectly
attempting to write beyond the end of a Field/OpRegion.  This was
a boundary case that occurred when a DWORD field was written to a
BYTE access OpRegion, forcing multiple writes and causing the
interpreter to write one datum too many.

Fields: Fixed a problem with Field/OpRegion access where the
starting bit address of a field was incorrectly calculated if the
current access type was wider than a byte (WordAcc, DwordAcc, or
QwordAcc).

Fields: Fixed a problem where forward references to individual
FieldUnits (individual Field names within a Field definition)
were
not resolved during the AML table load.

Fields: Fixed a problem where forward references from a Field
definition to the parent Operation Region definition were not
resolved during the AML table load.

Fields: Duplicate FieldUnit names within a scope are now detected
during AML table load.

Acpi Interfaces: Fixed a problem where the AcpiGetName()
interface
returned an incorrect name for the root node.

Code and Data Size: Code and Data optimizations have permitted
new
feature development with an actual reduction in the library size.
Current core subsystem library sizes are shown below.  These are
the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do not
include
any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version of the code
includes the debug output trace mechanism and has a larger code
and data size.  Note that these values will vary depending on the
efficiency of the compiler and the compiler options used during
generation.

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") to all modules.

 3) ASL Compiler version X2030:

Duplicate FieldUnit names within a scope are now detected and
flagged as errors.

 4) Documentation:

Programmer Reference updated to reflect OSL and address space
handler interface changes described above.

----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 10_18_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem with the internal object reference count
mechanism
that occasionally caused premature object deletion. This resolves
all of the outstanding problem reports where an object is deleted
in the middle of an interpreter evaluation.  Although this
problem
only showed up in rather obscure cases, the solution to the
problem involved an adjustment of all reference counts involving
objects attached to namespace nodes.

Fixed a problem with Field support in the interpreter where
writing to an aligned field whose length is an exact multiple (2
or greater) of the field access granularity would cause an
attempt
to write beyond the end of the field.

The top level AML opcode execution functions within the
interpreter have been renamed with a more meaningful and
consistent naming convention.  The modules exmonad.c and
exdyadic.c were eliminated.  New modules are exoparg1.c,
exoparg2.c, exoparg3.c, and exoparg6.c.

Support for the ACPI 2.0 "Mid" ASL operator has been implemented.

Fixed a problem where the AML debugger was causing some internal
objects to not be deleted during subsystem termination.

Fixed a problem with the external AcpiEvaluateObject interface
where the subsystem would fault if the named object to be
evaluated refered to a constant such as Zero, Ones, etc.

Fixed a problem with IndexFields and BankFields where the
subsystem would fault if the index, data, or bank registers were
not defined in the same scope as the field itself.

Added printf format string checking for compilers that support
this feature.  Corrected more than 50 instances of issues with
format specifiers within invocations of ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT
throughout the core subsystem code.

The ASL "Revision" operator now returns the ACPI support level
implemented in the core - the value "2" since the ACPI 2.0
support
is more than 50% implemented.

Enhanced the output of the AML debugger "dump namespace" command
to output in a more human-readable form.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.  These
are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do not
include
any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version of the code
includes the full debug trace mechanism -- leading to a much
larger code and data size.  Note that these values will vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

Linux:

Implemented a "Bad BIOS Blacklist" to track machines that have
known ASL/AML problems.

Enhanced the /proc interface for the thermal zone driver and
added
support for _HOT (the critical suspend trip point).  The 'info'
file now includes threshold/policy information, and allows
setting
of _SCP (cooling preference) and _TZP (polling frequency) values
to the 'info' file. Examples: "echo tzp=5 > info" sets the
polling
frequency to 5 seconds, and "echo scp=1 > info" sets the cooling
preference to the passive/quiet mode (if supported by the ASL).

Implemented a workaround for a gcc bug that resuted in an OOPs
when loading the control method battery driver.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_20_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The AcpiEnableEvent and AcpiDisableEvent interfaces have been
modified to allow individual GPE levels to be flagged as wake-
enabled (i.e., these GPEs are to remain enabled when the platform
sleeps.)

The AcpiEnterSleepState and AcpiLeaveSleepState interfaces now
support wake-enabled GPEs.  This means that upon entering the
sleep state, all GPEs that are not wake-enabled are disabled.
When leaving the sleep state, these GPEs are reenabled.

A local double-precision divide/modulo module has been added to
enhance portability to OS kernels where a 64-bit math library is
not available.  The new module is "utmath.c".

Several optimizations have been made to reduce the use of CPU
stack.  Originally over 2K, the maximum stack usage is now below
2K at 1860  bytes (1.82k)

Fixed a problem with the AcpiGetFirmwareTable interface where the
root table pointer was not mapped into a logical address
properly.

Fixed a problem where a NULL pointer was being dereferenced in
the
interpreter code for the ASL Notify operator.

Fixed a problem where the use of the ASL Revision operator
returned an error. This operator now returns the current version
of the ACPI CA core subsystem.

Fixed a problem where objects passed as control method parameters
to AcpiEvaluateObject were always deleted at method termination.
However, these objects may end up being stored into the namespace
by the called method.  The object reference count mechanism was
applied to these objects instead of a force delete.

Fixed a problem where static strings or buffers (contained in the
AML code) that are declared as package elements within the ASL
code could cause a fault because the interpreter would attempt to
delete them.  These objects are now marked with the "static
object" flag to prevent any attempt to delete them.

Implemented an interpreter optimization to use operands directly
from the state object instead of extracting the operands to local
variables.  This reduces stack use and code size, and improves
performance.

The module exxface.c was eliminated as it was an unnecessary
extra
layer of code.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.  These
are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do not
include
any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version of the code
includes the full debug trace mechanism -- leading to a much
larger code and data size.  Note that these values will vary
depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the compiler
options used during generation.

  Non-Debug Version:  65K Code,   5K Data,   70K Total
(Previously 69K)   Debug Version:     138K Code,  58K Data,  196K
Total  (Previously 195K)

Linux:

Support for ACPI 2.0 64-bit integers has been added.   All ACPI
Integer objects are now 64 bits wide

All Acpi data types and structures are now in lower case.  Only
Acpi macros are upper case for differentiation.

 Documentation:

Changes to the external interfaces as described above.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_31_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

A bug with interpreter implementation of the ASL Divide operator
was found and fixed.  The implicit function return value (not the
explicit store operands) was returning the remainder instead of
the quotient.  This was a longstanding bug and it fixes several
known outstanding issues on various platforms.

The ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT and function trace entry/exit macros have
been further optimized for size.  There are 700 invocations of
the
DEBUG_PRINT macro alone, so each optimization reduces the size of
the debug version of the subsystem significantly.

A stack trace mechanism has been implemented.  The maximum stack
usage is about 2K on 32-bit platforms.  The debugger command
"stat
stack" will display the current maximum stack usage.

All public symbols and global variables within the subsystem are
now prefixed with the string "Acpi".  This keeps all of the
symbols grouped together in a kernel map, and avoids conflicts
with other kernel subsystems.

Most of the internal fixed lookup tables have been moved into the
code segment via the const operator.

Several enhancements have been made to the interpreter to both
reduce the code size and improve performance.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.  These
are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced by the
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do not
include
any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version of the code
includes the full debug trace mechanism which contains over 700
invocations of the DEBUG_PRINT macro, 500 function entry macro
invocations, and over 900 function exit macro invocations --
leading to a much larger code and data size.  Note that these
values will vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and
the compiler options used during generation.

        Non-Debug Version:  64K Code,   5K Data,   69K Total
Debug Version:     137K Code,  58K Data,  195K Total

 Linux:

Implemented wbinvd() macro, pending a kernel-wide definition.

Fixed /proc/acpi/event to handle poll() and short reads.

 ASL Compiler, version X2026:

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where the AML
code emitted for package objects produced packages with zero
length.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_16_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The following ACPI 2.0 ASL operators have been implemented in the
AML interpreter (These are already supported by the Intel ASL
compiler):  ToDecimalString, ToHexString, ToString, ToInteger,
and
ToBuffer.  Support for 64-bit AML constants is implemented in the
AML parser, debugger, and disassembler.

The internal memory tracking mechanism (leak detection code) has
been upgraded to reduce the memory overhead (a separate tracking
block is no longer allocated for each memory allocation), and now
supports all of the internal object caches.

The data structures and code for the internal object caches have
been coelesced and optimized so that there is a single cache and
memory list data structure and a single group of functions that
implement generic cache management.  This has reduced the code
size in both the debug and release versions of the subsystem.

The DEBUG_PRINT macro(s) have been optimized for size and
replaced
by ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT.  The syntax for this macro is slightly
different, because it generates a single call to an internal
function.  This results in a savings of about 90 bytes per
invocation, resulting in an overall code and data savings of
about
16% in the debug version of the subsystem.

 Linux:

Fixed C3 disk corruption problems and re-enabled C3 on supporting
machines.

Integrated low-level sleep code by Patrick Mochel.

Further tweaked source code Linuxization.

Other minor fixes.

 ASL Compiler:

Support for ACPI 2.0 variable length packages is fixed/completed.

Fixed a problem where the optional length parameter for the ACPI
2.0 ToString operator.

Fixed multiple extraneous error messages when a syntax error is
detected within the declaration line of a control method.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_17_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Added a new interface named AcpiGetFirmwareTable to obtain any
ACPI table via the ACPI signature.  The interface can be called
at
any time during kernel initialization, even before the kernel
virtual memory manager is initialized and paging is enabled.
This
allows kernel subsystems to obtain ACPI tables very early, even
before the ACPI CA subsystem is initialized.

Fixed a problem where Fields defined with the AnyAcc attribute
could be resolved to the incorrect address under the following
conditions: 1) the field width is larger than 8 bits and 2) the
parent operation region is not defined on a DWORD boundary.

Fixed a problem where the interpreter is not being locked during
namespace initialization (during execution of the _INI control
methods), causing an error when an attempt is made to release it
later.

ACPI 2.0 support in the AML Interpreter has begun and will be
ongoing throughout the rest of this year.  In this label, The Mod
operator is implemented.

Added a new data type to contain full PCI addresses named
ACPI_PCI_ID. This structure contains the PCI Segment, Bus,
Device,
and Function values.

 Linux:

Enhanced the Linux version of the source code to change most
capitalized ACPI type names to lowercase. For example, all
instances of ACPI_STATUS are changed to acpi_status.  This will
result in a large diff, but the change is strictly cosmetic and
aligns the CA code closer to the Linux coding standard.

OSL Interfaces:

The interfaces to the PCI configuration space have been changed
to
add the PCI Segment number and to split the single 32-bit
combined
DeviceFunction field into two 16-bit fields.  This was
accomplished by moving the four values that define an address in
PCI configuration space (segment, bus, device, and function) to
the new ACPI_PCI_ID structure.

The changes to the PCI configuration space interfaces led to a
reexamination of the complete set of address space access
interfaces for PCI, I/O, and Memory.  The previously existing 18
interfaces have proven difficult to maintain (any small change
must be propagated across at least 6 interfaces) and do not
easily
allow for future expansion to 64 bits if necessary.  Also, on
some
systems, it would not be appropriate to demultiplex the access
width (8, 16, 32,or 64) before calling the OSL if the
corresponding native OS interfaces contain a similar access width
parameter.  For these reasons, the 18 address space interfaces
have been replaced by these 6 new ones:

AcpiOsReadPciConfiguration
AcpiOsWritePciConfiguration
AcpiOsReadMemory
AcpiOsWriteMemory
AcpiOsReadPort
AcpiOsWritePort

Added a new interface named AcpiOsGetRootPointer to allow the OSL
to perform the platform and/or OS-specific actions necessary to
obtain the ACPI RSDP table pointer.  On IA-32 platforms, this
interface will simply call down to the CA core to perform the low-
memory search for the table.  On IA-64, the RSDP is obtained from
EFI.  Migrating this interface to the OSL allows the CA core to
remain OS and platform independent.

Added a new interface named AcpiOsSignal to provide a generic
"function code and pointer" interface for various miscellaneous
signals and notifications that must be made to the host OS.   The
first such signals are intended to support the ASL Fatal and
Breakpoint operators.  In the latter case, the AcpiOsBreakpoint
interface has been obsoleted.

The definition of the AcpiFormatException interface has been
changed to simplify its use.  The caller no longer must supply a
buffer to the call; A pointer to a const string is now returned
directly.  This allows the call to be easily used in printf
statements, etc. since the caller does not have to manage a local
buffer.


 ASL Compiler, Version X2025:

The ACPI 2.0 Switch/Case/Default operators have been implemented
and are fully functional.  They will work with all ACPI 1.0
interpreters, since the operators are simply translated to
If/Else
pairs.

The ACPI 2.0 ElseIf operator is implemented and will also work
with 1.0 interpreters, for the same reason.

Implemented support for ACPI 2.0 variable-length packages.  These
packages have a separate opcode, and their size is determined by
the interpreter at run-time.

Documentation The ACPI CA Programmer Reference has been updated
to
reflect the new interfaces and changes to existing interfaces.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_15_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where a DWORD-accessed field within a Buffer
object would get its byte address inadvertently rounded down to
the nearest DWORD.  Buffers are always Byte-accessible.

 ASL Compiler, version X2024:

Fixed a problem where the Switch() operator would either fault or
hang the compiler.  Note however, that the AML code for this ACPI
2.0 operator is not yet implemented.

Compiler uses the new AcpiOsGetTimer interface to obtain compile
timings.

Implementation of the CreateField operator automatically converts
a reference to a named field within a resource descriptor from a
byte offset to a bit offset if required.

Added some missing named fields from the resource descriptor
support. These are the names that are automatically created by
the
compiler to reference fields within a descriptor.  They are only
valid at compile time and are not passed through to the AML
interpreter.

Resource descriptor named fields are now typed as Integers and
subject to compile-time typechecking when used in expressions.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 05_18_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a couple of problems in the Field support code where bits
from adjacent fields could be returned along with the proper
field
bits. Restructured the field support code to improve performance,
readability and maintainability.

New DEBUG_PRINTP macro automatically inserts the procedure name
into the output, saving hundreds of copies of procedure name
strings within the source, shrinking the memory footprint of the
debug version of the core subsystem.

 Source Code Structure:

The source code directory tree was restructured to reflect the
current organization of the component architecture.  Some files
and directories have been moved and/or renamed.

 Linux:

Fixed leaking kacpidpc processes.

Fixed queueing event data even when /proc/acpi/event is not
opened.

 ASL Compiler, version X2020:

Memory allocation performance enhancement - over 24X compile time
improvement on large ASL files.  Parse nodes and namestring
buffers are now allocated from a large internal compiler buffer.

The temporary .SRC file is deleted unless the "-s" option is
specified

The "-d" debug output option now sends all output to the .DBG
file
instead of the console.

"External" second parameter is now optional

"ElseIf" syntax now properly allows the predicate

Last operand to "Load" now recognized as a Target operand

Debug object can now be used anywhere as a normal object.

ResourceTemplate now returns an object of type BUFFER

EISAID now returns an object of type INTEGER

"Index" now works with a STRING operand

"LoadTable" now accepts optional parameters

"ToString" length parameter is now optional

"Interrupt (ResourceType," parse error fixed.

"Register" with a user-defined region space parse error fixed

Escaped backslash at the end of a string ("\\") scan/parse error
fixed

"Revision" is now an object of type INTEGER.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 05_02_01

Linux:

/proc/acpi/event now blocks properly.

Removed /proc/sys/acpi. You can still dump your DSDT from
/proc/acpi/dsdt.

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where some of
the
"small" resource descriptor types were not recognized.

Improved error messages for the case where an ASL Field is
outside
the range of the parent operation region.

 ASL Compiler, version X2018:

Added error detection for ASL Fields that extend beyond the
length
of the parent operation region (only if the length of the region
is known at compile time.)  This includes fields that have a
minimum access width that is smaller than the parent region, and
individual field units that are partially or entirely beyond the
extent of the parent.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 04_27_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where the namespace mutex could be released at
the
wrong time during execution of AcpiRemoveAddressSpaceHandler.

Added optional thread ID output for debug traces, to simplify
debugging of multiple threads.  Added context switch notification
when the debug code realizes that a different thread is now
executing ACPI code.

Some additional external data types have been prefixed with the
string "ACPI_" for consistency.  This may effect existing code.
The data types affected are the external callback typedefs -
e.g.,
WALK_CALLBACK becomes ACPI_WALK_CALLBACK.

 Linux:

Fixed an issue with the OSL semaphore implementation where a
thread was waking up with an error from receiving a SIGCHLD
signal.

Linux version of ACPI CA now uses the system C library for string
manipulation routines instead of a local implementation.

Cleaned up comments and removed TBDs.

 ASL Compiler, version X2017:

Enhanced error detection and reporting for all file I/O
operations.

 Documentation:

Programmer Reference updated to version 1.06.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 04_13_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Restructured support for BufferFields and RegionFields.
BankFields support is now fully operational.  All known 32-bit
limitations on field sizes have been removed.  Both BufferFields
and (Operation) RegionFields are now supported by the same field
management code.

Resource support now supports QWORD address and IO resources. The
16/32/64 bit address structures and the Extended IRQ structure
have been changed to properly handle Source Resource strings.

A ThreadId of -1 is now used to indicate a "mutex not acquired"
condition internally and must never be returned by
AcpiOsThreadId.
This reserved value was changed from 0 since Unix systems allow a
thread ID of 0.

Linux:

Driver code reorganized to enhance portability

Added a kernel configuration option to control ACPI_DEBUG

Fixed the EC driver to honor _GLK.

ASL Compiler, version X2016:

Fixed support for the "FixedHw" keyword.  Previously, the FixedHw
address space was set to 0, not 0x7f as it should be.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 03_13_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

During ACPI initialization, the _SB_._INI method is now run if
present.

Notify handler fix - notifies are deferred until the parent
method
completes execution.  This fixes the "mutex already acquired"
issue seen occasionally.

Part of the "implicit conversion" rules in ACPI 2.0 have been
found to cause compatibility problems with existing ASL/AML.  The
convert "result-to-target-type" implementation has been removed
for stores to method Args and Locals.  Source operand conversion
is still fully implemented.  Possible changes to ACPI 2.0
specification pending.

Fix to AcpiRsCalculatePciRoutingTableLength to return correct
length.

Fix for compiler warnings for 64-bit compiles.

 Linux:

/proc output aligned for easier parsing.

Release-version compile problem fixed.

New kernel configuration options documented in Configure.help.

IBM 600E - Fixed Sleep button may generate "Invalid <NULL>
context" message.

 OSPM:

Power resource driver integrated with bus manager.

Fixed kernel fault during active cooling for thermal zones.

Source Code:

The source code tree has been restructured.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 03_02_01

 Linux OS Services Layer (OSL):

Major revision of all Linux-specific code.

Modularized all ACPI-specific drivers.

Added new thermal zone and power resource drivers.

Revamped /proc interface (new functionality is under /proc/acpi).

New kernel configuration options.

 Linux known issues:

New kernel configuration options not documented in Configure.help
yet.


Module dependencies not currently implemented. If used, they
should be loaded in this order: busmgr, power, ec, system,
processor, battery, ac_adapter, button, thermal.

Modules will not load if CONFIG_MODVERSION is set.

IBM 600E - entering S5 may reboot instead of shutting down.

IBM 600E - Sleep button may generate "Invalid <NULL> context"
message.

Some systems may fail with "execution mutex already acquired"
message.

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Added a new OSL Interface, AcpiOsGetThreadId.  This was required
for the  deadlock detection code. Defined to return a non-zero,
32-
bit thread ID for the currently executing thread.  May be a non-
zero constant integer on single-thread systems.

Implemented deadlock detection for internal subsystem mutexes.
We
may add conditional compilation for this code (debug only) later.

ASL/AML Mutex object semantics are now fully supported.  This
includes multiple acquires/releases by owner and support for the
Mutex SyncLevel parameter.

A new "Force Release" mechanism automatically frees all ASL
Mutexes that have been acquired but not released when a thread
exits the interpreter.  This forces conformance to the ACPI spec
("All mutexes must be released when an invocation exits") and
prevents deadlocked ASL threads.  This mechanism can be expanded
(later) to monitor other resource acquisitions if OEM ASL code
continues to misbehave (which it will).

Several new ACPI exception codes have been added for the Mutex
support.

Recursive method calls are now allowed and supported (the ACPI
spec does in fact allow recursive method calls.)  The number of
recursive calls is subject to the restrictions imposed by the
SERIALIZED method keyword and SyncLevel (ACPI 2.0) method
parameter.

Implemented support for the SyncLevel parameter for control
methods (ACPI 2.0 feature)

Fixed a deadlock problem when multiple threads attempted to use
the interpreter.

Fixed a problem where the string length of a String package
element was not always set in a package returned from
AcpiEvaluateObject.

Fixed a problem where the length of a String package element was
not always included in the length of the overall package returned
from AcpiEvaluateObject.

Added external interfaces (Acpi*) to the ACPI debug memory
manager.  This manager keeps a list of all outstanding
allocations, and can therefore detect memory leaks and attempts
to
free memory blocks more than once. Useful for code such as the
power manager, etc.  May not be appropriate for device drivers.
Performance with the debug code enabled is slow.

The ACPI Global Lock is now an optional hardware element.

 ASL Compiler Version X2015:

Integrated changes to allow the compiler to be generated on
multiple platforms.

Linux makefile added to generate the compiler on Linux

 Source Code:

All platform-specific headers have been moved to their own
subdirectory, Include/Platform.

New source file added, Interpreter/ammutex.c

New header file, Include/acstruct.h

 Documentation:

The programmer reference has been updated for the following new
interfaces: AcpiOsGetThreadId AcpiAllocate AcpiCallocate AcpiFree

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_08_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem: Fixed a problem where an error was
incorrectly returned if the return resource buffer was larger
than
the actual data (in the resource interfaces).

References to named objects within packages are resolved to the
full pathname string before packages are returned directly (via
the AcpiEvaluateObject interface) or indirectly via the resource
interfaces.

Linux OS Services Layer (OSL):

Improved /proc battery interface.


Added C-state debugging output and other miscellaneous fixes.

ASL Compiler Version X2014:

All defined method arguments can now be used as local variables,
including the ones that are not actually passed in as parameters.
The compiler tracks initialization of the arguments and issues an
exception if they are used without prior assignment (just like
locals).

The -o option now specifies a filename prefix that is used for
all
output files, including the AML output file.  Otherwise, the
default behavior is as follows:  1) the AML goes to the file
specified in the DSDT.  2) all other output files use the input
source filename as the base.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 01_25_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem: Restructured the implementation of object
store support within the  interpreter.  This includes support for
the Store operator as well  as any ASL operators that include a
target operand.

Partially implemented support for Implicit Result-to-Target
conversion. This is when a result object is converted on the fly
to the type of  an existing target object.  Completion of this
support is pending  further analysis of the ACPI specification
concerning this matter.

CPU-specific code has been removed from the subsystem (hardware
directory).

New Power Management Timer functions added

Linux OS Services Layer (OSL): Moved system state transition code
to the core, fixed it, and modified  Linux OSL accordingly.

Fixed C2 and C3 latency calculations.


We no longer use the compilation date for the version message on
initialization, but retrieve the version from
AcpiGetSystemInfo().

Incorporated for fix Sony VAIO machines.

Documentation:  The Programmer Reference has been updated and
reformatted.


ASL Compiler:  Version X2013: Fixed a problem where the line
numbering and error reporting could get out  of sync in the
presence of multiple include files.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 01_15_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem:

Implemented support for type conversions in the execution of the
ASL  Concatenate operator (The second operand is converted to
match the type  of the first operand before concatenation.)

Support for implicit source operand conversion is partially
implemented.   The ASL source operand types Integer, Buffer, and
String are freely  interchangeable for most ASL operators and are
converted by the interpreter  on the fly as required.  Implicit
Target operand conversion (where the  result is converted to the
target type before storing) is not yet implemented.

Support for 32-bit and 64-bit BCD integers is implemented.

Problem fixed where a field read on an aligned field could cause
a
read  past the end of the field.

New exception, AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE, is returned when a method
does not return a value, but the caller expects one.  (The ASL
compiler flags this as a warning.)

ASL Compiler:

Version X2011:
1. Static typechecking of all operands is implemented. This
prevents the use of invalid objects (such as using a Package
where
an Integer is required) at compile time instead of at interpreter
run-time.
2. The ASL source line is printed with ALL errors and warnings.
3. Bug fix for source EOF without final linefeed.
4. Debug option is split into a parse trace and a namespace
trace.
5. Namespace output option (-n) includes initial values for
integers and strings.
6. Parse-only option added for quick syntax checking.
7. Compiler checks for duplicate ACPI name declarations

Version X2012:
1. Relaxed typechecking to allow interchangeability between
strings, integers, and buffers.  These types are now converted by
the interpreter at runtime.
2. Compiler reports time taken by each internal subsystem in the
debug         output file.

ASL Compiler:

This is the first official release of the compiler. Since the
compiler requires elements of the Core Subsystem, this label
synchronizes everything.

------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_08_00


Fixed a problem where named references within the ASL definition
of both OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did not work
properly.  The symptom was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE during
initialization of the region/field. This is similar (but not
related internally) to the problem that was fixed in the last
label.

Implemented both 32-bit and 64-bit support for the BCD ASL
functions ToBCD and FromBCD.

Updated all legal headers to include "2000" in the copyright
years.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_01_00

Fixed a problem where method invocations within the ASL
definition
of both OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did not work
properly.  The symptom was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE during
initialization of the region/field:

  nsinit-0209: AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE while getting region arguments
[DEBG]   ammonad-0284: Exec_monadic2_r/Not: bad operand(s)
(0x3005)

Fixed a problem where operators with more than one nested
subexpression would fail.  The symptoms were varied, by mostly
AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE errors.  This was actually a rather serious
problem that has gone unnoticed until now.

  Subtract (Add (1,2), Multiply (3,4))

Fixed a problem where AcpiGetHandle didn't quite get fixed in the
previous build (The prefix part of a relative path was handled
incorrectly).

Fixed a problem where Operation Region initialization failed if
the operation region name was a "namepath" instead of a simple
"nameseg". Symptom was an AE_NO_OPERAND error.

Fixed a problem where an assignment to a local variable via the
indirect RefOf mechanism only worked for the first such
assignment.  Subsequent assignments were ignored.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_15_00

ACPI 2.0 table support with backwards support for ACPI 1.0 and
the
0.71 extensions.  Note: although we can read ACPI 2.0 BIOS
tables,
the AML  interpreter does NOT have support for the new 2.0 ASL
grammar terms at this time.

All ACPI hardware access is via the GAS structures in the ACPI
2.0
FADT.

All physical memory addresses across all platforms are now 64
bits
wide. Logical address width remains dependent on the platform
(i.e., "void *").

AcpiOsMapMemory interface changed to a 64-bit physical address.

The AML interpreter integer size is now 64 bits, as per the ACPI
2.0 specification.

For backwards compatibility with ACPI 1.0, ACPI tables with a
revision number less than 2 use 32-bit integers only.

Fixed a problem where the evaluation of OpRegion operands did not
always resolve them to numbers properly.

------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 10_20_00

Fix for CBN_._STA issue.  This fix will allow correct access to
CBN_ OpRegions when the _STA returns 0x8.

Support to convert ACPI constants (Ones, Zeros, One) to actual
values before a package object is returned

Fix for method call as predicate to if/while construct causing
incorrect if/while behavior

Fix for Else block package lengths sometimes calculated wrong (if
block > 63 bytes)

Fix for Processor object length field, was always zero

Table load abort if FACP sanity check fails

Fix for problem with Scope(name) if name already exists

Warning emitted if a named object referenced cannot be found
(resolved) during method execution.





------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 9_29_00

New table initialization interfaces: AcpiInitializeSubsystem no
longer has any parameters AcpiFindRootPointer - Find the RSDP (if
necessary) AcpiLoadTables (RSDP) - load all tables found at RSDP-
>RSDT Obsolete Interfaces AcpiLoadFirmwareTables - replaced by
AcpiLoadTables

Note: These interface changes require changes to all existing
OSDs

The PCI_Config default address space handler is always installed
at the root namespace object.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_15_00

The new initialization architecture is implemented.  New
interfaces are: AcpiInitializeSubsystem (replaces AcpiInitialize)
AcpiEnableSubsystem Obsolete Interfaces: AcpiLoadNamespace
(Namespace is automatically loaded when a table is loaded)

The ACPI_OPERAND_OBJECT has been optimized to shrink its size
from
52 bytes to 32 bytes.  There is usually one of these for every
namespace object, so the memory savings is significant.

Implemented just-in-time evaluation of the CreateField operators.

Bug fixes for IA-64 support have been integrated.

Additional code review comments have been implemented

The so-called "third pass parse" has been replaced by a final
walk
through the namespace to initialize all operation regions
(address
spaces) and fields that have not yet been initialized during the
execution of the various _INI and REG methods.

New file - namespace/nsinit.c

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_01_00

Namespace manager data structures have been reworked to change
the
primary  object from a table to a single object.  This has
resulted in dynamic memory  savings of 3X within the namespace
and
2X overall in the ACPI CA subsystem.

Fixed problem where the call to AcpiEvFindPciRootBuses was
inadvertently left  commented out.

Reduced the warning count when generating the source with the GCC
compiler.

Revision numbers added to each module header showing the
SourceSafe version of the file.  Please refer to this version
number when giving us feedback or comments on individual modules.

The main object types within the subsystem have been renamed to
clarify their  purpose:

ACPI_INTERNAL_OBJECT -> ACPI_OPERAND_OBJECT
ACPI_GENERIC_OP -> ACPI_PARSE_OBJECT
ACPI_NAME_TABLE_ENTRY -> ACPI_NAMESPACE_NODE

NOTE: no changes to the initialization sequence are included in
this label.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_23_00

Fixed problem where TerminateControlMethod was being called
multiple times per  method

Fixed debugger problem where single stepping caused a semaphore
to
be  oversignalled

Improved performance through additional parse object caching -
added  ACPI_EXTENDED_OP type

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_10_00

Parser/Interpreter integration:  Eliminated the creation of
complete parse trees  for ACPI tables and control methods.
Instead, parse subtrees are created and  then deleted as soon as
they are processed (Either entered into the namespace or
executed
by the interpreter).  This reduces the use of dynamic kernel
memory  significantly. (about 10X)

Exception codes broken into classes and renumbered.  Be sure to
recompile all  code that includes acexcep.h.  Hopefully we won't
have to renumber the codes  again now that they are split into
classes (environment, programmer, AML code,  ACPI table, and
internal).

Fixed some additional alignment issues in the Resource Manager
subcomponent

Implemented semaphore tracking in the AcpiExec utility, and fixed
several places  where mutexes/semaphores were being unlocked
without a corresponding lock  operation.  There are no known
semaphore or mutex "leaks" at this time.

Fixed the case where an ASL Return operator is used to return an
unnamed  package.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_28_00

Fixed a problem with the way addresses were calculated in
AcpiAmlReadFieldData()  and AcpiAmlWriteFieldData(). This problem
manifested itself when a Field was  created with WordAccess or
DwordAccess, but the field unit defined within the  Field was
less
than a Word or Dword.

Fixed a problem in AmlDumpOperands() module's loop to pull
operands off of the  operand stack to display information. The
problem manifested itself as a TLB  error on 64-bit systems when
accessing an operand stack with two or more  operands.

Fixed a problem with the PCI configuration space handlers where
context was  getting confused between accesses. This required a
change to the generic address  space handler and address space
setup definitions. Handlers now get both a  global handler
context
(this is the one passed in by the user when executing
AcpiInstallAddressSpaceHandler() and a specific region context
that is unique to  each region (For example, the _ADR, _SEG and
_BBN values associated with a  specific region). The generic
function definitions have changed to the  following:

typedef ACPI_STATUS (*ADDRESS_SPACE_HANDLER) ( UINT32 Function,
UINT32 Address, UINT32 BitWidth, UINT32 *Value, void
*HandlerContext, // This used to be void *Context void
*RegionContext); // This is an additional parameter

typedef ACPI_STATUS (*ADDRESS_SPACE_SETUP) ( ACPI_HANDLE
RegionHandle, UINT32 Function, void *HandlerContext,  void
**RegionContext); // This used to be **ReturnContext

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_21_00

Major file consolidation and rename.  All files within the
interpreter have been  renamed as well as most header files.
This
was done to prevent collisions with  existing files in the host
OSs -- filenames such as "config.h" and "global.h"  seem to be
quite common.  The VC project files have been updated.  All
makefiles  will require modification.

The parser/interpreter integration continues in Phase 5 with the
implementation  of a complete 2-pass parse (the AML is parsed
twice) for each table;  This  avoids the construction of a huge
parse tree and therefore reduces the amount of  dynamic memory
required by the subsystem.  Greater use of the parse object cache
means that performance is unaffected.

Many comments from the two code reviews have been rolled in.

The 64-bit alignment support is complete.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_30_00

With a nod and a tip of the hat to the technology of yesteryear,
we've added  support in the source code for 80 column output
devices.  The code is now mostly  constrained to 80 columns or
less to support environments and editors that 1)  cannot display
or print more than 80 characters on a single line, and 2) cannot
disable line wrapping.

A major restructuring of the namespace data structure has been
completed.  The  result is 1) cleaner and more
understandable/maintainable code, and 2) a  significant reduction
in the dynamic memory requirement for each named ACPI  object
(almost half).

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_23_00

Linux support has been added.  In order to obtain approval to get
the ACPI CA  subsystem into the Linux kernel, we've had to make
quite a few changes to the  base subsystem that will affect all
users (all the changes are generic and OS- independent).  The
effects of these global changes have been somewhat far  reaching.
Files have been merged and/or renamed and interfaces have been
renamed.   The major changes are described below.

Osd* interfaces renamed to AcpiOs* to eliminate namespace
pollution/confusion  within our target kernels.  All OSD
interfaces must be modified to match the new  naming convention.

Files merged across the subsystem.  A number of the smaller
source
and header  files have been merged to reduce the file count and
increase the density of the  existing files.  There are too many
to list here.  In general, makefiles that  call out individual
files will require rebuilding.

Interpreter files renamed.  All interpreter files now have the
prefix am*  instead of ie* and is*.

Header files renamed:  The acapi.h file is now acpixf.h.  The
acpiosd.h file is  now acpiosxf.h.  We are removing references to
the acronym "API" since it is  somewhat windowsy. The new name is
"external interface" or xface or xf in the  filenames.j


All manifest constants have been forced to upper case (some were
mixed case.)   Also, the string "ACPI_" has been prepended to
many
(not all) of the constants,  typedefs, and structs.

The globals "DebugLevel" and "DebugLayer" have been renamed
"AcpiDbgLevel" and  "AcpiDbgLayer" respectively.

All other globals within the subsystem are now prefixed with
"AcpiGbl_" Internal procedures within the subsystem are now
prefixed with "Acpi" (with only  a few exceptions).  The original
two-letter abbreviation for the subcomponent  remains after
"Acpi"
- for example, CmCallocate became AcpiCmCallocate.

Added a source code translation/conversion utility.  Used to
generate the Linux  source code, it can be modified to generate
other types of source as well. Can  also be used to cleanup
existing source by removing extraneous spaces and blank  lines.
Found in tools/acpisrc/*

OsdUnMapMemory was renamed to OsdUnmapMemory and then
AcpiOsUnmapMemory.  (UnMap  became Unmap).

A "MaxUnits" parameter has been added to AcpiOsCreateSemaphore.
When set to  one, this indicates that the caller wants to use the
semaphore as a mutex, not a  counting semaphore.  ACPI CA uses
both types.  However, implementers of this  call may want to use
different OS primitives depending on the type of semaphore
requested.  For example, some operating systems provide separate
"mutex" and  "semaphore" interfaces - where the mutex interface
is
much faster because it  doesn't have all the overhead of a full
semaphore implementation.

Fixed a deadlock problem where a method that accesses the PCI
address space can  block forever if it is the first access to the
space.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_02_00

Support for environments that cannot handle unaligned data
accesses (e.g.  firmware and OS environments devoid of alignment
handler technology namely  SAL/EFI and the IA-64 Linux kernel)
has
been added (via configurable macros) in  these three areas: -
Transfer of data from the raw AML byte stream is done via byte
moves instead of    word/dword/qword moves. - External objects
are
aligned within the user buffer, including package   elements (sub-
objects). - Conversion of name strings to UINT32 Acpi Names is
now
done byte-wise.

The Store operator was modified to mimic Microsoft's
implementation when storing  to a Buffer Field.

Added a check of the BM_STS bit before entering C3.

The methods subdirectory has been obsoleted and removed.  A new
file, cmeval.c  subsumes the functionality.

A 16-bit (DOS) version of AcpiExec has been developed.  The
makefile is under  the acpiexec directory.
