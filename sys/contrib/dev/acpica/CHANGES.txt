----------------------------------------
15 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021115.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a memory leak problem where an error during resolution
of method arguments during a method invocation from another
method failed to cleanup properly by deleting all successfully
resolved argument objects.

Fixed a problem where the target of the Index() operator was
not correctly constructed if the source object was a package.
This problem has not been detected because the use of a target
operand with Index() is very rare.

Fixed a problem with the Index() operator where an attempt was
made to delete the operand objects twice.

Fixed a problem where an attempt was made to delete an operand
twice during execution of the CondRefOf() operator if the
target did not exist.

Implemented the first of perhaps several internal create
object functions that create and initialize a specific object
type.  This consolidates duplicated code wherever the object
is created, thus shrinking the size of the subsystem.

Implemented improved debug/error messages for errors that
occur during nested method invocations.  All executing method
pathnames are displayed (with the error) as the call stack is
unwound - thus simplifying debug.

Fixed a problem introduced in the 10/02 release that caused
premature deletion of a buffer object if a buffer was used as
an ASL operand where an integer operand is required (Thus
causing an implicit object conversion from Buffer to Integer.)
The change in the 10/02 release was attempting to fix a memory
leak (albeit incorrectly.)

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release
    Non-Debug Version:  71.9K Code,   9.1K Data,   81.0K Total
    Debug Version:     153.1K Code,  63.3K Data,  216.4K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  71.3K Code,   9.0K Data,   80.3K Total
    Debug Version:     152.7K Code,  63.2K Data,  215.5K Total


2) Linux

Changed the implementation of the ACPI semaphores to use
down() instead of down_interruptable().  It is important that
the execution of ACPI control methods not be interrupted by
signals.  Methods must run to completion, or the system may be
left in an unknown/unstable state.

Fixed a compilation error when CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is not
set. (Shawn Starr)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Changed the default location of output files.  All output
files are now placed in the current directory by default
instead of in the directory of the source file.  This change
may affect some existing makefiles, but it brings the behavior
of the compiler in line with other similar tools.  The
location of the output files can be overridden with the -p
command line switch.


----------------------------------------
11 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021111.


0) ACPI Specification 2.0B is released and is now available
at:  http://www.acpi.info/index.html


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support for the ACPI 2.0 SMBus Operation Regions.
This includes the early detection and handoff of the request
to the SMBus region handler (avoiding all of the complex field
support code), and support for the bidirectional return packet
from an SMBus write operation.  This paves the way for the
development of SMBus drivers in each host operating system.

Fixed a problem where the semaphore WAIT_FOREVER constant was
defined as 32 bits, but must be 16 bits according to the ACPI
specification.  This had the side effect of causing ASL
Mutex/Event timeouts even though the ASL code requested a wait
forever.  Changed all internal references to the ACPI timeout
parameter to 16 bits to prevent future problems.  Changed the
name of WAIT_FOREVER to ACPI_WAIT_FOREVER.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release
    Non-Debug Version:  71.4K Code,   9.0K Data,   80.4K Total
    Debug Version:     152.3K Code,  63.0K Data,  215.3K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  71.9K Code,   9.1K Data,   81.0K Total
    Debug Version:     153.1K Code,  63.3K Data,  216.4K Total


2) Linux

Module loading/unloading fixes (John Cagle)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Added support for the SMBBlockProcessCall keyword (ACPI 2.0)

Implemented support for the disassembly of all SMBus protocol
keywords (SMBQuick, SMBWord, etc.)

----------------------------------------
01 November 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021101.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where platforms that have a GPE1 block but no
GPE0 block were not handled correctly.  This resulted in a
"GPE overlap" error message.  GPE0 is no longer required.

Removed code added in the previous release that inserted nodes
into the namespace in alphabetical order.  This caused some
side-effects on various machines.  The root cause of the
problem is still under investigation since in theory, the
internal ordering of the namespace nodes should not matter.

Enhanced error reporting for the case where a named object is
not found during control method execution.  The full ACPI
namepath (name reference) of the object that was not found is
displayed in this case.

Note: as a result of the overhaul of the namespace object
types in the previous release, the namespace nodes for the
predefined scopes (_TZ, _PR, etc.) are now of the type
ACPI_TYPE_LOCAL_SCOPE instead of ACPI_TYPE_ANY.  This
simplifies the namespace management code but may affect code
that walks the namespace tree looking for specific object
types.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a much larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release
    Non-Debug Version:  70.7K Code,   8.6K Data,   79.3K Total
    Debug Version:     151.7K Code,  62.4K Data,  214.1K Total
  Current Release:
    Non-Debug Version:  71.4K Code,   9.0K Data,   80.4K Total
    Debug Version:     152.3K Code,  63.0K Data,  215.3K Total


2) Linux

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous release where the
Processor and Thermal objects were not recognized and
installed in /proc.  This was related to the scope type change
described above.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Implemented the -g option to get all of the required ACPI
tables from the registry and save them to files (Windows
version of the compiler only.)  The required tables are the
FADT, FACS, and DSDT.

Added ACPI table checksum validation during table disassembly
in order to catch corrupted tables.


----------------------------------------
22 October 2002.  Summary of changes for version 20021022.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented a restriction on the Scope operator that the
target must already exist in the namespace at the time the
operator is encountered (during table load or method
execution).  In other words, forward references are not
allowed and Scope() cannot create a new object. This changes
the previous behavior where the interpreter would create the
name if not found.  This new behavior correctly enables the
search-to-root algorithm during namespace lookup of the target
name.  Because of this upsearch, this fixes the known Compaq
_SB_.OKEC problem and makes both the AML interpreter and iASL
compiler compatible with other ACPI implementations.

Completed a major overhaul of the internal ACPI object types
for the ACPI Namespace and the associated operand objects.
Many of these types had become obsolete with the introduction
of the two-pass namespace load.  This cleanup simplifies the
code and makes the entire namespace load mechanism much
clearer and easier to understand.

Improved debug output for tracking scope opening/closing to
help diagnose scoping issues.  The old scope name as well as
the new scope name are displayed.  Also improved error
messages for problems with ASL Mutex objects and error
messages for GPE problems.

Cleaned up the namespace dump code, removed obsolete code.

All string output (for all namespace/object dumps) now uses
the common ACPI string output procedure which handles escapes
properly and does not emit non-printable characters.

Fixed some issues with constants in the 64-bit version of the
local C library (utclib.c)


2) Linux

EC Driver:  No longer attempts to acquire the Global Lock at
interrupt level.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Implemented ACPI 2.0B grammar change that disallows all Type 1
and 2 opcodes outside of a control method.  This means that
the "executable" operators (versus the "namespace" operators)
cannot be used at the table level; they can only be used
within a control method.

Implemented the restriction on the Scope() operator where the
target must already exist in the namespace at the time the
operator is encountered (during ASL compilation). In other
words, forward references are not allowed and Scope() cannot
create a new object.  This makes the iASL compiler compatible
with other ACPI implementations and makes the Scope()
implementation adhere to the ACPI specification.

Fixed a problem where namepath optimization for the Alias
operator was optimizing the wrong path (of the two namepaths.)
This caused a "Missing alias link" error message.

Fixed a problem where an "unknown reserved name" warning could
be incorrectly generated for names like "_SB" when the
trailing underscore is not used in the original ASL.

Fixed a problem where the reserved name check did not handle
NamePaths with multiple NameSegs correctly.  The first nameseg
of the NamePath was examined instead of the last NameSeg.


----------------------------------------

02 October 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem version 20021002:

Fixed a problem where a store/copy of a string to an existing
string did not always set the string length properly in the
String object.

Fixed a reported problem with the ToString operator where the
behavior was identical to the ToHexString operator instead of
just simply converting a raw buffer to a string data type.

Fixed a problem where CopyObject and the other "explicit"
conversion operators were not updating the internal namespace
node type as part of the store operation.

Fixed a memory leak during implicit source operand conversion
where the original object was not deleted if it was converted
to a new object of a different type.

Enhanced error messages for all problems associated with
namespace lookups.  Common procedure generates and prints the
lookup name as well as the formatted status.

Completed implementation of a new design for the Alias support
within the namespace.  The existing design did not handle the
case where a new object was assigned to one of the two names
due to the use of an explicit conversion operator, resulting
in the two names pointing to two different objects.  The new
design simply points the Alias name to the original name node
- not to the object.  This results in a level of indirection
that must be handled in the name resolution mechanism.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     151.7K Code,  62.4K Data,  214.1K Total


2) Linux

Initialize thermal driver's timer before it is used. (Knut
Neumann)

Allow handling negative celsius values. (Kochi Takayoshi)

Fix thermal management and make trip points. R/W (Pavel
Machek)

Fix /proc/acpi/sleep. (P. Christeas)

IA64 fixes. (David Mosberger)

Fix reversed logic in blacklist code. (Sergio Monteiro Basto)

Replace ACPI_DEBUG define with ACPI_DEBUG_OUTPUT. (Dominik
Brodowski)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Clarified some warning/error messages.


----------------------------------------
18 September 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem version 20020918:

Fixed a reported problem with reference chaining (via the
Index() and RefOf() operators) in the ObjectType() and
SizeOf() operators.  The definition of these operators
includes the dereferencing of all chained references to return
information on the base object.

Fixed a problem with stores to indexed package elements - the
existing code would not complete the store if an "implicit
conversion" was not performed.  In other words, if the
existing object (package element) was to be replaced
completely, the code didn't handle this case.

Relaxed typechecking on the ASL "Scope" operator to allow the
target name to refer to an object of type Integer, String, or
Buffer, in addition to the scoping object types (Device,
predefined Scopes, Processor, PowerResource, and ThermalZone.)
This allows existing AML code that has workarounds for a bug
in Windows to function properly.  A warning is issued,
however.  This affects both the AML interpreter and the iASL
compiler. Below is an example of this type of ASL code:

      Name(DEB,0x00)
      Scope(DEB)
      {

Fixed some reported problems with 64-bit integer support in
the local implementation of C library functions (clib.c)


2) Linux

Use ACPI fix map region instead of IOAPIC region, since it is
undefined in non-SMP.

Ensure that the SCI has the proper polarity and trigger, even
on systems that do not have an interrupt override entry in the
MADT.

2.5 big driver reorganization (Pat Mochel)

Use early table mapping code from acpitable.c (Andi Kleen)

New blacklist entries (Andi Kleen)

Blacklist improvements. Split blacklist code out into a
separate file. Move checking the blacklist to very early.
Previously, we would use ACPI tables, and then halfway through
init, check the blacklist -- too late. Now, it's early enough
to completely fall-back to non-ACPI.


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler version 20020918:

Fixed a problem where the typechecking code didn't know that
an alias could point to a method.  In other words, aliases
were not being dereferenced during typechecking.


----------------------------------------
29 August 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020829:

If the target of a Scope() operator already exists, it must be
an object type that actually opens a scope -- such as a
Device, Method, Scope, etc.  This is a fatal runtime error.
Similar error check has been added to the iASL compiler also.

Tightened up the namespace load to disallow multiple names in
the same scope.  This previously was allowed if both objects
were of the same type.  (i.e., a lookup was the same as
entering a new name).


2) Linux

Ensure that the ACPI interrupt has the proper trigger and
polarity.

local_irq_disable is extraneous. (Matthew Wilcox)

Make "acpi=off" actually do what it says, and not use the ACPI
interpreter *or* the tables.

Added arch-neutral support for parsing SLIT and SRAT tables
(Kochi Takayoshi)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler  Version 20020829:

Implemented namepath optimization for name declarations.  For
example, a declaration like "Method (\_SB_.ABCD)" would get
optimized to "Method (ABCD)" if the declaration is within the
\_SB_ scope.  This optimization is in addition to the named
reference path optimization first released in the previous
version. This would seem to complete all possible
optimizations for namepaths within the ASL/AML.

If the target of a Scope() operator already exists, it must be
an object type that actually opens a scope -- such as a
Device, Method, Scope, etc.

Implemented a check and warning for unreachable code in the
same block below a Return() statement.

Fixed a problem where the listing file was not generated if
the compiler aborted if the maximum error count was exceeded
(200).

Fixed a problem where the typechecking of method return values
was broken.  This includes the check for a return value when
the method is invoked as a TermArg (a return value is
expected.)

Fixed a reported problem where EOF conditions during a quoted
string or comment caused a fault.


----------------------------------------
15 August 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020815:

Fixed a reported problem where a Store to a method argument
that contains a reference did not perform the indirect store
correctly.  This problem was created during the conversion to
the new reference object model - the indirect store to a
method argument code was not updated to reflect the new model.

Reworked the ACPI mode change code to better conform to ACPI
2.0, handle corner cases, and improve code legibility (Kochi
Takayoshi)

Fixed a problem with the pathname parsing for the carat (^)
prefix.  The heavy use of the carat operator by the new
namepath optimization in the iASL compiler uncovered a problem
with the AML interpreter handling of this prefix.  In the case
where one or more carats precede a single nameseg, the nameseg
was treated as standalone and the search rule (to root) was
inadvertently applied.  This could cause both the iASL
compiler and the interpreter to find the wrong object or to
miss the error that should occur if the object does not exist
at that exact pathname.

Found and fixed the problem where the HP Pavilion DSDT would
not load.  This was a relatively minor tweak to the table
loading code (a problem caused by the unexpected encounter
with a method invocation not within a control method), but it
does not solve the overall issue of the execution of AML code
at the table level.  This investigation is still ongoing.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux

Remove redundant slab.h include (Brad Hards)

Fix several bugs in thermal.c (Herbert Nachtnebel)

Make CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT work properly (Pavel Machek)

Change acpi_system_suspend to use updated irq functions (Pavel
Machek)

Export acpi_get_firmware_table (Matthew Wilcox)

Use proper root proc entry for ACPI (Kochi Takayoshi)

Fix early-boot table parsing (Bjorn Helgaas)


3) iASL Compiler/Disassembler

Reworked the compiler options to make them more consistent and
to use two-letter options where appropriate.  We were running
out of sensible letters.   This may break some makefiles, so
check the current options list by invoking the compiler with
no parameters.

Completed the design and implementation of the ASL namepath
optimization option for the compiler.  This option optimizes
all references to named objects to the shortest possible path.
The first attempt tries to utilize a single nameseg (4
characters) and the "search-to-root" algorithm used by the
interpreter.  If that cannot be used (because either the name
is not in the search path or there is a conflict with another
object with the same name), the pathname is optimized using
the carat prefix (usually a shorter string than specifying the
entire path from the root.)

Implemented support to obtain the DSDT from the Windows
registry (when the disassembly option is specified with no
input file).  Added this code as the implementation for
AcpiOsTableOverride in the Windows OSL.  Migrated the 16-bit
code (used in the AcpiDump utility) to scan memory for the
DSDT to the AcpiOsTableOverride function in the DOS OSL to
make the disassembler truly OS independent.

Implemented a new option to disassemble and compile in one
step.  When used without an input filename, this option will
grab the DSDT from the local machine, disassemble it, and
compile it in one step.

Added a warning message for invalid escapes (a backslash
followed by any character other than the allowable escapes).
This catches the quoted string error "\_SB_" (which should be
"\\_SB_" ).  Also, there are numerous instances in the ACPI
specification where this error occurs.

Added a compiler option to disable all optimizations.  This is
basically the "compatibility mode" because by using this
option, the AML code will come out exactly the same as other
ASL compilers.

Added error messages for incorrectly ordered dependent
resource functions.  This includes: missing EndDependentFn
macro at end of dependent resource list, nested dependent
function macros (both start and end), and missing
StartDependentFn macro.  These are common errors that should
be caught at compile time.

Implemented _OSI support for the disassembler and compiler.
_OSI must be included in the namespace for proper disassembly
(because the disassembler must know the number of arguments.)

Added an "optimization" message type that is optional (off by
default).  This message is used for all optimizations -
including constant folding, integer optimization, and namepath
optimization.

----------------------------------------
25 July 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020725:

The AML Disassembler has been enhanced to produce compilable
ASL code and has been integrated into the iASL compiler (see
below) as well as the single-step disassembly for the AML
debugger and the disassembler for the AcpiDump utility.  All
ACPI 2.0A opcodes, resource templates and macros are fully
supported.  The disassembler has been tested on over 30
different AML files, producing identical AML when the
resulting disassembled ASL file is recompiled with the same
ASL compiler.

Modified the Resource Manager to allow zero interrupts and
zero dma channels during the GetCurrentResources call.  This
was causing problems on some platforms.

Added the AcpiOsRedirectOutput interface to the OSL to
simplify output redirection for the AcpiOsPrintf and
AcpiOsVprintf interfaces.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     142.9K Code,  58.7K Data,  201.6K Total
  Current Release:

    Debug Version:     149.4K Code,  61.6K Data,  211.0K Total


2) Linux

Fixed a panic in the EC driver (Dominik Brodowski)

Implemented checksum of the R/XSDT itself during Linux table
scan (Richard Schaal)


3) iASL compiler

The AML disassembler is integrated into the compiler.  The "-
d" option invokes the disassembler  to completely disassemble
an input AML file, producing as output a text ASL file with
the extension ".dsl" (to avoid name collisions with existing
.asl source files.)  A future enhancement will allow the
disassembler to obtain the BIOS DSDT from the registry under
Windows.

Fixed a problem with the VendorShort and VendorLong resource
descriptors where an invalid AML sequence was created.

Implemented a fix for BufferData term in the ASL parser.  It
was inadvertently defined twice, allowing invalid syntax to
pass and causing reduction conflicts.

Fixed a problem where the Ones opcode could get converted to a
value of zero if "Ones" was used where a byte, word or dword
value was expected.  The 64-bit value is now truncated to the
correct size with the correct value.


----------------------------------------
02 July 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020702:

The Table Manager code has been restructured to add several
new features.  Tables that are not required by the core
subsystem (other than the FADT, DSDT, FACS, PSDTs, etc.) are
no longer validated in any way and are returned from
AcpiGetFirmwareTable if requested.  The AcpiOsTableOverride
interface is now called for each table that is loaded by the
subsystem in order to allow the host to override any table it
chooses.  Previously, only the DSDT could be overridden.
Added one new files, tbrsdt.c and tbgetall.c.

Fixed a problem with the conversion of internal package
objects to external objects (when a package is returned from a
control method.)  The return buffer length was set to zero
instead of the proper length of the package object.

Fixed a reported problem with the use of the RefOf and DeRefOf
operators when passing reference arguments to control methods.
A new type of Reference object is used internally for
references produced by the RefOf operator.

Added additional error messages in the Resource Manager to
explain AE_BAD_DATA errors when they occur during resource
parsing.

Split the AcpiEnableSubsystem into two primitives to enable a
finer granularity initialization sequence.  These two calls
should be called in this order: AcpiEnableSubsystem (flags),
AcpiInitializeObjects (flags).  The flags parameter remains
the same.


2) Linux

Updated the ACPI utilities module to understand the new style
of fully resolved package objects that are now returned from
the core subsystem.  This eliminates errors of the form:

    ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0.PPB_._PRT]
    acpi_utils-0430 [145] acpi_evaluate_reference:
        Invalid element in package (not a device reference)

The method evaluation utility uses the new buffer allocation
scheme instead of calling AcpiEvaluate Object twice.

Added support for ECDT. This allows the use of the Embedded
Controller before the namespace has been fully initialized,
which is necessary for ACPI 2.0 support, and for some laptops
to initialize properly. (Laptops using ECDT are still rare, so
only limited testing was performed of the added
functionality.)

Fixed memory leaks in the EC driver.

Eliminated a brittle code structure in acpi_bus_init().

Eliminated the acpi_evaluate() helper function in utils.c. It
is no longer needed since acpi_evaluate_object can optionally
allocate memory for the return object.

Implemented fix for keyboard hang when getting battery
readings on some systems (Stephen White)

PCI IRQ routing update (Dominik Brodowski)

Fix an ifdef to allow compilation on UP with LAPIC but no
IOAPIC support

----------------------------------------
11 June 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020611:

Fixed a reported problem where constants such as Zero and One
appearing within _PRT packages were not handled correctly
within the resource manager code.  Originally reported against
the ASL compiler because the code generator now optimizes
integers to their minimal AML representation (i.e. AML
constants if possible.)  The _PRT code now handles all AML
constant opcodes correctly (Zero, One, Ones, Revision).

Fixed a problem with the Concatenate operator in the AML
interpreter where a buffer result object was incorrectly
marked as not fully evaluated, causing a run-time error of
AE_AML_INTERNAL.

All package sub-objects are now fully resolved before they are
returned from the external ACPI interfaces.  This means that
name strings are resolved to object handles, and constant
operators (Zero, One, Ones, Revision) are resolved to
Integers.

Implemented immediate resolution of the AML Constant opcodes
(Zero, One, Ones, Revision) to Integer objects upon detection
within the AML stream. This has simplified and reduced the
generated code size of the subsystem by eliminating about 10
switch statements for these constants (which previously were
contained in Reference objects.)  The complicating issues are
that the Zero opcode is used as a "placeholder" for
unspecified optional target operands and stores to constants
are defined to be no-ops.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the

2) Linux

Added preliminary support for obtaining _TRA data for PCI root
bridges (Bjorn Helgaas).


3) iASL Compiler Version X2046:

Fixed a problem where the "_DDN" reserved name was defined to
be a control method with one argument.  There are no
arguments, and _DDN does not have to be a control method.

Fixed a problem with the Linux version of the compiler where
the source lines printed with error messages were the wrong
lines.  This turned out to be the "LF versus CR/LF" difference
between Windows and Unix.  This appears to be the longstanding
issue concerning listing output and error messages.

Fixed a problem with the Linux version of compiler where
opcode names within error messages were wrong.  This was
caused by a slight difference in the output of the Flex tool
on Linux versus Windows.

Fixed a problem with the Linux compiler where the hex output
files contained some garbage data caused by an internal buffer
overrun.


----------------------------------------
17 May 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020517:

Implemented a workaround to an BIOS bug discovered on the HP
OmniBook where the FADT revision number and the table size are
inconsistent (ACPI 2.0 revision vs. ACPI 1.0 table size).  The
new behavior is to fallback to using only the ACPI 1.0 fields
of the FADT if the table is too small to be a ACPI 2.0 table
as claimed by the revision number.  Although this is a BIOS
bug, this is a case where the workaround is simple enough and
with no side effects, so it seemed prudent to add it.  A
warning message is issued, however.

Implemented minimum size checks for the fixed-length ACPI
tables -- the FADT and FACS, as well as consistency checks
between the revision number and the table size.

Fixed a reported problem in the table override support where
the new table pointer was incorrectly treated as a physical
address instead of a logical address.

Eliminated the use of the AE_AML_ERROR exception and replaced
it with more descriptive codes.

Fixed a problem where an exception would occur if an ASL Field
was defined with no named Field Units underneath it (used by
some index fields).

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux

Much work done on ACPI init (MADT and PCI IRQ routing
support). (Paul D. and Dominik Brodowski)

Fix PCI IRQ-related panic on boot (Sam Revitch)

Set BM_ARB_DIS when entering a sleep state (Ducrot Bruno)

Fix "MHz" typo (Dominik Brodowski)

Fix RTC year 2000 issue (Dominik Brodowski)

Preclude multiple button proc entries (Eric Brunet)

Moved arch-specific code out of include/platform/aclinux.h

3) iASL Compiler Version X2044:

Implemented error checking for the string used in the EISAID
macro (Usually used in the definition of the _HID object.)
The code now strictly enforces the PnP format - exactly 7
characters, 3 uppercase letters and 4 hex digits.

If a raw string is used in the definition of the _HID object
(instead of the EISAID macro), the string must contain all
alphanumeric characters (e.g., "*PNP0011" is not allowed
because of the asterisk.)

Implemented checking for invalid use of ACPI reserved names
for most of the name creation operators (Name, Device, Event,
Mutex, OperationRegion, PowerResource, Processor, and
ThermalZone.)  Previously, this check was only performed for
control methods.

Implemented an additional check on the Name operator to emit
an error if a reserved name that must be implemented in ASL as
a control method is used.  We know that a reserved name must
be a method if it is defined with input arguments.

The warning emitted when a namespace object reference is not
found during the cross reference phase has been changed into
an error.  The "External" directive should be used for names
defined in other modules.


4) Tools and Utilities

The 16-bit tools (adump16 and aexec16) have been regenerated
and tested.

Fixed a problem with the output of both acpidump and adump16
where the indentation of closing parentheses and brackets was
not aligned properly with the parent block.


----------------------------------------
03 May 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020503:

Added support a new OSL interface that allows the host
operating system software to override the DSDT found in the
firmware - AcpiOsTableOverride.  With this interface, the OSL
can examine the version of the firmware DSDT and replace it
with a different one if desired.

Added new external interfaces for accessing ACPI registers
from device drivers and other system software -
AcpiGetRegister and AcpiSetRegister.  This was simply an
externalization of the existing AcpiHwBitRegister interfaces.

Fixed a regression introduced in the previous build where the
ASL/AML CreateField operator always returned an error,
"destination must be a NS Node".

Extended the maximum time (before failure) to successfully
enable ACPI mode to 3 seconds.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

  Previous Release
    Non-Debug Version:  68.5K Code,   7.0K Data,   75.5K Total
    Debug Version:     142.4K Code,  58.3K Data,  200.7K Total
  Current Release:

    Debug Version:     142.9K Code,  58.4K Data,  201.3K Total


2) Linux

Enhanced ACPI init code for SMP. We are now fully MPS and $PIR-
free. While 3 out of 4 of our in-house systems work fine, the
last one still hangs when testing the LAPIC timer.

Renamed many files in 2.5 kernel release to omit "acpi_" from
the name.

Added warning on boot for Presario 711FR.

Sleep improvements (Pavel Machek)

ACPI can now be built without CONFIG_PCI enabled.

IA64: Fixed memory map functions (JI Lee)


3) iASL Compiler Version X2043:

Added support to allow the compiler to be integrated into the
MS VC++ development environment for one-button compilation of
single files or entire projects -- with error-to-source-line
mapping.

Implemented support for compile-time constant folding for the
Type3, Type4, and Type5 opcodes first defined in the ACPI 2.0
specification.  This allows the ASL writer to use expressions
instead of Integer/Buffer/String constants in terms that must
evaluate to constants at compile time and will also simplify
the emitted AML in any such sub-expressions that can be folded
(evaluated at compile-time.)  This increases the size of the
compiler significantly because a portion of the ACPI CA AML
interpreter is included within the compiler in order to pre-
evaluate constant expressions.

Fixed a problem with the "Unicode" ASL macro that caused the
compiler to fault.  (This macro is used in conjunction with
the _STR reserved name.)

Implemented an AML opcode optimization to use the Zero, One,
and Ones opcodes where possible to further reduce the size of
integer constants and thus reduce the overall size of the
generated AML code.

Implemented error checking for new reserved terms for ACPI
version 2.0A.

Implemented the -qr option to display the current list of ACPI
reserved names known to the compiler.

Implemented the -qc option to display the current list of ASL
operators that are allowed within constant expressions and can
therefore be folded at compile time if the operands are
constants.


4) Documentation

Updated the Programmer's Reference for new interfaces, data
types, and memory allocation model options.

Updated the iASL Compiler User Reference to apply new format
and add information about new features and options.

----------------------------------------
19 April 2002.  Summary of changes for this release.

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020419:

The source code base for the Core Subsystem has been
completely cleaned with PC-lint (FlexLint) for both 32-bit and
64-bit versions.  The Lint option files used are included in
the /acpi/generate/lint directory.

Implemented enhanced status/error checking across the entire
Hardware manager subsystem.  Any hardware errors (reported
from the OSL) are now bubbled up and will abort a running
control method.

Fixed a problem where the per-ACPI-table integer width (32 or
64) was stored only with control method nodes, causing a fault
when non-control method code was executed during table
loading.  The solution implemented uses a global variable to
indicate table width across the entire ACPI subsystem.
Therefore, ACPI CA does not support mixed integer widths
across different ACPI tables (DSDT, SSDT).

Fixed a problem where NULL extended fields (X fields) in an
ACPI 2.0 ACPI FADT caused the table load to fail.  Although
the existing ACPI specification is a bit fuzzy on this topic,
the new behavior is to fall back on a ACPI 1.0 field if the
corresponding ACPI 2.0 X field is zero (even though the table
revision indicates a full ACPI 2.0 table.)  The ACPI
specification will be updated to clarify this issue.

Fixed a problem with the SystemMemory operation region handler
where memory was always accessed byte-wise even if the AML-
specified access width was larger than a byte.  This caused
problems on systems with memory-mapped I/O.  Memory is now
accessed with the width specified.  On systems that do not
support non-aligned transfers, a check is made to guarantee
proper address alignment before proceeding in order to avoid
an AML-caused alignment fault within the kernel.

Fixed a problem with the ExtendedIrq resource where only one
byte of the 4-byte Irq field was extracted.

Fixed the AcpiExDigitsNeeded() procedure to support _UID.
This function was out of date and required a rewrite.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux

PCI IRQ routing fixes (Dominik Brodowski)


3) iASL Compiler Version X2042:

Implemented an additional compile-time error check for a field
unit whose size + minimum access width would cause a run-time
access beyond the end-of-region.  Previously, only the field
size itself was checked.

The Core subsystem and iASL compiler now share a common parse
object in preparation for compile-time evaluation of the type
3/4/5 ASL operators.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 03_29_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020329:

Implemented support for late evaluation of TermArg operands to
Buffer and Package objects.  This allows complex expressions
to be used in the declarations of these object types.

Fixed an ACPI 1.0 compatibility issue when reading Fields. In
ACPI 1.0, if the field was larger than 32 bits, it was
returned as a buffer - otherwise it was returned as an
integer.  In ACPI 2.0, the field is returned as a buffer only
if the field is larger than 64 bits.  The TableRevision is now
considered when making this conversion to avoid
incompatibility with existing ASL code.

Implemented logical addressing for AcpiOsGetRootPointer.  This
allows an RSDP with either a logical or physical address.
With this support, the host OS can now override all ACPI
tables with one logical RSDP.  Includes implementation of
"typed" pointer support to allow a common data type for both
physical and logical pointers internally.  This required a
change to the AcpiOsGetRootPointer interface.

Implemented the use of ACPI 2.0 Generic Address Structures for
all GPE, Fixed Event, and PM Timer I/O.  This allows the use
of memory mapped I/O for these ACPI features.

Initialization now ignores not only non-required tables (All
tables other than the FADT, FACS, DSDT, and SSDTs), but also
does not validate the table headers of unrecognized tables.

Fixed a problem where a notify handler could only be
installed/removed on an object of type Device.  All "notify"
objects are now supported -- Devices, Processor, Power, and
Thermal.

Removed most verbosity from the ACPI_DB_INFO debug level.
Only critical information is returned when this debug level is
enabled.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

    Debug Version:     138.0K Code,  56.6K Data,  194.6K Total
  Current Release:

    Debug Version:     139.8K Code,  57.4K Data,  197.2K Total


2) Linux:

The processor driver (acpi_processor.c) now fully supports
ACPI 2.0-based processor performance control (e.g. Intel(R)
SpeedStep(TM) technology) Note that older laptops that only
have the Intel "applet" interface are not supported through
this.  The 'limit' and 'performance' interface (/proc) are
fully functional.  [Note that basic policy for controlling
performance state transitions will be included in the next
version of ospmd.]  The idle handler was modified to more
aggressively use C2, and PIIX4 errata handling underwent a
complete overhaul (big thanks to Dominik Brodowski).

Added support for ACPI-PCI device binding (acpi_pci_root.c).
_ADR-based devices in the ACPI namespace are now dynamically
bound (associated) with their PCI counterparts (e.g. PCI1-
>01:00.0).  This allows, among other things, ACPI to resolve
bus numbers for subordinate PCI bridges.

Enhanced PCI IRQ routing to get the proper bus number for _PRT
entries defined underneath PCI bridges.

Added IBM 600E to bad bios list due to invalid _ADR value for
PIIX4 PCI-ISA bridge, resulting in improper PCI IRQ routing.

In the process of adding full MADT support (e.g. IOAPIC) for
IA32 (acpi.c, mpparse.c) -- stay tuned.

Added back visual differentiation between fixed-feature and
control-method buttons in dmesg.  Buttons are also subtyped
(e.g. button/power/PWRF) to simplify button identification.

We no longer use -Wno-unused when compiling debug. Please
ignore any "_THIS_MODULE defined but not used" messages.

Can now shut down the system using "magic sysrq" key.


3) iASL Compiler version 2041:

Fixed a problem where conversion errors for hex/octal/decimal
constants were not reported.

Implemented a fix for the General Register template Address
field.  This field was 8 bits when it should be 64.

Fixed a problem where errors/warnings were no longer being
emitted within the listing output file.

Implemented the ACPI 2.0A restriction on ACPI Table Signatures
to exactly 4 characters, alphanumeric only.




----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 03_08_02


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem Version 20020308:

Fixed a problem with AML Fields where the use of the
"AccessAny" keyword could cause an interpreter error due to
attempting to read or write beyond the end of the parent
Operation Region.

Fixed a problem in the SystemMemory Operation Region handler
where an attempt was made to map memory beyond the end of the
region.  This was the root cause of the "AE_ERROR" and
"AE_NO_MEMORY" errors on some Linux systems.

Fixed a problem where the interpreter/namespace "search to
root" algorithm was not functioning for some object types.
Relaxed the internal restriction on the search to allow
upsearches for all external object types as well as most
internal types.


2) Linux:

We now use safe_halt() macro versus individual calls to sti |
hlt.

Writing to the processor limit interface should now work.
"echo 1" will increase the limit, 2 will decrease, and 0 will
reset to the default.


3) ASL compiler:

Fixed segfault on Linux version.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this release: 02_25_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:


Fixed a problem where the GPE bit masks were not initialized
properly, causing erratic GPE behavior.

Implemented limited support for multiple calling conventions.
The code can be generated with either the VPL (variable
parameter list, or "C") convention, or the FPL (fixed
parameter list, or "Pascal") convention.  The core subsystem
is about 3.4% smaller when generated with FPL.


2) Linux

Re-add some /proc/acpi/event functionality that was lost
during the rewrite

Resolved issue with /proc events for fixed-feature buttons
showing up as the system device.

Fixed checks on C2/C3 latencies to be inclusive of maximum
values.

Replaced AE_ERRORs in acpi_osl.c with more specific error
codes.

Changed ACPI PRT option from "pci=noacpi-routing" to
"pci=noacpi"

Fixed limit interface & usage to fix bugs with passive cooling
hysterisis.

Restructured PRT support.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_14_02


1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented support in AcpiLoadTable to allow loading of FACS
and FADT tables.

Suport for the now-obsolete interim 0.71 64-bit ACPI tables
has been removed.  All 64-bit platforms should be migrated to
the ACPI 2.0 tables.  The actbl71.h header has been removed
from the source tree.

All C macros defined within the subsystem have been prefixed
with "ACPI_" to avoid collision with other system include
files.

Removed the return value for the two AcpiOsPrint interfaces,
since it is never used and causes lint warnings for ignoring
the return value.

Added error checking to all internal mutex acquire and release
calls.  Although a failure from one of these interfaces is
probably a fatal system error, these checks will cause the
immediate abort of the currently executing method or
interface.

Fixed a problem where the AcpiSetCurrentResources interface
could fault.  This was a side effect of the deployment of the
new memory allocation model.

Fixed a couple of problems with the Global Lock support
introduced in the last major build.  The "common" (1.0/2.0)
internal FACS was being overwritten with the FACS signature
and clobbering the Global Lock pointer.  Also, the actual
firmware FACS was being unmapped after construction of the
"common" FACS, preventing access to the actual Global Lock
field within it.  The "common" internal FACS is no longer
installed as an actual ACPI table; it is used simply as a
global.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below.  These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux

Updated Linux-specific code for core macro and OSL interface
changes described above.

Improved /proc/acpi/event. It now can be opened only once and
has proper poll functionality.

Fixed and restructured power management (acpi_bus).

Only create /proc "view by type" when devices of that class
exist.

Fixed "charging/discharging" bug (and others) in acpi_battery.

Improved thermal zone code.


3) ASL Compiler, version X2039:

Implemented the new compiler restriction on ASL String
hex/octal escapes to non-null, ASCII values.  An error results
if an invalid value is used.  (This will require an ACPI 2.0
specification change.)

AML object labels that are output to the optional C and ASM
source are now prefixed with both the ACPI table signature and
table ID to help guarantee uniqueness within a large BIOS
project.


----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_01_02

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

ACPI 2.0 support is complete in the entire Core Subsystem and
the ASL compiler. All new ACPI 2.0 operators are implemented
and all other changes for ACPI 2.0 support are complete.  With
simultaneous code and data optimizations throughout the
subsystem, ACPI 2.0 support has been implemented with almost
no additional cost in terms of code and data size.

Implemented a new mechanism for allocation of return buffers.
If the buffer length is set to ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER, the
buffer will be allocated on behalf of the caller.
Consolidated all return buffer validation and allocation to a
common procedure.  Return buffers will be allocated via the
primary OSL allocation interface since it appears that a
separate pool is not needed by most users.  If a separate pool
is required for these buffers, the caller can still use the
original mechanism and pre-allocate the buffer(s).

Implemented support for string operands within the DerefOf
operator.

Restructured the Hardware and Event managers to be table
driven, simplifying the source code and reducing the amount of
generated code.

Split the common read/write low-level ACPI register bitfield
procedure into a separate read and write, simplifying the code
considerably.

Obsoleted the AcpiOsCallocate OSL interface.  This interface
was used only a handful of times and didn't have enough
critical mass for a separate interface.  Replaced with a
common calloc procedure in the core.

Fixed a reported problem with the GPE number mapping mechanism
that allows GPE1 numbers to be non-contiguous with GPE0.
Reorganized the GPE information and shrunk a large array that
was originally large enough to hold info for all possible GPEs
(256) to simply large enough to hold all GPEs up to the
largest GPE number on the machine.

Fixed a reported problem with resource structure alignment on
64-bit platforms.

Changed the AcpiEnableEvent and AcpiDisableEvent external
interfaces to not require any flags for the common case of
enabling/disabling a GPE.

Implemented support to allow a "Notify" on a Processor object.

Most TBDs in comments within the source code have been
resolved and eliminated.

Fixed a problem in the interpreter where a standalone parent
prefix (^) was not handled correctly in the interpreter and
debugger.

Removed obsolete and unnecessary GPE save/restore code.

Implemented Field support in the ASL Load operator.  This
allows a table to be loaded from a named field, in addition to
loading a table directly from an Operation Region.

Implemented timeout and handle support in the external Global
Lock interfaces.

Fixed a problem in the AcpiDump utility where pathnames were
no longer being generated correctly during the dump of named
objects.

Modified the AML debugger to give a full display of if/while
predicates instead of just one AML opcode at a time.  (The
predicate can have several nested ASL statements.)  The old
method was confusing during single stepping.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

2) Linux

 Implemented fix for PIIX reverse throttling errata (Processor
driver)

Added new Limit interface (Processor and Thermal drivers)

New thermal policy (Thermal driver)

Many updates to /proc

Battery "low" event support (Battery driver)

Supports ACPI PCI IRQ routing (PCI Link and PCI root drivers)

IA32 - IA64 initialization unification, no longer experimental

Menuconfig options redesigned

3) ASL Compiler, version X2037:

Implemented several new output features to simplify
integration of AML code into  firmware: 1) Output the AML in C
source code with labels for each named ASL object.  The
original ASL source code is interleaved as C comments. 2)
Output the AML in ASM source code with labels and interleaved
ASL    source. 3) Output the AML in raw hex table form, in
either C or ASM.

Implemented support for optional string parameters to the
LoadTable operator.

Completed support for embedded escape sequences within string
literals.  The compiler now supports all single character
escapes as well as the Octal and Hex escapes.  Note: the
insertion of a null byte into a string literal (via the
hex/octal escape) causes the string to be immediately
terminated.  A warning is issued.

Fixed a problem where incorrect AML was generated for the case
where an ASL namepath consists of a single parent prefix (

) with no trailing name segments.

The compiler has been successfully generated with a 64-bit C
compiler.




----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_18_01

1) Linux

Enhanced blacklist with reason and severity fields. Any
table's signature may now be used to identify a blacklisted
system.

Call _PIC control method to inform the firmware which
interrupt model the OS is using. Turn on any disabled link
devices.

Cleaned up busmgr /proc error handling (Andreas Dilger)

 2) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented ACPI 2.0 semantics for the "Break" operator (Exit
from while loop)

Completed implementation of the ACPI 2.0 "Continue",
"ConcatenateResTemplate", "DataTableRegion", and "LoadTable"
operators.  All new ACPI 2.0 operators are now implemented in
both the ASL compiler and the AML interpreter.  The only
remaining ACPI 2.0 task is support for the String data type in
the DerefOf operator.  Fixed a problem with AcquireMutex where
the status code was lost if the caller had to actually wait
for the mutex.

Increased the maximum ASL Field size from 64K bits to 4G bits.

Completed implementation of the external Global Lock
interfaces -- AcpiAcquireGlobalLock and AcpiReleaseGlobalLock.
The Timeout and Handler parameters were added.

Completed another pass at removing warnings and issues when
compiling with 64-bit compilers.  The code now compiles
cleanly with the Intel 64-bit C/C++ compiler.  Most notably,
the pointer add and subtract (diff) macros have changed
considerably.

Created and deployed a new ACPI_SIZE type that is 64-bits wide
on 64-bit platforms, 32-bits on all others.  This type is used
wherever memory allocation and/or the C sizeof() operator is
used, and affects the OSL memory allocation interfaces
AcpiOsAllocate and AcpiOsCallocate.

Implemented sticky user breakpoints in the AML debugger.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size. Note that these
values will vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler
and the compiler options used during generation.

Now checks for (and generates an error if detected) the use of
a Break or Continue statement without an enclosing While
statement.

Successfully generated the compiler with the Intel 64-bit C
compiler.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_05_01

 1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The ACPI 2.0 CopyObject operator is fully implemented.  This
operator creates a new copy of an object (and is also used to
bypass the "implicit conversion" mechanism of the Store
operator.)

The ACPI 2.0 semantics for the SizeOf operator are fully
implemented.  The change is that performing a SizeOf on a
reference object causes an automatic dereference of the object
to tha actual value before the size is evaluated. This
behavior was undefined in ACPI 1.0.

The ACPI 2.0 semantics for the Extended IRQ resource
descriptor have been implemented.  The interrupt polarity and
mode are now independently set.

Fixed a problem where ASL Constants (Zero, One, Ones,
Revision) appearing in Package objects were not properly
converted to integers when the internal Package was converted
to an external object (via the AcpiEvaluateObject interface.)

Fixed a problem with the namespace object deletion mechanism
for objects created by control methods.  There were two parts
to this problem: 1) Objects created during the initialization
phase method parse were not being deleted, and 2) The object
owner ID mechanism to track objects was broken.

Fixed a problem where the use of the ASL Scope operator within
a control method would result in an invalid opcode exception.

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where the
buffer length required for the _PRT structure was not being
returned correctly.

Code and Data Size: Current core subsystem library sizes are
shown below. These are the code and data sizes for the
acpica.lib produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler,
and these values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.
The debug version of the code includes the debug output trace
mechanism and has a larger code and data size.  Note that
these values will vary depending on the efficiency of the
compiler and the compiler options used during generation.

 2) Linux:

Updated all files to apply cleanly against 2.4.16.

Added basic PCI Interrupt Routing Table (PRT) support for IA32
(acpi_pci.c), and unified the PRT code for IA32 and IA64.
This version supports both static and dyanmic PRT entries, but
dynamic entries are treated as if they were static (not yet
reconfigurable).  Architecture- specific code to use this data
is absent on IA32 but should be available shortly.

Changed the initialization sequence to start the ACPI
interpreter (acpi_init) prior to initialization of the PCI
driver (pci_init) in init/main.c.  This ordering is required
to support PRT and facilitate other (future) enhancement.  A
side effect is that the ACPI bus driver and certain device
drivers can no longer be loaded as modules.

Modified the 'make menuconfig' options to allow PCI Interrupt
Routing support to be included without the ACPI Bus and other
device drivers.

 3) ASL Compiler, version X2033:

Fixed some issues with the use of the new CopyObject and
DataTableRegion operators.  Both are fully functional.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_20_01

 20 November 2001.  Summary of changes for this release.

 1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Updated Index support to match ACPI 2.0 semantics.  Storing a
Integer, String, or Buffer to an Index of a Buffer will store
only the least-significant byte of the source to the Indexed
buffer byte.  Multiple writes are not performed.

Fixed a problem where the access type used in an AccessAs ASL
operator was not recorded correctly into the field object.

Fixed a problem where ASL Event objects were created in a
signalled state. Events are now created in an unsignalled
state.

The internal object cache is now purged after table loading
and initialization to reduce the use of dynamic kernel memory
-- on the assumption that object use is greatest during the
parse phase of the entire table (versus the run-time use of
individual control methods.)

ACPI 2.0 variable-length packages are now fully operational.

Code and Data Size: Code and Data optimizations have permitted
new feature development with an actual reduction in the
library size.  Current core subsystem library sizes are shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism
and has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the
compiler options used during generation.

 2) Linux:

Enhanced the ACPI boot-time initialization code to allow the
use of Local APIC tables for processor enumeration on IA-32,
and to pave the way for a fully MPS-free boot (on SMP systems)
in the near future.  This functionality replaces
arch/i386/kernel/acpitables.c, which was introduced in an
earlier 2.4.15-preX release.  To enable this feature you must
add "acpi_boot=on" to the kernel command line -- see the help
entry for CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT for more information.  An IA-64
release is in the works...

Restructured the configuration options to allow boot-time
table parsing support without inclusion of the ACPI
Interpreter (and other) code.

NOTE: This release does not include fixes for the reported
events, power-down, and thermal passive cooling issues (coming
soon).

 3) ASL Compiler:

Added additional typechecking for Fields within restricted
access Operation Regions.  All fields within EC and CMOS
regions must be declared with ByteAcc. All fields withing
SMBus regions must be declared with the BufferAcc access type.

Fixed a problem where the listing file output of control
methods no longer interleaved the actual AML code with the ASL
source code.



----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_09_01

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Implemented ACPI 2.0-defined support for writes to fields with
a Buffer, String, or Integer source operand that is smaller
than the target field. In these cases, the source operand is
zero-extended to fill the target field.

Fixed a problem where a Field starting bit offset (within the
parent operation region) was calculated incorrectly if the
alignment of the field differed from the access width.  This
affected CreateWordField, CreateDwordField, CreateQwordField,
and possibly other fields that use the "AccessAny" keyword.

Fixed a problem introduced in the 11_02_01 release where
indirect stores through method arguments did not operate
correctly.

2) Linux:

Implemented boot-time ACPI table parsing support
(CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT) for IA32 and IA64 UP/SMP systems.  This
code facilitates the use of ACPI tables (e.g. MADT, SRAT)
rather than legacy BIOS interfaces (e.g. MPS) for the
configuration of system processors, memory, and interrupts
during setup_arch().  Note that this patch does not include
the required architecture-specific changes required to apply
this information -- subsequent patches will be posted for both
IA32 and IA64 to achieve this.

Added low-level sleep support for IA32 platforms, courtesy of
Pat Mochel. This allows IA32 systems to transition to/from
various sleeping states (e.g. S1, S3), although the lack of a
centralized driver model and power-manageable drivers will
prevent its (successful) use on most systems.

Revamped the ACPI 'menuconfig' layout: created new "ACPI
Support" submenu, unified IA32 and IA64 options, added new
"Boot using ACPI tables" option, etc.

Increased the default timeout for the EC driver from 1ms to
10ms (1000 cycles of 10us) to try to address AE_TIME errors
during EC transactions.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_02_01

1) ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

ACPI 2.0 Support: Implemented ACPI 2.0 64-bit Field access
(QWordAcc keyword). All ACPI 2.0 64-bit support is now
implemented.

OSL Interfaces: Several of the OSL (AcpiOs*) interfaces
required changes to support ACPI 2.0 Qword field access.
Read/Write PciConfiguration(), Read/Write Memory(), and
Read/Write Port() now accept an ACPI_INTEGER (64 bits) as the
value parameter.  Also, the value parameter for the address
space handler interface is now an ACPI_INTEGER.  OSL
implementations of these interfaces must now handle the case
where the Width parameter is 64.

Index Fields: Fixed a problem where unaligned bit assembly and
disassembly for IndexFields was not supported correctly.

Index and Bank Fields:  Nested Index and Bank Fields are now
supported. During field access, a check is performed to ensure
that the value written to an Index or Bank register is not out
of the range of the register.  The Index (or Bank) register is
written before each access to the field data. Future support
will include allowing individual IndexFields to be wider than
the DataRegister width.

Fields: Fixed a problem where the AML interpreter was
incorrectly attempting to write beyond the end of a
Field/OpRegion.  This was a boundary case that occurred when a
DWORD field was written to a BYTE access OpRegion, forcing
multiple writes and causing the interpreter to write one datum
too many.

Fields: Fixed a problem with Field/OpRegion access where the
starting bit address of a field was incorrectly calculated if
the current access type was wider than a byte (WordAcc,
DwordAcc, or QwordAcc).

Fields: Fixed a problem where forward references to individual
FieldUnits (individual Field names within a Field definition)
were not resolved during the AML table load.

Fields: Fixed a problem where forward references from a Field
definition to the parent Operation Region definition were not
resolved during the AML table load.

Fields: Duplicate FieldUnit names within a scope are now
detected during AML table load.

Acpi Interfaces: Fixed a problem where the AcpiGetName()
interface returned an incorrect name for the root node.

Code and Data Size: Code and Data optimizations have permitted
new feature development with an actual reduction in the
library size.  Current core subsystem library sizes are shown
below.  These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib
produced by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these
values do not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug
version of the code includes the debug output trace mechanism
and has a larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the
compiler options used during generation.

handler interface changes described above.

----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 10_18_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem with the internal object reference count
mechanism that occasionally caused premature object deletion.
This resolves all of the outstanding problem reports where an
object is deleted in the middle of an interpreter evaluation.
Although this problem only showed up in rather obscure cases,
the solution to the problem involved an adjustment of all
reference counts involving objects attached to namespace
nodes.

Fixed a problem with Field support in the interpreter where
writing to an aligned field whose length is an exact multiple
(2 or greater) of the field access granularity would cause an
attempt to write beyond the end of the field.

The top level AML opcode execution functions within the
interpreter have been renamed with a more meaningful and
consistent naming convention.  The modules exmonad.c and
exdyadic.c were eliminated.  New modules are exoparg1.c,
exoparg2.c, exoparg3.c, and exoparg6.c.

Support for the ACPI 2.0 "Mid" ASL operator has been
implemented.

Fixed a problem where the AML debugger was causing some
internal objects to not be deleted during subsystem
termination.

Fixed a problem with the external AcpiEvaluateObject interface
where the subsystem would fault if the named object to be
evaluated refered to a constant such as Zero, Ones, etc.

Fixed a problem with IndexFields and BankFields where the
subsystem would fault if the index, data, or bank registers
were not defined in the same scope as the field itself.

Added printf format string checking for compilers that support
this feature.  Corrected more than 50 instances of issues with
format specifiers within invocations of ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT
throughout the core subsystem code.

The ASL "Revision" operator now returns the ACPI support level
implemented in the core - the value "2" since the ACPI 2.0
support is more than 50% implemented.

Enhanced the output of the AML debugger "dump namespace"
command to output in a more human-readable form.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.
These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced
by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do
not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version
of the code includes the full debug trace mechanism -- leading
to a much larger code and data size.  Note that these values
will vary depending on the efficiency of the compiler and the
compiler options used during generation.

Linux:

Implemented a "Bad BIOS Blacklist" to track machines that have
known ASL/AML problems.

Enhanced the /proc interface for the thermal zone driver and
added support for _HOT (the critical suspend trip point).  The
'info' file now includes threshold/policy information, and
allows setting of _SCP (cooling preference) and _TZP (polling
frequency) values to the 'info' file. Examples: "echo tzp=5 >
info" sets the polling frequency to 5 seconds, and "echo scp=1
> info" sets the cooling preference to the passive/quiet mode
(if supported by the ASL).

Implemented a workaround for a gcc bug that resuted in an OOPs
when loading the control method battery driver.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_20_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The AcpiEnableEvent and AcpiDisableEvent interfaces have been
modified to allow individual GPE levels to be flagged as wake-
enabled (i.e., these GPEs are to remain enabled when the
platform sleeps.)

The AcpiEnterSleepState and AcpiLeaveSleepState interfaces now
support wake-enabled GPEs.  This means that upon entering the
sleep state, all GPEs that are not wake-enabled are disabled.
When leaving the sleep state, these GPEs are reenabled.

A local double-precision divide/modulo module has been added
to enhance portability to OS kernels where a 64-bit math
library is not available.  The new module is "utmath.c".

Several optimizations have been made to reduce the use of CPU
stack.  Originally over 2K, the maximum stack usage is now
below 2K at 1860  bytes (1.82k)

Fixed a problem with the AcpiGetFirmwareTable interface where
the root table pointer was not mapped into a logical address
properly.

Fixed a problem where a NULL pointer was being dereferenced in
the interpreter code for the ASL Notify operator.

Fixed a problem where the use of the ASL Revision operator
returned an error. This operator now returns the current
version of the ACPI CA core subsystem.

Fixed a problem where objects passed as control method
parameters to AcpiEvaluateObject were always deleted at method
termination.  However, these objects may end up being stored
into the namespace by the called method.  The object reference
count mechanism was applied to these objects instead of a
force delete.

Fixed a problem where static strings or buffers (contained in
the AML code) that are declared as package elements within the
ASL code could cause a fault because the interpreter would
attempt to delete them.  These objects are now marked with the
"static object" flag to prevent any attempt to delete them.

Implemented an interpreter optimization to use operands
directly from the state object instead of extracting the
operands to local variables.  This reduces stack use and code
size, and improves performance.

The module exxface.c was eliminated as it was an unnecessary
extra layer of code.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.
These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced
by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do
not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version

ACPI Integer objects are now 64 bits wide

All Acpi data types and structures are now in lower case.
Only Acpi macros are upper case for differentiation.

 Documentation:

Changes to the external interfaces as described above.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_31_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

A bug with interpreter implementation of the ASL Divide
operator was found and fixed.  The implicit function return
value (not the explicit store operands) was returning the
remainder instead of the quotient.  This was a longstanding
bug and it fixes several known outstanding issues on various
platforms.

The ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT and function trace entry/exit macros have
been further optimized for size.  There are 700 invocations of
the DEBUG_PRINT macro alone, so each optimization reduces the
size of the debug version of the subsystem significantly.

A stack trace mechanism has been implemented.  The maximum
stack usage is about 2K on 32-bit platforms.  The debugger
command "stat stack" will display the current maximum stack
usage.

All public symbols and global variables within the subsystem
are now prefixed with the string "Acpi".  This keeps all of
the symbols grouped together in a kernel map, and avoids
conflicts with other kernel subsystems.

Most of the internal fixed lookup tables have been moved into
the code segment via the const operator.

Several enhancements have been made to the interpreter to both
reduce the code size and improve performance.

Current core subsystem library code sizes are shown below.
These are the code and data sizes for the acpica.lib produced
by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, and these values do
not include any ACPI driver or OSPM code.  The debug version
of the code includes the full debug trace mechanism which
contains over 700 invocations of the DEBUG_PRINT macro, 500
function entry macro invocations, and over 900 function exit
macro invocations -- leading to a much larger code and data
size.  Note that these values will vary depending on the
efficiency of the compiler and the compiler options used
during generation.

 Linux:

Implemented wbinvd() macro, pending a kernel-wide definition.

Fixed /proc/acpi/event to handle poll() and short reads.

 ASL Compiler, version X2026:

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where the AML
code emitted for package objects produced packages with zero
length.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_16_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

The following ACPI 2.0 ASL operators have been implemented in
the AML interpreter (These are already supported by the Intel
ASL compiler):  ToDecimalString, ToHexString, ToString,
ToInteger, and ToBuffer.  Support for 64-bit AML constants is
implemented in the AML parser, debugger, and disassembler.

The internal memory tracking mechanism (leak detection code)
has been upgraded to reduce the memory overhead (a separate
tracking block is no longer allocated for each memory
allocation), and now supports all of the internal object
caches.

The data structures and code for the internal object caches
have been coelesced and optimized so that there is a single
cache and memory list data structure and a single group of
functions that implement generic cache management.  This has
reduced the code size in both the debug and release versions
of the subsystem.

The DEBUG_PRINT macro(s) have been optimized for size and
replaced by ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT.  The syntax for this macro is
slightly different, because it generates a single call to an
internal function.  This results in a savings of about 90
bytes per invocation, resulting in an overall code and data
savings of about 16% in the debug version of the subsystem.

 Linux:

Fixed C3 disk corruption problems and re-enabled C3 on
supporting machines.

Integrated low-level sleep code by Patrick Mochel.

Further tweaked source code Linuxization.

Other minor fixes.

 ASL Compiler:

Support for ACPI 2.0 variable length packages is
fixed/completed.

Fixed a problem where the optional length parameter for the
ACPI 2.0 ToString operator.

Fixed multiple extraneous error messages when a syntax error
is detected within the declaration line of a control method.

 ----------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_17_01

ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Added a new interface named AcpiGetFirmwareTable to obtain any
ACPI table via the ACPI signature.  The interface can be
called at any time during kernel initialization, even before
the kernel virtual memory manager is initialized and paging is
enabled.  This allows kernel subsystems to obtain ACPI tables
very early, even before the ACPI CA subsystem is initialized.

Fixed a problem where Fields defined with the AnyAcc attribute
could be resolved to the incorrect address under the following
conditions: 1) the field width is larger than 8 bits and 2)
the parent operation region is not defined on a DWORD
boundary.

Fixed a problem where the interpreter is not being locked
during namespace initialization (during execution of the _INI
control methods), causing an error when an attempt is made to
release it later.

ACPI 2.0 support in the AML Interpreter has begun and will be
ongoing throughout the rest of this year.  In this label, The
Mod operator is implemented.

Added a new data type to contain full PCI addresses named
ACPI_PCI_ID. This structure contains the PCI Segment, Bus,
Device, and Function values.

 Linux:

Enhanced the Linux version of the source code to change most
capitalized ACPI type names to lowercase. For example, all
instances of ACPI_STATUS are changed to acpi_status.  This
will result in a large diff, but the change is strictly
cosmetic and aligns the CA code closer to the Linux coding
standard.

OSL Interfaces:

The interfaces to the PCI configuration space have been
changed to add the PCI Segment number and to split the single
32-bit combined DeviceFunction field into two 16-bit fields.
This was accomplished by moving the four values that define an
address in PCI configuration space (segment, bus, device, and
function) to the new ACPI_PCI_ID structure.

The changes to the PCI configuration space interfaces led to a
reexamination of the complete set of address space access
interfaces for PCI, I/O, and Memory.  The previously existing
18 interfaces have proven difficult to maintain (any small
change must be propagated across at least 6 interfaces) and do
not easily allow for future expansion to 64 bits if necessary.
Also, on some systems, it would not be appropriate to
demultiplex the access width (8, 16, 32,or 64) before calling
the OSL if the corresponding native OS interfaces contain a
similar access width parameter.  For these reasons, the 18
address space interfaces have been replaced by these 6 new
ones:

AcpiOsReadPciConfiguration
AcpiOsWritePciConfiguration
AcpiOsReadMemory
AcpiOsWriteMemory
AcpiOsReadPort
AcpiOsWritePort

Added a new interface named AcpiOsGetRootPointer to allow the
OSL to perform the platform and/or OS-specific actions
necessary to obtain the ACPI RSDP table pointer.  On IA-32
platforms, this interface will simply call down to the CA core
to perform the low-memory search for the table.  On IA-64, the
RSDP is obtained from EFI.  Migrating this interface to the
OSL allows the CA core to remain OS and platform independent.

Added a new interface named AcpiOsSignal to provide a generic
"function code and pointer" interface for various
miscellaneous signals and notifications that must be made to
the host OS.   The first such signals are intended to support
the ASL Fatal and Breakpoint operators.  In the latter case,
the AcpiOsBreakpoint interface has been obsoleted.

The definition of the AcpiFormatException interface has been
changed to simplify its use.  The caller no longer must supply
a buffer to the call; A pointer to a const string is now
returned directly.  This allows the call to be easily used in
printf statements, etc. since the caller does not have to
manage a local buffer.

 ASL Compiler, Version X2025:

The ACPI 2.0 Switch/Case/Default operators have been
implemented and are fully functional.  They will work with all
ACPI 1.0 interpreters, since the operators are simply
translated to If/Else pairs.

The ACPI 2.0 ElseIf operator is implemented and will also work
with 1.0 interpreters, for the same reason.

Implemented support for ACPI 2.0 variable-length packages.
These packages have a separate opcode, and their size is
determined by the interpreter at run-time.

Documentation The ACPI CA Programmer Reference has been
updated to reflect the new interfaces and changes to existing
interfaces.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_15_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where a DWORD-accessed field within a Buffer
object would get its byte address inadvertently rounded down
to the nearest DWORD.  Buffers are always Byte-accessible.

 ASL Compiler, version X2024:

Fixed a problem where the Switch() operator would either fault
or hang the compiler.  Note however, that the AML code for
this ACPI 2.0 operator is not yet implemented.

Compiler uses the new AcpiOsGetTimer interface to obtain
compile timings.

Implementation of the CreateField operator automatically
converts a reference to a named field within a resource
descriptor from a byte offset to a bit offset if required.

Added some missing named fields from the resource descriptor
support. These are the names that are automatically created by
the compiler to reference fields within a descriptor.  They
are only valid at compile time and are not passed through to
the AML interpreter.

Resource descriptor named fields are now typed as Integers and
subject to compile-time typechecking when used in expressions.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 05_18_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a couple of problems in the Field support code where
bits from adjacent fields could be returned along with the
proper field bits. Restructured the field support code to
improve performance, readability and maintainability.

New DEBUG_PRINTP macro automatically inserts the procedure
name into the output, saving hundreds of copies of procedure
name strings within the source, shrinking the memory footprint
of the debug version of the core subsystem.

 Source Code Structure:

The source code directory tree was restructured to reflect the
current organization of the component architecture.  Some
files and directories have been moved and/or renamed.

 Linux:

Fixed leaking kacpidpc processes.

Fixed queueing event data even when /proc/acpi/event is not
opened.

 ASL Compiler, version X2020:

Memory allocation performance enhancement - over 24X compile
time improvement on large ASL files.  Parse nodes and
namestring buffers are now allocated from a large internal
compiler buffer.

The temporary .SRC file is deleted unless the "-s" option is
specified

The "-d" debug output option now sends all output to the .DBG
file instead of the console.

"External" second parameter is now optional

"ElseIf" syntax now properly allows the predicate

Last operand to "Load" now recognized as a Target operand

Debug object can now be used anywhere as a normal object.

ResourceTemplate now returns an object of type BUFFER

EISAID now returns an object of type INTEGER

"Index" now works with a STRING operand

"LoadTable" now accepts optional parameters

"ToString" length parameter is now optional

"Interrupt (ResourceType," parse error fixed.

"Register" with a user-defined region space parse error fixed

Escaped backslash at the end of a string ("\\") scan/parse
error fixed

"Revision" is now an object of type INTEGER.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 05_02_01

Linux:

/proc/acpi/event now blocks properly.

Removed /proc/sys/acpi. You can still dump your DSDT from
/proc/acpi/dsdt.

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem introduced in the previous label where some of
the "small" resource descriptor types were not recognized.

Improved error messages for the case where an ASL Field is
outside the range of the parent operation region.

 ASL Compiler, version X2018:

Added error detection for ASL Fields that extend beyond the
length of the parent operation region (only if the length of
the region is known at compile time.)  This includes fields
that have a minimum access width that is smaller than the
parent region, and individual field units that are partially
or entirely beyond the extent of the parent.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 04_27_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Fixed a problem where the namespace mutex could be released at
the wrong time during execution of
AcpiRemoveAddressSpaceHandler.

Added optional thread ID output for debug traces, to simplify
debugging of multiple threads.  Added context switch
notification when the debug code realizes that a different
thread is now executing ACPI code.

Some additional external data types have been prefixed with
the string "ACPI_" for consistency.  This may effect existing
code.  The data types affected are the external callback
typedefs - e.g., WALK_CALLBACK becomes ACPI_WALK_CALLBACK.

 Linux:

Fixed an issue with the OSL semaphore implementation where a
thread was waking up with an error from receiving a SIGCHLD
signal.

Linux version of ACPI CA now uses the system C library for
string manipulation routines instead of a local
implementation.

Cleaned up comments and removed TBDs.

 ASL Compiler, version X2017:

Enhanced error detection and reporting for all file I/O
operations.

 Documentation:

Programmer Reference updated to version 1.06.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 04_13_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Restructured support for BufferFields and RegionFields.
BankFields support is now fully operational.  All known 32-bit
limitations on field sizes have been removed.  Both
BufferFields and (Operation) RegionFields are now supported by
the same field management code.

Resource support now supports QWORD address and IO resources.
The 16/32/64 bit address structures and the Extended IRQ
structure have been changed to properly handle Source Resource
strings.

A ThreadId of -1 is now used to indicate a "mutex not
acquired" condition internally and must never be returned by
AcpiOsThreadId. This reserved value was changed from 0 since
Unix systems allow a thread ID of 0.

Linux:

Driver code reorganized to enhance portability

Added a kernel configuration option to control ACPI_DEBUG

Fixed the EC driver to honor _GLK.

ASL Compiler, version X2016:

Fixed support for the "FixedHw" keyword.  Previously, the
FixedHw address space was set to 0, not 0x7f as it should be.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 03_13_01

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

During ACPI initialization, the _SB_._INI method is now run if
present.

Notify handler fix - notifies are deferred until the parent
method completes execution.  This fixes the "mutex already
acquired" issue seen occasionally.

Part of the "implicit conversion" rules in ACPI 2.0 have been
found to cause compatibility problems with existing ASL/AML.
The convert "result-to-target-type" implementation has been
removed for stores to method Args and Locals.  Source operand
conversion is still fully implemented.  Possible changes to
ACPI 2.0 specification pending.

Fix to AcpiRsCalculatePciRoutingTableLength to return correct
length.

Fix for compiler warnings for 64-bit compiles.

 Linux:

/proc output aligned for easier parsing.

Release-version compile problem fixed.

New kernel configuration options documented in Configure.help.

IBM 600E - Fixed Sleep button may generate "Invalid <NULL>
context" message.

 OSPM:

Power resource driver integrated with bus manager.

Fixed kernel fault during active cooling for thermal zones.

Source Code:

The source code tree has been restructured.



------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 03_02_01

 Linux OS Services Layer (OSL):

Major revision of all Linux-specific code.

Modularized all ACPI-specific drivers.

Added new thermal zone and power resource drivers.

Revamped /proc interface (new functionality is under
/proc/acpi).

New kernel configuration options.

 Linux known issues:

New kernel configuration options not documented in
Configure.help yet.

Module dependencies not currently implemented. If used, they
should be loaded in this order: busmgr, power, ec, system,
processor, battery, ac_adapter, button, thermal.

Modules will not load if CONFIG_MODVERSION is set.

IBM 600E - entering S5 may reboot instead of shutting down.

IBM 600E - Sleep button may generate "Invalid <NULL> context"
message.

Some systems may fail with "execution mutex already acquired"
message.

 ACPI CA Core Subsystem:

Added a new OSL Interface, AcpiOsGetThreadId.  This was
required for the  deadlock detection code. Defined to return a
non-zero, 32-bit thread ID for the currently executing thread.
May be a non-zero constant integer on single-thread systems.

Implemented deadlock detection for internal subsystem mutexes.
We may add conditional compilation for this code (debug only)
later.

ASL/AML Mutex object semantics are now fully supported.  This
includes multiple acquires/releases by owner and support for
the Mutex SyncLevel parameter.

A new "Force Release" mechanism automatically frees all ASL
Mutexes that have been acquired but not released when a thread
exits the interpreter.  This forces conformance to the ACPI
spec ("All mutexes must be released when an invocation exits")
and prevents deadlocked ASL threads.  This mechanism can be
expanded (later) to monitor other resource acquisitions if OEM
ASL code continues to misbehave (which it will).

Several new ACPI exception codes have been added for the Mutex
support.

Recursive method calls are now allowed and supported (the ACPI
spec does in fact allow recursive method calls.)  The number
of recursive calls is subject to the restrictions imposed by
the SERIALIZED method keyword and SyncLevel (ACPI 2.0) method
parameter.

Implemented support for the SyncLevel parameter for control
methods (ACPI 2.0 feature)

Fixed a deadlock problem when multiple threads attempted to
use the interpreter.

Fixed a problem where the string length of a String package
element was not always set in a package returned from
AcpiEvaluateObject.

Fixed a problem where the length of a String package element
was not always included in the length of the overall package
returned from AcpiEvaluateObject.

Added external interfaces (Acpi*) to the ACPI debug memory
manager.  This manager keeps a list of all outstanding
allocations, and can therefore detect memory leaks and
attempts to free memory blocks more than once. Useful for code
such as the power manager, etc.  May not be appropriate for
device drivers.  Performance with the debug code enabled is
slow.

The ACPI Global Lock is now an optional hardware element.

 ASL Compiler Version X2015:

Integrated changes to allow the compiler to be generated on
multiple platforms.

Linux makefile added to generate the compiler on Linux

 Source Code:

All platform-specific headers have been moved to their own
subdirectory, Include/Platform.

New source file added, Interpreter/ammutex.c

New header file, Include/acstruct.h

 Documentation:

The programmer reference has been updated for the following
new interfaces: AcpiOsGetThreadId AcpiAllocate AcpiCallocate
AcpiFree

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 02_08_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem: Fixed a problem where an error was
incorrectly returned if the return resource buffer was larger
than the actual data (in the resource interfaces).

References to named objects within packages are resolved to
the full pathname string before packages are returned directly
(via the AcpiEvaluateObject interface) or indirectly via the
resource interfaces.

Linux OS Services Layer (OSL):

Improved /proc battery interface.


Added C-state debugging output and other miscellaneous fixes.

ASL Compiler Version X2014:

All defined method arguments can now be used as local
variables, including the ones that are not actually passed in
as parameters.  The compiler tracks initialization of the
arguments and issues an exception if they are used without
prior assignment (just like locals).

The -o option now specifies a filename prefix that is used for
all output files, including the AML output file.  Otherwise,
the default behavior is as follows:  1) the AML goes to the
file specified in the DSDT.  2) all other output files use the
input source filename as the base.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 01_25_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem: Restructured the implementation of
object store support within the  interpreter.  This includes
support for the Store operator as well  as any ASL operators
that include a target operand.

Partially implemented support for Implicit Result-to-Target
conversion. This is when a result object is converted on the
fly to the type of  an existing target object.  Completion of
this support is pending  further analysis of the ACPI
specification concerning this matter.

CPU-specific code has been removed from the subsystem
(hardware directory).

New Power Management Timer functions added

Linux OS Services Layer (OSL): Moved system state transition
code to the core, fixed it, and modified  Linux OSL
accordingly.

Fixed C2 and C3 latency calculations.


We no longer use the compilation date for the version message
on  initialization, but retrieve the version from
AcpiGetSystemInfo().

Incorporated for fix Sony VAIO machines.

Documentation:  The Programmer Reference has been updated and
reformatted.


ASL Compiler:  Version X2013: Fixed a problem where the line
numbering and error reporting could get out  of sync in the
presence of multiple include files.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 01_15_01

Core ACPI CA Subsystem:

Implemented support for type conversions in the execution of
the ASL  Concatenate operator (The second operand is converted
to match the type  of the first operand before concatenation.)

Support for implicit source operand conversion is partially
implemented.   The ASL source operand types Integer, Buffer,
and String are freely  interchangeable for most ASL operators
and are converted by the interpreter  on the fly as required.
Implicit Target operand conversion (where the  result is
converted to the target type before storing) is not yet
implemented.

Support for 32-bit and 64-bit BCD integers is implemented.

Problem fixed where a field read on an aligned field could
cause a read  past the end of the field.

New exception, AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE, is returned when a
method does not return a value, but the caller expects one.
(The ASL compiler flags this as a warning.)

ASL Compiler:

Version X2011:
1. Static typechecking of all operands is implemented. This
prevents the use of invalid objects (such as using a Package
where an Integer is required) at compile time instead of at
interpreter run-time.
2. The ASL source line is printed with ALL errors and
warnings.
3. Bug fix for source EOF without final linefeed.
4. Debug option is split into a parse trace and a namespace
trace.
5. Namespace output option (-n) includes initial values for
integers and strings.
6. Parse-only option added for quick syntax checking.
7. Compiler checks for duplicate ACPI name declarations

Version X2012:
1. Relaxed typechecking to allow interchangeability between
strings, integers, and buffers.  These types are now converted
by the interpreter at runtime.
2. Compiler reports time taken by each internal subsystem in
the debug         output file.


 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_14_00

ASL Compiler:

This is the first official release of the compiler. Since the
compiler requires elements of the Core Subsystem, this label
synchronizes everything.

------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_08_00

Fixed a problem where named references within the ASL
definition of both OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did
not work properly.  The symptom was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE
during initialization of the region/field. This is similar
(but not related internally) to the problem that was fixed in
the last label.

Implemented both 32-bit and 64-bit support for the BCD ASL
functions ToBCD and FromBCD.

Updated all legal headers to include "2000" in the copyright
years.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 12_01_00

Fixed a problem where method invocations within the ASL
definition of both OperationRegions and CreateXXXFields did
not work properly.  The symptom was an AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE
during initialization of the region/field:

  nsinit-0209: AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE while getting region
arguments [DEBG]   ammonad-0284: Exec_monadic2_r/Not: bad
operand(s) (0x3005)

Fixed a problem where operators with more than one nested
subexpression would fail.  The symptoms were varied, by mostly
AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE errors.  This was actually a rather
serious problem that has gone unnoticed until now.

  Subtract (Add (1,2), Multiply (3,4))

Fixed a problem where AcpiGetHandle didn't quite get fixed in
the previous build (The prefix part of a relative path was
handled incorrectly).

Fixed a problem where Operation Region initialization failed
if the operation region name was a "namepath" instead of a
simple "nameseg". Symptom was an AE_NO_OPERAND error.

Fixed a problem where an assignment to a local variable via
the indirect RefOf mechanism only worked for the first such
assignment.  Subsequent assignments were ignored.

 ------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 11_15_00

ACPI 2.0 table support with backwards support for ACPI 1.0 and
the 0.71 extensions.  Note: although we can read ACPI 2.0 BIOS
tables, the AML  interpreter does NOT have support for the new
2.0 ASL grammar terms at this time.

All ACPI hardware access is via the GAS structures in the ACPI
2.0 FADT.

All physical memory addresses across all platforms are now 64
bits wide. Logical address width remains dependent on the
platform (i.e., "void *").

AcpiOsMapMemory interface changed to a 64-bit physical
address.

The AML interpreter integer size is now 64 bits, as per the
ACPI 2.0 specification.

For backwards compatibility with ACPI 1.0, ACPI tables with a
revision number less than 2 use 32-bit integers only.

Fixed a problem where the evaluation of OpRegion operands did
not always resolve them to numbers properly.

------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 10_20_00

Fix for CBN_._STA issue.  This fix will allow correct access
to CBN_ OpRegions when the _STA returns 0x8.

Support to convert ACPI constants (Ones, Zeros, One) to actual
values before a package object is returned

Fix for method call as predicate to if/while construct causing
incorrect if/while behavior

Fix for Else block package lengths sometimes calculated wrong
(if block > 63 bytes)

Fix for Processor object length field, was always zero

Table load abort if FACP sanity check fails

Fix for problem with Scope(name) if name already exists

Warning emitted if a named object referenced cannot be found
(resolved) during method execution.





------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 9_29_00

New table initialization interfaces: AcpiInitializeSubsystem
no longer has any parameters AcpiFindRootPointer - Find the
RSDP (if necessary) AcpiLoadTables (RSDP) - load all tables
found at RSDP->RSDT Obsolete Interfaces AcpiLoadFirmwareTables
- replaced by AcpiLoadTables

Note: These interface changes require changes to all existing
OSDs

The PCI_Config default address space handler is always
installed at the root namespace object.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_15_00

The new initialization architecture is implemented.  New
interfaces are: AcpiInitializeSubsystem (replaces
AcpiInitialize) AcpiEnableSubsystem Obsolete Interfaces:
AcpiLoadNamespace (Namespace is automatically loaded when a
table is loaded)

The ACPI_OPERAND_OBJECT has been optimized to shrink its size
from 52 bytes to 32 bytes.  There is usually one of these for
every namespace object, so the memory savings is significant.

Implemented just-in-time evaluation of the CreateField
operators.

Bug fixes for IA-64 support have been integrated.

Additional code review comments have been implemented

The so-called "third pass parse" has been replaced by a final
walk through the namespace to initialize all operation regions
(address spaces) and fields that have not yet been initialized
during the execution of the various _INI and REG methods.

New file - namespace/nsinit.c

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 09_01_00

Namespace manager data structures have been reworked to change
the primary  object from a table to a single object.  This has
resulted in dynamic memory  savings of 3X within the namespace
and 2X overall in the ACPI CA subsystem.

Fixed problem where the call to AcpiEvFindPciRootBuses was
inadvertently left  commented out.

Reduced the warning count when generating the source with the
GCC compiler.

Revision numbers added to each module header showing the
SourceSafe version of the file.  Please refer to this version
number when giving us feedback or comments on individual
modules.

The main object types within the subsystem have been renamed
to clarify their  purpose:

ACPI_INTERNAL_OBJECT -> ACPI_OPERAND_OBJECT
ACPI_GENERIC_OP -> ACPI_PARSE_OBJECT
ACPI_NAME_TABLE_ENTRY -> ACPI_NAMESPACE_NODE

NOTE: no changes to the initialization sequence are included
in this label.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_23_00

Fixed problem where TerminateControlMethod was being called
multiple times per  method

Fixed debugger problem where single stepping caused a
semaphore to be  oversignalled

Improved performance through additional parse object caching -
added  ACPI_EXTENDED_OP type

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 08_10_00

Parser/Interpreter integration:  Eliminated the creation of
complete parse trees  for ACPI tables and control methods.
Instead, parse subtrees are created and  then deleted as soon
as they are processed (Either entered into the namespace or
executed by the interpreter).  This reduces the use of dynamic
kernel memory  significantly. (about 10X)

Exception codes broken into classes and renumbered.  Be sure
to recompile all  code that includes acexcep.h.  Hopefully we
won't have to renumber the codes  again now that they are
split into classes (environment, programmer, AML code,  ACPI
table, and internal).

Fixed some additional alignment issues in the Resource Manager
subcomponent

Implemented semaphore tracking in the AcpiExec utility, and
fixed several places  where mutexes/semaphores were being
unlocked without a corresponding lock  operation.  There are
no known semaphore or mutex "leaks" at this time.

Fixed the case where an ASL Return operator is used to return
an unnamed  package.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_28_00

Fixed a problem with the way addresses were calculated in
AcpiAmlReadFieldData()  and AcpiAmlWriteFieldData(). This
problem manifested itself when a Field was  created with
WordAccess or DwordAccess, but the field unit defined within
the  Field was less than a Word or Dword.

Fixed a problem in AmlDumpOperands() module's loop to pull
operands off of the  operand stack to display information. The
problem manifested itself as a TLB  error on 64-bit systems
when accessing an operand stack with two or more  operands.

Fixed a problem with the PCI configuration space handlers
where context was  getting confused between accesses. This
required a change to the generic address  space handler and
address space setup definitions. Handlers now get both a
global handler context (this is the one passed in by the user
when executing  AcpiInstallAddressSpaceHandler() and a
specific region context that is unique to  each region (For
example, the _ADR, _SEG and _BBN values associated with a
specific region). The generic function definitions have
changed to the  following:

typedef ACPI_STATUS (*ADDRESS_SPACE_HANDLER) ( UINT32
Function, UINT32 Address, UINT32 BitWidth, UINT32 *Value, void
*HandlerContext, // This used to be void *Context void
*RegionContext); // This is an additional parameter

typedef ACPI_STATUS (*ADDRESS_SPACE_SETUP) ( ACPI_HANDLE
RegionHandle, UINT32 Function, void *HandlerContext,  void
**RegionContext); // This used to be **ReturnContext

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 07_21_00

Major file consolidation and rename.  All files within the
interpreter have been  renamed as well as most header files.
This was done to prevent collisions with  existing files in
the host OSs -- filenames such as "config.h" and "global.h"
seem to be quite common.  The VC project files have been
updated.  All makefiles  will require modification.

The parser/interpreter integration continues in Phase 5 with
the implementation  of a complete 2-pass parse (the AML is
parsed twice) for each table;  This  avoids the construction
of a huge parse tree and therefore reduces the amount of
dynamic memory required by the subsystem.  Greater use of the
parse object cache  means that performance is unaffected.

Many comments from the two code reviews have been rolled in.

The 64-bit alignment support is complete.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_30_00

With a nod and a tip of the hat to the technology of
yesteryear, we've added  support in the source code for 80
column output devices.  The code is now mostly  constrained to
80 columns or less to support environments and editors that 1)
cannot display or print more than 80 characters on a single
line, and 2) cannot  disable line wrapping.

A major restructuring of the namespace data structure has been
completed.  The  result is 1) cleaner and more
understandable/maintainable code, and 2) a  significant
reduction in the dynamic memory requirement for each named
ACPI  object (almost half).

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_23_00

Linux support has been added.  In order to obtain approval to
get the ACPI CA  subsystem into the Linux kernel, we've had to
make quite a few changes to the  base subsystem that will
affect all users (all the changes are generic and OS-
independent).  The effects of these global changes have been
somewhat far  reaching.  Files have been merged and/or renamed
and interfaces have been  renamed.   The major changes are
described below.

Osd* interfaces renamed to AcpiOs* to eliminate namespace
pollution/confusion  within our target kernels.  All OSD
interfaces must be modified to match the new  naming
convention.

Files merged across the subsystem.  A number of the smaller
source and header  files have been merged to reduce the file
count and increase the density of the  existing files.  There
are too many to list here.  In general, makefiles that  call
out individual files will require rebuilding.

Interpreter files renamed.  All interpreter files now have the
prefix am*  instead of ie* and is*.

Header files renamed:  The acapi.h file is now acpixf.h.  The
acpiosd.h file is  now acpiosxf.h.  We are removing references
to the acronym "API" since it is  somewhat windowsy. The new
name is "external interface" or xface or xf in the
filenames.j


All manifest constants have been forced to upper case (some
were mixed case.)   Also, the string "ACPI_" has been
prepended to many (not all) of the constants,  typedefs, and
structs.

The globals "DebugLevel" and "DebugLayer" have been renamed
"AcpiDbgLevel" and  "AcpiDbgLayer" respectively.

All other globals within the subsystem are now prefixed with
"AcpiGbl_" Internal procedures within the subsystem are now
prefixed with "Acpi" (with only  a few exceptions).  The
original two-letter abbreviation for the subcomponent  remains
after "Acpi" - for example, CmCallocate became
AcpiCmCallocate.

Added a source code translation/conversion utility.  Used to
generate the Linux  source code, it can be modified to
generate other types of source as well. Can  also be used to
cleanup existing source by removing extraneous spaces and
blank  lines.  Found in tools/acpisrc/*

OsdUnMapMemory was renamed to OsdUnmapMemory and then
AcpiOsUnmapMemory.  (UnMap  became Unmap).

A "MaxUnits" parameter has been added to
AcpiOsCreateSemaphore.  When set to  one, this indicates that
the caller wants to use the semaphore as a mutex, not a
counting semaphore.  ACPI CA uses both types.  However,
implementers of this  call may want to use different OS
primitives depending on the type of semaphore  requested.  For
example, some operating systems provide separate "mutex" and
"semaphore" interfaces - where the mutex interface is much
faster because it  doesn't have all the overhead of a full
semaphore implementation.

Fixed a deadlock problem where a method that accesses the PCI
address space can  block forever if it is the first access to
the space.

-------------------------------------------
Summary of changes for this label: 06_02_00

Support for environments that cannot handle unaligned data
accesses (e.g.  firmware and OS environments devoid of
alignment handler technology namely  SAL/EFI and the IA-64
Linux kernel) has been added (via configurable macros) in
these three areas: - Transfer of data from the raw AML byte
stream is done via byte moves instead of    word/dword/qword
moves. - External objects are aligned within the user buffer,
including package   elements (sub-objects). - Conversion of
name strings to UINT32 Acpi Names is now done byte-wise.

The Store operator was modified to mimic Microsoft's
implementation when storing  to a Buffer Field.

Added a check of the BM_STS bit before entering C3.

The methods subdirectory has been obsoleted and removed.  A
new file, cmeval.c  subsumes the functionality.

A 16-bit (DOS) version of AcpiExec has been developed.  The
makefile is under  the acpiexec directory.
