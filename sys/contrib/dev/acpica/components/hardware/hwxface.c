 *
 *  March 2005:
 *  Added support for a package that contains two integers. This

 *
 *  January 2013:
 *  Therefore, we must be prepared to accept a package with either a
 *  single integer or multiple integers.
 *
 *  The single integer DWORD format is as follows:
 *      BYTE 0 - Value for the PM1A SLP_TYP register
 *      BYTE 1 - Value for the PM1B SLP_TYP register
 *      BYTE 2-3 - Reserved
