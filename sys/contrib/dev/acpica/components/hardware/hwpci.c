 *
 * DESCRIPTION: This function derives a full PCI ID for a PCI device,
 *              consisting of a Segment number, Bus number, Device number,
 *              and function code.
 *
 *              The PCI hardware dynamically configures PCI bus numbers
 *              depending on the bus topology discovered during system
 *              initialization. This function is invoked during configuration
 *              of a PCI_Config Operation Region in order to (possibly) update
 *              the Bus/Device/Function numbers in the PciId with the actual
 *              values as determined by the hardware and operating system
 *              configuration.
 *
 *              The PciId parameter is initially populated during the Operation
 *              Region initialization. This function is then called, and is
 *              will make any necessary modifications to the Bus, Device, or
 *              Function number PCI ID subfields as appropriate for the
 *              current hardware and OS configuration.
 *
 * NOTE:        Created 08/2010. Replaces the previous OSL AcpiOsDerivePciId
 *              interface since this feature is OS-independent. This module
 *              specifically avoids any use of recursion by building a local
 *              temporary device list.
