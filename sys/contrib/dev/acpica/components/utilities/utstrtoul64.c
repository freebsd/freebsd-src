/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * This module contains the top-level string to 64/32-bit unsigned integer
 * conversion functions:
 *
 *  1) A standard strtoul() function that supports 64-bit integers, base
 *     8/10/16, with integer overflow support. This is used mainly by the
 *     iASL compiler, which implements tighter constraints on integer
 *     constants than the runtime (interpreter) integer-to-string conversions.
 *  2) Runtime "Explicit conversion" as defined in the ACPI specification.
 *  3) Runtime "Implicit conversion" as defined in the ACPI specification.
 *
 * Current users of this module:
 *
 *  iASL        - Preprocessor (constants and math expressions)
 *  iASL        - Main parser, conversion of constants to integers
 *  iASL        - Data Table Compiler parser (constants and math expressions)
 *  Interpreter - Implicit and explicit conversions, GPE method names
 *  Interpreter - Repair code for return values from predefined names
 *  Debugger    - Command line input string conversion
 *  AcpiDump    - ACPI table physical addresses
 *  AcpiExec    - Support for namespace overrides
 *
 * Notes concerning users of these interfaces:
 *
 * AcpiGbl_IntegerByteWidth is used to set the 32/64 bit limit for explicit
 * and implicit conversions. This global must be set to the proper width.
 * For the core ACPICA code, the width depends on the DSDT version. For the
 * AcpiUtStrtoul64 interface, all conversions are 64 bits. This interface is
 * used primarily for iASL, where the default width is 64 bits for all parsers,
 * but error checking is performed later to flag cases where a 64-bit constant
 * is wrongly defined in a 32-bit DSDT/SSDT.
 *
 * In ACPI, the only place where octal numbers are supported is within
 * the ASL language itself. This is implemented via the main AcpiUtStrtoul64
 * interface. According the ACPI specification, there is no ACPI runtime
 * support (explicit/implicit) for octal string conversions.

 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Perform a 64-bit conversion with restrictions placed upon
 *              an "implicit conversion" by the ACPI specification. Used by
 *              many ASL operators that require an integer operand, and support
 *              an automatic (implicit) conversion from a string operand
 *              to the final integer operand. The major restriction is that
 *              only hex strings are supported.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Base is always 16, either with or without the 0x prefix. Decimal and
 * Octal strings are not supported, as per the ACPI specification.

 * Examples (both are hex values):
 *      Add ("BA98", Arg0, Local0)
 *      Subtract ("0x12345678", Arg1, Local1)
 *
 * Conversion rules as extracted from the ACPI specification:
 *
 *  The converted integer is initialized to the value zero.
 *  The ASCII string is always interpreted as a hexadecimal constant.
 *
 *  1)  According to the ACPI specification, a "0x" prefix is not allowed.
 *      However, ACPICA allows this as an ACPI extension on general
 *      principle. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  2)  The conversion terminates when the size of an integer is reached
 *      (32 or 64 bits). There are no numeric overflow conditions. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  3)  The first non-hex character terminates the conversion and returns
 *      the current accumulated value of the converted integer (NO ERROR).
 *
 *  4)  Conversion of a null (zero-length) string to an integer is
 *      technically not allowed. However, ACPICA allows this as an ACPI
 *      extension. The conversion returns the value 0. (NO ERROR)
 *
 * NOTE: There are no error conditions returned by this function. At

 *
 *  2)  The value must not exceed the maximum of an integer value
 *      (32 or 64 bits). The ACPI specification states the behavior is
 *      "unpredictable", so ACPICA matches the behavior of the implicit
 *      conversion case. There are no numeric overflow conditions. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  3)  Behavior on the first non-hex character is not defined by the ACPI
 *      specification (for the ToInteger operator), so ACPICA matches the
 *      behavior of the implicit conversion case. It terminates the
 *      conversion and returns the current accumulated value of the converted
 *      integer. (NO ERROR)
