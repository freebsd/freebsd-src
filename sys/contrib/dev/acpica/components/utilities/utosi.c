/******************************************************************************
 *
 * ACPICA policy for new _OSI strings:
 *
 * It is the stated policy of ACPICA that new _OSI strings will be integrated
 * into this module as soon as possible after they are defined. It is strongly
 * recommended that all ACPICA hosts mirror this policy and integrate any
 * changes to this module as soon as possible. There are several historical
 * reasons behind this policy:
 *
 * 1) New BIOSs tend to test only the case where the host responds TRUE to
 *    the latest version of Windows, which would respond to the latest/newest
 *    _OSI string. Not responding TRUE to the latest version of Windows will
 *    risk executing untested code paths throughout the DSDT and SSDTs.
 *
 * 2) If a new _OSI string is recognized only after a significant delay, this
 *    has the potential to cause problems on existing working machines because
 *    of the possibility that a new and different path through the ASL code
 *    will be executed.
 *
 * 3) New _OSI strings are tending to come out about once per year. A delay
 *    in recognizing a new string for a significant amount of time risks the
 *    release of another string which only compounds the initial problem.
 *
 *****************************************************************************/


/*
 * Strings supported by the _OSI predefined control method (which is
 * implemented internally within this module.)
 *
 * March 2009: Removed "Linux" as this host no longer wants to respond true
 * for this string. Basically, the only safe OS strings are windows-related
 * and in many or most cases represent the only test path within the
 * BIOS-provided ASL code.
 *
 * The last element of each entry is used to track the newest version of
 * Windows that the BIOS has requested.
