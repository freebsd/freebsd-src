/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * This module attempts to repair or convert objects returned by the
 * predefined methods to an object type that is expected, as per the ACPI
 * specification. The need for this code is dictated by the many machines that
 * return incorrect types for the standard predefined methods. Performing these
 * conversions here, in one place, eliminates the need for individual ACPI
 * device drivers to do the same. Note: Most of these conversions are different
 * than the internal object conversion routines used for implicit object
 * conversion.
 *
 * The following conversions can be performed as necessary:
 *
 * Integer -> String
 * Integer -> Buffer
 * String  -> Integer
 * String  -> Buffer
 * Buffer  -> Integer
 * Buffer  -> String
 * Buffer  -> Package of Integers
 * Package -> Package of one Package
 *
 * Additional conversions that are available:
 *  Convert a null return or zero return value to an EndTag descriptor
 *  Convert an ASCII string to a Unicode buffer
 *
 * An incorrect standalone object is wrapped with required outer package
 *
 * Additional possible repairs:
 * Required package elements that are NULL replaced by Integer/String/Buffer

 * DESCRIPTION: Repair a common problem with objects that are defined to
 *              return a variable-length Package of sub-objects. If there is
 *              only one sub-object, some BIOS code mistakenly simply declares
 *              the single object instead of a Package with one sub-object.
 *              This function attempts to repair this error by wrapping a
 *              Package object around the original object, creating the
 *              correct and expected Package with one sub-object.
 *
 *              Names that can be repaired in this manner include:
 *              _ALR, _CSD, _HPX, _MLS, _PLD, _PRT, _PSS, _TRT, _TSS,
