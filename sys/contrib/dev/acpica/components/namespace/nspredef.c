 *
 * This module validates predefined ACPI objects that appear in the namespace,
 * at the time they are evaluated (via AcpiEvaluateObject). The purpose of this
 * validation is to detect problems with BIOS-exposed predefined ACPI objects
 * before the results are returned to the ACPI-related drivers.
 *
 * There are several areas that are validated:
 *
 *  1) The number of input arguments as defined by the method/object in the
 *     ASL is validated against the ACPI specification.
 *  2) The type of the return object (if any) is validated against the ACPI
 *     specification.
 *  3) For returned package objects, the count of package elements is
 *     validated, as well as the type of each package element. Nested
 *     packages are supported.
 *
 * For any problems found, a warning message is issued.
