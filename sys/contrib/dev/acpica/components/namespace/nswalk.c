 * DESCRIPTION: Performs a modified depth-first walk of the namespace tree,
 *              starting (and ending) at the node specified by StartHandle.
 *              The callback function is called whenever a node that matches
 *              the type parameter is found. If the callback function returns
 *              a non-zero value, the search is terminated immediately and
 *              this value is returned to the caller.
 *
 *              The point of this procedure is to provide a generic namespace
 *              walk routine that can be called from multiple places to
 *              provide multiple services; the callback function(s) can be
 *              tailored to each task, whether it is a print function,
 *              a compare function, etc.
