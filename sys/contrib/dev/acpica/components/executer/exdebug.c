 * FUNCTION:    AcpiExDoDebugObject
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  SourceDesc          - Object to be output to "Debug Object"
 *              Level               - Indentation level (used for packages)
 *              Index               - Current package element, zero if not pkg
 *
 * RETURN:      None
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Handles stores to the AML Debug Object. For example:
 *              Store(INT1, Debug)
 *
 * This function is not compiled if ACPI_NO_ERROR_MESSAGES is set.
 *
 * This function is only enabled if AcpiGbl_EnableAmlDebugObject is set, or
 * if ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT is set in the AcpiDbgLevel. Thus, in the normal
 * operational case, stores to the debug object are ignored but can be easily
 * enabled if necessary.
