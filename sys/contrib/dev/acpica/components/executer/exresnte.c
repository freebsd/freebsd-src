 * FUNCTION:    AcpiExResolveNodeToValue
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  ObjectPtr       - Pointer to a location that contains
 *                                a pointer to a NS node, and will receive a
 *                                pointer to the resolved object.
 *              WalkState       - Current state. Valid only if executing AML
 *                                code. NULL if simply resolving an object
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Resolve a Namespace node to a valued object
 *
 * Note: for some of the data types, the pointer attached to the Node
 * can be either a pointer to an actual internal object or a pointer into the
 * AML stream itself. These types are currently:
 *
 *      ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER
 *      ACPI_TYPE_STRING
 *      ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER
 *      ACPI_TYPE_MUTEX
