 * DESCRIPTION: Concatenate two objects with the ACPI-defined conversion
 *              rules as necessary.
 * NOTE:
 * Per the ACPI spec (up to 6.1), Concatenate only supports Integer,
 * String, and Buffer objects. However, we support all objects here
 * as an extension. This improves the usefulness of both Concatenate
 * and the Printf/Fprintf macros. The extension returns a string
 * describing the object type for the other objects.
