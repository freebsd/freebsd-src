 *              conversion), and a copy of the value of the source to
 *              the target.
 *
 *              The Assignment of an object to another (not named) object
 *              is handled here.
 *              The Source passed in will replace the current value (if any)
 *              with the input value.
 *
 *              When storing into an object the data is converted to the
 *              target object type then stored in the object. This means
 *              that the target object type (for an initialized target) will
 *              not be changed by a store operation.
 *
 *              This module allows destination types of Number, String,
 *              Buffer, and Package.
 *
 *              Assumes parameters are already validated. NOTE: SourceDesc
 *              resolution (from a reference object) must be performed by
 *              the caller if necessary.
