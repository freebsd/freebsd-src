/*!
 * Naming convention for AML interpreter execution routines.
 *
 * The routines that begin execution of AML opcodes are named with a common
 * convention based upon the number of arguments, the number of target operands,
 * and whether or not a value is returned:
 *
 *      AcpiExOpcode_xA_yT_zR
 *
 * Where:
 *
 * xA - ARGUMENTS:    The number of arguments (input operands) that are
 *                    required for this opcode type (1 through 6 args).
 * yT - TARGETS:      The number of targets (output operands) that are required
 *                    for this opcode type (0, 1, or 2 targets).
 * zR - RETURN VALUE: Indicates whether this opcode type returns a value
 *                    as the function return (0 or 1).
 *
 * The AcpiExOpcode* functions are called via the Dispatcher component with
 * fully resolved operands.
