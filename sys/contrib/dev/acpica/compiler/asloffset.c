 * DESCRIPTION: Process one node during a offset table file generation.
 *
 * Three types of objects are currently emitted to the offset table:
 *   1) Tagged (named) resource descriptors
 *   2) Named integer objects with constant integer values
 *   3) Named package objects
 *   4) Operation Regions that have constant Offset (address) parameters
 *   5) Control methods
 *
 * The offset table allows the BIOS to dynamically update the values of these
 * objects at boot time.
