[0]	COPYRIGHT & LICENSE

	Please read the COPYRIGHT file carefully.  If you cannot
	agree to be bound by the terms of this license, please
	contact M-systems and make arrangements with them.

[1]	Which devices are supported ?

	The driver has been tested with the following devices:

	DiskOnChip2000 (8, 12, 24, 32, 40, 72, 144 MB)
	DiskOnChipMillenium (8 MB)

[2]	Which firmware version ?

	The driver has only been tested with version 1.21, but should
	also work with earlier versions.

[3]	How many devices ?

	The driver supports up to 8 devices but have been tested only
	with 5 due to hardware limitations in my test setup.

[4]	Which FreeBSD versions ?

	The driver is tested for 4.0-CURRENT and 3.2-STABLE.  Porting
	to earlier versions of FreeBSD should be a simple matter of
	modifying the fla.c file.  [patches are welcome]

	For 3.2-STABLE sources earlier than 1999-08-01 you
	will need to apply the patch in file patch.00

[5]	Can I install FreeBSD with sysinstall ?

	Yes, from medio july FreeBSD-4.X snapshots have recognized the
	fla devices in sysinstall.  You need to build a custom kernel
	with the driver though.  See below about booting from a fla
	device.

[6]	How to boot from a fla device ?

	The FreeBSD kernel recognizes the root device using various
	hacks.  These hacks doesn't recognize the fla device so some
	"real" hacks are needed to boot from your fla device.

	In 4.0 current the easiest way is to configure your kernel with
	the 
		options ROOTDEVNAME=\"fla0\"

	In older versions, specifying the boot device in the kernel
	config file this way is the easiest way to do it:

		config          kernel  root on major 28 minor 65538

[7]	How to disklabel a fla device ?

	Look at the script in prep.fla.sh, it will do the job for you.

[8]	Who to contact ?

	doc2k@phk.freebsd.dk will offer limited best-effort help
	to the extent time permits.

[9]	Will more documentation be forthcoming ?

	YES.

Good Luck,

Poul-Henning
