 rtw88 firmware
================

This repository contains firmware images supported by Realtek's wireless
driver rtw88. And some of the devices run with more than one firmware
file. Basically, a "normal" firmware is necessary to be downloaded to
the device.
And another is called "wowlan" firmware, it should be loaded when a
device is going to suspend. Which means driver will "re-download/swap"
the firmware image. The wowlan firmware contains wake up functions that
can recognize specific events and send a wake up signal to device if
needed, and the system will resume to running state. During resume,
driver will then swap the normal firmware back, return to running state.

If any distros or platforms do not require wowlan feature, they can
_only_ pick the normal firmware. And everything still works fine,
except that the device cannot be waken from the wireless NICs.
