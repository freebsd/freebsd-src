 *		The relevant Toeplitz key registers are provided in RxOLE's
 *		instance of common parser module. These registers are separate
 *		from the Toeplitz keys used by ASE/FSE modules inside RxOLE.
 *		The actual value will be passed on from common parser module
 *		to RxOLE in one of the WHO_* TLVs.
 *
 * ppdu_start_timestamp
 *		Timestamp that indicates when the PPDU that contained this MPDU
 *		started on the medium.
 *
 * phy_meta_data
 *		SW programmed Meta data provided by the PHY. Can be used for SW
 *		to indicate the channel the device is on.
 *
 * toeplitz_hash_2_or_4
 *		Controlled by multiple RxOLE registers for TCP/UDP over
 *		IPv4/IPv6 - Either, Toeplitz hash computed over 2-tuple
 *		IPv4 or IPv6 src/dest addresses is reported; or, Toeplitz
 *		hash computed over 4-tuple IPv4 or IPv6 src/dest addresses
 *		and src/dest ports is reported. The Flow_id_toeplitz hash
 *		can also be reported here. Usually the hash reported here
 *		is the one used for hash-based REO routing (see use_flow_id_toeplitz_clfy
 *		in 'RXPT_CLASSIFY_INFO').
 *
 * sa
 *		Source MAC address
 *
 * first_mpdu
 *		Indicates the first MSDU of the PPDU.  If both first_mpdu
 *		and last_mpdu are set in the MSDU then this is a not an
 *		A-MPDU frame but a stand alone MPDU.  Interior MPDU in an
 *		A-MPDU shall have both first_mpdu and last_mpdu bits set to
 *		0.  The PPDU start status will only be valid when this bit
 *		is set.
 *
 * mcast_bcast
 *		Multicast / broadcast indicator.  Only set when the MAC
 *		address 1 bit 0 is set indicating mcast/bcast and the BSSID
 *		matches one of the 4 BSSID registers. Only set when
 *		first_msdu is set.
 *
 * ast_index_not_found
 *		Only valid when first_msdu is set. Indicates no AST matching
 *		entries within the max search count.
 *
 * ast_index_timeout
 *		Only valid when first_msdu is set. Indicates an unsuccessful
 *		search in the address search table due to timeout.
 *
 * power_mgmt
 *		Power management bit set in the 802.11 header.  Only set
 *		when first_msdu is set.
 *
 * non_qos
 *		Set if packet is not a non-QoS data frame.  Only set when
 *		first_msdu is set.
 *
 * null_data
 *		Set if frame type indicates either null data or QoS null
 *		data format.  Only set when first_msdu is set.
 *
 * mgmt_type
 *		Set if packet is a management packet.  Only set when
 *		first_msdu is set.
 *
 * ctrl_type
 *		Set if packet is a control packet.  Only set when first_msdu
 *		is set.
 *
 * more_data
 *		Set if more bit in frame control is set.  Only set when
 *		first_msdu is set.
 *
 * eosp
 *		Set if the EOSP (end of service period) bit in the QoS
 *		control field is set.  Only set when first_msdu is set.
 *
 * a_msdu_error
 *		Set if number of MSDUs in A-MSDU is above a threshold or if the
 *		size of the MSDU is invalid. This receive buffer will contain
 *		all of the remainder of MSDUs in this MPDU w/o decapsulation.
 *
 * order
 *		Set if the order bit in the frame control is set.  Only
 *		set when first_msdu is set.
 *
 * wifi_parser_error
 *		Indicates that the WiFi frame has one of the following errors
 *
 * overflow_err
 *		RXPCU Receive FIFO ran out of space to receive the full MPDU.
 *		Therefore this MPDU is terminated early and is thus corrupted.
 *
 *		This MPDU will not be ACKed.
 *
 *		RXPCU might still be able to correctly receive the following
 *		MPDUs in the PPDU if enough fifo space became available in time.
 *
 * mpdu_length_err
 *		Set by RXPCU if the expected MPDU length does not correspond
 *		with the actually received number of bytes in the MPDU.
 *
 * tcp_udp_chksum_fail
 *		Indicates that the computed checksum (tcp_udp_chksum) did
 *		not match the checksum in the TCP/UDP header.
 *
 * ip_chksum_fail
 *		Indicates that the computed checksum did not match the
 *		checksum in the IP header.
 *
 * sa_idx_invalid
 *		Indicates no matching entry was found in the address search
 *		table for the source MAC address.
 *
 * da_idx_invalid
 *		Indicates no matching entry was found in the address search
 *		table for the destination MAC address.
 *
 * amsdu_addr_mismatch
 *		Indicates that an A-MSDU with 'from DS = 0' had an SA mismatching
 *		TA or an A-MDU with 'to DS = 0' had a DA mismatching RA
 *
 * rx_in_tx_decrypt_byp
 *		Indicates that RX packet is not decrypted as Crypto is busy
 *		with TX packet processing.
 *
 * encrypt_required
 *		Indicates that this data type frame is not encrypted even if
 *		the policy for this MPDU requires encryption as indicated in
 *		the peer table key type.
 *
 * directed
 *		MPDU is a directed packet which means that the RA matched
 *		our STA addresses.  In proxySTA it means that the TA matched
 *		an entry in our address search table with the corresponding
 *		'no_ack' bit is the address search entry cleared.
 *
 * buffer_fragment
 *		Indicates that at least one of the rx buffers has been
 *		fragmented.  If set the FW should look at the rx_frag_info
 *		descriptor described below.
 *
 * mpdu_length_err
 *		Indicates that the MPDU was pre-maturely terminated
 *		resulting in a truncated MPDU.  Don't trust the MPDU length
 *		field.
 *
 * tkip_mic_err
 *		Indicates that the MPDU Michael integrity check failed
 *
 * decrypt_err
 *		Indicates that the MPDU decrypt integrity check failed
 *
 * fcs_err
 *		Indicates that the MPDU FCS check failed
 *
 * flow_idx_timeout
 *		Indicates an unsuccessful flow search due to the expiring of
 *		the search timer.
 *
 * flow_idx_invalid
 *		flow id is not valid.
 *
 * decrypt_status_code
 *		Field provides insight into the decryption performed. Values
 *		are defined in enum %RX_DESC_DECRYPT_STATUS_CODE_*.
 *
 * rx_bitmap_not_updated
 *		Frame is received, but RXPCU could not update the receive bitmap
 *		due to (temporary) fifo constraints.
 *
 * msdu_done
 *		If set indicates that the RX packet data, RX header data, RX
 *		PPDU start descriptor, RX MPDU start/end descriptor, RX MSDU
 *		start/end descriptors and RX Attention descriptor are all
 *		valid.  This bit must be in the last octet of the
 *		descriptor.
