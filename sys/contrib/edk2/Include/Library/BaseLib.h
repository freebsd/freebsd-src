  AsmPrepareThunk16() must be called with ThunkContext before this function is used.
  This function must be called with interrupts disabled.

  The register state from the RealModeState field of ThunkContext is restored just prior
  to calling the 16-bit real mode entry point.  This includes the EFLAGS field of RealModeState,
  which is used to set the interrupt state when a 16-bit real mode entry point is called.
  Control is transferred to the 16-bit real mode entry point specified by the CS and Eip fields of RealModeState.
  The stack is initialized to the SS and ESP fields of RealModeState.  Any parameters passed to
  the 16-bit real mode code must be populated by the caller at SS:ESP prior to calling this function.
  The 16-bit real mode entry point is invoked with a 16-bit CALL FAR instruction,
  so when accessing stack contents, the 16-bit real mode code must account for the 16-bit segment
  and 16-bit offset of the return address that were pushed onto the stack. The 16-bit real mode entry
  point must exit with a RETF instruction. The register state is captured into RealModeState immediately
  after the RETF instruction is executed.

  If EFLAGS specifies interrupts enabled, or any of the 16-bit real mode code enables interrupts,
  or any of the 16-bit real mode code makes a SW interrupt, then the caller is responsible for making sure
  the IDT at address 0 is initialized to handle any HW or SW interrupts that may occur while in 16-bit real mode.

  If EFLAGS specifies interrupts enabled, or any of the 16-bit real mode code enables interrupts,
  then the caller is responsible for making sure the 8259 PIC is in a state compatible with 16-bit real mode.
  This includes the base vectors, the interrupt masks, and the edge/level trigger mode.

  If THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_BIG_REAL_MODE is set in the ThunkAttributes field of ThunkContext, then the user code
  is invoked in big real mode.  Otherwise, the user code is invoked in 16-bit real mode with 64KB segment limits.

  If neither THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_INT_15 nor THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_KBD_CTRL are set in
  ThunkAttributes, then it is assumed that the user code did not enable the A20 mask, and no attempt is made to
  disable the A20 mask.

  If THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_INT_15 is set and THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_KBD_CTRL is clear in
  ThunkAttributes, then attempt to use the INT 15 service to disable the A20 mask.  If this INT 15 call fails,
  then attempt to disable the A20 mask by directly accessing the 8042 keyboard controller I/O ports.

  If THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_INT_15 is clear and THUNK_ATTRIBUTE_DISABLE_A20_MASK_KBD_CTRL is set in

    X86_ASSEMBLY_PATCH_LABEL gPatchCr3;
    PatchInstructionX86 (gPatchCr3, AsmReadCr3 (), 4);

  @param[out] InstructionEnd  Pointer right past the instruction to patch. The
                              immediate operand to patch is expected to
                              comprise the trailing bytes of the instruction.
                              If InstructionEnd is closer to address 0 than
                              ValueSize permits, then ASSERT().

  @param[in] PatchValue       The constant to write to the immediate operand.
                              The caller is responsible for ensuring that
                              PatchValue can be represented in the byte, word,
                              dword or qword operand (as indicated through
                              ValueSize); otherwise ASSERT().

  @param[in] ValueSize        The size of the operand in bytes; must be 1, 2,
                              4, or 8. ASSERT() otherwise.
