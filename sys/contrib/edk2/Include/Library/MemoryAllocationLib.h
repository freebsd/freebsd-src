/** @file
  Provides services to allocate and free memory buffers of various memory types and alignments.

  The Memory Allocation Library abstracts various common memory allocation operations. This library
  allows code to be written in a phase-independent manner because the allocation of memory in PEI, DXE,
  and SMM (for example) is done via a different mechanism. Using a common library interface makes it
  much easier to port algorithms from phase to phase.
