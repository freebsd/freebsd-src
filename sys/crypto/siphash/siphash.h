 * SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (a.k.a. keyed hash functions)
 * optimized for speed on short messages returning a 64bit hash/digest value.
 *
 * The number of rounds is defined during the initialization:
 *  SipHash24_Init() for the fast and resonable strong version
 *  SipHash48_Init() for the strong version (half as fast)
 *
 * struct SIPHASH_CTX ctx;
 * SipHash24_Init(&ctx);
 * SipHash_SetKey(&ctx, "16bytes long key");
 * SipHash_Update(&ctx, pointer_to_string, length_of_string);
 * SipHash_Final(output, &ctx);
