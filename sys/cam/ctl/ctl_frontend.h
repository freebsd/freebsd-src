/*
 * The ctl_frontend structure is the registration mechanism between a FETD
 * (Front End Target Driver) and the CTL layer.  Here is a description of
 * the fields:
 *
 * port_type:		  This field tells CTL what kind of front end it is
 *                        dealing with.  This field serves two purposes.
 *                        The first is to let CTL know whether the frontend
 *                        in question is inside the main CTL module (i.e.
 *                        the ioctl front end), and therefore its module
 *                        reference count shouldn't be incremented.  The
 *                        CTL ioctl front end should continue to use the
 *                        CTL_PORT_IOCTL argument as long as it is part of
 *                        the main CTL module.  The second is to let CTL
 *                        know what kind of front end it is dealing with, so
 *                        it can return the proper inquiry data for that
 *                        particular port.
 *
 * num_requested_ctl_io:  This is the number of ctl_io structures that the
 *			  front end needs for its pool.  This should
 * 			  generally be the maximum number of outstanding
 *			  transactions that the FETD can handle.  The CTL
 *			  layer will add a few to this to account for
 *			  ctl_io buffers queued for pending sense data.
 *			  (Pending sense only gets queued if the FETD
 * 			  doesn't support autosense.  e.g. non-packetized
 * 			  parallel SCSI doesn't support autosense.)
 *
 * port_name:		  A string describing the FETD.  e.g. "LSI 1030T U320"
 *			  or whatever you want to use to describe the driver.
 *
 * physical_port:	  This is the physical port number of this
 * 			  particular port within the driver/hardware.  This
 * 			  number is hardware/driver specific.
 * virtual_port:	  This is the virtual port number of this
 * 			  particular port.  This is for things like NP-IV.
 * 
 * port_online():	  This function is called, with onoff_arg as its
 *			  argument, by the CTL layer when it wants the FETD
 *			  to start responding to selections on the specified
 * 			  target ID.
 *
 * port_offline():	  This function is called, with onoff_arg as its
 *			  argument, by the CTL layer when it wants the FETD
 * 			  to stop responding to selection on the specified
 * 			  target ID.
 *
 * onoff_arg:		  This is supplied as an argument to port_online()
 *			  and port_offline().  This is specified by the
 *			  FETD.
 *
 * lun_enable():	  This function is called, with targ_lun_arg, a target
 *			  ID and a LUN ID as its arguments, by CTL when it
 *			  wants the FETD to enable a particular LUN.  If the
 *			  FETD doesn't really know about LUNs, it should
 *			  just ignore this call and return 0.  If the FETD
 *			  cannot enable the requested LUN for some reason, the
 *			  FETD should return non-zero status.
 *
 * lun_disable():	  This function is called, with targ_lun_arg, a target
 *			  ID and LUN ID as its arguments, by CTL when it
 *			  wants the FETD to disable a particular LUN.  If the
 *			  FETD doesn't really know about LUNs, it should just
 *			  ignore this call and return 0.  If the FETD cannot
 *			  disable the requested LUN for some reason, the
 *			  FETD should return non-zero status.
 *
 * targ_lun_arg:	  This is supplied as an argument to the targ/lun
 *			  enable/disable() functions.  This is specified by
 *			  the FETD.
 *
 * fe_datamove():	  This function is called one or more times per I/O
 *			  by the CTL layer to tell the FETD to initiate a
 *			  DMA to or from the data buffer(s) specified by
 * 			  the passed-in ctl_io structure.
 *
 * fe_done():	  	  This function is called by the CTL layer when a
 *			  particular SCSI I/O or task management command has
 * 			  completed.  For SCSI I/O requests (CTL_IO_SCSI),
 *			  sense data is always supplied if the status is
 *			  CTL_SCSI_ERROR and the SCSI status byte is
 *			  SCSI_STATUS_CHECK_COND.  If the FETD doesn't
 *			  support autosense, the sense should be queued
 *			  back to the CTL layer via ctl_queue_sense().
 *
 * fe_dump():		  This function, if it exists, is called by CTL
 *			  to request a dump of any debugging information or
 *			  state to the console.
 *
 * targ_port:		  The CTL layer assigns a "port number" to every
 *			  FETD.  This port number should be passed back in
 *			  in the header of every ctl_io that is queued to
 *			  the CTL layer.  This enables us to determine
 *			  which bus the command came in on.
 *
 * ctl_pool_ref:	  Memory pool reference used by the FETD in calls to
 * 			  ctl_alloc_io().
 *
 * max_initiators:	  Maximum number of initiators that the FETD is
 *			  allowed to have.  Initiators should be numbered
 *			  from 0 to max_initiators - 1.  This value will
 * 			  typically be 16, and thus not a problem for
 * 			  parallel SCSI.  This may present issues for Fibre
 *			  Channel.
 *
 * wwnn			  World Wide Node Name to be used by the FETD.
 *			  Note that this is set *after* registration.  It
 * 			  will be set prior to the online function getting
 * 			  called.
 *
 * wwpn			  World Wide Port Name to be used by the FETD.
 *			  Note that this is set *after* registration.  It
 * 			  will be set prior to the online function getting
 * 			  called.
 *
 * status:		  Used by CTL to keep track of per-FETD state.
 *
 * links:		  Linked list pointers, used by CTL.  The FETD
 *			  shouldn't touch this field.
