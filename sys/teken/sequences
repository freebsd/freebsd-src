# File format is as follows:
#	Abbr		Abbreviation of sequence name
#	Name		Sequence name (will be converted to C function name)
#	Sequence	Bytes that form the sequence
#	Args		Standard value of arguments passed to this sequence
#			- `n' non-zero number (0 gets converted to 1)
#			- `r' regular numeric argument
#			- `v' means a variable number of arguments
