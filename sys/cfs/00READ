NOTE:	The matching user level code has not been released
	yet.  It will be available soon.  The existing released
	Coda code is not quite ready for current.  We'll
	have some patches out soon.

BUG:	There is a bug in file mapping/executing.  When a file is
	first created in Coda, it can not be executed.  But after
	you restart Coda (unmount/mount -- actually vutil -shutdown),
	you can run the file just fine.  I haven't had time to look
	for this problem yet.

WARNING:
	A version of this code has run on stable for a while now.
	The code has been recently ported to current.  It is mostly
	working, but hasn't been run long enough to be sure all the
	bugs are sorted out.  Let me know if there are any problems.
	In particular, killing venus (or rebooting) when/if venus
	is hung, may not work correctly.

	This code is not SMP ready.  Most locks are on vnodes
	and cnodes and go thru the lock manager.  There are a
	few hashes and queues that need to be locked -- I think that's
	all that is needed.
