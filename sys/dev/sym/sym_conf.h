 *  The sym53c8xx driver is derived from the ncr53c8xx driver that had been 
 *  a port of the FreeBSD ncr driver to Linux-1.2.13.

 *  The original ncr driver has been written for 386bsd and FreeBSD by

 *
 *  HVD/LVD/SE capable controllers (895, 895A, 896, 1010) 
 *  report the actual SCSI BUS mode from the STEST4 IO 
 *  register.
 *
 *  But for HVD/SE only capable chips (825a, 875, 885), 
 *  the driver uses some heuristic to probe against HVD. 
 *  Normally, the chip senses the DIFFSENS signal and 
 *  should switch its BUS tranceivers to high impedance 
 *  in situation of the driver having been wrong about 
 *  the actual BUS mode. May-be, the BUS mode probing of 
 *  the driver is safe, but, given that it may be partially 
 *  based on some previous IO register settings, it 
 *  cannot be stated so. Thus, decision has been taken 
 *  to require a user option to be set for the DIFF probing 
 *  to be applied for the 825a, 875 and 885 chips.
 *  
 *  This setup option works as follows:
 *
 *    0  ->  HVD only supported for 895, 895A, 896, 1010.
 *    1  ->  HVD probed  for 825A, 875, 885.
