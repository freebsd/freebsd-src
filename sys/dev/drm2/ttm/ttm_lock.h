/** @file ttm_lock.h
 * This file implements a simple replacement for the buffer manager use
 * of the DRM heavyweight hardware lock.
 * The lock is a read-write lock. Taking it in read mode and write mode
 * is relatively fast, and intended for in-kernel use only.
 *
 * The vt mode is used only when there is a need to block all
 * user-space processes from validating buffers.
 * It's allowed to leave kernel space with the vt lock held.
 * If a user-space process dies while having the vt-lock,
 * it will be released during the file descriptor release. The vt lock
 * excludes write lock and read lock.
 *
 * The suspend mode is used to lock out all TTM users when preparing for
 * and executing suspend operations.
 *
