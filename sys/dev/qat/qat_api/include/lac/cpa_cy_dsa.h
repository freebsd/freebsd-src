 *
 * @ingroup cpaCy
 *
 * @description
 *      These functions specify the API for Public Key Encryption
 *      (Cryptography) Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) operations.
 *
 *      Support is provided for FIPS PUB 186-2 with Change Notice 1
 *      specification, and optionally for FIPS PUB 186-3.  If an
 *      implementation does not support FIPS PUB 186-3, then the
 *      corresponding functions may return a status of @ref
 *      CPA_STATUS_FAIL.
 *
 *      Support for FIPS PUB 186-2 with Change Notice 1 implies supporting
 *      the following choice for the pair L and N:
 *      - L = 1024, N = 160
 *
 *      Support for FIPS PUB 186-3 implies supporting the following choices
 *      for the pair L and N:
 *
 *      - L = 1024, N = 160
 *      - L = 2048, N = 224
 *      - L = 2048, N = 256
 *      - L = 3072, N = 256
 *
 *      Only the modular math aspects of DSA parameter generation and message
 *      signature generation and verification are implemented here.  For full
 *      DSA support, this DSA API SHOULD be used in conjunction with other
 *      parts of this overall Cryptographic API. In particular the Symmetric
 *      functions (for hashing), the Random Number Generation functions, and
 *      the Prime Number Test functions will be required.
 *
 * @note
 *      Large numbers are represented on the QuickAssist API as described
 *      in the Large Number API (@ref cpaCyLn).

 *     FIPS 186-3 Section 4.6:
 *
 *         r = (g^k mod p) mod q
 *         s = (k^-1(z + xr)) mod q
 *
 *     Here, z = the leftmost min(N, outlen) bits of Hash(M).  This function
 *     does not perform the SHA digest; z is computed by the caller and
 *     passed as a parameter in the pOpData field.
 *
 *     The protocol status, returned in the callback function as parameter
 *     protocolStatus (or, in the case of synchronous invocation, in the
 *     parameter *pProtocolStatus) is used to indicate whether either of
 *     the values r or s are zero.
 *
 *     Specifically, (protocolStatus == CPA_TRUE) means neither is zero (i.e.
 *     (r != 0) && (s != 0)), while (protocolStatus == CPA_FALSE) means that at
 *     least one of r or s is zero (i.e. (r == 0) || (s == 0)).
