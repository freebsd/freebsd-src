 * @ingroup cpaCy
 *
 * @description
 *      These functions specify the Cryptographic API for Large Number
 *      Operations.
 *
 * @note
 *      Large numbers are represented on the QuickAssist API using octet
 *      strings, stored in structures of type @ref CpaFlatBuffer.  These
 *      octet strings are encoded as described by PKCS#1 v2.1, section 4,
 *      which is consistent with ASN.1 syntax.  The following text
 *      summarizes this.   Any exceptions to this encoding are specified
 *      on the specific data structure or function to which the exception
 *      applies.
 *
 *      An n-bit number, N, has a value in the range 2^(n-1) through 2^(n)-1.
 *      In other words, its most significant bit, bit n-1 (where bit-counting
 *      starts from zero) MUST be set to 1.  We can also state that the
 *      bit-length n of a number N is defined by n = floor(log2(N))+1.
 *
 *      The buffer, b, in which an n-bit number N is stored, must be "large
 *      enough".  In other words, b.dataLenInBytes must be at least
 *      minLenInBytes = ceiling(n/8).
 *
 *      The number is stored in a "big endian" format.  This means that the
 *      least significant byte (LSB) is b[b.dataLenInBytes-1], while the
 *      most significant byte (MSB) is b[b.dataLenInBytes-minLenInBytes].
 *      In the case where the buffer is "exactly" the right size, then the
 *      MSB is b[0].  Otherwise, all bytes from b[0] up to the MSB MUST be
 *      set to 0x00.
 *
 *      The largest bit-length we support today is 8192 bits. In other
 *      words, we can deal with numbers up to a value of (2^8192)-1.
