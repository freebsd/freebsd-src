 * @description
 *      This structure contains the operation data for the cpaCyPrimeTest
 *      function. The client MUST allocate the memory for this structure and the
 *      items pointed to by this structure. When the structure is passed into
 *      the function, ownership of the memory passes to the function. Ownership
 *      of the memory returns to the client when this structure is returned in
 *      the callback function.
 *
 *      All values in this structure are required to be in Most Significant Byte
 *      first order, e.g. primeCandidate.pData[0] = MSB.
 *
 *      All numbers MUST be stored in big-endian order.
 *
 * @note
 *      If the client modifies or frees the memory referenced in this
 *      structure after it has been submitted to the cpaCyPrimeTest
 *      function, and before it has been returned in the callback, undefined
 *      behavior will result.

 *      Prime Number Test Function.
 *
 * @description
 *      This function will test probabilistically if a number is prime. Refer
 *      to ANSI X9.80 2005 for details. The primality result will be returned
 *      in the asynchronous callback.
 *
 *      The following combination of GCD, Fermat, Miller-Rabin, and Lucas
 *      testing is supported:
 *      (up to 1x GCD) + (up to 1x Fermat) + (up to 50x Miller-Rabin rounds) +
 *      (up to 1x Lucas)
 *      For example:
 *      (1x GCD) + (25x Miller-Rabin) + (1x Lucas);
 *      (1x GCD) + (1x Fermat);
 *      (50x Miller-rabin);
 *
 *      Tests are always performed in order of increasing complexity, for
 *      example GCD first, then Fermat, then Miller-Rabin, and finally Lucas.
 *
 *      For all of the primality tests, the following prime number "sizes"
 *      (length in bits) are supported: all sizes up to and including 512
 *      bits, as well as sizes 768, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072 and 4096.
 *
 *      Candidate prime numbers MUST match these sizes accordingly, with
 *      leading zeroes present where necessary.
 *
 *      When this prime number test is used in conjunction with combined
 *      Miller-Rabin and Lucas tests, it may be used as a means of performing
 *      a self test operation on the random data generator.
 *
 *      A response status of ok (pass == CPA_TRUE) means all requested
 *      primality tests passed, and the prime candidate is probably prime
 *      (the exact probability depends on the primality tests requested).
 *      A response status of not ok (pass == CPA_FALSE) means one of the
 *      requested primality tests failed (the prime candidate has been found
 *      to be composite).
 * @context
 *      When called as an asynchronous function it cannot sleep. It can be
 *      executed in a context that does not permit sleeping.
 *      When called as a synchronous function it may sleep. It MUST NOT be
 *      executed in a context that DOES NOT permit sleeping.
