 * @defgroup  LacHash  Hash
 *
 * @ingroup LacSym
 *
 * API functions of the Hash component
 *
 * @lld_start
 * @lld_overview
 * There is a single \ref cpaCySym "Symmetric LAC API" for hash, cipher,
 * auth encryption and algorithm chaining. This API is implemented by the
 * \ref LacSym "Symmetric" module. It demultiplexes calls to this API into
 * their basic operation and does some common parameter checking and deals
 * with accesses to the session table.
 *
 * The hash component supports hashing in 3 modes. PLAIN, AUTH and NESTED.
 * Plain mode is used to provide data integrity while auth mode is used to
 * provide integrity as well as its authenticity. Nested mode is intended
 * for use by non standard HMAC like algorithms such as for the SSL master
 * key secret. Partial packets is supported for both plain and auth modes.
 * In-place and out-of-place processing is supported for all modes. The
 * verify operation is supported for PLAIN and AUTH modes only.
 *
 * The hash component is responsible for implementing the hash specific
 * functionality for initialising a session and for a perform operation.
 * Statistics are maintained in the symmetric \ref CpaCySymStats64 "stats"
 * structure. This module has been separated out into two. The hash QAT module
 * deals entirely with QAT data structures. The hash module itself has minimal
 * exposure to the QAT data structures.
 *
 * @lld_dependencies
 * - \ref LacCommon
 * - \ref LacSymQat "Symmetric QAT": Hash uses the lookup table provided by
 *   this module to validate user input. Hash also uses this module to build
 *   the hash QAT request message, request param structure, populate the
 *   content descriptor, allocate and populate the hash state prefix buffer.
 *   Hash also registers its function to process the QAT response with this
 *   module.
 * - OSAL : For memory functions, atomics and locking
 *
 * @lld_module_algorithms
 * <b>a. HMAC Precomputes</b>\n
 * HMAC algorithm is specified as follows:
 * \f$ HMAC(msg) = hash((key \oplus opad) \parallel
 * hash((key \oplus ipad) \parallel msg ))\f$.
 * The key is fixed per session, and is padded up to the block size of the
 * algorithm if necessary and xored with the ipad/opad. The following portion
 * of the operation can be precomputed: \f$ hash(key \oplus ipad) \f$ as the
 * output of this intermediate hash will be the same for every perform
 * operation. This intermediate state is the intermediate state of a partial
 * partial packet. It is used as the initialiser state to \f$ hash(msg) \f$.
 * The same applies to \f$ hash(key \oplus ipad) \f$. There is a saving in
 * the data path by the length of time it takes to do two hashes on a block
 * size of data. Note: a partial packet operation generates an intermediate
 * state. The final operation on a partial packet or when a full packet is
 * used applies padding and gives the final hash result. Essentially for the
 * inner hash, a partial packet final is issued on the data, using the
 * precomputed intermediate state and returns the digest.
 *
 * For the HMAC precomputes, \ref LacSymHash_HmacPreCompute(), there are two
 * hash operations done using a internal content descriptor to configure the
 * QAT. A first partial packet is specified as the packet type for the
 * pre-computes as we need the state that uses the initialiser constants
 * specific to the algorithm. The resulting output is copied from the hash
 * state prefix buffer into the QAT content descriptor for the session being
 * initialised. The state is used each perform operation as the initialiser
 * to the algorithm
 *
 * <b>b. AES XCBC Precomputes</b>\n
 * A similar technique to HMAC will be used to generate the precomputes for
 * AES XCBC. In this case a cipher operation will be used to generate the
 * precomputed result. The Pre-compute operation involves deriving 3 128-bit
 *  keys (K1, K2 and K3) from the 128-bit secret key K.
 *
 * - K1 = 0x01010101010101010101010101010101 encrypted with Key K
 * - K2 = 0x02020202020202020202020202020202 encrypted with Key K
 * - K3 = 0x03030303030303030303030303030303 encrypted with Key K
 *
 * A content descriptor  is created with the cipher algorithm set to AES
 * in ECB mode and with the keysize set to 128 bits. The 3 constants, 16 bytes
 * each, are copied into the src buffer and an in-place cipher operation is
 * performed on the 48 bytes. ECB mode does not maintain the state, therefore
 * the 3 keys can be encrypted in one perform. The encrypted result is used by
 * the state2 field in the hash setup block of the content descriptor.
 *
 * The precompute operations use a different lac command ID and thus have a
 * different route in the response path to the symmetric code. In this
 * precompute callback function the output of the precompute operation is
 * copied into the content descriptor for the session being registered.
 *
 * <b>c. AES CCM Precomputes</b>\n
 * The precomputes for AES CCM are trivial, i.e. there is no need to perform
 * a cipher or a digest operation.  Instead, the key is stored directly in
 * the state2 field.
 *
 * <b>d. AES GCM Precomputes</b>\n
 * As with AES XCBC precomputes, a cipher operation will be used to generate
 * the precomputed result for AES GCM.  In this case the Galois Hash
 * Multiplier (H) must be derived and stored in the state2 field.  H is
 * derived by encrypting a 16-byte block of zeroes with the
 * cipher/authentication key, using AES in ECB mode.
 *
 * <b>Key size for Auth algorithms</b>\n
 * <i>Min Size</i>\n
 * RFC 2104 states "The key for HMAC can be of any length. However, less than
 *  L bytes is strongly discouraged as it would decrease the security strength
 *  of the function."
 *
 * FIPS 198a states "The size of the key, K, shall be equal to or greater than
 * L/2, where L is the size of the hash function output."
 *
 * RFC 4434 states "If the key has fewer than 128 bits, lengthen it to exactly
 * 128 bits by padding it on the right with zero bits.
 *
 * A key length of 0 upwards is accepted. It is up to the client to pass in a
 * key that complies with the standard they wish to support.
 *
 * <i>Max Size</i>\n
 * RFC 2104 section 2 states : "Applications that use keys longer than B bytes
 * will first hash the key using H and then use the resultant L byte string
 * as the actual key to HMAC
 *
 * RFC 4434 section 2 states:
 * "If the key is 129 bits or longer, shorten it to exactly 128 bits
 *  by performing the steps in AES-XCBC-PRF-128 (that is, the
 *  algorithm described in this document).  In that re-application of
 *  this algorithm, the key is 128 zero bits; the message is the
 *  too-long current key."
 *
 * We push this up to the client. They need to do the hash operation through
 * the LAC API if the key is greater than the block size of the algorithm. This
 * will reduce the key size to the digest size of the algorithm.
 *
 * RFC 3566 section 4 states:
 * AES-XCBC-MAC-96 is a secret key algorithm.  For use with either ESP or
 * AH a fixed key length of 128-bits MUST be supported.  Key lengths
 * other than 128-bits MUST NOT be supported (i.e., only 128-bit keys are
 * to be used by AES-XCBC-MAC-96).
 *
 * In this case it is up to the client to provide a key that complies with
 * the standards. i.e. exactly 128 bits in size.
 *
 *
 * <b>HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA1-96</b>\n
 * HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA1-96 are defined as requirements by Look Aside
 * IPsec. The differences between HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA1-96 are that the
 * digest produced is truncated and there are strict requirements on the
 * size of the key that is used.
 *
 * They are supported in LAC by HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1. The field
 * \ref CpaCySymHashSetupData::digestResultLenInBytes in the LAC API in
 * bytes needs to be set to 12 bytes. There are also requirements regarding
 * the keysize. It is up to the client to ensure the key size meets the
 * requirements of the standards they are using.
 *
 * RFC 2403: HMAC-MD5-96 Key lengths other than 128-bits MUST NOT be supported.
 * HMAC-MD5-96 produces a 128-bit authenticator value. For use with either
 * ESP or AH, a truncated value using the first 96 bits MUST be supported.
 *
 * RFC2404: HMAC-SHA1-96 Key lengths other than 160- bits MUST NOT be supported
 * HMAC-SHA-1-96 produces a 160-bit authenticator value. For use with either
 * ESP or AH, a truncated value using the first 96 bits MUST be supported.
 *
 * <b>Out of place operations</b>
 * When verify is disabled, the digest will be written to the destination
 * buffer. When verify is enabled, the digest calculated is compared to the
 * digest stored in the source buffer.
 *
 * <b>Partial Packets</b>
 * Partial packets are handled in the \ref LacSym "Symmetric" component for
 * the request. The hash callback function handles the update of the state
 * in the callback.
