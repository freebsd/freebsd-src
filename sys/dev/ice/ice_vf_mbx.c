/* The mailbox overflow detection algorithm helps to check if there
 * is a possibility of a malicious VF transmitting too many MBX messages to the
 * PF.
 * 1. The mailbox snapshot structure, ice_mbx_snapshot, is initialized during
 * driver initialization in ice_init_hw() using ice_mbx_init_snapshot().
 * The struct ice_mbx_snapshot helps to track and traverse a static window of
 * messages within the mailbox queue while looking for a malicious VF.
 *
 * 2. When the caller starts processing its mailbox queue in response to an
 * interrupt, the structure ice_mbx_snapshot is expected to be cleared before
 * the algorithm can be run for the first time for that interrupt. This
 * requires calling ice_mbx_reset_snapshot() as well as calling
 * ice_mbx_reset_vf_info() for each VF tracking structure.
 *
 * 3. For every message read by the caller from the MBX Queue, the caller must
 * call the detection algorithm's entry function ice_mbx_vf_state_handler().
 * Before every call to ice_mbx_vf_state_handler() the struct ice_mbx_data is
 * filled as it is required to be passed to the algorithm.
 *
 * 4. Every time a message is read from the MBX queue, a tracking structure
 * for the VF must be passed to the state handler. The boolean output
 * report_malvf from ice_mbx_vf_state_handler() serves as an indicator to the
 * caller whether it must report this VF as malicious or not.
 *
 * 5. When a VF is identified to be malicious, the caller can send a message
 * to the system administrator.
 *
 * 6. The PF is responsible for maintaining the struct ice_mbx_vf_info
 * structure for each VF. The PF should clear the VF tracking structure if the
 * VF is reset. When a VF is shut down and brought back up, we will then
 * assume that the new VF is not malicious and may report it again if we
 * detect it again.
 *
 * 7. The function ice_mbx_reset_snapshot() is called to reset the information
 * in ice_mbx_snapshot for every new mailbox interrupt handled.
