INTERFACE card;

# Companion interface for pccard.  We need to set attributes for memory
# and i/o port mappings (as well as other types of attributes) that have
# a well defined meaning inside the PC Card/CardBus system.  The bus
# methods are inadequate for this because this must be done at the time the
# resources are set for the device, which predates their activation.  Also,
# the driver activating the resources doesn't necessarily know or need to know
# these attributes.
