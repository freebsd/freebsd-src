/*
 * __BIT(n): Return a bitmask with bit m set, where the least
 *           significant bit is bit 0.
 *
 * __BITS(m, n): Return a bitmask with bits m through n, inclusive,
 *               set.  It does not matter whether m>n or m<=n.  The
 *               least significant bit is bit 0.
 *
 * A "bitfield" is a span of consecutive bits defined by a bitmask,
 * where 1s select the bits in the bitfield.  __SHIFTIN, __SHIFTOUT,
 * and SHIFTOUT_MASK help read and write bitfields from device registers.
 *
 * __SHIFTIN(v, mask): Left-shift bits `v' into the bitfield
 *                     defined by `mask', and return them.  No
 *                     side-effects.
 *
 * __SHIFTOUT(v, mask): Extract and return the bitfield selected
 *                      by `mask' from `v', right-shifting the
 *                      bits so that the rightmost selected bit
 *                      is at bit 0.  No side-effects.
 *
 * __SHIFTOUT_MASK(mask): Right-shift the bits in `mask' so that
 *                        the rightmost non-zero bit is at bit
 *                        0.  This is useful for finding the
 *                        greatest unsigned value that a bitfield
 *                        can hold.  No side-effects.  Note that
 *                        SHIFTOUT_MASK(m) = SHIFTOUT(m, m).
