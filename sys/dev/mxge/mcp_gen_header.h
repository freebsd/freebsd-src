#ifndef _mcp_gen_header_h

/* this file define a standard header used as a first entry point to
   exchange information between firmware/driver and driver.  The
   header structure can be anywhere in the mcp. It will usually be in
   the .data section, because some fields needs to be initialized at
   compile time.
   The 32bit word at offset MX_HEADER_PTR_OFFSET in the mcp must
   contains the location of the header. 

   Typically a MCP will start with the following:
   .text
     .space 52    ! to help catch MEMORY_INT errors
     bt start     ! jump to real code
     nop
     .long _gen_mcp_header
   
   The source will have a definition like:

   mcp_gen_header_t gen_mcp_header = {
      .header_length = sizeof(mcp_gen_header_t),
      .mcp_type = MCP_TYPE_XXX,
      .version = "something $Id: mcp_gen_header.h,v 1.1 2005/12/23 02:10:44 gallatin Exp $",
      .mcp_globals = (unsigned)&Globals
   };
