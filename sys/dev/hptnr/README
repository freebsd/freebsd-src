2. Rebuild the kernel with HighPoint Rocket support
-----------------------------------------------

  1) Install kernel source package and building tools. 
  
  2) Extract the driver files under the kernel source tree:

     # cd /usr/src/sys/
     # tar xvzf /your/path/to/HPTNR_FreeBSD_Src_1.x.x_xx_xx_xx.tgz

  3) Update the kernel configuration file to include the HighPoint source.
     Assume the configure file is GENERIC, and new kernel configure file is 
     MYKERNEL:

     # cd i386/conf          (or amd64/conf for AMD64)
     # cp GENERIC MYKERNEL

  4) Edit MYKERNEL, and add the following line under "RAID controllers 
     interfaced to the SCSI subsystem":

          device  "hptnr"   #HighPoint Rocket

  5) For i386 system, edit /usr/src/sys/conf/files.i386 and append the lines
     shown below:

          hptnr_lib.o optional    hptnr  \
              dependency  "$S/dev/hptnr/i386-elf.hptnr_lib.o.uu" \
              compile-with    "uudecode < $S/dev/hptnr/i386-elf.hptnr_lib.o.uu" \
              no-implicit-rule

          dev/hptnr/hptnr_os_bsd.c      optional        hptnr
          dev/hptnr/hptnr_osm_bsd.c     optional        hptnr
          dev/hptnr/hptnr_config.c      optional        hptnr

     For amd64 system, edit /usr/src/sys/conf/files.amd64 and append the lines
     shown below:

          hptnr_lib.o optional    hptnr  \
              dependency  "$S/dev/hptnr/amd64-elf.hptnr_lib.o.uu" \
              compile-with    "uudecode < $S/dev/hptnr/amd64-elf.hptnr_lib.o.uu" \
              no-implicit-rule

          dev/hptnr/hptnr_os_bsd.c      optional        hptnr
          dev/hptnr/hptnr_osm_bsd.c     optional        hptnr
          dev/hptnr/hptnr_config.c      optional        hptnr

  6) Rebuild and install the kernel:

     a) for FreeBSD 5.x-i386/6.x-i386/7.x-i386/8.x-i386/9.x-i386/10.x-i386:
     
        # cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/
        # /usr/sbin/config MYKERNEL
        # cd ../compile/MYKERNEL/
        # make depend
        # make 
        # make install

     b) for FreeBSD 5.x-amd64/6.x-amd64/7.x-amd64/8.x-amd64/9.x-amd64/10.x-amd64:

        # cd /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/
        # /usr/sbin/config MYKERNEL
        # cd ../compile/MYKERNEL/
        # make depend
        # make 
        # make install

     c) for FreeBSD 4.x:
     
        # cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/
        # /usr/sbin/config MYKERNEL
        # cd ../../compile/MYKERNEL/
        # make depend
        # make 
        # make install

    If the driver was previously configured as an auto-loaded module by
    /boot/defaults/loader.conf, please remove the entry hptnr_load="YES"
    from loader.conf to prevent the driver from being loaded twice.
    
  7) Reboot from the new kernel.


3. Build/Load the driver as a kernel module
------------------------------------------------

  1) Install kernel source package and building tools. 
  
  2) Extract the driver files under the kernel source tree:
    
     # cd /usr/src/sys/
     # tar xvzf /your/path/to/HPTNR_FreeBSD_Src_1.x.x_xx_xx_xx.tgz


  4) Build the driver module:
    
     # cd modules/hptnr
     # make

  5) Copy the driver module to the kernel module directory

     For FreeBSD 4.x:
     
     # cp hptnr.ko /modules/

     For FreeBSD 5.x/6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x/10.x:
    
     # cp hptnr.ko /boot/kernel/

  6) Reboot and load the driver under loader prompt. e.g:

        BTX loader 1.00  BTX version is 1.01
        Console: internal video/keyboard
        BIOS driver A: is disk0
        BIOS driver C: is disk2
        BIOS 636kB/74512kB available memory
        
        FreeBSD/i386 bootstrap loader, Revision 0.8
        (mailto:jkh@narf.osd.bsdi.com, Sat Apr 21 08:46:19 GMT 2001)
        Loading /boot/defaults/loader.conf
        /kernel text=0x24f1db data=0x3007ec+0x2062c -
        
        Hit [Enter] to boot immediagely, or any other key for command prompt.
        Booting [kernel] in 9 seconds
        
         <-- press SPACE key here 
        Type '?' for a list of commands, 'help' for more detailed help.
        ok load hptnr
        /modules/hptnr.ko text=0xf571 data=0x2c8+0x254
        ok boot
        
     For FreeBSD 5.x/6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x/10.x, you can select 6 on the boot menu to get a loader
     prompt.
  
  7) You can add a below line into /boot/defaults/loader.conf to load the
     driver automatically:
    
           hptnr_load="YES"
    
     Please refer to the installation guide in HighPoint FreeBSD driver release 
     package for more information.
