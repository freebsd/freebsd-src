PROSUM
PROATM ATM Adapters on FreeBSD


1. Introduction
===============

The PROATM adapters are based on the IDT77252 SAR and are not supported by the
idt driver Richard Hodges for IDT77211 SAR.

Prosum provides the proatm driver that is derived from the Richard Hodges driver
and the Prosum nicstar2 driver for the IDT77252 SAR. Proatm can be used with
kernel versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.1 and newer. It supports the ATM 25.6 Mbps and 155
Mbps Prosum card models and the UBR, CBR and VBR QoS. It is compatible with the
Host ATM Research Platform (HARP) software.

We recommend you to download the latest version of this driver from our web
site. You can contact us at the address indicated in section 5 regarding any
problem of for knowing the state of the pending version.


2. Installing proatm
====================

NOTE: If you are not familiar with building and installing a new kernel, please
refer to the FreeBSD Handbook.

Proatm is delivered in the form of a patch but you need not use the patch
utility to install it. Follow the procedure below.

* Copy proatm.c, proatm.h and proatm_rtbl.c into /usr/src/sys/pci.
* Copy atm_if.h into /usr/src/sys/netatm.

* in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/YOUR_NAME add these entries:

        options     ATM_CORE	#core ATM protocol family
        options     ATM_IP      #IP over ATM support

* at least one (and usually one) of the following:

        options     ATM_SIGPVC  #SIGPVC signalling manager
        options     ATM_SPANS   #SPANS signalling manager
        options     ATM_UNI     #UNI signalling manager

* and the device driver:

        device      proatm0     #PROATM device driver (this file)

* on 3.5 and 3.51 kernel versions,add the following line to
/usr/src/sys/conf/files:

        pci/proatm.c    optional proatm device-driver

* on 4.1 and newer kernel versions,add the following line to
/usr/src/sys/conf/files:

        pci/proatm.c    optional proatm pci

* Then rebuild and install your kernel and reboot.

To rebuild and install your kernel, do the following in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf:

# config YOUR_NAME

# cd ../../compile/YOUR_NAME
# make depend
# make
# make install
# reboot
(old kernel is /kernel.old if you need it!)


3. Configuring the HARP software
================================
* Referring to rc.atm provided, edit /etc/rc.atm and add 3 lines to atm_pass1()
to detect the Proatm cards. You may also simply copy rc.atm into /etc.

* Edit /etc/rc.conf.Below is an example for two PVCs connections automatically
open at start time:

    atm_enable="YES"
    atm_netif_proatm0="atm 1"      # Network interfaces for physical interface.
    atm_sigmgr_proatm0="SIGPVC"    # Signalling manager for physical interface.
    atm_prefix_proatm0=""          # NSAP prefix
    atm_macaddr_proatm0="NO"       # Override physical MAC address (or NO).
    #atm_arpserver_proatm0="0x47.0005.80.007300.0000.0300.0100.0020481C095F00"
    atm_scsparp_atm0="NO"          # Run SCSP/ATMARP (or NO)
    atm_pvcs="0 1"
    atm_pvc_0="proatm0 0 32 AAL5 SNAP IP atm0 192.168.2.8"
    atm_pvc_1="proatm0 0 100 AAL5 SNAP IP atm0 192.168.2.9"
    #atm_arps=""
    network_interfaces="pcn0 atm0 lo0"
    ifconfig_pcn0="inet 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0"      #Ethernet
    ifconfig_atm0="inet 192.168.2.5 netmask 255.255.255.0"      #ATM

* Reboot the system.


4. Checking the installation
============================
Here are samples showing the output of some commands allowing to verify that
everything went well:

    > netstat -ni
    Name  Mtu   Network       Address            Ipkts Ierrs  Opkts Oerrs Coll
    atm0  9180  <Link#7>    00:c0:fd:00:7a:ad        0     0      0     0    0
    atm0  9180  192.168.2     192.168.2.5        47308     -  47308     -    -

    > atm show config proatm0
    Intf      Vendor    Model     Media           Bus   Serial No
    proatm0   -         -         OC-3c           PCI   0
        MAC address = 00:c0:fd:00:7a:ad
        Hardware version = PROATM-155
        Firmware version = PROATM 1.000

    > atm show interface
    Interface  Sigmgr   State
    proatm0    SIGPVC   ACTIVE
        ATM address = -
        Network interfaces: atm0

* With another machine connected on the atm network and setup for a CLIP
connection over the PVC #0.32:

    > ping 192.168.2.8

5. Configuring the driver
=========================
Look for the "You may change these" section in proatm.h. It contains compilation
parameters that can be changed to set up some driver features. Don't touch
anything unless you know exactly what you are doing.

PROATM_LBUFS and PROATM_SBUFS
-----------------------------
Defines the default number of large (2k) and small (96-bytes) buffers that are
reserved for receipt.
Default value is 200. Authorized values range from 70 to 510.

PROATM_VPIBITS
--------------
Defines the number of bits used to code the VP number.
Default value is 2. Authorized values are 0, 1, 2, or 8. Refer to the table
below:

	PROATM_VPIBITS      VPI             VCI (128KB SRAM)    VCI (512KB SRAM)
	0                   0               0 to 1023           0 to 4095
	1                   0, 1            0 to 511            0 to 2047
	2                   0, 1, 2, 3      0 to 255            0 to 1023
	8                   0 to 255        0 to 3              0 to 15

Note: Cards equipped with 128KB memory can support 1024 VCs. Cards equipped
with 512KB memory can support 4096 VCs

PROATM_MAX_QUEUE
----------------
Defines the maximum number of transmition queues. Each VC needs one queue
(except UBR VCs with maximum or with unspecified Peak Cell rate that all use
the same special queue). Each transmission queue needs 1 KB of host memory.

Default value: 250 (250 KB memory)
Maximum authorized values:  269 for 128KB-memory cards, 4095 for 512KB-memory
cards.

RCQ_SUPPORT
-----------
Enables receipt of erroneous cells, or receipt of cells from non open VCs. So
far we do nothing with these cells but an empty function is provided where you
can write your own processing.

VPI_BASE and VCI_BASE
---------------------
You can normaly transmit and receive on VCs with VPI/VCI values depending on
PROATM_VPIBITS and the card memory size. (Refer to the table above)
However in certain special cases you may need to use normally-unreachable
VPI/VCI couples such as 8/35 for example. To do that set VCI_BASE and VPI_BASE
according to your needs. For example setting VPI_BASE to 8 and VCI_BASE to 0
would allow you to play with the 8.35 VC.

WARNING: Please be aware that VPIs below VPI_BASE and VCIs below VCI_BASE are
not reachable anymore when you set them to non zero values.

VPI_BASE is smaller than 256. It is a multiple (0 included) of the number
of VPIs the card has been set up for.
For example, if PROATM_VPIBITS = 2, the number of possible VPIs is 4 and
VPI_BASE may be set to 0, 4, 8, 12 ... 254.

VCI_BASE plays for the VCs the same role as VPI_BASE for the VPs. It is smaller
than 64536 and must be a multiple of the number of VC's that the card is able to
manage.
For example let's suppose if the card has 128 KB memory and PROATM_VPIBITS = 2,
the number of VCI bits is 8 (10-2) and thus the number of VCIs is 256, then
VPI_BASE may be set to any value from among 0, 256, 512 ... 64280 (simple isn't
it?)
