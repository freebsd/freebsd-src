Things that need doing!

* RIFS? Do I care about supporting RIFS?

* Fast Frames? Do I care about supporting FF here, or is it done via suitable
  evilness in net80211?

* A-MPDU aggregation?
  + how many pending A-MPDU frames per hardware TXQ? As many as needed? One?

* Software retransmit when aggregation is enabled
  + Whether doing A-MPDU or not
  + Support rate updates and lookup on a retry; maybe a slower rate
    is needed?

* Send BAR when needed
  + after TX failure
  + when else?

* DELBA - ie, downgrade existing packets in the SWQ
  + What about stuff in the HWQ?

* 20<->2040 mode change?
  + part of this project or not?
  + right now packets are simply flushed; why not just re-prod them into
    the software TXQ ?

Things that need investigating!

* Recursive HW TXQ's sometimes? Get some details about the the next one

* LORs? Post some more details! (on STA join and node deletion?)

* How should channel scanning be handled? Right now it's causing both a HW TXQ
  and SW TXQ / node flush; this means the BAW will need to be slid along. Eek.

* When a node is flushed (but not being deleted) should the BAW also be updated?
  I don't think it is right now and this could be incorrect.
