# attach() - attach hardware.
# This method is called when the device is being attached. All resources
# have been allocated. The transmit and receive buffers exist, but no
# high-level (ie tty) initialization has been done yet.
# The intend of this method is to setup the hardware for normal operation.
METHOD int attach {
	struct uart_softc *this;
};

# detach() - detach hardware.
# This method is called when a device is being detached from its bus. It
# is the first action performed, so even the high-level (ie tty) interface
# is still operational.
# The intend of this method is to disable the hardware.
METHOD int detach {

# flush() - flush FIFOs.
# This method is called to flush the transmitter and/or the receiver as
# specified by the what argument. Characters are expected to be lost.
METHOD int flush {

};

# getsig() - get line and modem signals.
# This method retrieves the DTE and DCE signals and their corresponding
# delta bits. The delta bits include those corresponding to DTE signals
# when they were changed by a call to setsig. The delta bits maintained
# by the hardware driver are cleared as a side-effect. A second call to
# this function will not have any delta bits set, unless there was a
# change in the signals in the mean time.
METHOD int getsig {
	struct uart_softc *this;
};

# ioctl() - get or set miscellaneous parameters.
# This method is the bitbucket method. It can (and will) be used when there's
# something we need to set or get for which a new method is overkill. It's
# used for example to set HW or SW flow-control.
METHOD int ioctl {

# ipend() - query UART for pending interrupts.
# When an interrupt is signalled, the handler will call this method to find
# out which of the interrupt sources needs attention. The handler will use
# this information to dispatch service routines that deal with each of the
# interrupt sources. An advantage of this approach is that it allows multi-
# port drivers (like puc(4)) to query multiple devices concurrently and
# service them on an interrupt priority basis. If the hardware cannot provide
# the information reliably, it is free to service the interrupt and return 0,
# meaning that no attention is required.

# to something that represents the hardware.

# receive() - move data from the receive FIFO to the receive buffer.
# This method is called to move received data to the receive buffer and
# additionally should make sure the receive interrupt should be cleared.
METHOD int receive {
	struct uart_softc *this;
};

# setsig() - set line and modem signals.
# This method allows changing DTE signals. The DTE delta bits indicate which
# signals are to be changed and the DTE bits themselves indicate whether to
# set or clear the signals. A subsequent call to getsig will return with the
# DTE delta bits set of those DTE signals that did change by this method.
METHOD int setsig {

# transmit() - move data from the transmit buffer to the transmit FIFO.
# This method is responsible for writing the Tx buffer to the UART and
# additionally should make sure that a transmit interrupt is generated
# when transmission is complete.
METHOD int transmit {
	struct uart_softc *this;
};

# txbusy() - report if Tx is still busy.
# This method is called by the tty glue for reporting upward that output is
# still being drained despite sc_txbusy unset. Non-DEFAULT implementations
# allow for extra checks, i. e. beyond what can be determined in ipend(),
# that the Tx path actually is idle. For example, whether the last character
# has left the transmit shift register in addition to the FIFO being empty.
METHOD bool txbusy {
	struct uart_softc *this;
} DEFAULT uart_default_txbusy;

# grab() - Up call from the console to the upper layers of the driver when
# the kernel asks to grab the console. This is valid only for console
# drivers. This method is responsible for transitioning the hardware
# from an interrupt driven state to a polled state that works with the
# low-level console interface defined for this device. The kernel
# currently only calls this when it wants to grab input from the
# console. Output can still happen asyncrhonously to these calls.
METHOD void grab {
