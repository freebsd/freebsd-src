 *        the user task request object and the core task request object.
 *
 * @param[in]  scic_controller the handle to the core controller object
 *             for which to build the task managmement request.
 * @param[in]  scic_remote_device the handle to the core remote device
 *             object for which to build the task management request.
 *             passed, then a copy of the request is built internally.  The
 *             request will be copied into the actual controller request
 *             memory when the task is allocated internally during the
 *             scic_controller_start_task() method.

 * @param[in]  user_task_request_object This parameter specifies the user
 *             task request to be utilized during construction.  This task
 *             pointer will become the associated object for the core
 *             task request object.
 * @param[in]  scic_task_request_memory This parameter specifies the memory
 *             location to be utilized when building the core request.
 * @param[out] new_scic_task_request_handle This parameter specifies a
 *             pointer to the handle the core will expect in further
 *             interactions with the core task request object.
 *
 * @return Indicate if the controller successfully built the task request.
