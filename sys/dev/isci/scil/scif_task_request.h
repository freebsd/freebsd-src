/**
 * @brief This method is called by the SCIF user to construct a task
 *        management request.  This method will construct a SCIC task request
 *        internally.
 *
 * @note  The SCI framework implementation will create an association between
 *        the user task request object and the framework task request object.
 *
 * @param[in]  scif_controller the handle to the framework controller object
 *             for which to build an IO request.
 * @param[in]  scif_remote_device This parameter specifies the framework
 *             remote device with which this task request is to be associated.
 * @param[in]  io_tag This parameter specifies the IO tag to be associated
 *             with this request.  If SCI_CONTROLLER_INVALID_IO_TAG is
 *             passed, then a copy of the request is built internally.  The
 *             request will be copied into the actual controller request
 *             memory when the IO tag is allocated internally during the
 *             scif_controller_start_task() method.
 * @param[in]  user_task_request_object This parameter specifies the user
 *             task request to be utilized during task construction.  This task
 *             pointer will become the associated object for the framework
 *             task request object.
 * @param[in]  task_request_memory This parameter specifies the memory
 *             to be utilized in the construction of the framework task request.
 * @param[in]  scif_task_request This parameter specifies the handle to be
 *             utilized for all further interactions with this task request
 *             object.
 *
 * @return Indicate if the controller successfully built the task request.
 * @retval SCI_SUCCESS This value is returned if the task request was
 *         successfully built.
