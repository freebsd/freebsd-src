@section scic_introduction_section Introduction

The Storage Controller Interface Core (SCIC) provides the underlying fundamental
hardware abstractions required to implement a standard SAS/SATA storage driver.

The following is a list of features that may be found in a core implementation:
-# hardware interrupt handling
-# hardware event handling
-# hardware state machine handling
-# IO and task management state machine handling
-# Phy staggered spin up

@note
For the SCU Driver Standard implementation of the SCI Core interface the
following definitions should be used to augment the cardinalities described
in the previous diagram:
-# There are exactly 4 scic_phy objects in the scic_controller.
-# There are exactly 4 scic_port objects in the scic_controller.
-# There can be a maximum of 4 scic_phy objects managed in a single scic_port.
-# The maximum number of supported controllers in a library is a truly flexible
   value, but the likely maximum number is 4.
