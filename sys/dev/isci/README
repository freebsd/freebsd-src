FreeBSD Driver for Intel(R) C600 SAS Controller
===============================================

This driver has been developed for use with FreeBSD, version 9.0 and later.

This driver uses an OS-agnostic abstraction layer library named SCIL that is
published by Intel specifically for the C600 SAS controller.  The SAS
controller has no firmware, so the driver is extensive and using SCIL
minimizes the development and maintenance cost of the driver.

The FreeBSD implementation files are in the isci directory, and SCIL files
are in the isci/scil subdirectory.  As Intel publishes new versions of SCIL
(to add features or fix bugs), the isci/scil subdirectory will be updated
appropriately.
