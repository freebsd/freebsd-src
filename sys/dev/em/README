Overview
========

This file describes the FreeBSD* driver, version 1.7.x, for the Intel(R)
PRO/1000 Family of Adapters. This driver has been developed for use with 
FreeBSD, version 4.7. 

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation 
supplied with your Intel PRO/1000 adapter. All hardware requirements listed 
apply to use with FreeBSD.

To verify your Intel adapter is supported, find the board ID number on the
adapter. Look for a label that has a barcode and a number in the format of
123456-001 (six digits hyphen three digits). Match this to the list of 
numbers above.

For more information on how to identify your adapter, go to the Adapter &
Driver ID Guide at:

Building and Installation
=========================

NOTE: The driver can be installed as a dynamic loadable kernel module or 
      compiled into the kernel. You must have kernel sources installed in 
      order to compile the driver module.

In the instructions below, x.x.x is the driver version as indicated in the 
name of the driver tar file.

1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice. For 
   example, use /home/username/em or /usr/local/src/em.

2. Untar/unzip the archive:

        tar xvfz em-x.x.x.tar.gz

   This will create an em-x.x.x directory.

3. To create a loadable module, perform the following steps. 
   NOTE: To compile the driver into the kernel, go directly to step 4.

	a. To compile the module

	          cd em-x.x.x
      	          make

   	b. To install the compiled module in system directory:
	 
		  make install
		
   	c. If you want the driver to load automatically when the system is booted:

      	      1. Follow steps a, and b above to compile and install the module
	      2. Edit /boot/loader.conf, and add the following line:

      	          if_em_load="YES"

4. To compile the driver into the kernel:

        cd em-x.x.x/src

        cp if_em* /usr/src/sys/dev/em

        cp Makefile.kernel /usr/src/sys/modules/em/Makefile

   Edit the /usr/src/sys/conf/files.i386 file, and add the following lines:

        dev/em/if_em.c optional em

        dev/em/if_em_hw.c optional em 

   Remove the following lines from the /usr/src/sys/conf/files.i386 file, 
   if they exist:

        dev/em/if_em_fxhw.c optional em
        dev/em/if_em_phy.c optional em

   Edit the kernel configuration file (i.e., GENERIC or MYKERNEL) in 
   /usr/src/sys/i386/conf, and ensure the following line is present:

        device em

   Compile and install the kernel. The system must be rebooted for the kernel
   updates to take effect. For additional information on compiling the 
   kernel, consult the FreeBSD operating system documentation.

5. To assign an IP address to the interface, enter the following:

        ifconfig em<interface_num> <IP_address>

6. Verify that the interface works. Enter the following, where <IP_address>
   is the IP address for another machine on the same subnet as the interface
   that is being tested:

        ping <IP_address>

7. To configure the IP address to remain after reboot, edit /etc/rc.conf, 
   and create the appropriate ifconfig_em<interface_num> entry:

        ifconfig_em<interface_num>="<ifconfig_settings>"

   Example usage:

        ifconfig_em0="inet 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"

   NOTE: For assistance, see the ifconfig man page.


Speed and Duplex Configuration
==============================

By default, the adapter auto-negotiates the speed and duplex of the 
connection. If there is a specific need, the ifconfig utility can be used to 
configure the speed and duplex settings on the adapter. Example usage:

        ifconfig em<interface_num> <IP_address> media 100baseTX mediaopt 
            full-duplex

   NOTE: Only use mediaopt to set the driver to full-duplex. If mediaopt is 
         not specified and you are not running at gigabit speed, the driver 
         defaults to half-duplex.


This driver supports the following media type options:

   autoselect      -  Enables auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.

   10baseT/UTP     -  Sets speed to 10 Mbps. Use the ifconfig mediaopt 
                      option to select full-duplex mode.

   100baseTX       -  Sets speed to 100 Mbps. Use the ifconfig mediaopt
                      option to select full-duplex mode.

   1000baseTX      -  Sets speed to 1000 Mbps. In this case, the driver
                      supports only full-duplex mode.

   1000baseSX      -  Sets speed to 1000 Mbps. In this case, the driver
                      supports only full-duplex mode.

For more information on the ifconfig utility, see the ifconfig man page.


Additional Configurations
=========================

The driver supports Transmit/Receive Checksum Offload and Jumbo Frames on 
all but the 82542-based adapters. For specific adapters, refer to the 
Supported Adapters section.

  Jumbo Frames
  ------------
  To enable Jumbo Frames, use the ifconfig utility to increase the MTU 
  beyond 1500 bytes. 

  NOTES: Only enable Jumbo Frames if your network infrastructure supports 
         them.
   
         The Jumbo Frames setting on the switch must be set to at least 
         22 bytes larger than that of the adapter.

  The Jumbo Frames MTU range for Intel Adapters is 1500 to 16114. The default 
  MTU range is 1500. To modify the setting, enter the following:

        ifconfig em<interface_num> <hostname or IP address> mtu 9000

  To confirm an interface's MTU value, use the ifconfig command. To confirm
  the MTU used between two specific devices, use:

        route get <destination_IP_address>

  VLANs
  -----
  To create a new VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> create

  To associate the VLAN pseudo-interface with a physical interface and 
  assign a VLAN ID, IP address, and netmask:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> <ip_address> netmask <subnet_mask> vlan 
           <vlan_id> vlandev <physical_interface>

  Example:

        ifconfig vlan10 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 vlan10 vlandev em0

  In this example, all packets will be marked on egress with  802.1Q VLAN 
  tags, specifying a VLAN ID of 10.

  To remove a VLAN pseudo-interface:

        ifconfig <vlan_name> destroy

  Polling
  -------
  To enable polling in the driver, add the following options to the kernel 
  configuration, and then recompile the kernel:

        options DEVICE_POLLING
        options HZ=1000

  At runtime, use the following command to turn on polling mode. Similarly,
  turn off polling mode by setting the variable to 0:

        sysctl kern.polling.enable=1


  NOTES: DEVICE POLLING is only valid for non-SMP kernels.

         The driver has to be built into the kernel for DEVICE POLLING to be
         enabled in the driver.


Known Limitations
=================
 
  There are known performance issues with this driver when running UDP traffic
  with Jumbo Frames. Intel recommends not using Jumbo Frames for UDP traffic.


  82541/82547 can't link or is slow to link with some link partners
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  There is a known compatibility issue with 82541/82547 and some switches 
  where link will not be established, or will be slow to establish.  In 
  particular, these switches are known to be incompatible with 82541/82547:

        Planex FXG-08TE
        I-O Data ETG-SH8

  To workaround the issue, the driver can be compiled with an override of the 
  PHY's master/slave setting.  Forcing master or forcing slave mode will 
  improve time-to-link.

  Edit ./em.x.x.x/src/if_em.h to remove the #define EM_MASTER_SLAVE 
  from within the comments.  

      /* #define EM_MASTER_SLAVE  2 */
      #define EM_MASTER_SLAVE  2 

  Use one of the following options.
      0 = Hardware default
      1 = Master mode
      2 = Slave mode
      3 = Auto master/slave

  Recompile the module (refer to step 3 above)
  a. To compile the module

          cd em-x.x.x
          make clean
          make

   b. To install the compiled module in system directory:
 
          make install
