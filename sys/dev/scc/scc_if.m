# attach() - attach hardware.
# This method is called when the device is being attached. All resources
# have been allocated. The intend of this method is to setup the hardware
# for normal operation.
# The reset parameter informs the hardware driver whether a full device
# reset is allowed or not. This is important when one of the channels can
# be used as system console and a hardware reset would disrupt output.

# ipend() - query SCC for pending interrupts.
# When an interrupt is signalled, the handler will call this method to find
# out which of the interrupt sources needs attention. The handler will use
# this information to dispatch service routines that deal with each of the
# interrupt sources. An advantage of this approach is that it allows multi-
# port drivers (like puc(4)) to query multiple devices concurrently and
# service them on an interrupt priority basis. If the hardware cannot provide
# the information reliably, it is free to service the interrupt and return 0,
# meaning that no attention is required.
METHOD int ipend {

# probe() - detect hardware.
# This method is called as part of the bus probe to make sure the
# hardware exists. This function should also set the device description
# to something that represents the hardware.
