.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm loader.conf.lua
.Nd Lua-based system bootstrap configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the lua-based
.Xr loader 8
encounters a filename in
.Va loader_conf_files
that has a
.Dq .lua
suffix, it will be loaded and executed by the lua interpreter in a limited
environment.
.Pp
The limited environment does not contain the ability to reference or load other
lua modules.
Existing loader environment variables may be referenced as if they were already
defined global variables.
.Pp
A lua configuration file may set any global variable, which will subsequently
be processed and added to the environment after execution of the configuration
file has completed.
Other than the
.Ar exec
setting, all variables described in
.Xr loader.conf 5
operate the same in the
.Nm
environment.
Note that the settings describing module options can only be set in the
environment; there is currently no way for a
.Pa loader.conf.lua
to fetch them.
At this time, global table and function values are ignored.
.Pp
The
.Fn config.buildenv
hook will be run with an empty environment provided to it that may be populated
by a custom
.Pa local.lua .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr loader.conf 5
.Sh AUTHORS
The mechanism for loading
.Nm
files was originally written by
.An Kyle Evans Aq Mt kevans@FreeBSD.org .
