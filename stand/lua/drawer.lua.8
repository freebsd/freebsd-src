.Sh NAME
.Nm drawer.lua
.Nd bootloader menu/screen drawer module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains functionality for drawing and manipulating the menu, logo, and brand
to the screen.
.Pp
Before using the functionality provided by
.Nm ,
it must be included with a statement such as the following:
.Pp
.Dl local drawer = require("drawer")
.Ss BRAND DEFINITIONS
Brand definitions describe a
.Dq brand ,
traditionally drawn above the menu.
The exact position may be controlled by using the
.Xr loader.conf 5
variables
.Va loader_brand_x
and
.Va loader_brand_y .
The following keys may be defined for a brand definition:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic Graphic" -offset indent
.It Ic graphic
A table of strings containing rows of text to be drawn to the screen.
.El
.Ss LOGO DEFINITIONS
Logo definitions describe a
.Dq logo ,
traditionally to the right of the menu.
The exact position may be controlled by using the
.Xr loader.conf 5
variables
.Va loader_logo_x
and
.Va loader_logo_y .
The following keys may be defined for a logo definition:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic requires_color" -offset indent
.It Ic requires_color
A boolean describing whether or not this logo definition requires color.
If it is chosen to be drawn and it requires color on a color-disabled boot,
.Nm
will elect to use the default
.Dq orbbw
logo rather than the chosen logo.
.It Ic graphic
A table of strings containing rows of text to be drawn to the screen.
.It Ic shift
A table describing the
.Va x
and
.Va y
shift that should be applied to all elements should this logo be selected.
This is typically used for shifting the menu and brand if an empty or minimal
logo are selected.
.El
.Ss CUSTOM BRANDS AND LOGOS
The brand and logo system is designed to allow brands and logos to be easily
plugged in.
When an unrecognized
.Ev loader_brand
or
.Ev loader_logo
are encountered,
.Nm
will attempt to include
.Pa brand-${loader_brand}.lua
or
.Pa logo-${loader_logo}.lua
respectively.
These files are expected to call either
.Fn drawer.addBrand
or
.Fn drawer.addLogo
to add the requested branddef or logodef.
.Nm
will attempt to do another lookup for the requested brand or logo before falling
back to one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic drawer.default_color_logodef" -offset indent
.It Ic drawer.default_brand
The default brand to be used if the requested brand cannot be located.
.It Ic drawer.default_color_logodef
The default logodef to be used if an invalid logodef is requested and
.Xr loader 8
has been configured to allow output of color.
.It Ic drawer.default_bw_logodef
The default logodef to be used if either an invalid logodef has been requested,
or a logodef has been requested that requires color and
.Xr loader 8
has been configured to not output color.
.El
.Ss FRAME STYLES
.Nm
contains the definitions for the different frame styles that may be drawn around
the menu.
Frame styles define the characters drawn for horizontal lines, vertical aligns,
and each of the four corner styles.
The following keys may be defined for a frame style:
.Bl -bullet -width ""
.It
horizontal
.It
vertical
.It
top_left
.It
bottom_left
.It
top_right
.It
bottom_right
.El
Frame styles are currently defined in the table
.Ic drawer.frame_styles
indexed by the name used for
.Ev loader_menu_frame .
No API currently exists for manipulating this table indirectly.
.Ss Exported functions
The following functions are exported from
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width hook.registerType -offset indent
.It Fn drawer.addBrand name def
Add the brand definition described by
.Fa def
to the table of known brand definitions, indexed by
.Fa name .
.It Fn drawer.addLogo name def
