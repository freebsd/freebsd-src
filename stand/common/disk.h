 * Device descriptor for partitioned disks. To use, set the
 * d_slice and d_partition variables as follows:
 *
 * Whole disk access:
 *
 * 	d_slice = D_SLICENONE
 * 	d_partition = <doesn't matter>
 *
 * Whole MBR slice:
 *
 * 	d_slice = MBR slice number (typically 1..4)
 * 	d_partition = D_PARTNONE
 *
 * BSD disklabel partition within an MBR slice:
 *
 * 	d_slice = MBR slice number (typically 1..4)
 * 	d_partition = disklabel partition (typically 0..19 or D_PARTWILD)
 *
 * BSD disklabel partition on the true dedicated disk:
 *
 * 	d_slice = D_SLICENONE
 * 	d_partition = disklabel partition (typically 0..19 or D_PARTWILD)
 *
 * GPT partition:
 *
 * 	d_slice = GPT partition number (typically 1..N)
 * 	d_partition = D_PARTISGPT
 *
 * For MBR, setting d_partition to D_PARTWILD will automatically use the first
 * partition within the slice.
 *
 * For both MBR and GPT, to automatically find the 'best' slice and partition,
 * set d_slice to D_SLICEWILD. This uses the partition type to decide which
 * partition to use according to the following list of preferences:
 *
 * 	FreeBSD (active)
 * 	FreeBSD (inactive)
 * 	Linux (active)
 * 	Linux (inactive)
 * 	DOS/Windows (active)
 * 	DOS/Windows (inactive)
 *
 * Active MBR slices (marked as bootable) are preferred over inactive. GPT
 * doesn't have the concept of active/inactive partitions. In both MBR and GPT,
 * if there are multiple slices/partitions of a given type, the first one
 * is chosen.
 *
 * The low-level disk device will typically call disk_open() from its open
 * method to interpret the disk partition tables according to the rules above.
 * This will initialize d_offset to the block offset of the start of the
 * selected partition - this offset should be added to the offset passed to
 * the device's strategy method.
