.Sh NAME
.Nm zfsboot
.Nd bootcode for ZFS on BIOS-based computers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used on BIOS-based computers to boot from a filesystem in
a ZFS pool.
.Nm
is installed in two parts on a disk or a partition used by a ZFS pool.
The first part, a single-sector starter boot block, is installed
at the beginning of the disk or partition.
The second part, a main boot block, is installed at a special offset
within the disk or partition.
Both areas are reserved by the ZFS on-disk specification for boot use.
If
.Nm
is installed in a partition, then that partition should be made
bootable using appropriate configuration and boot blocks described in
.Xr boot 8 .
.Sh BOOTING
The
.Nm
boot process is very similar to that of
.Xr gptzfsboot 8 .
One significant difference is that
.Nm
does not currently support the GPT partitioning scheme.
Thus only whole disks and MBR partitions, traditionally referred to as
slices, are probed for ZFS disk labels.
See the BUGS section in
.Xr gptzfsboot 8
for some limitations of the MBR scheme support.
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
supports all the same prompt and configuration file arguments as
.Xr gptzfsboot 8 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /boot/zfsboot -compact
.It Pa /boot/zfsboot
boot code binary
.It Pa /boot.config
parameters for the boot block
.Pq optional
.It Pa /boot/config
alternative parameters for the boot block
.Pq optional
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
is typically installed using
.Xr dd 1 .
To install
.Nm
on the
.Pa ada0
drive:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=/boot/zfsboot of=/dev/ada0 count=1
dd if=/boot/zfsboot of=/dev/ada0 iseek=1 oseek=1024
.Ed
.Pp
If the drive is currently in use, the GEOM safety will prevent writes
and must be disabled before running the above commands:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl kern.geom.debugflags=0x10
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
can also be installed in an MBR slice:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gpart create -s mbr ada0
gpart add -t freebsd ada0
gpart bootcode -b /boot/boot0 ada0
gpart set -a active -i 1 ada0
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ada0s1 count=2
dd if=/boot/zfsboot of=/dev/ada0s1 count=1
dd if=/boot/zfsboot of=/dev/ada0s1 iseek=1 oseek=1024
.Ed
.Pp
Note that commands to create and populate a pool are not shown
in the example above.

.Sh HISTORY

.Sh BUGS
Installing
.Nm
with
.Xr dd 1
is a hack.
ZFS needs a command to properly install
.Nm
onto a ZFS-controlled disk or partition.
