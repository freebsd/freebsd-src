.Sh NAME
.Nm loader
.Nd kernel bootstrapping final stage
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The program called
.Nm
is the final stage of
.Fx Ns 's
kernel bootstrapping process.
It is responsible for bringing the kernel, kernel modules and other files into
memory.
It creates a set of
.Xr sh 1
like environment variables that are passed to the kernel.
It executes boot scripts written in one of several interpreters.
Together with the scripts, it controls the booting process and
interaction with the user.
.Pp
It provides a scripting language that can be used to
automate tasks, do pre-configuration or assist in recovery
procedures.
This scripting language is roughly divided in
two main components.
The smaller one is a set of commands
designed for direct use by the casual user, called "builtin
commands" for historical reasons.
The main drive behind these commands is user-friendliness.
The larger component is the scripting language built into
the boot loader.
.Fx
provides three different interpreters: Forth, Lua and Simple.
The Forth loader is based on an ANS Forth compatible
Forth interpreter based on FICL, by
.An John Sadler .
The Lua loader is a full Lua interpreter from
.Pa https://www.lua.org/ .
The Simple loader only interprets a list of builtin commands
without any control structure.
.Pp
During initialization,
.Nm
will probe for a console and set the
.Va console
variable, or set it to serial console
.Pq Dq Li comconsole
if the previous boot stage used that.
If multiple consoles are selected, they will be listed separated by spaces.
Then, devices are probed,
.Va currdev
and
.Va loaddev
are set, and
.Va LINES
is set to 24.
Finally, an interpreter specific file will be executed.
.Sh BUILTIN COMMANDS
The commands common to all interpreters are described in the
.Xr loader_simp 8
.Dq BUILTIN COMMANDS
section.
.Ss BUILTIN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The environment variables common to all interpreters are described in the
.Xr loader_simp 8
.Dq BUILTIN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 3.1 .
The
.Nm
scripting language changed to Lua by default in
.Fx 12.0 .
