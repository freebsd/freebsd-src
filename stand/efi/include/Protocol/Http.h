  The Response() function queues an HTTP response to this HTTP instance, similar to
  Receive() function in the EFI TCP driver. When the HTTP Response is received successfully,

  The HTTP driver will queue a receive token to the underlying TCP instance. When data
  is received in the underlying TCP instance, the data will be parsed and Token will
  be populated with the response data. If the data received from the remote host
  contains an incomplete or invalid HTTP header, the HTTP driver will continue waiting
  (asynchronously) for more data to be sent from the remote host before signaling
  Event in Token.

  It is the responsibility of the caller to allocate a buffer for Body and specify the
  size in BodyLength. If the remote host provides a response that contains a content
  body, up to BodyLength bytes will be copied from the receive buffer into Body and
  BodyLength will be updated with the amount of bytes received and copied to Body. This
  allows the client to download a large file in chunks instead of into one contiguous
  block of memory. Similar to HTTP request, if Body is not NULL and BodyLength is
  non-zero and all other fields are NULL or 0, the HTTP driver will queue a receive
  token to underlying TCP instance. If data arrives in the receive buffer, up to
  BodyLength bytes of data will be copied to Body. The HTTP driver will then update
  BodyLength with the amount of bytes received and copied to Body.

  If the HTTP driver does not have an open underlying TCP connection with the host
  specified in the response URL, Request() will return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED. This is
  consistent with RFC 2616 recommendation that HTTP clients should attempt to maintain
  an open TCP connection between client and host.
