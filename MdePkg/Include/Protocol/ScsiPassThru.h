  SCSI Pass Through protocol as defined in EFI 1.1.
  This protocol allows information about a SCSI channel to be collected, 
  and allows SCSI Request Packets to be sent to any SCSI devices on a SCSI
  channel even if those devices are not boot devices. This protocol is attached 
  to the device handle of each SCSI channel in a system that the protocol 
  supports, and can be used for diagnostics. It may also be used to build 
  a Block I/O driver for SCSI hard drives and SCSI CD-ROM or DVD drives to
  allow those devices to become boot devices.

/**
  Sends a SCSI Request Packet to a SCSI device that is attached to 
  the SCSI channel. This function supports both blocking I/O and 
  non-blocking I/O.  The blocking I/O functionality is required, 
  and the non-blocking I/O functionality is optional.

  @param  This   Protocol instance pointer.
  @param  Target The Target ID of the SCSI device to
                 send the SCSI Request Packet.
  @param  Lun    The LUN of the SCSI device to send the
                 SCSI Request Packet.
  @param  Packet A pointer to the SCSI Request Packet to send
                 to the SCSI device specified by Target and Lun.
  @param  Event  If non-blocking I/O is not supported then Event
                 is ignored, and blocking I/O is performed.
                 If Event is NULL, then blocking I/O is performed.
                 If Event is not NULL and non blocking I/O is
                 supported, then non-blocking I/O is performed,
                 and Event will be signaled when the SCSI Request
                 Packet completes

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS               The SCSI Request Packet was sent by the host, and
                                    TransferLength bytes were transferred to/from
                                    DataBuffer. See HostAdapterStatus, TargetStatus,
                                    SenseDataLength, and SenseData in that order
                                    for additional status information.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE       The SCSI Request Packet was executed, but the
                                    entire DataBuffer could not be transferred.
                                    The actual number of bytes transferred is returned
                                    in TransferLength. See HostAdapterStatus,
                                    TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in
                                    that order for additional status information.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY             The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because
                                    there are too many SCSI Request Packets already
                                    queued.  The caller may retry again later.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR          A device error occurred while attempting to send
                                    the SCSI Request Packet. See HostAdapterStatus,

                                    that order for additional status information.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER     Target, Lun, or the contents of ScsiRequestPacket
                                    are invalid. The SCSI Request Packet was not sent,
                                    so no additional status information is available.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED           The command described by the SCSI Request Packet
                                    is not supported by the host adapter. The SCSI
                                    Request Packet was not sent, so no additional
                                    status information is available.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT               A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI
                                    Request Packet to execute. See HostAdapterStatus,
