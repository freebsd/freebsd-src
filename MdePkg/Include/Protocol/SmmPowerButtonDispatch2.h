/**
  Provides the parent dispatch service for a power button event.

  This service registers a function (DispatchFunction) which will be called when an SMI is 
  generated because the power button was pressed or released, as specified by RegisterContext. 
  On return, DispatchHandle contains a unique handle which may be used later to unregister the 
  function using UnRegister().
  The DispatchFunction will be called with Context set to the same value as was passed into 
  this function in RegisterContext and with CommBuffer and CommBufferSize set to NULL.

  @param[in]  This               Pointer to the EFI_SMM_POWER_BUTTON_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  DispatchFunction   Function to register for handler when power button is pressed or released.
  @param[in]  RegisterContext    Pointer to the dispatch function's context. The caller fills in this context
                                 before calling the Register() function to indicate to the Register() function
                                 the power button SMI phase for which the dispatch function should be invoked.
  @param[out] DispatchHandle     Handle generated by the dispatcher to track the function instance. 

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The dispatch function has been successfully
                                 registered and the SMI source has been enabled.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       The driver was unable to enable the SMI source.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  RegisterContext is invalid. The power button input value
                                 is not within valid range.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   There is not enough memory (system or SMM) to manage this child.
