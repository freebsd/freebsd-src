/**
  Sends a SCSI Request Packet to a SCSI device that is attached to the SCSI channel. This function
  supports both blocking I/O and nonblocking I/O. The blocking I/O functionality is required, and the
  nonblocking I/O functionality is optional.

  @param  This    A pointer to the EFI_EXT_SCSI_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  Target  The Target is an array of size TARGET_MAX_BYTES and it represents
                  the id of the SCSI device to send the SCSI Request Packet. Each
                  transport driver may choose to utilize a subset of this size to suit the needs
                  of transport target representation. For example, a Fibre Channel driver
                  may use only 8 bytes (WWN) to represent an FC target.
  @param  Lun     The LUN of the SCSI device to send the SCSI Request Packet.
  @param  Packet  A pointer to the SCSI Request Packet to send to the SCSI device
                  specified by Target and Lun.
  @param  Event   If nonblocking I/O is not supported then Event is ignored, and blocking
                  I/O is performed. If Event is NULL, then blocking I/O is performed. If
                  Event is not NULL and non blocking I/O is supported, then
                  nonblocking I/O is performed, and Event will be signaled when the
                  SCSI Request Packet completes.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The SCSI Request Packet was sent by the host. For bi-directional
                                commands, InTransferLength bytes were transferred from
                                InDataBuffer. For write and bi-directional commands,
                                OutTransferLength bytes were transferred by
                                OutDataBuffer.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The SCSI Request Packet was not executed. The number of bytes that
                                could be transferred is returned in InTransferLength. For write
                                and bi-directional commands, OutTransferLength bytes were
                                transferred by OutDataBuffer.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY         The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because there are too many
                                SCSI Request Packets already queued. The caller may retry again later.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      A device error occurred while attempting to send the SCSI Request
                                Packet.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Target, Lun, or the contents of ScsiRequestPacket are invalid.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The command described by the SCSI Request Packet is not supported
                                by the host adapter. This includes the case of Bi-directional SCSI
                                commands not supported by the implementation. The SCSI Request
                                Packet was not sent, so no additional status information is available.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI Request Packet to execute.
