///   1. The child may accept a 4 second periodic rate, in which case it registers with
///        Period = 40000
///        SmiTickInterval = 20000
///      The resulting SMI will occur every 2 seconds with the child called back on
///      every 2nd SMI.
///      NOTE: the same result would occur if the child set SmiTickInterval = 0.
///   2. The child may choose the finer granularity SMI (64ms):
///        Period = 30000
///        SmiTickInterval = 640
///      The resulting SMI will occur every 64ms with the child called back on
///      every 47th SMI.
///      NOTE: the child driver should be aware that this will result in more
///        SMIs occuring during system runtime which can negatively impact system

/**
  Register a child SMI source dispatch function for SMM periodic timer.

  This service registers a function (DispatchFunction) which will be called when at least the 
  amount of time specified by RegisterContext has elapsed. On return, DispatchHandle 
  contains a unique handle which may be used later to unregister the function using UnRegister().
  The DispatchFunction will be called with Context set to the same value as was passed into 
  this function in RegisterContext and with CommBuffer pointing to an instance of 
  EFI_SMM_PERIODIC_TIMER_CONTEXT and CommBufferSize pointing to its size.

  @param[in]  This               Pointer to the EFI_SMM_PERIODIC_TIMER_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  DispatchFunction   Function to register for handler when at least the specified amount
                                 of time has elapsed. 
  @param[in]  RegisterContext    Pointer to the dispatch function's context.
                                 The caller fills this context in before calling
                                 the register function to indicate to the register
                                 function the period at which the dispatch function
                                 should be invoked.
  @param[out] DispatchHandle     Handle generated by the dispatcher to track the function instance. 

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The dispatch function has been successfully
                                 registered and the SMI source has been enabled.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       The driver was unable to enable the SMI source.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  RegisterContext is invalid. The period input value
                                 is not within valid range.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   There is not enough memory (system or SMM) to manage this child.
