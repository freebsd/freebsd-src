  Provides the functions to submit Scsi commands defined in SCSI-2 specification for SCSI devices.

  This library class provides the functions to submit SCSI commands defined in SCSI-2 specification
  for hard drive, CD and DVD devices that are the most common SCSI boot targets used by UEFI platforms.
  This library class depends on SCSI I/O Protocol defined in UEFI Specification and SCSI-2 industry standard.

/**
  Execute Test Unit Ready SCSI command on a specific SCSI target.

  Executes the Test Unit Ready command on the SCSI target specified by ScsiIo.
  If Timeout is zero, then this function waits indefinitely for the command to complete.
  If Timeout is greater than zero, then the command is executed and will timeout after Timeout 100 ns units.
  If ScsiIo is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If SenseDataLength is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If HostAdapterStatus is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If TargetStatus is NULL, then ASSERT().

  If SenseDataLength is non-zero and SenseData is not NULL, SenseData must meet buffer
  alignment requirement defined in EFI_SCSI_IO_PROTOCOL. Otherwise EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER
  gets returned.

  @param[in]     ScsiIo             A pointer to the SCSI I/O Protocol instance
                                    for the specific SCSI target.
  @param[in]     Timeout            The timeout in 100 ns units to use for the execution
                                    of this SCSI Request Packet. A Timeout value of
                                    zero means that this function will wait indefinitely
                                    for the SCSI Request Packet to execute. If Timeout
                                    is greater than zero, then this function will return
                                    EFI_TIMEOUT if the time required to execute the SCSI
                                    Request Packet is greater than Timeout.
  @param[in, out] SenseData         A pointer to sense data that was generated by
                                    the execution of the SCSI Request Packet. This
                                    buffer must be allocated by the caller.
                                    If SenseDataLength is 0, then this parameter is
                                    optional and may be NULL.
  @param[in, out] SenseDataLength   On input, a pointer to the length in bytes of
                                    the SenseData buffer. On output, a pointer to
                                    the number of bytes written to the SenseData buffer.
  @param[out]     HostAdapterStatus The status of the SCSI Host Controller that produces
                                    the SCSI bus containing the SCSI target specified by
                                    ScsiIo when the SCSI Request Packet was executed.
                                    See the EFI SCSI I/O Protocol in the UEFI Specification
                                    for details on the possible return values.
  @param[out]     TargetStatus      The status returned by the SCSI target specified
                                    by ScsiIo when the SCSI Request Packet was executed
                                    on the SCSI Host Controller. See the EFI SCSI I/O
                                    Protocol in the UEFI Specification for details on
                                    the possible return values.

                                    information.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY             The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because
                                    there are too many SCSI Command Packets already
                                    queued. The SCSI Request Packet was not sent, so
                                    no additional status information is available.
                                    The caller may retry again later.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR          A device error occurred while attempting to send
                                    SCSI Request Packet.  See HostAdapterStatus,
                                    TargetStatus, SenseDataLength, and SenseData in that
                                    order for additional status information.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED           The command described by the SCSI Request Packet
                                    is not supported by the SCSI initiator(i.e., SCSI
                                    Host Controller). The SCSI Request Packet was not
                                    sent, so no additional status information is available.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT               A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI Request
                                    Packet to execute.  See HostAdapterStatus, TargetStatus,
                                    SenseDataLength, and SenseData in that order for
                                    additional status information.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER     The contents of the SCSI Request Packet are invalid.

                                     by the execution of the SCSI Request Packet.
                                     This buffer must be allocated by the caller.

                                     is optional and may be NULL.
  @param[in, out]  SenseDataLength   On input, the length in bytes of the SenseData buffer.
                                     On output, the number of bytes written to the SenseData buffer.

                                     specified by ScsiIo when the SCSI Request Packet

                                     on the SCSI Host Controller.  See the EFI SCSI

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS                 Command is executed successfully.
  @retval  EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE         The SCSI Request Packet was executed,
                                       but the entire DataBuffer could not be
                                       transferred. The actual number of bytes
                                       transferred is returned in DataLength.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_READY               The SCSI Request Packet could not be
                                       sent because there are too many SCSI
                                       Command Packets already queued.
  @retval  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR            A device error occurred while attempting
                                       to send SCSI Request Packet.
  @retval  EFI_UNSUPPORTED             The command described by the SCSI
                                       Request Packet is not supported by the
                                       SCSI initiator(i.e., SCSI  Host
                                       Controller)
  @retval  EFI_TIMEOUT                 A timeout occurred while waiting for the
                                       SCSI Request Packet to execute.
  @retval  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       The contents of the SCSI Request Packet
                                       are invalid.
  @retval  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES        The request could not be completed due
                                       to a lack of resources.
