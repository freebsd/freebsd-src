  The entry point of PE/COFF Image for the DXE Core. 

  This function is the entry point for the DXE Core. This function is required to call
  ProcessModuleEntryPointList() and ProcessModuleEntryPointList() is never expected to return.
  The DXE Core is responsible for calling ProcessLibraryConstructorList() as soon as the EFI
  System Table and the image handle for the DXE Core itself have been established.
  If ProcessModuleEntryPointList() returns, then ASSERT() and halt the system.

  @param  HobStart  Pointer to the beginning of the HOB List passed in from the PEI Phase.

  directly and library instances that a module depends on indirectly through other
  libraries. This function is autogenerated by build tools and those build tools are
  responsible for collecting the set of library instances, determine which ones have
  constructors, and calling the library constructors in the proper order based upon
  each of the library instances own dependencies.
