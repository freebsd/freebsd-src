  This interface conveys state information out of the Security (SEC) phase into PEI.

  This service is published by the SEC phase. The SEC phase handoff has an optional
  EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR list as its final argument when control is passed from SEC into the
  PEI Foundation. As such, if the platform supports the built-in self test (BIST) on IA-32 Intel
  architecture or the PAL-A handoff state for Itanium architecture, this information is encapsulated
  into the data structure abstracted by this service. This information is collected for the boot-strap
  processor (BSP) on IA-32. For Itanium architecture, it is available on all processors that execute
  the PEI Foundation.

  @param  PeiServices               The pointer to the PEI Services Table.
  @param  StructureSize             The pointer to the variable describing size of the input buffer.
  @param  PlatformInformationRecord The pointer to the EFI_SEC_PLATFORM_INFORMATION_RECORD.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS               The data was successfully returned.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL      The buffer was too small. The current buffer size needed to
                                    hold the record is returned in StructureSize.
