  Returns the pointer to the HOB list.

  This function returns the pointer to first HOB in the list.
  For PEI phase, the PEI service GetHobList() can be used to retrieve the pointer
  to the HOB list.  For the DXE phase, the HOB list pointer can be retrieved through
  the EFI System Table by looking up theHOB list GUID in the System Configuration Table.
  Since the System Configuration Table does not exist that the time the DXE Core is
  launched, the DXE Core uses a global variable from the DXE Core Entry Point Library
  to manage the pointer to the HOB list.

  If the pointer to the HOB list is NULL, then ASSERT().
