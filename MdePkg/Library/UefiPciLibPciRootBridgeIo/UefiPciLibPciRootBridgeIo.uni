// This library produces the APIs from the PCI Library and implements these APIs

// typically produced by a chipset specific DXE driver.
// This library binds to the first PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol in the platform. As a result,
// it should only be used on platforms that contain a single PCI root bridge.
