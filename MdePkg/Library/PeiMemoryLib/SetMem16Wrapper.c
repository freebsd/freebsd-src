  Fills a target buffer with a 16-bit value, and returns the target buffer.

  This function fills Length bytes of Buffer with the 16-bit value specified by
  Value, and returns Buffer. Value is repeated every 16-bits in for Length
  bytes of Buffer.

  If Length > 0 and Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - Buffer + 1), then ASSERT().
  If Buffer is not aligned on a 16-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is not aligned on a 16-bit boundary, then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer  The pointer to the target buffer to fill.
  @param  Length  The number of bytes in Buffer to fill.
  @param  Value   The value with which to fill Length bytes of Buffer.

  @return Buffer.
