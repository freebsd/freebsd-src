/**
  Copies the data in a caller supplied buffer to a specified range of PCI
  configuration space.

  Writes the range of PCI configuration registers specified by StartAddress and
  Size from the buffer specified by Buffer. This function only allows the PCI
  configuration registers from a single PCI function to be written. Size is
  returned. When possible 32-bit PCI configuration write cycles are used to
  write from StartAddress to StartAddress + Size. Due to alignment restrictions,
  8-bit and 16-bit PCI configuration write cycles may be used at the beginning
  and the end of the range.

  If any reserved bits in StartAddress are set, then ASSERT().
  If ((StartAddress & 0xFFF) + Size) > 0x1000, then ASSERT().
  If Size > 0 and Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  StartAddress  Starting address that encodes the PCI Segment, Bus, Device,
                        Function and Register.
  @param  Size          Size in bytes of the transfer.
  @param  Buffer        Pointer to a buffer containing the data to write.

  @return The parameter of Size.
