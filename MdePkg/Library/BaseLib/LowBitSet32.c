/**
  Returns the bit position of the lowest bit set in a 32-bit value.

  This function computes the bit position of the lowest bit set in the 32-bit
  value specified by Operand. If Operand is zero, then -1 is returned.
  Otherwise, a value between 0 and 31 is returned.

  @param  Operand The 32-bit operand to evaluate.

  @retval 0..31  The lowest bit set in Operand was found.
  @retval -1     Operand is zero.
