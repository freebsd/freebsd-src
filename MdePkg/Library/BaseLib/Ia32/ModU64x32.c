/**
  Divides a 64-bit unsigned integer by a 32-bit unsigned integer and
  generates a 32-bit unsigned remainder.

  This function divides the 64-bit unsigned value Dividend by the 32-bit
  unsigned value Divisor and generates a 32-bit remainder. This function
  returns the 32-bit unsigned remainder.

  @param  Dividend  A 64-bit unsigned value.
  @param  Divisor   A 32-bit unsigned value.

  @return Dividend % Divisor
