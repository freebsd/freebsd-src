 * Encrypt (or decrypt) len bytes of a buffer buf.
 * The length must be a multiple of eight.
 * The key should have odd parity in the low bit of each byte.
 * ivec is the input vector, and is updated to the new one (cbc only).
 * The mode is created by oring together the appropriate parameters.
 * DESERR_NOHWDEVICE is returned if DES_HW was specified but
 * there was no hardware to do it on (the data will still be
 * encrypted though, in software).
