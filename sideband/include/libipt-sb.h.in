/* An Intel(R) Processor Trace (Intel PT) sideband tracing session.
 *
 * The session serves one Intel PT decoder.
 *
 * It is not thread-safe.  It doesn't need to be.  If a trace stream is decoded
 * by multiple decoders in parallel, each decoder needs its own sideband tracing
 * session since each decoder will be looking at the trace at a different point
 * in time and may see a different memory image.
 *
 * A sideband tracing session contains all sideband decoders that are relevant
 * for that trace stream.  We distinguish primary and secondary sideband
 * channels:
 *
 * - primary sideband channels affect decode directly.
 *
 *     They actively change the Intel PT decoder's memory image on context
 *     switch sideband records.
 *
 *     For per-cpu trace decode, for example, the sideband channel of the cpu
 *     for which trace is being decoded is a primary sideband channel.
 *
 * - secondary sideband channels affect decode indirectly.
 *
 *     They maintain the memory image for different process contexts but do not
 *     actively switch the Intel PT decoder's memory image.  They typically
 *     ignore context switch sideband records.
 *
 *     They may still directly affect the Intel PT decoder's memory image by
 *     adding new sections while trace in that context is being decoded.
 *
 *     For per-cpu trace decode, for example, the sideband channels of other
 *     cpus are secondary sideband channels.
