			[RT #22590]

3011.	[func]		Allow setting this in named.conf using the new
			'resolver-query-timeout' option, which specifies a max
			time in seconds.  0 means 'default' and anything longer
			than 30 will be silently set to 30. [RT #22852]

3010.	[bug]		Fixed a bug where "rndc reconfig" stopped the timer
			for refreshing managed-keys. [RT #22296]

3009.	[bug]		clients-per-query code didn't work as expected with
			particular query patterns. [RT #22972]

3007.	[bug]		Named failed to preserve the case of domain names in
			rdata which is not compressible when writing master
			files.  [RT #22863]

3006.	[func]		Allow dynamically generated TSIG keys to be preserved
			across restarts of named.  Initially this is for
			TSIG keys generated using GSSAPI. [RT #22639]

3005.	[port]		Solaris: Work around the lack of
			gsskrb5_register_acceptor_identity() by setting
			the KRB5_KTNAME environment variable to the
			contents of tkey-gssapi-keytab.  Also fixed
			test errors on MacOSX.  [RT #22853]

3004.	[func]		DNS64 reverse support. [RT #22769]

3003.	[experimental]	Added update-policy match type "external",
			enabling named to defer the decision of whether to

			(Contributed by Andrew Tridgell.) [RT #22758]

3002.	[bug]		isc_mutex_init_errcheck() failed to destroy attr.
			[RT #22766]

3001.	[func]		Added a default trust anchor for the root zone, which
			can be switched on by setting "dnssec-validation auto;"
			in the named.conf options. [RT #21727]

			[RT #22589]

2995.	[bug]		The Kerberos realm was not being correctly extracted
			from the signer's identity. [RT #22770]

2994.	[port]		NetBSD: use pthreads by default on NetBSD >= 5.0, and

			for looking at a secure delegation. [RT #22059]

2991.	[contrib]	contrib/zone-edit.sh: A simple zone editing tool for
			dynamic zones. [RT #22365]

2990.	[bug]		'dnssec-settime -S' no longer tests prepublication
			interval validity when the interval is set to 0.
			[RT #22761]

2989.	[func]		Added support for writable DLZ zones. (Contributed
			by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba project.) [RT #22629]

2988.	[experimental]	Added a "dlopen" DLZ driver, allowing the creation
			of external DLZ drivers that can be loaded as
			shared objects at runtime rather than linked with
			named.  Currently this is switched on via a
			compile-time option, "configure --with-dlz-dlopen".
			Note: the syntax for configuring DLZ zones
			is likely to be refined in future releases.
			(Contributed by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba
			project.) [RT #22629]

2987.	[func]		Improve ease of configuring TKEY/GSS updates by
			adding a "tkey-gssapi-keytab" option.  If set,
			updates will be allowed with any key matching
			a principal in the specified keytab file.
			"tkey-gssapi-credential" is no longer required
			and is expected to be deprecated.  (Contributed
			by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba project.)
			[RT #22629]

2986.	[func]		Add new zone type "static-stub".  It's like a stub
			zone, but the nameserver names and/or their IP
			addresses are statically configured. [RT #21474]

2985.	[bug]		Add a regression test for change #2896. [RT #21324]

2984.	[bug]		Don't run MX checks when the target of the MX record

2983.	[bug]		Include "loadkeys" in rndc help output. [RT #22493]

	--- 9.8.0a1 released ---

2982.	[bug]		Reference count dst keys.  dst_key_attach() can be used
			increment the reference count.

			Note: dns_tsigkey_createfromkey() callers should now
			always call dst_key_free() rather than setting it
			to NULL on success. [RT #22672]

2981.	[func]		Partial DNS64 support (AAAA synthesis). [RT #21991]

2980.	[bug]		named didn't properly handle UPDATES that changed the
			TTL of the NSEC3PARAM RRset. [RT #22363]

2979.	[bug]		named could deadlock during shutdown if two
			"rndc stop" commands were issued at the same
			time. [RT #22108]

2978.	[port]		hpux: look for <devpoll.h> [RT #21919]

2977.	[bug]		'nsupdate -l' report if the session key is missing.
			[RT #21670]

2976.	[bug]		named could die on exit after negotiating a GSS-TSIG
			key. [RT #22573]

2975.	[bug]		rbtdb.c:cleanup_dead_nodes_callback() acquired the
			wrong lock which could lead to server deadlock.
			[RT #22614]

2974.	[bug]		Some valid UPDATE requests could fail due to a
			consistency check examining the existing version
			of the zone rather than the new version resulting
			from the UPDATE. [RT #22413]

2973.	[bug]		bind.keys.h was being removed by the "make clean"
			at the end of configure resulting in build failures
			where there is very old version of perl installed.
			Move it to "make maintainer-clean". [RT #22230]

2972.	[bug]		win32: address windows socket errors. [RT #21906]

2971.	[bug]		Fixed a bug that caused journal files not to be
			compacted on Windows systems as a result of
			non-POSIX-compliant rename() semantics. [RT #22434]

2970.	[security]	Adding a NO DATA negative cache entry failed to clear
			any matching RRSIG records.  A subsequent lookup of
			of NO DATA cache entry could trigger a INSIST when the
			unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA
			cache entry.

			CVE-2010-3613, VU#706148. [RT #22288]

2969.	[security]	Fix acl type processing so that allow-query works
			in options and view statements.  Also add a new
			set of tests to verify proper functioning.

			CVE-2010-3615, VU#510208. [RT #22418]

2968.	[security]	Named could fail to prove a data set was insecure
			before marking it as insecure.  One set of conditions
			that can trigger this occurs naturally when rolling
			DNSKEY algorithms.

			CVE-2010-3614, VU#837744. [RT #22309]

2967.	[bug]		'host -D' now turns on debugging messages earlier.
			[RT #22361]

2966.	[bug]		isc_print_vsnprintf() failed to check if there was
			space available in the buffer when adding a left
			justified character with a non zero width,
			(e.g. "%-1c"). [RT #22270]

2965.	[func]		Test HMAC functions using test data from RFC 2104 and
			RFC 4634. [RT #21702]

2964.	[placeholder]

2963.	[security]	The allow-query acl was being applied instead of the
			allow-query-cache acl to cache lookups. [RT #22114]

2962.	[port]		win32: add more dependencies to BINDBuild.dsw.
			[RT #22062]

2961.	[bug]		Be still more selective about the non-authoritative
			answers we apply change 2748 to. [RT #22074]

			[RT #21594]

2959.	[func]		Check that named starts with a missing masterfile.
			[RT #22076]

2958.	[bug]		named failed to start with a missing master file.

2957.	[bug]		entropy_get() and entropy_getpseudo() failed to match
			the API for RAND_bytes() and RAND_pseudo_bytes()
			respectively. [RT #21962]

2956.	[port]		Enable atomic operations on the PowerPC64. [RT #21899]

2955.	[func]		Provide more detail in the recursing log. [RT #22043]

2953.	[bug]		Silence spurious "expected covering NSEC3, got an
			exact match" message when returning a wildcard
			no data response. [RT #21744]

2952.	[port]		win32: named-checkzone and named-checkconf failed
			to initialize winsock. [RT #21932]

2951.	[bug]		named failed to generate a correct signed response
			in a optout, delegation only zone with no secure
			delegations. [RT #22007]

2950.	[bug]		named failed to perform a SOA up to date check when
			falling back to TCP on UDP timeouts when
			ixfr-from-differences was set. [RT #21595]

2949.	[bug]		dns_view_setnewzones() contained a memory leak if
			it was called multiple times. [RT #21942]

2948.	[port]		MacOS: provide a mechanism to configure the test
			interfaces at reboot. See bin/tests/system/README
			for details.

2947.	[placeholder]

2946.	[doc]		Document the default values for the minimum and maximum
			zone refresh and retry values in the ARM. [RT #21886]

2945.	[doc]		Update empty-zones list in ARM. [RT #21772]

2944.	[maint]		Remove ORCHID prefix from built in empty zones.
			[RT #21772]

2943.	[func]		Add support to load new keys into managed zones
			without signing immediately with "rndc loadkeys".
			Add support to link keys with "dnssec-keygen -S"
			and "dnssec-settime -S".  [RT #21351]

2942.	[contrib]	zone2sqlite failed to setup the entropy sources.
			[RT #21610]

2941.	[bug]		sdb and sdlz (dlz's zone database) failed to support
			DNAME at the zone apex.  [RT #21610]

2940.	[port]		Remove connection aborted error message on
			Windows. [RT #21549]

2939.	[func]		Check that named successfully skips NSEC3 records
			that fail to match the NSEC3PARAM record currently
			in use. [RT# 21868]

2938.	[bug]		When generating signed responses, from a signed zone
			that uses NSEC3, named would use a uninitialized
			pointer if it needed to skip a NSEC3 record because
			it didn't match the selected NSEC3PARAM record for
			zone. [RT# 21868]

2937.	[bug]		Worked around an apparent race condition in over
			memory conditions.  Without this fix a DNS cache DB or
			ADB could incorrectly stay in an over memory state,
			effectively refusing further caching, which
			subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable.
			This fix prevents this problem from happening by
			polling the state of the memory context, rather than
			making a copy of the state, which appeared to cause
			a race.  This is a "workaround" in that it doesn't
			solve the possible race per se, but several experiments
			proved this change solves the symptom.  Also, the
			polling overhead hasn't been reported to be an issue.
			This bug should only affect a caching server that
			specifies a finite max-cache-size.  It's also quite
			likely that the bug happens only when enabling threads,
			but it's not confirmed yet. [RT #21818]

2936.	[func]		Improved configuration syntax and multiple-view
			support for addzone/delzone feature (see change
			#2930).  Removed "new-zone-file" option, replaced
			with "allow-new-zones (yes|no)".  The new-zone-file
			for each view is now created automatically, with
			a filename generated from a hash of the view name.
			It is no longer necessary to "include" the
			new-zone-file in named.conf; this happens
			automatically.  Zones that were not added via
			"rndc addzone" can no longer be removed with
			"rndc delzone". [RT #19447]

2935.	[bug]		nsupdate: improve 'file not found' error message.
			[RT #21871]

2934.	[bug]		Use ANSI C compliant shift range in lib/isc/entropy.c.
			[RT #21871]

2933.	[bug]		'dig +nsid' used stack memory after it went out of
			scope.  This could potentially result in a unknown,
			potentially malformed, EDNS option being sent instead
			of the desired NSID option. [RT #21781]

2932.	[cleanup]	Corrected a numbering error in the "dnssec" test.
			[RT #21597]

2931.	[bug]		Temporarily and partially disable change 2864
			because it would cause infinite attempts of RRSIG
			queries.  This is an urgent care fix; we'll
			revisit the issue and complete the fix later.
			[RT #21710]

2930.	[experimental]	New "rndc addzone" and "rndc delzone" commands
			allow dynamic addition and deletion of zones.
			To enable this feature, specify a "new-zone-file"
			option at the view or options level in named.conf.
			Zone configuration information for the new zones
			will be written into that file.  To make the new
			zones persist after a restart, "include" the file
			into named.conf in the appropriate view.  (Note:
			This feature is not yet documented, and its syntax
			is expected to change.) [RT #19447]

2929.	[bug]		Improved handling of GSS security contexts:
			 - added LRU expiration for generated TSIGs
			 - added the ability to use a non-default realm
			 - added new "realm" keyword in nsupdate
			 - limited lifetime of generated keys to 1 hour
			   or the lifetime of the context (whichever is
			   smaller)
			[RT #19737]

2928.	[bug]		Be more selective about the non-authoritative
			answer we apply change 2748 to. [RT #21594]

2927.	[placeholder]

			current managed keys combined with trusted keys.
			[RT #20904]

2923.	[bug]		'dig +trace' could drop core after "connection
			timeout". [RT #21514]

2922.	[contrib]	Update zkt to version 1.0.

2921.	[bug]		The resolver could attempt to destroy a fetch context
			too soon.  [RT #19878]

2920.	[func]		Allow 'filter-aaaa-on-v4' to be applied selectively
			to IPv4 clients.  New acl 'filter-aaaa' (default any).

2919.	[func]		Add autosign-ksk and autosign-zsk virtual time tests.
			[RT #20840]

2918.	[maint]		Add AAAA address for I.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.

2917.	[func]		Virtual time test framework. [RT #20801]

2916.	[func]		Add framework to use IPv6 in tests.
			fd92:7065:b8e:ffff::1 ... fd92:7065:b8e:ffff::7

2915.	[cleanup]	Be smarter about which objects we attempt to compile
			based on configure options. [RT #21444]

2914.	[bug]		Make the "autosign" system test more portable.
			[RT #20997]

2913.	[func]		Add pkcs#11 system tests. [RT #20784]

2912.	[func]		Windows clients don't like UPDATE responses that clear

			a DNSKEY. [RT #21384]

2907.	[bug]		The export version of libdns had undefined references.
			[RT #21444]

2906.	[bug]		Address RFC 5011 implementation issues. [RT #20903]

2905.	[port]		aix: set use_atomic=yes with native compiler.
			[RT #21402]

2904.	[bug]		When using DLV, sub-zones of the zones in the DLV,
			could be incorrectly marked as insecure instead of
			secure leading to negative proofs failing.  This was
			a unintended outcome from change 2890. [RT# 21392]

2903.	[bug]		managed-keys-directory missing from namedconf.c.

2847.	[cleanup]	Corrected usage message in dnssec-settime. [RT #20921]

2846.	[bug]		EOF on unix domain sockets was not being handled
			correctly. [RT #20731]

2845.	[bug]		RFC 5011 client could crash on shutdown. [RT #20903]

2844.	[doc]		notify-delay default in ARM was wrong.  It should have
			been five (5) seconds.

2843.	[func]		Prevent dnssec-keygen and dnssec-keyfromlabel from
			creating key files if there is a chance that the new
			key ID will collide with an existing one after
			either of the keys has been revoked.  (To override
			this in the case of dnssec-keyfromlabel, use the -y
			option.  dnssec-keygen will simply create a
			different, non-colliding key, so an override is
			not necessary.) [RT #20838]

2842.	[func]		Added "smartsign" and improved "autosign" and
			"dnssec" regression tests. [RT #20865]

2836.	[bug]		Keys that were scheduled to become active could
			be delayed. [RT #20874]

2835.	[bug]		Key inactivity dates were inadvertently stored in
			the private key file with the outdated tag
			"Unpublish" rather than "Inactive".  This has been
			fixed; however, any existing keys that had Inactive
			dates set will now need to have them reset, using
			'dnssec-settime -I'. [RT #20868]

2834.	[bug]		HMAC-SHA* keys that were longer than the algorithm
			digest length were used incorrectly, leading to
			interoperability problems with other DNS
			implementations.  This has been corrected.
			(Note: If an oversize key is in use, and
			compatibility is needed with an older release of
			BIND, the new tool "isc-hmac-fixup" can convert
			the key secret to a form that will work with all

2832.	[bug]		Modify "struct stat" in lib/export/samples/nsprobe.c
			to avoid redefinition in some OSs [RT 20831]

2831.	[security]	Do not attempt to validate or cache
			out-of-bailiwick data returned with a secure

2815.	[bug]		Exclusively lock the task when freezing a zone.
			[RT #19838]

2814.	[func]		Provide a definitive error message when a master
			zone is not loaded. [RT #20757]

2813.	[bug]		Better handling of unreadable DNSSEC key files.
			[RT #20710]

2812.	[bug]		Make sure updates can't result in a zone with
			NSEC-only keys and NSEC3 records. [RT #20748]

2811.	[cleanup]	Add "rndc sign" to list of commands in rndc usage
			output. [RT #20733]

2810.	[doc]		Clarified the process of transitioning an NSEC3 zone
			to insecure. [RT #20746]

2809.	[cleanup]	Restored accidentally-deleted text in usage output
			in dnssec-settime and dnssec-revoke [RT #20739]

2808.	[bug]		Remove the attempt to install atomic.h from lib/isc.
			atomic.h is correctly installed by the architecture
			specific subdirectories.  [RT #20722]

2807.	[bug]		Fixed a possible ASSERT when reconfiguring zone
			keys. [RT #20720]

	--- 9.7.0rc1 released ---

2806.	[bug]		"rdnc sign" could delay re-signing the DNSKEY
			when it had changed. [RT #20703]

2805.	[bug]		Fixed namespace problems encountered when building
			external programs using non-exported BIND9 libraries
			(i.e., built without --enable-exportlib). [RT #20679]

2804.	[bug]		Send notifies when a zone is signed with "rndc sign"
			or as a result of a scheduled key change. [RT #20700]

2803.	[port]		win32: Install named-journalprint, nsec3hash, arpaname
			and genrandom under windows. [RT #20670]

2802.	[cleanup]	Rename journalprint to named-journalprint. [RT #20670]

2801.	[func]		Detect and report records that are different according
			to DNSSEC but are semantically equal according to plain
			DNS.  Apply plain DNS comparisons rather than DNSSEC
			comparisons when processing UPDATE requests.
			dnssec-signzone now removes such semantically duplicate
			records prior to signing the RRset.

			named-checkzone -r {ignore|warn|fail} (default warn)
			named-compilezone -r {ignore|warn|fail} (default warn)

			named.conf: check-dup-records {ignore|warn|fail};

2800.	[func]		Reject zones which have NS records which refer to
			CNAMEs, DNAMEs or don't have address record (class IN
			only).  Reject UPDATEs which would cause the zone
			to fail the above checks if committed. [RT #20678]

2799.	[cleanup]	Changed the "secure-to-insecure" option to
			"dnssec-secure-to-insecure", and "dnskey-ksk-only"
			to "dnssec-dnskey-kskonly", for clarity. [RT #20586]

2779.	[bug]		Dynamic key revocation could fail. [RT #20644]

2778.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone could fail when a key was revoked

2770.	[cleanup]	Add log messages to resolver.c to indicate events

			use.) [RT #20339]

2731.	[func]		Additional work on change 2709.  The key parser
			will now ignore unrecognized fields when the
			minor version number of the private key format
			has been increased.  It will reject any key with
			the major version number increased. [RT #20310]

2730.	[func]		Have dnssec-keygen display a progress indication
			a la 'openssl genrsa' on standard error. Note
			when the first '.' is followed by a long stop
			one has the choice between slow generation vs.
			poor random quality, i.e., '-r /dev/urandom'.

			flags.

2713.	[bug]		powerpc: atomic operations missing asm("ics") /
			__isync() calls.

2712.	[func]		New 'auto-dnssec' zone option allows zone signing
			to be fully automated in zones configured for
			dynamic DNS.  'auto-dnssec allow;' permits a zone
			to be signed by creating keys for it in the
			key-directory and using 'rndc sign <zone>'.
			'auto-dnssec maintain;' allows that too, plus it
			also keeps the zone's DNSSEC keys up to date
			according to their timing metadata. [RT #19943]

2711.	[port]		win32: Add the bin/pkcs11 tools into the full
			build. [RT #20372]

2710.	[func]		New 'dnssec-signzone -x' flag and 'dnskey-ksk-only'
			zone option cause a zone to be signed with only KSKs
			signing the DNSKEY RRset, not ZSKs.  This reduces
			the size of a DNSKEY answer.  [RT #20340]

2709.	[func]		Added some data fields, currently unused, to the
			private key file format, to allow implementation
			of explicit key rollover in a future release
			without impairing backward or forward compatibility.
			[RT #20310]

2708.	[func]		Insecure to secure and NSEC3 parameter changes via
			update are now fully supported and no longer require
			defines to enable.  We now no longer overload the
			NSEC3PARAM flag field, nor the NSEC OPT bit at the
			apex.  Secure to insecure changes are controlled by
			by the named.conf option 'secure-to-insecure'.

			Warning: If you had previously enabled support by
			adding defines at compile time to BIND 9.6 you should
			ensure that all changes that are in progress have
			completed prior to upgrading to BIND 9.7.  BIND 9.7
			is not backwards compatible.

2707.	[func]		dnssec-keyfromlabel no longer require engine name
			to be specified in the label if there is a default
			engine or the -E option has been used.  Also, it
			now uses default algorithms as dnssec-keygen does
			(i.e., RSASHA1, or NSEC3RSASHA1 if -3 is used).
			[RT #20371]

2706.	[bug]		Loading a zone with a very large NSEC3 salt could
			trigger an assert. [RT #20368]

2687.	[bug]		Fixed dnssec-signzone -S handling of revoked keys.
			Also, added warnings when revoking a ZSK, as this is

2677.	[func]		Changes to key metadata behavior:
			- Keys without "publish" or "active" dates set will
			  no longer be used for smart signing.  However,
			  those dates will be set to "now" by default when
			  a key is created; to generate a key but not use
			  it yet, use dnssec-keygen -G.
			- New "inactive" date (dnssec-keygen/settime -I)
			  sets the time when a key is no longer used for
			  signing but is still published.
			- The "unpublished" date (-U) is deprecated in
			  favor of "deleted" (-D).

			  named process using the session key generated
			  by named
			[RT #19284]

2608.	[func]		Perform post signing verification checks in
			dnssec-signzone.  These can be disabled with -P.

			The post sign verification test ensures that for each

			"dnssec-lookaside auto;"  This is the equivalent
			of "dnssec-lookaside . trust-anchor dlv.isc.org;"
			plus setting a trusted-key for dlv.isc.org.

			Note: The trusted key is hard-coded into named,
			but is also stored in (and can be overridden
			by) $sysconfdir/bind.keys.  As the ISC DLV key
			rolls over it can be kept up to date by replacing
			the bind.keys file with a key downloaded from

2464.	[port]		linux: check that a capability is present before
			trying to set it. [RT #18135]

2463.	[port]		linux: POSIX doesn't include the IPv6 Advanced Socket
			API and glibc hides parts of the IPv6 Advanced Socket
			API as a result.  This is stupid as it breaks how the
			two halves (Basic and Advanced) of the IPv6 Socket API
			were designed to be used but we have to live with it.

			(clear DF) for UDP responses and requests.

2443.	[bug]		win32: UDP connect() would not generate an event,
			and so connected UDP sockets would never clean up.
			Fix this by doing an immediate WSAConnect() rather
			than an io completion port type for UDP.

2442.	[bug]		A lock could be destroyed twice. [RT# 18626]

2441.	[bug]		isc_radix_insert() could copy radix tree nodes

2431.	[bug]		Acl processing could leak memory. [RT #18323]

2430.	[bug]		win32: isc_interval_set() could round down to

			Use caution: this option may not work for some
			operating systems without rebuilding named.

2420.	[bug]		Windows socket handling cleanup.  Let the io
			completion event send out canceled read/write
			done events, which keeps us from writing to memory
			we no longer have ownership of.  Add debugging
			socket_log() function.  Rework TCP socket handling

 971.	[placeholder]

 970.	[func]		'max-journal-size' can now be used to set a target
			size for a journal.

 969.	[func]		dig now supports the undocumented dig 8 feature
			of allowing arbitrary labels, not just dotted
			decimal quads, with the -x option.  This can be
			used to conveniently look up RFC2317 names as in
			"dig -x 10.0.0.0-127". [RT #827, #1576, #1598]

 968.	[bug]		On win32, the isc_time_now() function was unnecessarily

 955.	[bug]		When using views, the zone's class was not being
			inherited from the view's class. [RT #1583]

 954.	[bug]		When requesting AXFRs or IXFRs using dig, host, or
			nslookup, the RD bit should not be set as zone
			transfers are inherently non-recursive. [RT #1575]

 953.	[func]		The /var/run/named.key file from change #843
			has been replaced by /etc/rndc.key.  Both
			named and rndc will look for this file and use
			it to configure a default control channel key
			if not already configured using a different
			method (rndc.conf / controls).  Unlike
			named.key, rndc.key is not created automatically;
			it must be created by manually running
			"rndc-confgen -a".

 952.	[bug]		The server required manual intervention to serve the
			affected zones if it died between creating a journal
			and committing the first change to it.

 951.	[bug]		CFLAGS was not passed to the linker when
			linking some of the test programs under
			bin/tests. [RT #1555].

 950.	[bug]		Explicit TTLs did not properly override $TTL

	--- 9.2.0b2 released ---

 948.	[port]		Integrated support for building on Windows NT /
			Windows 2000.

 947.	[bug]		dns_rdata_soa_t had a badly named element "mname" which
			was really the RNAME field from RFC1035.  To avoid
			confusion and silent errors that would occur it the
			"origin" and "mname" elements were given their correct
			names "mname" and "rname" respectively, the "mname"
			element is renamed to "contact".

 946.	[cleanup]	doc/misc/options is now machine-generated from the
			configuration parser syntax tables, and therefore
			more likely to be correct.

 945.	[func]		Add the new view-specific options
			"match-destinations" and "match-recursive-only".

 944.	[func]		Check for expired signatures on load.

 943.	[bug]		The server could crash when receiving a command

 933.	[bug]		configure failed doing libbind on platforms not
			supported by BIND 8. [RT #1496]

	--- 9.2.0a3 released ---

 932.	[bug]		Use INSTALL_SCRIPT, not INSTALL_PROGRAM,
			when installing isc-config.sh.
			[RT #198, #1466]

 931.	[bug]		The controls statement only attempted to verify
			messages using the first key in the key list.
			(9.2.0a1/a2 only).

 930.	[func]		Query performance testing tool added as
			contrib/queryperf.

 929.	[placeholder]

 928.	[bug]		nsupdate would send empty update packets if the
			send (or empty line) command was run after
			another send but before any new updates or
			prerequisites were specified.  It should simply
			ignore this command.

 927.	[bug]		Don't hold the zone lock for the entire dump to disk.
			[RT #1423]

 926.	[bug]		The resolver could deadlock with the ADB when
			shutting down (multi-threaded builds only).
			[RT #1324]

 925.	[cleanup]	Remove openssl from the distribution; require that
			--with-openssl be specified if DNSSEC is needed.

 924.	[port]		Extend support for pre-RFC2133 IPv6 implementation.
			[RT #987]

 923.	[bug]		Multiline TSIG secrets (and other multiline strings)
			were not accepted in named.conf. [RT #1469]

 922.	[func]		Added two new lwres_getrrsetbyname() result codes,
			ERR_NONAME and ERR_NODATA.

 921.	[bug]		lwres returned an incorrect error code if it received
			a truncated message.

 920.	[func]		Increase the lwres receive buffer size to 16K.
			[RT #1451]

 919.	[placeholder]

 918.	[func]		In nsupdate, TSIG errors are no longer treated as
			fatal errors.

 917.	[func]		New nsupdate command 'key', allowing TSIG keys to
			be specified in the nsupdate command stream rather
			than the command line.

 916.	[bug]		Specifying type ixfr to dig without specifying
			a serial number failed in unexpected ways.

 915.	[func]		The named-checkconf and named-checkzone programs
			now have a '-v' option for printing their version.
			[RT #1151]

 914.	[bug]		Global 'server' statements were rejected when
			using views, even though they were accepted
			in 9.1. [RT #1368]

 913.	[bug]		Cache cleaning was not sufficiently aggressive.
			[RT #1441, #1444]

 912.	[bug]		Attempts to set the 'additional-from-cache' or
			'additional-from-auth' option to 'no' in a
			server with recursion enabled will now

			[RT #1145]

 911.	[placeholder]

 907.	[func]		The ability to get entropy from either the
			random device, a user-provided file or from

			to libisc as isc_entropy_usebestsource().

 906.	[port]		Separated the system independent portion of
			lib/isc/unix/entropy.c into lib/isc/entropy.c
			and added lib/isc/win32/entropy.c.

 905.	[bug]		Configuring a forward "zone" for the root domain
			did not work. [RT #1418]

 904.	[bug]		The server would leak memory if attempting to use
			an expired TSIG key. [RT #1406]

 903.	[bug]		dig should not crash when receiving a TCP packet

 902.	[bug]		The -d option was ignored if both -t and -g were also
			specified.

 901.	[placeholder]

 900.	[bug]		A config.guess update changed the system identification

 896.	[bug]		If a configuration file is set on named's command line
			and it has a relative pathname, the current directory
			(after any possible jailing resulting from named -t)
			will be prepended to it so that reloading works
			properly even when a directory option is present.

 895.	[func]		New function, isc_dir_current(), akin to POSIX's
			getcwd().

 894.	[bug]		When using the DNSSEC tools, a message intended to warn
			when the keyboard was being used because of the lack
			of a suitable random device was not being printed.

 893.	[func]		Removed isc_file_test() and added isc_file_exists()
			for the basic functionality that was being added
			with isc_file_test().

 892.	[placeholder]

 891.	[bug]		Return an error when a SIG(0) signed response to
			an unsigned query is seen.  This should actually
			do the verification, but it's not currently
			possible. [RT #1391]

 890.	[cleanup]	The man pages no longer require the mandoc macros
			and should now format cleanly using most versions of
			nroff, and HTML versions of the man pages have been
			added.  Both are generated from DocBook source.

 889.	[port]		Eliminated blank lines before .TH in nroff man

 849.	[func]		<isc/net.h> will ensure INADDR_LOOPBACK is defined.

 848.	[func]		A minimum max-cache-size of two megabytes is enforced
			by the cache cleaner.

 847.	[func]		Added isc_file_test(), which currently only has
			some very basic functionality to test for the
			existence of a file, whether a pathname is absolute,
			or whether a pathname is the fundamental representation
			of the current directory.  It is intended that this
			function can be expanded to test other things a
			programmer might want to know about a file.

 846.	[func]		A non-zero 'param' to dst_key_generate() when making an
			hmac-md5 key means that good entropy is not required.

 845.	[bug]		The access rights on the public file of a symmetric
			key are now restricted as soon as the file is opened,
			rather than after it has been written and closed.

 844.	[func]		<isc/net.h> will ensure INADDR_LOOPBACK is defined,
			just as <lwres/net.h> does.

 843.	[func]		If no controls statement is present in named.conf,
			or if any inet phrase of a controls statement is
			lacking a keys clause, then a key will be automatically
			generated by named and an rndc.conf-style file
			named named.key will be written that uses it.  rndc
			will use this file only if its normal configuration
			file, or one provided on the command line, does not
			exist.

 842.	[func]		'rndc flush' now takes an optional view.

 841.	[bug]		When sdb modules were not declared threadsafe, their
			create and destroy functions were not serialized.

 840.	[bug]		The config file parser could print the wrong file
			name if an error was detected after an included file
			was parsed. [RT #1353]

 839.	[func]		Dump packets for which there was no view or that the
			class could not be determined to category "unmatched".

 838.	[port]		UnixWare 7.x.x is now suported by
			bin/tests/system/ifconfig.sh.

 837.	[cleanup]	Multi-threading is now enabled by default only on
			OSF1, Solaris 2.7 and newer, and AIX.

 836.	[func]		Upgraded libtool to 1.4.

 835.	[bug]		The dispatcher could enter a busy loop if
			it got an I/O error receiving on a UDP socket.
			[RT #1293]

 834.	[func]		Accept (but warn about) master files beginning with
			an SOA record without an explicit TTL field and
			lacking a $TTL directive, by using the SOA MINTTL
			as a default TTL.  This is for backwards compatibility
			with old versions of BIND 8, which accepted such
			files without warning although they are illegal
			according to RFC1035.

 833.	[cleanup]	Moved dns_soa_*() from <dns/journal.h> to
			<dns/soa.h>, and extended them to support
			all the integer-valued fields of the SOA RR.

 832.	[bug]		The default location for named.conf in named-checkconf
			should depend on --sysconfdir like it does in named.
			[RT #1258]

 831.	[placeholder]

 830.	[func]		Implement 'rndc status'.

 829.	[bug]		The DNS_R_ZONECUT result code should only be returned
			when an ANY query is made with DNS_DBFIND_GLUEOK set.
			In all other ANY query cases, returning the delegation
			is better.

 828.	[bug]		The errno value from recvfrom() could be overwritten
			by logging code. [RT #1293]

 827.	[bug]		When an IXFR protocol error occurs, the slave
			should retry with AXFR.

 826.	[bug]		Some IXFR protocol errors were not detected.

 825.	[bug]		zone.c:ns_query() detached from the wrong zone
			reference. [RT #1264]

 824.	[bug]		Correct line numbers reported by dns_master_load().
			[RT #1263]

 823.	[func]		The output of "dig -h" now goes to stdout so that it
			can easily be piped through "more". [RT #1254]

 822.	[bug]		Sending nxrrset prerequisites would crash nsupdate.
			[RT #1248]

 821.	[bug]		The program name used when logging to syslog should
			be stripped of leading path components.
			[RT #1178, #1232]

 820.	[bug]		Name server address lookups failed to follow
			A6 chains into the glue of local authoritative
			zones.

 819.	[bug]		In certain cases, the resolver's attempts to
			restart an address lookup at the root could cause
			the fetch to deadlock (with itself) instead of
			restarting. [RT #1225]

 818.	[bug]		Certain pathological responses to ANY queries could
			cause an assertion failure. [RT #1218]

 817.	[func]		Adjust timeouts for dialup zone queries.

 816.	[bug]		Report potential problems with log file accessibility
			at configuration time, since such problems can't
			reliably be reported at the time they actually occur.

 815.	[bug]		If a log file was specified with a path separator
			character (i.e. "/") in its name and the directory
			did not exist, the log file's name was treated as
			though it were the directory name. [RT #1189]

 814.	[bug]		Socket objects left over from accept() failures
			were incorrectly destroyed, causing corruption
			of socket manager data structures.

 813.	[bug]		File descriptors exceeding FD_SETSIZE were handled
			badly. [RT #1192]

 812.	[bug]		dig sometimes printed incomplete IXFR responses
			due to an uninitialized variable. [RT #1188]

 811.	[bug]		Parentheses were not quoted in zone dumps. [RT #1194]

 810.	[bug]		The signer name in SIG records was not properly
			down-cased when signing/verifying records. [RT #1186]

 809.	[bug]		Configuring a non-local address as a transfer-source
			could cause an assertion failure during load.

 808.	[func]		Add 'rndc flush' to flush the server's cache.

 807.	[bug]		When setting up TCP connections for incoming zone
			transfers, the transfer-source port was not
			ignored like it should be.

 806.	[bug]		DNS_R_SEENINCLUDE was failing to propagate back up
			the calling stack to the zone maintenance level,
			causing zones to not reload when an included file was
			touched but the top-level zone file was not.

 805.	[bug]		When using "forward only", missing root hints should
			not cause queries to fail. [RT #1143]

 804.	[bug]		Attempting to obtain entropy could fail in some
			situations.  This would be most common on systems
			with user-space threads. [RT #1131]

 803.	[bug]		Treat all SIG queries as if they have the CD bit set,
			otherwise no data will be returned [RT #749]

 802.	[bug]		DNSSEC key tags were computed incorrectly in almost
			all cases. [RT #1146]

 801.	[bug]		nsupdate should treat lines beginning with ';' as
			comments. [RT #1139]

 800.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone produced incorrect statistics for
			large zones. [RT #1133]

 799.	[bug]		The ADB didn't find AAAA glue in a zone unless A6
			glue was also present.

 798.	[bug]		nsupdate should be able to reject bad input lines
			and continue. [RT #1130]

 797.	[func]		Issue a warning if the 'directory' option contains
			a relative path. [RT #269]

 796.	[func]		When a size limit is associated with a log file,
			only roll it when the size is reached, not every
			time the log file is opened. [RT #1096]

 795.	[func]		Add the +multiline option to dig. [RT #1095]

 794.	[func]		Implement the "port" and "default-port" statements
			in rndc.conf.

 793.	[cleanup]	The DNSSEC tools could create filenames that were
			illegal or contained shell meta-characters.  They
			now use a different text encoding of names that
			doesn't have these problems. [RT #1101]

 792.	[cleanup]	Replace the OMAPI command channel protocol with a
			simpler one.

 791.	[bug]		The command channel now works over IPv6.

 790.	[bug]		Wildcards created using dynamic update or IXFR
			could fail to match. [RT #1111]

 789.	[bug]		The "localhost" and "localnets" ACLs did not match
			when used as the second element of a two-element
			sortlist item.

 788.	[func]		Add the "match-mapped-addresses" option, which
			causes IPv6 v4mapped addresses to be treated as
			IPv4 addresses for the purpose of acl matching.

 787.	[bug]		The DNSSEC tools failed to downcase domain
			names when mapping them into file names.

 786.	[bug]		When DNSSEC signing/verifying data, owner names were
			not properly down-cased.

 785.	[bug]		A race condition in the resolver could cause
			an assertion failure. [RT #673, #872, #1048]

 784.	[bug]		nsupdate and other programs would not quit properly
			if some signals were blocked by the caller. [RT #1081]

 783.	[bug]		Following CNAMEs could cause an assertion failure
			when either using an sdb database or under very
			rare conditions.

 782.	[func]		Implement the "serial-query-rate" option.

 781.	[func]		Avoid error packet loops by dropping duplicate FORMERR
			responses. [RT #1006]

 780.	[bug]		Error handling code dealing with out of memory or
			other rare errors could lead to assertion failures
			by calling functions on uninitialized names. [RT #1065]

 779.	[func]		Added the "minimal-responses" option.

 778.	[bug]		When starting cache cleaning, cleaning_timer_action()
			returned without first pausing the iterator, which
			could cause deadlock. [RT #998]

 777.	[bug]		An empty forwarders list in a zone failed to override
			global forwarders. [RT #995]

 776.	[func]		Improved error reporting in denied messages. [RT #252]

 775.	[placeholder]

 774.	[func]		max-cache-size is implemented.

 773.	[func]		Added isc_rwlock_trylock() to attempt to lock without
			blocking.

 772.	[bug]		Owner names could be incorrectly omitted from cache
			dumps in the presence of negative caching entries.
			[RT #991]

 771.	[cleanup]	TSIG errors related to unsynchronized clocks
			are logged better. [RT #919]

 770.	[func]		Add the "edns yes_or_no" statement to the server
			clause. [RT #524]

 769.	[func]		Improved error reporting when parsing rdata. [RT #740]

 768.	[bug]		The server did not emit an SOA when a CNAME
			or DNAME chain ended in NXDOMAIN in an
			authoritative zone.

 767.	[placeholder]

 766.	[bug]		A few cases in query_find() could leak fname.
			This would trigger the mpctx->allocated == 0
			assertion when the server exited.
			[RT #739, #776, #798, #812, #818, #821, #845,
			#892, #935, #966]

 765.	[func]		ACL names are once again case insensitive, like
			in BIND 8. [RT #252]

 764.	[func]		Configuration files now allow "include" directives
			in more places, such as inside the "view" statement.
			[RT #377, #728, #860]

 763.	[func]		Configuration files no longer have reserved words.
			[RT #731, #753]

 762.	[cleanup]	The named.conf and rndc.conf file parsers have
			been completely rewritten.

 761.	[bug]		_REENTRANT was still defined when building with
			--disable-threads.

 760.	[contrib]	Significant enhancements to the pgsql sdb driver.

 759.	[bug]		The resolver didn't turn off "avoid fetches" mode
			when restarting, possibly causing resolution
			to fail when it should not.  This bug only affected
			platforms which support both IPv4 and IPv6. [RT #927]

 758.	[bug]		The "avoid fetches" code did not treat negative
			cache entries correctly, causing fetches that would
			be useful to be avoided.  This bug only affected
			platforms which support both IPv4 and IPv6. [RT #927]

 757.	[func]		Log zone transfers.

 756.	[bug]		dns_zone_load() could "return" success when no master
			file was configured.

 755.	[bug]		Fix incorrectly formatted log messages in zone.c.

 754.	[bug]		Certain failure conditions sending UDP packets
			could cause the server to retry the transmission
			indefinitely. [RT #902]

 753.	[bug]		dig, host, and nslookup would fail to contact a
			remote server if getaddrinfo() returned an IPv6
			address on a system that doesn't support IPv6.
			[RT #917]

 752.	[func]		Correct bad tv_usec elements returned by
			gettimeofday().

 751.	[func]		Log successful zone loads / transfers.  [RT #898]

 750.	[bug]		A query should not match a DNAME whose trust level
			is pending. [RT #916]

 749.	[bug]		When a query matched a DNAME in a secure zone, the
			server did not return the signature of the DNAME.
			[RT #915]

 748.	[doc]		List supported RFCs in doc/misc/rfc-compliance.
			[RT #781]

 747.	[bug]		The code to determine whether an IXFR was possible

			not have a journal. [RT #865, #908]

 746.	[bug]		The sdb didn't clone rdatasets properly, causing
			a crash when the server followed delegations. [RT #905]

 745.	[func]		Report the owner name of records that fail
			semantic checks while loading.

 744.	[bug]		When returning DNS_R_CNAME or DNS_R_DNAME as the
			result of an ANY or SIG query, the resolver failed
			to setup the return event's rdatasets, causing an
			assertion failure in the query code. [RT #881]

 743.	[bug]		Receiving a large number of certain malformed
			answers could cause named to stop responding.
			[RT #861]

 742.	[placeholder]

 741.	[port]		Support openssl-engine. [RT #709]

 740.	[port]		Handle openssl library mismatches slightly better.

 739.	[port]		Look for /dev/random in configure, rather than
			assuming it will be there for only a predefined
			set of OSes.

 738.	[bug]		If a non-threadsafe sdb driver supported AXFR and
			received an AXFR request, it would deadlock or die
			with an assertion failure. [RT #852]

 737.	[port]		stdtime.c failed to compile on certain platforms.

 736.	[func]		New functions isc_task_{begin,end}exclusive().

 735.	[doc]		Add BIND 4 migration notes.

 734.	[bug]		An attempt to re-lock the zone lock could occur if
			the server was shutdown during a zone transfer.
			[RT #830]

 733.	[bug]		Reference counts of dns_acl_t objects need to be
			locked but were not. [RT #801, #821]

 732.	[bug]		Glue with 0 TTL could also cause SERVFAIL. [RT #828]

 731.	[bug]		Certain zone errors could cause named-checkzone to
			fail ungracefully. [RT #819]

 730.	[bug]		lwres_getaddrinfo() returns the correct result when
			it fails to contact a server. [RT #768]

 729.	[port]		pthread_setconcurrency() needs to be called on Solaris.

 728.	[bug]		Fix comment processing on master file directives.
			[RT# 757]

 727.	[port]		Work around OS bug where accept() succeeds but
			fails to fill in the peer address of the accepted
			connection, by treating it as an error rather than
			an assertion failure. [RT #809]

 726.	[func]		Implement the "trace" and "notrace" commands in rndc.

 725.	[bug]		Installing man pages could fail.

 724.	[func]		New libisc functions isc_netaddr_any(),
			isc_netaddr_any6().

 723.	[bug]		Referrals whose NS RRs had a 0 TTL caused the resolver
			to return DNS_R_SERVFAIL. [RT #783]

 722.	[func]		Allow incremental loads to be canceled.

 721.	[cleanup]	Load manager and dns_master_loadfilequota() are no
			more.

 720.	[bug]		Server could enter infinite loop in
			dispatch.c:do_cancel(). [RT #733]

 719.	[bug]		Rapid reloads could trigger an assertion failure.
			[RT #743, #763]

 718.	[cleanup]	"internal" is no longer a reserved word in named.conf.
			[RT #753, #731]

 717.	[bug]		Certain TKEY processing failure modes could
			reference an uninitialized variable, causing the

 716.	[bug]		The first line of a $INCLUDE master file was lost if
			an origin was specified. [RT #744]

 715.	[bug]		Resolving some A6 chains could cause an assertion

 714.	[bug]		Preserve interval timers across reloads unless changed.
			[RT# 729]

 713.	[func]		named-checkconf takes '-t directory' similar to named.

 710.	[func]		The forwarders statement now takes an optional
			port. [RT #418]

 709.	[bug]		ANY or SIG queries for data with a TTL of 0
			would return SERVFAIL. [RT #620]

 708.	[bug]		When building with --with-openssl, the openssl headers
			included with BIND 9 should not be used. [RT #702]

 707.	[func]		The "filename" argument to named-checkzone is no
			longer optional, to reduce confusion. [RT #612]

 706.	[bug]		Zones with an explicit "allow-update { none; };"
			were considered dynamic and therefore not reloaded
			on SIGHUP or "rndc reload".

 705.	[port]		Work out resource limit type for use where rlim_t is
			not available. [RT #695]

 704.	[port]		RLIMIT_NOFILE is not available on all platforms.

			use 127.0.0.1 instead. [RT #693]

 701.	[func]		Root hints are now fully optional.  Class IN
			views use compiled-in hints by default, as
			before.  Non-IN views with no root hints now
			provide authoritative service but not recursion.
			A warning is logged if a view has neither root
			hints nor authoritative data for the root. [RT #696]

 700.	[bug]		$GENERATE range check was wrong. [RT #688]

 692.	[bug]		Deal with systems that have getaddrinfo() but not
			gai_strerror(). [RT #679]

 691.	[bug]		Configuring per-view forwarders caused an assertion
			failure. [RT #675, #734]

 686.	[bug]		dig and nslookup can now be properly aborted during

 683.	[bug]		File descriptor leak in isc_lex_openfile().

 682.	[bug]		nslookup displayed SOA records incorrectly. [RT #665]

 681.	[bug]		$GENERATE specifying output format was broken. [RT #653]

 680.	[bug]		dns_rdata_fromstruct() mishandled options bigger

 678.	[bug]		"transfer-format one-answer;" could trigger an assertion
			failure. [RT #646]

 677.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone would occasionally use the wrong ttl

 676.	[bug]		Log messages about lame servers to category
			'lame-servers' rather than 'resolver', so as not
			to be gratuitously incompatible with BIND 8.

 675.	[bug]		TKEY queries could cause the server to leak
			memory.

 674.	[func]		Allow messages to be TSIG signed / verified using
			a offset from the current time.

 673.	[func]		The server can now convert RFC1886-style recursive
			lookup requests into RFC2874-style lookups, when
			enabled using the new option "allow-v6-synthesis".

 672.	[bug]		The wrong time was in the "time signed" field when
			replying with BADTIME error.

 671.	[bug]		The message code was failing to parse a message with
			no question section and a TSIG record. [RT #628]

 670.	[bug]		The lwres replacements for getaddrinfo and
			getipnodebyname didn't properly check for the
			existence of the sockaddr sa_len field.

 669.	[bug]		dnssec-keygen now makes the public key file
			non-world-readable for symmetric keys. [RT #403]

 668.	[func]		named-checkzone now reports multiple errors in master

			[RT #626]

 666.	[bug]		If a request sent by dig is longer than 512 bytes,

 665.	[bug]		Signed responses were not sent when the size of the
			TSIG + question exceeded the maximum message size.
			[RT #628]

 664.	[bug]		The t_tasks and t_timers module tests are now skipped

			listen-on documentation. [RT #616]

 656.	[func]		Treat an unescaped newline in a quoted string as

			specified in <draft-ietf-dnsext-ad-is-secure>.

 650.	[bug]		SIG(0) records were being generated and verified
			incorrectly. [RT #606]

 649.	[bug]		It was possible to join to an already running fctx
			after it had "cloned" its events, but before it sent
			them.  In this case, the event of the newly joined
			fetch would not contain the answer, and would
			trigger the INSIST() in fctx_sendevents().  In
			BIND 9.0, this bug did not trigger an INSIST(), but
			caused the fetch to fail with a SERVFAIL result.
			[RT #588, #597, #605, #607]

 648.	[port]		Add support for pre-RFC2133 IPv6 implementations.

 647.	[bug]		Resolver queries sent after following multiple

			[RT #595]

 640.	[bug]		Memory leak in error path could cause
			"mpctx->allocated == 0" failure. [RT #584]

 639.	[bug]		Reading entropy from the keyboard would sometimes fail.
			[RT #591]

 638.	[port]		lib/isc/random.c needed to explicitly include time.h
			to get a prototype for time() when pthreads was not
			being used. [RT #592]

 637.	[port]		Use isc_u?int64_t instead of (unsigned) long long in
			lib/isc/print.c.  Also allow lib/isc/print.c to
			be compiled even if the platform does not need it.
			[RT #592]

 636.	[port]		Shut up MSVC++ about a possible loss of precision
			in the ISC__BUFFER_PUTUINT*() macros. [RT #592]

 635.	[bug]		Reloading a server with a configured blackhole list
			would cause an assertion. [RT #590]

 634.	[bug]		A log file will completely stop being written when
			it reaches the maximum size in all cases, not just
			when versioning is also enabled. [RT #570]

 633.	[port]		Cope with rlim_t missing on BSD/OS systems. [RT #575]

 632.	[bug]		The index array of the journal file was
			corrupted as it was written to disk.

 631.	[port]		Build without thread support on systems without
			pthreads.

 630.	[bug]		Locking failure in zone code. [RT #582]

 629.	[bug]		9.1.0b1 dereferenced a null pointer and crashed
			when responding to a UDP IXFR request.

 628.	[bug]		If the root hints contained only AAAA addresses,
			named would be unable to perform resolution.

 627.	[bug]		The EDNS0 blackhole detection code of change 324
			waited for three retransmissions to each server,
			which takes much too long when a domain has many
			name servers and all of them drop EDNS0 queries.
			Now we retry without EDNS0 after three consecutive
			timeouts, even if they are all from different
			servers. [RT #143]

 626.	[bug]		The lightweight resolver daemon no longer crashes
			when asked for a SIG rrset. [RT #558]

 625.	[func]		Zones now inherit their class from the enclosing view.

			for syntax checking named.conf files and zone files,
			respectively.

 622.	[bug]		A canceled request could be destroyed before
			dns_request_destroy() was called. [RT #562]

 621.	[port]		Disable IPv6 at runtime if IPv6 sockets are unusable.
			This mostly affects Red Hat Linux 7.0, which has
			conflicts between libc and the kernel.

 620.	[bug]		dns_master_load*inc() now require 'task' and 'load'
			to be non-null.  Also 'done' will not be called if
			dns_master_load*inc() fails immediately. [RT #565]

 619.	[placeholder]

 618.	[bug]		Queries to a signed zone could sometimes cause
			an assertion failure.

 617.	[bug]		When using dynamic update to add a new RR to an
			existing RRset with a different TTL, the journal
			entries generated from the update did not include
			explicit deletions and re-additions of the existing
			RRs to update their TTL to the new value.

 616.	[func]		dnssec-signzone -t output now includes performance
			statistics.

 615.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone did not like child keysets signed
			by multiple keys.

 614.	[bug]		Checks for uninitialized link fields were prone
			to false positives, causing assertion failures.
			The checks are now disabled by default and may
			be re-enabled by defining ISC_LIST_CHECKINIT.

 613.	[bug]		"rndc reload zone" now reloads primary zones.
			It previously only updated slave and stub zones,
			if an SOA query indicated an out of date serial.

 612.	[cleanup]	Shutup a ridiculously noisy HP-UX compiler that
			complains relentlessly about how its treatment
			of 'const' has changed as well as how casting
			sometimes tightens alignment constraints.

 611.	[func]		allow-notify can be used to permit processing of
			notify messages from hosts other than a slave's
			masters.

 610.	[func]		rndc dumpdb is now supported.

			with the time the file was signed.

 607.	[bug]		nsupdate would fail if it encountered a CNAME or
			DNAME in a response to an SOA query. [RT #515]

 606.	[bug]		Compiling with --disable-threads failed due
			to isc_thread_self() being incorrectly defined
			as an integer rather than a function.

 605.	[func]		New function isc_lex_getlasttokentext().

 604.	[bug]		The named.conf parser could print incorrect line
			numbers when long comments were present.

 603.	[bug]		Make dig handle multiple types or classes on the same
			query more correctly.

 602.	[func]		Cope automatically with UnixWare's broken
			IN6_IS_ADDR_* macros. [RT #539]

 601.	[func]		Return a non-zero exit code if an update fails
			in nsupdate.

 600.	[bug]		Reverse lookups sometimes failed in dig, etc...

 599.	[func]		Added four new functions to the libisc log API to
			support i18n messages.  isc_log_iwrite(),
			isc_log_ivwrite(), isc_log_iwrite1() and
			isc_log_ivwrite1() were added.

 598.	[bug]		An update-policy statement would cause the server
			to assert while loading. [RT #536]

 597.	[func]		dnssec-signzone is now multi-threaded.

 596.	[bug]		DNS_RDATASLAB_FORCE and DNS_RDATASLAB_EXACT are
			not mutually exclusive.

 595.	[port]		On Linux 2.2, socket() returns EINVAL when it
			should return EAFNOSUPPORT.  Work around this.
			[RT #531]

 594.	[func]		sdb drivers are now assumed to not be thread-safe
			unless the DNS_SDBFLAG_THREADSAFE flag is supplied.

 593.	[bug]		If a secure zone was missing all its NXTs and
			a dynamic update was attempted, the server entered
			an infinite loop.

 592.	[bug]		The sig-validity-interval option now specifies a
			number of days, not seconds.  This matches the
			documentation. [RT #529]

	--- 9.1.0b1 released ---

 591.	[bug]		Work around non-reentrancy in openssl by disabling
			pre-computation in keys.

 590.	[doc]		There are now man pages for the lwres library in
			doc/man/lwres.

 589.	[bug]		The server could deadlock if a zone was updated
			while being transferred out.

 588.	[bug]		ctx->in_use was not being correctly initialized when
			when pushing a file for $INCLUDE. [RT #523]

 587.	[func]		A warning is now printed if the "allow-update"
			option allows updates based on the source IP
			address, to alert users to the fact that this
			is insecure and becoming increasingly so as
			servers capable of update forwarding are being
			deployed.

 586.	[bug]		multiple views with the same name were fatal. [RT #516]

 585.	[func]		dns_db_addrdataset() and and dns_rdataslab_merge()
			now support 'exact' additions in a similar manner to
			dns_db_subtractrdataset() and dns_rdataslab_subtract().

 584.	[func]		You can now say 'notify explicit'; to suppress
			notification of the servers listed in NS records
			and notify only those servers listed in the
			'also-notify' option.

 583.	[func]		"rndc querylog" will now toggle logging of
			queries, like "ndc querylog" in BIND 8.

 582.	[bug]		dns_zone_idetach() failed to lock the zone.
			[RT #199, #463]

 581.	[bug]		log severity was not being correctly processed.
			[RT #485]

 580.	[func]		Ignore trailing garbage on incoming DNS packets,
			for interoperability with broken server
			implementations. [RT #491]

 579.	[bug]		nsupdate did not take a filename to read update from.
			[RT #492]

 578.	[func]		New config option "notify-source", to specify the
			source address for notify messages.

 577.	[func]		Log illegal RDATA combinations. e.g. multiple
			singleton types, cname and other data.

 576.	[doc]		isc_log_create() description did not match reality.

 575.	[bug]		isc_log_create() was not setting internal state
			correctly to reflect the default channels created.

 574.	[bug]		TSIG signed queries sent by the resolver would fail to
			have their responses validated and would leak memory.

 573.	[bug]		The journal files of IXFRed slave zones were
			inadvertently discarded on server reload, causing
			"journal out of sync with zone" errors on subsequent
			reloads. [RT #482]

 572.	[bug]		Quoted strings were not accepted as key names in
			address match lists.

 571.	[bug]		It was possible to create an rdataset of singleton
			type which had more than one rdata. [RT #154]
			[RT #279]

 570.	[bug]		rbtdb.c allowed zones containing nodes which had
			both a CNAME and "other data". [RT #154]

 569.	[func]		The DNSSEC AD bit will not be set on queries which
			have not requested a DNSSEC response.

 568.	[func]		Add sample simple database drivers in contrib/sdb.

 567.	[bug]		Setting the zone transfer timeout to zero caused an
			assertion failure. [RT #302]

 566.	[func]		New public function dns_timer_setidle().

 565.	[func]		Log queries more like BIND 8: query logging is now
			done to category "queries", level "info". [RT #169]

 564.	[func]		Add sortlist support to lwresd.

 563.	[func]		New public functions dns_rdatatype_format() and
			dns_rdataclass_format(), for convenient formatting
			of rdata type/class mnemonics in log messages.

 562.	[cleanup]	Moved lib/dns/*conf.c to bin/named where they belong.

 561.	[func]		The 'datasize', 'stacksize', 'coresize' and 'files'
			clauses of the options{} statement are now implemented.

 560.	[bug]		dns_name_split did not properly the resulting prefix
			when a maximal length bitstring label was split which
			was preceded by another bitstring label. [RT #429]

 559.	[bug]		dns_name_split did not properly create the suffix
			when splitting within a maximal length bitstring label.

 558.	[func]		New functions, isc_resource_getlimit and
			isc_resource_setlimit.

 557.	[func]		Symbolic constants for libisc integral types.

 556.	[func]		The DNSSEC OK bit in the EDNS extended flags
			is now implemented.  Responses to queries without
			this bit set will not contain any DNSSEC records.

 555.	[bug]		A slave server attempting a zone transfer could
			crash with an assertion failure on certain
			malformed responses from the master. [RT #457]

 554.	[bug]		In some cases, not all of the dnssec tools were
			properly installed.

 553.	[bug]		Incoming zone transfers deferred due to quota
			were not started when quota was increased but
			only when a transfer in progress finished. [RT #456]

 552.	[bug]		We were not correctly detecting the end of all c-style
			comments. [RT #455]

 551.	[func]		Implemented the 'sortlist' option.

 550.	[func]		Support unknown rdata types and classes.

 549.	[bug]		"make" did not immediately abort the build when a
			subdirectory make failed [RT #450].

 548.	[func]		The lexer now ungets tokens more correctly.

 547.	[placeholder]

 546.	[func]		Option 'lame-ttl' is now implemented.

 545.	[func]		Name limit and counting options removed from dig;
			they didn't work properly, and cannot be correctly
			implemented without significant changes.

 544.	[func]		Add statistics option, enable statistics-file option,
			add RNDC option "dump-statistics" to write out a
			query statistics file.

 543.	[doc]		The 'port' option is now documented.

 542.	[func]		Add support for update forwarding as required for
			full compliance with RFC2136.  It is turned off
			by default and can be enabled using the
			'allow-update-forwarding' option.

 541.	[func]		Add bogus server support.

 540.	[func]		Add dialup support.

 539.	[func]		Support the blackhole option.

 538.	[bug]		fix buffer overruns by 1 in lwres_getnameinfo().

 537.	[placeholder]

 536.	[func]		Use transfer-source{-v6} when sending refresh queries.
			Transfer-source{-v6} now take a optional port
			parameter for setting the UDP source port.  The port
			parameter is ignored for TCP.

 535.	[func]		Use transfer-source{-v6} when forwarding update
			requests.

 534.	[func]		Ancestors have been removed from RBT chains.  Ancestor
			information can be discerned via node parent pointers.

 533.	[func]		Incorporated name hashing into the RBT database to
			improve search speed.

 532.	[func]		Implement DNS UPDATE pseudo records using
			DNS_RDATA_UPDATE flag.

 531.	[func]		Rdata really should be initialized before being assigned
			to (dns_rdata_fromwire(), dns_rdata_fromtext(),
			dns_rdata_clone(), dns_rdata_fromregion()),
			check that it is.

 530.	[func]		New function dns_rdata_invalidate().

 529.	[bug]		521 contained a bug which caused zones to always
			reload.  [RT #410]

 528.	[func]		The ISC_LIST_XXXX macros now perform sanity checks
			on their arguments.  ISC_LIST_XXXXUNSAFE can be use
			to skip the checks however use with caution.

 527.	[func]		New function dns_rdata_clone().

 526.	[bug]		nsupdate incorrectly refused to add RRs with a TTL
			of 0.

 525.	[func]		New arguments 'options' for dns_db_subtractrdataset(),
			and 'flags' for dns_rdataslab_subtract() allowing you
			to request that the RR's must exist prior to deletion.
			DNS_R_NOTEXACT is returned if the condition is not met.

 524.	[func]		The 'forward' and 'forwarders' statement in
			non-forward zones should work now.

 523.	[doc]		The source to the Administrator Reference Manual is
			now an XML file using the DocBook DTD, and is included
			in the distribution.  The plain text version of the
			ARM is temporarily unavailable while we figure out
			how to generate readable plain text from the XML.

 522.	[func]		The lightweight resolver daemon can now use
			a real configuration file, and its functionality
			can be provided by a name server.  Also, the -p and -P
			options to lwresd have been reversed.

 521.	[bug]		Detect master files which contain $INCLUDE and always
			reload. [RT #196]

 520.	[bug]		Upgraded libtool to 1.3.5, which makes shared
			library builds almost work on AIX (and possibly
			others).

 519.	[bug]		dns_name_split() would improperly split some bitstring
			labels, zeroing a few of the least significant bits in
			the prefix part.  When such an improperly created
			prefix was returned to the RBT database, the bogus
			label was dutifully stored, corrupting the tree.
			[RT #369]

 518.	[bug]		The resolver did not realize that a DNAME which was
			"the answer" to the client's query was "the answer",
			and such queries would fail. [RT #399]

 517.	[bug]		The resolver's DNAME code would trigger an assertion
			if there was more than one DNAME in the chain.
			[RT #399]

 516.	[bug]		Cache lookups which had a NULL node pointer, e.g.
			those by dns_view_find(), and which would match a
			DNAME, would trigger an INSIST(!search.need_cleanup)
			assertion. [RT #399]

 515.	[bug]		The ssu table was not being attached / detached
			by dns_zone_[sg]etssutable. [RT#397]

 514.	[func]		Retry refresh and notify queries if they timeout.
			[RT #388]

 513.	[func]		New functionality added to rdnc and server to allow
			individual zones to be refreshed or reloaded.

 512.	[bug]		The zone transfer code could throw an exception with
			an invalid IXFR stream.

 511.	[bug]		The message code could throw an assertion on an
			out of memory failure. [RT #392]

 510.	[bug]		Remove spurious view notify warning. [RT #376]

 509.	[func]		Add support for write of zone files on shutdown.

 508.	[func]		dns_message_parse() can now do a best-effort
			attempt, which should allow dig to print more invalid
			messages.

 507.	[func]		New functions dns_zone_flush(), dns_zt_flushanddetach()
			and dns_view_flushanddetach().

 506.	[func]		Do not fail to start on errors in zone files.

 505.	[bug]		nsupdate was printing "unknown result code". [RT #373]

 504.	[bug]		The zone was not being marked as dirty when updated via
			IXFR.

 503.	[bug]		dumptime was not being set along with
			DNS_ZONEFLG_NEEDDUMP.

 502.	[func]		On a SERVFAIL reply, DiG will now try the next server
			in the list, unless the +fail option is specified.

 501.	[bug]		Incorrect port numbers were being displayed by
			nslookup. [RT #352]

 500.	[func]		Nearly useless +details option removed from DiG.

 499.	[func]		In DiG, specifying a class with -c or type with -t
			changes command-line parsing so that classes and
			types are only recognized if following -c or -t.
			This allows hosts with the same name as a class or
			type to be looked up.

 498.	[doc]		There is now a man page for "dig"
			in doc/man/bin/dig.1.

 497.	[bug]		The error messages printed when an IP match list
			contained a network address with a nonzero host
			part where not sufficiently detailed. [RT #365]

 496.	[bug]		named didn't sanity check numeric parameters. [RT #361]

 495.	[bug]		nsupdate was unable to handle large records. [RT #368]

 494.	[func]		Do not cache NXDOMAIN responses for SOA queries.

 493.	[func]		Return non-cachable (ttl = 0) NXDOMAIN responses
			for SOA queries.  This makes it easier to locate
			the containing zone without polluting intermediate
			caches.

 492.	[bug]		attempting to reload a zone caused the server fail
			to shutdown cleanly. [RT #360]

 491.	[bug]		nsupdate would segfault when sending certain
			prerequisites with empty RDATA. [RT #356]

 490.	[func]		When a slave/stub zone has not yet successfully
			obtained an SOA containing the zone's configured
			retry time, perform the SOA query retries using
			exponential backoff. [RT #337]

 489.	[func]		The zone manager now has a "i/o" queue.

 488.	[bug]		Locks weren't properly destroyed in some cases.

 487.	[port]		flockfile() is not defined on all systems.

 486.	[bug]		nslookup: "set all" and "server" commands showed
			the incorrect port number if a port other than 53
			was specified. [RT #352]

 485.	[func]		When dig had more than one server to query, it would
			send all of the messages at the same time.  Add
			rate limiting of the transmitted messages.

 484.	[bug]		When the server was reloaded after removing addresses
			from the named.conf "listen-on" statement, sockets
			were still listening on the removed addresses due
			to reference count loops. [RT #325]

 483.	[bug]		nslookup: "set all" showed a "search" option but it
			was not settable.

 482.	[bug]		nslookup: a plain "server" or "lserver" should be
			treated as a lookup.

 481.	[bug]		nslookup:get_next_command() stack size could exceed
			per thread limit.

 480.	[bug]		strtok() is not thread safe. [RT #349]

 479.	[func]		The test suite can now be run by typing "make check"
			or "make test" at the top level.

 478.	[bug]		"make install" failed if the directory specified with
			--prefix did not already exist.

 477.	[bug]		The the isc-config.sh script could be installed before
			its directory was created. [RT #324]

 476.	[bug]		A zone could expire while a zone transfer was in
			progress triggering a INSIST failure. [RT #329]

 475.	[bug]		query_getzonedb() sometimes returned a non-null version
			on failure.  This caused assertion failures when
			generating query responses where names subject to
			additional section processing pointed to a zone
			to which access had been denied by means of the
			allow-query option. [RT #336]

 474.	[bug]		The mnemonic of the CHAOS class is CH according to
			RFC1035, but it was printed and read only as CHAOS.
			We now accept both forms as input, and print it
			as CH. [RT #305]

 473.	[bug]		nsupdate overran the end of the list of name servers
			when no servers could be reached, typically causing
			it to print the error message "dns_request_create:
			not implemented".

 472.	[bug]		Off-by-one error caused isc_time_add() to sometimes
			produce invalid time values.

 471.	[bug]		nsupdate didn't compile on HP/UX 10.20

 470.	[func]		$GENERATE is now supported.  See also
			doc/misc/migration.

 469.	[bug]		"query-source address * port 53;" now works.

 468.	[bug]		dns_master_load*() failed to report file and line
			number in certain error conditions.

 467.	[bug]		dns_master_load*() failed to log an error if
			pushfile() failed.

 466.	[bug]		dns_master_load*() could return success when it failed.

 465.	[cleanup]	Allow 0 to be set as an omapi_value_t value by
			omapi_value_storeint().

 464.	[cleanup]	Build with openssl's RSA code instead of dnssafe.

 463.	[bug]		nsupdate sent malformed SOA queries to the second
			and subsequent name servers in resolv.conf if the
			query sent to the first one failed.

 462.	[bug]		--disable-ipv6 should work now.

 461.	[bug]		Specifying an unknown key in the "keys" clause of the
			"controls" statement caused a NULL pointer dereference.

 460.	[bug]		Much of the DNSSEC code only worked with class IN.

 459.	[bug]		Nslookup processed the "set" command incorrectly.

 458.	[bug]		Nslookup didn't properly check class and type values.
			[RT #305]

 457.	[bug]		Dig/host/hslookup didn't properly handle connect
			timeouts in certain situations, causing an
			unnecessary warning message to be printed.

 456.	[bug]		Stub zones were not resetting the refresh and expire
			counters, loadtime or clearing the DNS_ZONE_REFRESH
			(refresh in progress) flag upon successful update.
			This disabled further refreshing of the stub zone,
			causing it to eventually expire. [RT #300]

 455.	[doc]		Document IPv4 prefix notation does not require a
			dotted decimal quad but may be just dotted decimal.

 454.	[bug]		Enforce dotted decimal and dotted decimal quad where
			documented as such in named.conf. [RT #304, RT #311]

 453.	[bug]		Warn if the obsolete option "maintain-ixfr-base"
			is specified in named.conf. [RT #306]

 452.	[bug]		Warn if the unimplemented option "statistics-file"
			is specified in named.conf. [RT #301]

 451.	[func]		Update forwarding implemented.

 450.	[func]		New function ns_client_sendraw().

 449.	[bug]		isc_bitstring_copy() only works correctly if the
			two bitstrings have the same lsb0 value, but this
			requirement was not documented, nor was there a
			REQUIRE for it.

 448.	[bug]		Host output formatting change, to match v8. [RT #255]

 447.	[bug]		Dig didn't properly retry in TCP mode after
			a truncated reply. [RT #277]

 446.	[bug]		Confusing notify log message. [RT #298]

 445.	[bug]		Doing a 0 bit isc_bitstring_copy() of an lsb0
			bitstring triggered a REQUIRE statement.  The REQUIRE
			statement was incorrect. [RT #297]

 444.	[func]		"recursion denied" messages are always logged at
			debug level 1, now, rather than sometimes at ERROR.
			This silences these warnings in the usual case, where
			some clients set the RD bit in all queries.

 443.	[bug]		When loading a master file failed because of an
			unrecognized RR type name, the error message
			did not include the file name and line number.
			[RT #285]

 442.	[bug]		TSIG signed messages that did not match any view
			crashed the server. [RT #290]

 441.	[bug]		Nodes obscured by a DNAME were inaccessible even

 438.	[func]		New function dns_message_getrawmessage().

 437.	[func]		Log NOTIFY activity to the notify channel.

 436.	[bug]		If recvmsg() returned EHOSTUNREACH or ENETUNREACH,
			which sometimes happens on Linux, named would enter
			a busy loop.  Also, unexpected socket errors were
			not logged at a high enough logging level to be
			useful in diagnosing this situation. [RT #275]

 435.	[bug]		dns_zone_dump() overwrote existing zone files
			rather than writing to a temporary file and
			renaming.  This could lead to empty or partial
			zone files being left around in certain error
			conditions involving the initial transfer of a
			slave zone, interfering with subsequent server
			startup. [RT #282]

 434.	[func]		New function isc_file_isabsolute().

 433.	[func]		isc_base64_decodestring() now accepts newlines
			within the base64 data.  This makes it possible
			to break up the key data in a "trusted-keys"
			statement into multiple lines. [RT #284]

 432.	[func]		Added refresh/retry jitter.  The actual refresh/
			retry time is now a random value between 75% and
			100% of the configured value.

 431.	[func]		Log at ISC_LOG_INFO when a zone is successfully
			loaded.

 430.	[bug]		Rewrote the lightweight resolver client management
			code to handle shutdown correctly and general
			cleanup.

 429.	[bug]		The space reserved for a TSIG record in a response
			was 2 bytes too short, leading to message
			generation failures.

 428.	[bug]		rbtdb.c:find_closest_nxt() erroneously returned
			DNS_R_BADDB for nodes which had neither NXT nor SIG NXT
			(e.g. glue).  This could cause SERVFAILs when
			generating negative responses in a secure zone.

 427.	[bug]		Avoid going into an infinite loop when the validator
			gets a negative response to a key query where the
			records are signed by the missing key.

 426.	[bug]		Attempting to generate an oversized RSA key could
			cause dnssec-keygen to dump core.

 425.	[bug]		Warn about the auth-nxdomain default value change
			if there is no auth-nxdomain statement in the
			config file. [RT #287]

 424.	[bug]		notify_createmessage() could trigger an assertion
			failure when creating the notify message failed,
			e.g. due to corrupt zones with multiple SOA records.
			[RT #279]

 423.	[bug]		When responding to a recursive query, errors that occur
			after following a CNAME should cause the query to fail.
			[RT #274]

 422.	[func]		get rid of isc_random_t, and make isc_random_get()
			and isc_random_jitter() use rand() internally
			instead of local state.  Note that isc_random_*()
			functions are only for weak, non-critical "randomness"
			such as timing jitter and such.

 421.	[bug]		nslookup would exit when given a blank line as input.

 420.	[bug]		nslookup failed to implement the "exit" command.

 419.	[bug]		The certificate type PKIX was misspelled as SKIX.

 418.	[bug]		At debug levels >= 10, getting an unexpected
			socket receive error would crash the server
			while trying to log the error message.

 417.	[func]		Add isc_app_block() and isc_app_unblock(), which
			allow an application to handle signals while
			blocking.

 416.	[bug]		Slave zones with no master file tried to use a
			NULL pointer for a journal file name when they
			received an IXFR. [RT #273]

 415.	[bug]		The logging code leaked file descriptors.

 414.	[bug]		Server did not shut down until all incoming zone
			transfers were finished.

 413.	[bug]		Notify could attempt to use the zone database after
			it had been unloaded. [RT#267]

 412.	[bug]		named -v didn't print the version.

 411.	[bug]		A typo in the HS A code caused an assertion failure.

 410.	[bug]		lwres_gethostbyname() and company set lwres_h_errno
			to a random value on success.

 409.	[bug]		If named was shut down early in the startup
			process, ns_omapi_shutdown() would attempt to lock
			an uninitialized mutex. [RT #262]

 408.	[bug]		stub zones could leak memory and reference counts if
			all the masters were unreachable.

 407.	[bug]		isc_rwlock_lock() would needlessly block
			readers when it reached the read quota even
			if no writers were waiting.

 406.	[bug]		Log messages were occasionally lost or corrupted
			due to a race condition in isc_log_doit().

 405.	[func]		Add support for selective forwarding (forward zones)

 404.	[bug]		The request library didn't completely work with IPv6.

 403.	[bug]		"host" did not use the search list.

 402.	[bug]		Treat undefined acls as errors, rather than
			warning and then later throwing an assertion.
			[RT #252]

 401.	[func]		Added simple database API.

 400.	[bug]		SIG(0) signing and verifying was done incorrectly.
			[RT #249]

 399.	[bug]		When reloading the server with a config file
			containing a syntax error, it could catch an
			assertion failure trying to perform zone
			maintenance on, or sending notifies from,
			tentatively created zones whose views were
			never fully configured and lacked an address
			database and request manager.

 398.	[bug]		"dig" sometimes caught an assertion failure when
			using TSIG, depending on the key length.

 397.	[func]		Added utility functions dns_view_gettsig() and
			dns_view_getpeertsig().

 396.	[doc]		There is now a man page for "nsupdate"
			in doc/man/bin/nsupdate.8.

 395.	[bug]		nslookup printed incorrect RR type mnemonics
			for RRs of type >= 21 [RT #237].

 394.	[bug]		Current name was not propagated via $INCLUDE.

 393.	[func]		Initial answer while loading (awl) support.
			Entry points: dns_master_loadfileinc(),
			dns_master_loadstreaminc(), dns_master_loadbufferinc().
			Note: calls to dns_master_load*inc() should be rate
			be rate limited so as to not use up all file
			descriptors.

 392.	[func]		Add ISC_R_FAMILYNOSUPPORT.  Returned when OS does
			not support the given address family requested.

 391.	[clarity]	ISC_R_FAMILY -> ISC_R_FAMILYMISMATCH.

 390.	[func]		The function dns_zone_setdbtype() now takes
			an argc/argv style vector of words and sets
			both the zone database type and its arguments,
			making the functions dns_zone_adddbarg()
			and dns_zone_cleardbargs() unnecessary.

 389.	[bug]		Attempting to send a request over IPv6 using
			dns_request_create() on a system without IPv6
			support caused an assertion failure [RT #235].

 388.	[func]		dig and host can now do reverse ipv6 lookups.

 387.	[func]		Add dns_byaddr_createptrname(), which converts
			an address into the name used by a PTR query.

 386.	[bug]		Missing strdup() of ACL name caused random
			ACL matching failures [RT #228].

 385.	[cleanup]	Removed functions dns_zone_equal(), dns_zone_print(),
			and dns_zt_print().

 384.	[bug]		nsupdate was incorrectly limiting TTLs to 65535 instead
			of 2147483647.

 383.	[func]		When writing a master file, print the SOA and NS
			records (and their SIGs) before other records.

 382.	[bug]		named -u failed on many Linux systems where the
			libc provided kernel headers do not match
			the current kernel.

 381.	[bug]		Check for IPV6_RECVPKTINFO and use it instead of
			IPV6_PKTINFO if found. [RT #229]

 380.	[bug]		nsupdate didn't work with IPv6.

 379.	[func]		New library function isc_sockaddr_anyofpf().

 378.	[func]		named and lwresd will log the command line arguments
			they were started with in the "starting ..." message.

 377.	[bug]		When additional data lookups were refused due to
			"allow-query", the databases were still being
			attached causing reference leaks.

 376.	[bug]		The server should always use good entropy when
			performing cryptographic functions needing entropy.

 375.	[bug]		Per-zone "allow-query" did not properly override the
			view/global one for CNAME targets and additional
			data [RT #220].

 374.	[bug]		SOA in authoritative negative responses had wrong TTL.

 373.	[func]		nslookup is now installed by "make install".

 372.	[bug]		Deal with Microsoft DNS servers appending two bytes of
			garbage to zone transfer requests.

 371.	[bug]		At high debug levels, doing an outgoing zone transfer
			of a very large RRset could cause an assertion failure
			during logging.

 370.	[bug]		The error messages for roll-forward failures were
			overly terse.

 369.	[func]		Support new named.conf options, view and zone
			statements:

				max-retry-time, min-retry-time,
				max-refresh-time, min-refresh-time.

 368.	[func]		Restructure the internal ".bind" view so that more
			zones can be added to it.

 367.	[bug]		Allow proper selection of server on nslookup command
			line.

 366.	[func]		Allow use of '-' batch file in dig for stdin.

 365.	[bug]		nsupdate -k leaked memory.

 364.	[func]		Added additional-from-{cache,auth}

 363.	[placeholder]

 362.	[bug]		rndc no longer aborts if the configuration file is
			missing an options statement. [RT #209]

 361.	[func]		When the RBT find or chain functions set the name and
			origin for a node that stores the root label
			the name is now set to an empty name, instead of ".",
			to simplify later use of the name and origin by
			dns_name_concatenate(), dns_name_totext() or
			dns_name_format().

 360.	[func]		dns_name_totext() and dns_name_format() now allow
			an empty name to be passed, which is formatted as "@".

 359.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone occasionally signed glue records.

 358.	[cleanup]	Rename the intermediate files used by the dnssec
			programs.

 357.	[bug]		The zone file parser crashed if the argument
			to $INCLUDE was a quoted string.

 356.	[cleanup]	isc_task_send no longer requires event->sender to
			be non-null.

 355.	[func]		Added isc_dir_createunique(), similar to mkdtemp().

 354.	[doc]		Man pages for the dnssec tools are now included in
			the distribution, in doc/man/dnssec.

 353.	[bug]		double increment in lwres/gethost.c:copytobuf().
			[RT# 187]

 352.	[bug]		Race condition in dns_client_t startup could cause
			an assertion failure.

 351.	[bug]		Constructing a response with rcode SERVFAIL to a TSIG
			signed query could crash the server.

 350.	[bug]		Also-notify lists specified in the global options
			block were not correctly reference counted, causing
			a memory leak.

 349.	[bug]		Processing a query with the CD bit set now works
			as expected.

 348.	[func]		New boolean named.conf options 'additional-from-auth'
			and 'additional-from-cache' now supported in view and
			global options statement.

 347.	[bug]		Don't crash if an argument is left off options in dig.

 346.	[placeholder]

 345.	[bug]		Large-scale changes/cleanups to dig:
			* Significantly improve structure handling
			* Don't pre-load entire batch files
			* Add name/rr counting/limiting
			* Fix SIGINT handling
			* Shorten timeouts to match v8's behavior

 344.	[bug]		When shutting down, lwresd sometimes tried
			to shut down its client tasks twice,
			triggering an assertion.

 343.	[bug]		Although zone maintenance SOA queries and
			notify requests were signed with TSIG keys
			when configured for the server in case,
			the TSIG was not verified on the response.

 342.	[bug]		The wrong name was being passed to
			dns_name_dup() when generating a TSIG
			key using TKEY.

 341.	[func]		Support 'key' clause in named.conf zone masters
			statement to allow authentication via TSIG keys:

				masters {
					10.0.0.1 port 5353 key "foo";
					10.0.0.2 ;
				};

 340.	[bug]		The top-level COPYRIGHT file was missing from
			the distribution.

 339.	[bug]		DNSSEC validation of the response to an ANY
			query at a name with a CNAME RR in a secure
			zone triggered an assertion failure.

 338.	[bug]		lwresd logged to syslog as named, not lwresd.

 337.	[bug]		"dig" did not recognize "nsap-ptr" as an RR type
			on the command line.

 336.	[bug]		"dig -f" used 64 k of memory for each line in
			the file.  It now uses much less, though still
			proportionally to the file size.

 335.	[bug]		named would occasionally attempt recursion when
			it was disallowed or undesired.

 334.	[func]		Added hmac-md5 to libisc.

 333.	[bug]		The resolver incorrectly accepted referrals to
			domains that were not parents of the query name,
			causing assertion failures.

 332.	[func]		New function dns_name_reset().

 331.	[bug]		Only log "recursion denied" if RD is set. [RT #178]

 330.	[bug]		Many debugging messages were partially formatted
			even when debugging was turned off, causing a
			significant decrease in query performance.

 329.	[func]		omapi_auth_register() now takes a size_t argument for
			the length of a key's secret data.  Previously
			OMAPI only stored secrets up to the first NUL byte.

 328.	[func]		Added isc_base64_decodestring().

 327.	[bug]		rndc.conf parser wasn't correctly recognizing an IP
			address where a host specification was required.

 326.	[func]		'keys' in an 'inet' control statement is now
			required and must have at least one item in it.
			A "not supported" warning is now issued if a 'unix'
			control channel is defined.

 325.	[bug]		isc_lex_gettoken was processing octal strings when
			ISC_LEXOPT_CNUMBER was not set.

 324.	[func]		In the resolver, turn EDNS0 off if there is no
			response after a number of retransmissions.
			This is to allow queries some chance of succeeding
			even if all the authoritative servers of a zone
			silently discard EDNS0 requests instead of
			sending an error response like they ought to.

 323.	[bug]		dns_rbt_findname() did not ignore empty rbt nodes.
			Because of this, servers authoritative for a parent
			and grandchild zone but not authoritative for the
			intervening child zone did not correctly issue
			referrals to the servers of the child zone.

 322.	[bug]		Queries for KEY RRs are now sent to the parent
			server before the authoritative one, making
			DNSSEC insecurity proofs work in many cases
			where they previously didn't.

 321.	[bug]		When synthesizing a CNAME RR for a DNAME
			response, query_addcname() failed to initialize
			the type and class of the CNAME dns_rdata_t,
			causing random failures.

 320.	[func]		Multiple rndc changes: parses an rndc.conf file,
			uses authentication to talk to named, command
			line syntax changed.  This will all be described
			in the ARM.

 319.	[func]		The named.conf "controls" statement is now used
			to configure the OMAPI command channel.

 318.	[func]		dns_c_ndcctx_destroy() could never return anything
			except ISC_R_SUCCESS; made it have void return instead.

 317.	[func]		Use callbacks from libomapi to determine if a
			new connection is valid, and if a key requested
			to be used with that connection is valid.

 316.	[bug]		Generate a warning if we detect an unexpected <eof>
			but treat as <eol><eof>.

 315.	[bug]		Handle non-empty blanks lines. [RT #163]

 314.	[func]		The named.conf controls statement can now have
			more than one key specified for the inet clause.

 313.	[bug]		When parsing resolv.conf, don't terminate on an
			error.  Instead, parse as much as possible, but
			still return an error if one was found.

 312.	[bug]		Increase the number of allowed elements in the
			resolv.conf search path from 6 to 8.  If there
			are more than this, ignore the remainder rather
			than returning a failure in lwres_conf_parse.

 311.	[bug]		lwres_conf_parse failed when the first line of
			resolv.conf was empty or a comment.

 310.	[func]		Changes to named.conf "controls" statement (inet
			subtype only)

			  - support "keys" clause

				controls {
				   inet * port 1024
					allow { any; } keys { "foo"; }
				}

			  - allow "port xxx" to be left out of statement,
			    in which case it defaults to omapi's default port
			    of 953.

 309.	[bug]		When sending a referral, the server did not look
			for name server addresses as glue in the zone
			holding the NS RRset in the case where this zone
			was not the same as the one where it looked for
			name server addresses as authoritative data.

 308.	[bug]		Treat a SOA record not at top of zone as an error
			when loading a zone. [RT #154]

 307.	[bug]		When canceling a query, the resolver didn't check for
			isc_socket_sendto() calls that did not yet have their
			completion events posted, so it could (rarely) end up
			destroying the query context and then want to use
			it again when the send event posted, triggering an
			assertion as it tried to cancel an already-canceled
			query.  [RT #77]

 306.	[bug]		Reading HMAC-MD5 private key files didn't work.

 305.	[bug]		When reloading the server with a config file
			containing a syntax error, it could catch an
			assertion failure trying to perform zone
			maintenance on tentatively created zones whose
			views were never fully configured and lacked
			an address database.

 304.	[bug]		If more than LWRES_CONFMAXNAMESERVERS servers
			are listed in resolv.conf, silently ignore them
			instead of returning failure.

 303.	[bug]		Add additional sanity checks to differentiate a AXFR
			response vs a IXFR response. [RT #157]

 302.	[bug]		In dig, host, and nslookup, MXNAME should be large
			enough to hold any legal domain name in presentation
			format + terminating NULL.

 301.	[bug]		Uninitialized pointer in host:printmessage(). [RT #159]

 300.	[bug]		Using both <isc/net.h> and <lwres/net.h> didn't work
			on platforms lacking IPv6 because each included their
			own ipv6 header file for the missing definitions.  Now
			each library's ipv6.h defines the wrapper symbol of
			the other (ISC_IPV6_H and LWRES_IPV6_H).

 299.	[cleanup]	Get the user and group information before changing the
			root directory, so the administrator does not need to
			keep a copy of the user and group databases in the
			chroot'ed environment.  Suggested by Hakan Olsson.

 298.	[bug]		A mutex deadlock occurred during shutdown of the
			interface manager under certain conditions.
			Digital Unix systems were the most affected.

 297.	[bug]		Specifying a key name that wasn't fully qualified
			in certain parts of the config file could cause
			an assertion failure.

 296.	[bug]		"make install" from a separate build directory
			failed unless configure had been run in the source
			directory, too.

 295.	[bug]		When invoked with type==CNAME and a message
			not constructed by dns_message_parse(),
			dns_message_findname() failed to find anything
			due to checking for attribute bits that are set
			only in dns_message_parse().  This caused an
			infinite loop when constructing the response to
			an ANY query at a CNAME in a secure zone.

 294.	[bug]		If we run out of space in while processing glue
			when reading a master file and commit "current name"
			reverts to "name_current" instead of staying as
			"name_glue".

 293.	[port]		Add support for FreeBSD 4.0 system tests.

 292.	[bug]		Due to problems with the way some operating systems
			handle simultaneous listening on IPv4 and IPv6
			addresses, the server no longer listens on IPv6
			addresses by default.  To revert to the previous
			behavior, specify "listen-on-v6 { any; };" in
			the config file.

 291.	[func]		Caching servers no longer send outgoing queries
			over TCP just because the incoming recursive query
			was a TCP one.

 290.	[cleanup]	+twiddle option to dig (for testing only) removed.

 289.	[cleanup]	dig is now installed in $bindir instead of $sbindir.
			host is now installed in $bindir.  (Be sure to remove
			any $sbindir/dig from a previous release.)

 288.	[func]		rndc is now installed by "make install" into $sbindir.

 287.	[bug]		rndc now works again as "rndc 127.1 reload" (for
			only that task).  Parsing its configuration file and
			using digital signatures for authentication has been
			disabled until named supports the "controls" statement,
			post-9.0.0.

 286.	[bug]		On Solaris 2, when named inherited a signal state
			where SIGHUP had the SIG_IGN action, SIGHUP would
			be ignored rather than causing the server to reload
			its configuration.

 285.	[bug]		A change made to the dst API for beta4 inadvertently
			broke OMAPI's creation of a dst key from an incoming
			message, causing an assertion to be triggered.  Fixed.

 284.	[func]		The DNSSEC key generation and signing tools now
			generate randomness from keyboard input on systems
			that lack /dev/random.

 283.	[cleanup]	The 'lwresd' program is now a link to 'named'.

 282.	[bug]		The lexer now returns ISC_R_RANGE if parsed integer is
			too big for an unsigned long.

 281.	[bug]		Fixed list of recognized config file category names.

 280.	[func]		Add isc-config.sh, which can be used to more
			easily build applications that link with
			our libraries.

 279.	[bug]		Private omapi function symbols shared between
			two or more files in libomapi.a were not namespace
			protected using the ISC convention of starting with
			the library name and two underscores ("omapi__"...)

 278.	[bug]		bin/named/logconf.c:category_fromconf() didn't take
			note of when isc_log_categorybyname() wasn't able
			to find the category name and would then apply the
			channel list of the unknown category to all categories.

 277.	[bug]		isc_log_categorybyname() and isc_log_modulebyname()
			would fail to find the first member of any category
			or module array apart from the internal defaults.
			Thus, for example, the "notify" category was improperly
			configured by named.

 276.	[bug]		dig now supports maximum sized TCP messages.

 275.	[bug]		The definition of lwres_gai_strerror() was missing
			the lwres_ prefix.

 274.	[bug]		TSIG AXFR verify failed when talking to a BIND 8
			server.

 273.	[func]		The default for the 'transfer-format' option is
			now 'many-answers'.  This will break zone transfers
			to BIND 4.9.5 and older unless there is an explicit
			'one-answer' configuration.

 272.	[bug]		The sending of large TCP responses was canceled
			in mid-transmission due to a race condition
			caused by the failure to set the client object's
			"newstate" variable correctly when transitioning
			to the "working" state.

 271.	[func]		Attempt to probe the number of cpus in named
			if unspecified rather than defaulting to 1.

 270.	[func]		Allow maximum sized TCP answers.

 269.	[bug]		Failed DNSSEC validations could cause an assertion
			failure by causing clone_results() to be called with
			with hevent->node == NULL.

 268.	[doc]		A plain text version of the Administrator
			Reference Manual is now included in the distribution,
			as doc/arm/Bv9ARM.txt.

 267.	[func]		Nsupdate is now provided in the distribution.

 266.	[bug]		zone.c:save_nsrrset() node was not initialized.

 265.	[bug]		dns_request_create() now works for TCP.

 264.	[func]		Dispatch can not take TCP sockets in connecting
			state.  Set DNS_DISPATCHATTR_CONNECTED when calling
			dns_dispatch_createtcp() for connected TCP sockets
			or call dns_dispatch_starttcp() when the socket is
			connected.

 263.	[func]		New logging channel type 'stderr'

				channel some-name {
					stderr;
					severity error;
				}

 262.	[bug]		'master' was not initialized in zone.c:stub_callback().

 261.	[func]		Add dns_zone_markdirty().

 260.	[bug]		Running named as a non-root user failed on Linux
			kernels new enough to support retaining capabilities
			after setuid().

 259.	[func]		New random-device and random-seed-file statements
			for global options block of named.conf. Both accept
			a single string argument.

 258.	[bug]		Fixed printing of lwres_addr_t.address field.

 257.	[bug]		The server detached the last zone manager reference
			too early, while it could still be in use by queries.
			This manifested itself as assertion failures during the
			shutdown process for busy name servers. [RT #133]

 256.	[func]		isc_ratelimiter_t now has attach/detach semantics, and
			isc_ratelimiter_shutdown guarantees that the rate
			limiter is detached from its task.

 255.	[func]		New function dns_zonemgr_attach().

 254.	[bug]		Suppress "query denied" messages on additional data
			lookups.

	--- 9.0.0b4 released ---

 253.	[func]		resolv.conf parser now recognizes ';' and '#' as
			comments (anywhere in line, not just as the beginning).

 252.	[bug]		resolv.conf parser mishandled masks on sortlists.
			It also aborted when an unrecognized keyword was seen,
			now it silently ignores the entire line.

 251.	[bug]		lwresd caught an assertion failure on startup.

 250.	[bug]		fixed handling of size+unit when value would be too
			large for internal representation.

 249.	[cleanup]	max-cache-size config option now takes a size-spec
			like 'datasize', except 'default' is not allowed.

 248.	[bug]		global lame-ttl option was not being printed when
			config structures were written out.

 247.	[cleanup]	Rename cache-size config option to max-cache-size.

 246.	[func]		Rename global option cachesize to cache-size and
			add corresponding option to view statement.

 245.	[bug]		If an uncompressed name will take more than 255
			bytes and the buffer is sufficiently long,
			dns_name_fromwire should return DNS_R_FORMERR,
			not ISC_R_NOSPACE.  This bug caused cause the
			server to catch an assertion failure when it
			received a query for a name longer than 255
			bytes.

 244.	[bug]		empty named.conf file and empty options statement are
			now parsed properly.

 243.	[func]		new cachesize option for named.conf

 242.	[cleanup]	fixed incorrect warning about auth-nxdomain usage.

 241.	[cleanup]	nscount and soacount have been removed from the
			dns_master_*() argument lists.

 240.	[func]		databases now come in three flavours: zone, cache
			and stub.

 239.	[func]		If ISC_MEM_DEBUG is enabled, the variable
			isc_mem_debugging controls whether messages
			are printed or not.

 238.	[cleanup]	A few more compilation warnings have been quieted:
			+ missing sigwait prototype on BSD/OS 4.0/4.0.1.
			+ PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT unbraced initializer warnings on
				Solaris 2.8.
			+ IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT unbraced initializer warnings on
				BSD/OS 4.*, Linux and Solaris 2.8.

 237.	[bug]		If connect() returned ENOBUFS when the resolver was
			initiating a TCP query, the socket didn't get
			destroyed, and the server did not shut down cleanly.

 236.	[func]		Added new listen-on-v6 config file statement.

 235.	[func]		Consider it a config file error if a listen-on
			statement has an IPv6 address in it, or a
			listen-on-v6 statement has an IPv4 address in it.

 234.	[bug]		Allow a trusted-key's first field (domain-name) be
			either a quoted or an unquoted string, instead of
			requiring a quoted string.

 233.	[cleanup]	Convert all config structure integer values to unsigned
			integer (isc_uint32_t) to match grammar.

 232.	[bug]		Allow slave zones to not have a file.

 231.	[func]		Support new 'port' clause in config file options
			section. Causes 'listen-on', 'masters' and
			'also-notify' statements to use its value instead of
			default (53).

 230.	[func]		Replace the dst sign/verify API with a cleaner one.

 229.	[func]		Support config file sig-validity-interval statement
			in options, views and zone statements (master
			zones only).

			trailing period.

 227.	[cleanup]	The enumerated identifiers dns_rdataclass_*,
			dns_rcode_*, dns_opcode_*, and dns_trust_* are
			also now cast to their appropriate types, as with
			dns_rdatatype_* in item number 225 below.

 226.	[func]		dns_name_totext() now always prints the root name as
			'.', even when omit_final_dot is true.

 225.	[cleanup]	The enumerated dns_rdatatype_* identifiers are now
			cast to dns_rdatatype_t via macros of their same name
			so that they are of the proper integral type wherever
			a dns_rdatatype_t is needed.

 224.	[cleanup]	The entire project builds cleanly with gcc's
			-Wcast-qual and -Wwrite-strings warnings enabled,
			which is now the default when using gcc.  (Warnings
			from confparser.c, because of yacc's code, are
			unfortunately to be expected.)

 223.	[func]		Several functions were re-prototyped to qualify one
			or more of their arguments with "const".  Similarly,
			several functions that return pointers now have
			those pointers qualified with const.

 222.	[bug]		The global 'also-notify' option was ignored.

 221.	[bug]		An uninitialized variable was sometimes passed to
			dns_rdata_freestruct() when loading a zone, causing
			an assertion failure.

 220.	[cleanup]	Set the default outgoing port in the view, and
			set it in sockaddrs returned from the ADB.
			[31-May-2000 explorer]

 219.	[bug]		Signed truncated messages more correctly follow
			the respective specs.

 218.	[func]		When an rdataset is signed, its ttl is normalized
			based on the signature validity period.

 217.	[func]		Also-notify and trusted-keys can now be used in
			the 'view' statement.

 216.	[func]		The 'max-cache-ttl' and 'max-ncache-ttl' options
			now work.

 215.	[bug]		Failures at certain points in request processing
			could cause the assertion INSIST(client->lockview
			== NULL) to be triggered.

 214.	[func]		New public function isc_netaddr_format(), for
			formatting network addresses in log messages.

 213.	[bug]		Don't leak memory when reloading the zone if
			an update-policy clause was present in the old zone.

 212.	[func]		Added dns_message_get/settsigkey, to make TSIG
			key management reasonable.

 211.	[func]		The 'key' and 'server' statements can now occur
			inside 'view' statements.

 210.	[bug]		The 'allow-transfer' option was ignored for slave
			zones, and the 'transfers-per-ns' option was
			was ignored for all zones.

 209.	[cleanup]	Upgraded openssl files to new version 0.9.5a

 208.	[func]		Added ISC_OFFSET_MAXIMUM for the maximum value
			of an isc_offset_t.

 207.	[func]		The dnssec tools properly use the logging subsystem.

 206.	[cleanup]	dst now stores the key name as a dns_name_t, not
			a char *.

 205.	[cleanup]	On IRIX, turn off the mostly harmless warnings 1692
			("prototyped function redeclared without prototype")
			and 1552 ("variable ... set but not used") when
			compiling in the lib/dns/sec/{dnssafe,openssl}
			directories, which contain code imported from outside
			sources.

 204.	[cleanup]	On HP/UX, pass +vnocompatwarnings to the linker
			to quiet the warnings that "The linked output may not
			run on a PA 1.x system."

 203.	[func]		notify and zone soa queries are now tsig signed when
			appropriate.

 202.	[func]		isc_lex_getsourceline() changed from returning int
			to returning unsigned long, the type of its underlying
			counter.

 201.	[cleanup]	Removed the test/sdig program, it has been
			replaced by bin/dig/dig.

	--- 9.0.0b3 released ---

 200.	[bug]		Failures in sending query responses to clients
			(e.g., running out of network buffers) were
			not logged.

 199.	[bug]		isc_heap_delete() sometimes violated the heap
			invariant, causing timer events not to be posted
			when due.

 198.	[func]		Dispatch managers hold memory pools which
			any managed dispatcher may use.  This allows
			us to avoid dipping into the memory context for
			most allocations. [19-May-2000 explorer]

 197.	[bug]		When an incoming AXFR or IXFR completes, the
			zone's internal state is refreshed from the
			SOA data. [19-May-2000 explorer]

 196.	[func]		Dispatchers can be shared easily between views
			and/or interfaces. [19-May-2000 explorer]

 195.	[bug]		Including the NXT record of the root domain
			in a negative response caused an assertion
			failure.

 194.	[doc]		The PDF version of the Administrator's Reference
			Manual is no longer included in the ISC BIND9
			distribution.

 193.	[func]		changed dst_key_free() prototype.

 192.	[bug]		Zone configuration validation is now done at end
			of config file parsing, and before loading
			callbacks.

 191.	[func]		Patched to compile on UnixWare 7.x.  This platform
			is not directly supported by the ISC.

 190.	[cleanup]	The DNSSEC tools have been moved to a separate
			directory dnssec/ and given the following new,
			more descriptive names:

			      dnssec-keygen
			      dnssec-signzone
			      dnssec-signkey
			      dnssec-makekeyset

			Their command line arguments have also been changed to
			be more consistent.  dnssec-keygen now prints the
			name of the generated key files (sans extension)
			on standard output to simplify its use in automated
			scripts.

 189.	[func]		isc_time_secondsastimet(), a new function, will ensure
			that the number of seconds in an isc_time_t does not
			exceed the range of a time_t, or return ISC_R_RANGE.
			Similarly, isc_time_now(), isc_time_nowplusinterval(),
			isc_time_add() and isc_time_subtract() now check the
			range for overflow/underflow.  In the case of
			isc_time_subtract, this changed a calling requirement
			(ie, something that could generate an assertion)
			into merely a condition that returns an error result.
			isc_time_add() and isc_time_subtract() were void-
			valued before but now return isc_result_t.

 188.	[func]		Log a warning message when an incoming zone transfer
			contains out-of-zone data.

 187.	[func]		isc_ratelimiter_enqueue() has an additional argument
			'task'.

 186.	[func]		dns_request_getresponse() has an additional argument
			'preserve_order'.

 185.	[bug]		Fixed up handling of ISC_MEMCLUSTER_LEGACY.  Several
			public functions did not have an isc__ prefix, and
			referred to functions that had previously been
			renamed.

 184.	[cleanup]	Variables/functions which began with two leading
			underscores were made to conform to the ANSI/ISO
			standard, which says that such names are reserved.

 183.	[func]		ISC_LOG_PRINTTAG option for log channels.  Useful
			for logging the program name or other identifier.

 182.	[cleanup]	New command-line parameters for dnssec tools

 181.	[func]		Added dst_key_buildfilename and dst_key_parsefilename

 180.	[func]		New isc_result_t ISC_R_RANGE.  Supersedes DNS_R_RANGE.

 179.	[func]		options named.conf statement *must* now come
			before any zone or view statements.

 178.	[func]		Post-load of named.conf check verifies a slave zone
			has non-empty list of masters defined.

 177.	[func]		New per-zone boolean:

				enable-zone yes | no ;

			intended to let a zone be disabled without having
			to comment out the entire zone statement.

 176.	[func]		New global and per-view option:

				max-cache-ttl number

 175.	[func]		New global and per-view option:

				additional-data internal | minimal | maximal;

 174.	[func]		New public function isc_sockaddr_format(), for
			formatting socket addresses in log messages.

 173.	[func]		Keep a queue of zones waiting for zone transfer
			quota so that a new transfer can be dispatched
			immediately whenever quota becomes available.

 172.	[bug]		$TTL directive was sometimes missing from dumped
			master files because totext_ctx_init() failed to
			initialize ctx->current_ttl_valid.

 171.	[cleanup]	On NetBSD systems, the mit-pthreads or
			unproven-pthreads library is now always used
			unless --with-ptl2 is explicitly specified on
			the configure command line.  The
			--with-mit-pthreads option is no longer needed
			and has been removed.

 170.	[cleanup]	Remove inter server consistency checks from zone,
			these should return as a separate module in 9.1.
			dns_zone_checkservers(), dns_zone_checkparents(),
			dns_zone_checkchildren(), dns_zone_checkglue().

			Remove dns_zone_setadb(), dns_zone_setresolver(),
			dns_zone_setrequestmgr() these should now be found
			via the view.

 169.	[func]		ratelimiter can now process N events per interval.

 168.	[bug]		include statements in named.conf caused syntax errors
			due to not consuming the semicolon ending the include
			statement before switching input streams.

 167.	[bug]		Make lack of masters for a slave zone a soft error.

 166.	[bug]		Keygen was overwriting existing keys if key_id
			conflicted, now it will retry, and non-null keys
			with key_id == 0 are not generated anymore.  Key
			was not able to generate NOAUTHCONF DSA key,
			increased RSA key size to 2048 bits.

 165.	[cleanup]	Silence "end-of-loop condition not reached" warnings
			from Solaris compiler.

 164.	[func]		Added functions isc_stdio_open(), isc_stdio_close(),
			isc_stdio_seek(), isc_stdio_read(), isc_stdio_write(),
			isc_stdio_flush(), isc_stdio_sync(), isc_file_remove()
			to encapsulate nonportable usage of errno and sync.

 163.	[func]		Added result codes ISC_R_FILENOTFOUND and
			ISC_R_FILEEXISTS.

 162.	[bug]		Ensure proper range for arguments to ctype.h functions.

 161.	[cleanup]	error in yyparse prototype that only HPUX caught.

 160.	[cleanup]	getnet*() are not going to be implemented at this
			stage.

 159.	[func]		Redefinition of config file elements is now an
			error (instead of a warning).

 158.	[bug]		Log channel and category list copy routines
			weren't assigning properly to output parameter.

 157.	[port]		Fix missing prototype for getopt().

 156.	[func]		Support new 'database' statement in zone.

				database "quoted-string";

 155.	[bug]		ns_notify_start() was not detaching the found zone.

 154.	[func]		The signer now logs libdns warnings to stderr even when
			not verbose, and in a nicer format.

 153.	[func]		dns_rdata_tostruct() 'mctx' is now optional.  If 'mctx'
			is NULL then you need to preserve the 'rdata' until
			you have finished using the structure as there may be
			references to the associated memory.  If 'mctx' is
			non-NULL it is guaranteed that there are no references
			to memory associated with 'rdata'.

			dns_rdata_freestruct() must be called if 'mctx' was
			non-NULL and may safely be called if 'mctx' was NULL.

 152.	[bug]		keygen dumped core if domain name argument was omitted
			from command line.

 151.	[func]		Support 'disabled' statement in zone config (causes
			zone to be parsed and then ignored). Currently must
			come after the 'type' clause.

 150.	[func]		Support optional ports in masters and also-notify
			statements:

				masters [ port xxx ] { y.y.y.y [ port zzz ] ; }

 149.	[cleanup]	Removed unused argument 'olist' from
			dns_c_view_unsetordering().

 148.	[cleanup]	Stop issuing some warnings about some configuration
			file statements that were not implemented, but now are.

 147.	[bug]		Changed yacc union size to be smaller for yaccs that
			put yacc-stack on the real stack.

 146.	[cleanup]	More general redundant header file cleanup.  Rather
			than continuing to itemize every header which changed,
			this changelog entry just notes that if a header file
			did not need another header file that it was including
			in order to provide its advertised functionality, the
			inclusion of the other header file was removed.  See
			util/check-includes for how this was tested.

 145.	[cleanup]	Added <isc/lang.h> and ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS/
			ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS to header files that had function
			prototypes, and removed it from those that did not.

 144.	[cleanup]	libdns header files too numerous to name were made
			to conform to the same style for multiple inclusion
			protection.

 143.	[func]		Added function dns_rdatatype_isknown().

 142.	[cleanup]	<isc/stdtime.h> does not need <time.h> or
			<isc/result.h>.

			<isc/int.h> and <isc/result.h>.

 138.	[cleanup]	isc_strtouq moved from str.[ch] to string.[ch] and
			renamed isc_string_touint64.  isc_strsep moved from
			strsep.c to string.c and renamed isc_string_separate.

 137.	[cleanup]	<isc/commandline.h>, <isc/mem.h>, <isc/print.h>
			<isc/serial.h>, <isc/string.h> and <isc/offset.h>
			made to conform to the same style for multiple
			inclusion protection.

 136.	[cleanup]	<isc/commandline.h>, <isc/interfaceiter.h>,
			<isc/net.h> and Win32's <isc/thread.h> needed
			ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS/ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS.

 135.	[cleanup]	Win32's <isc/condition.h> did not need <isc/result.h>
			or <isc/boolean.h>, now uses <isc/types.h> in place
			of <isc/time.h>, and needed ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS
			and ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS.

 134.	[cleanup]	<isc/dir.h> does not need <limits.h>.

 133.	[cleanup]	<isc/ipv6.h> needs <isc/platform.h>.

 132.	[cleanup]	<isc/app.h> does not need <isc/task.h>, but does
			need <isc/eventclass.h>.

 131.	[cleanup]	<isc/mutex.h> and <isc/util.h> need <isc/result.h>
			for ISC_R_* codes used in macros.

 130.	[cleanup]	<isc/condition.h> does not need <pthread.h> or
			<isc/boolean.h>, and now includes <isc/types.h>
			instead of <isc/time.h>.

 129.	[bug]		The 'default_debug' log channel was not set up when
			'category default' was present in the config file

 128.	[cleanup]	<isc/dir.h> had ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS instead of
			ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS at end of header.

 127.	[cleanup]	The contracts for the comparison routines
			dns_name_fullcompare(), dns_name_compare(),
			dns_name_rdatacompare(), and dns_rdata_compare() now
			specify that the order value returned is < 0, 0, or > 0
			instead of -1, 0, or 1.

 126.	[cleanup]	<isc/quota.h> and <isc/taskpool.h> need <isc/lang.h>.

 125.	[cleanup]	<isc/eventclass.h>, <isc/ipv6.h>, <isc/magic.h>,
			<isc/mutex.h>, <isc/once.h>, <isc/region.h>, and
			<isc/resultclass.h> do not need <isc/lang.h>.

 124.	[func]		signer now imports parent's zone key signature
			and creates null keys/sets zone status bit for
			children when necessary

 123.	[cleanup]	<isc/event.h> does not need <stddef.h>.

 122.	[cleanup]	<isc/task.h> does not need <isc/mem.h> or
			<isc/result.h>.

 117.	[cleanup]	libdns.a changes:
			dns_zone_clearnotify() and dns_zone_addnotify()
			are replaced by dns_zone_setnotifyalso().
			dns_zone_clearmasters() and dns_zone_addmaster()
			are replaced by dns_zone_setmasters().

 116.	[func]		Added <isc/offset.h> for isc_offset_t (aka off_t
			on Unix systems).

 115.	[port]		Shut up the -Wmissing-declarations warning about
			<stdio.h>'s __sputaux on BSD/OS pre-4.1.

 114.	[cleanup]	<isc/sockaddr.h> does not need <isc/buffer.h> or
			<isc/list.h>.

 113.	[func]		Utility programs dig and host added.

 112.	[cleanup]	<isc/serial.h> does not need <isc/boolean.h>.

 107.	[func]		Add keysigner and keysettool.

 106.	[func]		Allow dnssec verifications to ignore the validity
			period.  Used by several of the dnssec tools.

 105.	[doc]		doc/dev/coding.html expanded with other
			implicit conventions the developers have used.

 104.	[bug]		Made compress_add and compress_find static to
			lib/dns/compress.c.

 103.	[func]		libisc buffer API changes for <isc/buffer.h>:
			Added:
				isc_buffer_base(b)          (pointer)
				isc_buffer_current(b)       (pointer)
				isc_buffer_active(b)        (pointer)
				isc_buffer_used(b)          (pointer)
				isc_buffer_length(b)            (int)

				isc_buffer_consumed(b, r) ->
					isc_buffer_consumedregion(b, r)
				isc_buffer_active(b, r) ->
					isc_buffer_activeregion(b, r)
				isc_buffer_remaining(b, r) ->
					isc_buffer_remainingregion(b, r)

			Buffer types were removed, so the ISC_BUFFERTYPE_*
			macros are no more, and the type argument to
			isc_buffer_init and isc_buffer_allocate were removed.
			isc_buffer_putstr is now void (instead of isc_result_t)
			and requires that the caller ensure that there
			is enough available buffer space for the string.

 102.	[port]		Correctly detect inet_aton, inet_pton and inet_ptop
			on BSD/OS 4.1.

 101.	[cleanup]	Quieted EGCS warnings from lib/isc/print.c.

 100.	[cleanup]	<isc/random.h> does not need <isc/int.h> or
			<isc/mutex.h>.  isc_random_t moved to <isc/types.h>.

  99.	[cleanup]	Rate limiter now has separate shutdown() and
			destroy() functions, and it guarantees that all
			queued events are delivered even in the shutdown case.

  98.	[cleanup]	<isc/print.h> does not need <stdarg.h> or <stddef.h>
			unless ISC_PLATFORM_NEEDVSNPRINTF is defined.

			<isc/event.h>.

  96.	[cleanup]	<isc/mutex.h> does not need <isc/result.h>.

			<isc/result.h>.

  90.	[cleanup]	Removed unneeded ISC_LANG_BEGINDECLS/ISC_LANG_ENDDECLS
			from <named/listenlist.h>.

  89.	[cleanup]	<isc/lex.h> does not need <stddef.h>.

			added to a response.

  83.	[func]		If the server is authoritative for both a
			delegating zone and its (nonsecure) delegatee, and
			a query is made for a KEY RR at the top of the
			delegatee, then the server will look for a KEY
			in the delegator if it is not found in the delegatee.

  82.	[cleanup]	<isc/buffer.h> does not need <isc/list.h>.

  81.	[cleanup]	<isc/int.h> and <isc/boolean.h> do not need
			<isc/lang.h>.

  80.	[cleanup]	<isc/print.h> does not need <stdio.h> or <stdlib.h>.

  79.	[cleanup]	<dns/callbacks.h> does not need <stdio.h>.

  78.	[cleanup]	lwres_conftest renamed to lwresconf_test for
			consistency with other *_test programs.

  77.	[cleanup]	typedef of isc_time_t and isc_interval_t moved from

			isc_file_getmodtime, isc_mktemplate renamed to
			isc_file_mktemplate and isc_ufile renamed to
			isc_file_openunique.  By no means an exhaustive API,
			it is just what's needed for now.

  72.	[func]		DNS_RBTFIND_NOPREDECESSOR and DNS_RBTFIND_NOOPTIONS
			added for dns_rbt_findnode, the former to disable the
			setting of the chain to the predecessor, and the
			latter to make clear when no options are set.

  71.	[cleanup]	Made explicit the implicit REQUIREs of

  59.	[bug]		Cause net/host unreachable to be a hard error
			when sending and receiving.

  58.	[bug]		bin/named/query.c could sometimes trigger the
			(client->query.attributes & NS_QUERYATTR_NAMEBUFUSED)
			== 0 assertion in query_newname().

  56.	[bug]		SIG records were not properly returned in cached
			negative answers.

  55.	[bug]		Responses containing multiple names in the authority
			section were not negatively cached.

  54.	[bug]		If a fetch with sigrdataset==NULL joined one with
			sigrdataset!=NULL or vice versa, the resolver
			could catch an assertion or lose signature data,
			respectively.

  53.	[port]		freebsd 4.0: lib/isc/unix/socket.c requires
			<sys/param.h>.

  52.	[bug]		rndc: taskmgr and socketmgr were not initialized
			to NULL.

  51.	[cleanup]	dns/compress.h and dns/zt.h did not need to include

  44.	[bug]		Don't include authority data if it would force us
			to unset the AD bit in the message.

  43.	[bug]		DNSSEC verification of cached rdatasets was failing.

  42.	[cleanup]	Simplified logging of messages with embedded domain
			names by introducing a new convenience function
			dns_name_format().

  41.	[func]		Use PR_SET_KEEPCAPS on Linux 2.3.99-pre3 and later
			to allow 'named' to run as a non-root user while
			retaining the ability to bind() to privileged
			ports.

  40.	[func]		Introduced new logging category "dnssec" and
			logging module "dns/validator".

  39.	[cleanup]	Moved the typedefs for isc_region_t, isc_textregion_t,
			and isc_lex_t to <isc/types.h>.

  38.	[bug]		TSIG signed incoming zone transfers work now.

  37.	[bug]		If the first RR in an incoming zone transfer was
			not an SOA, the server died with an assertion failure
			instead of just reporting an error.

  36.	[cleanup]	Change DNS_R_SUCCESS (and others) to ISC_R_SUCCESS

  35.	[performance]	Log messages which are of a level too high to be
			logged by any channel in the logging configuration
			will not cause the log mutex to be locked.

  34.	[bug]		Recursion was allowed even with 'recursion no'.

  33.	[func]		The RBT now maintains a parent pointer at each node.

  32.	[cleanup]	bin/lwresd/client.c needs <string.h> for memset()
			prototype.

  31.	[bug]		Use ${LIBTOOL} to compile bin/named/main.@O@.

  30.	[func]		config file grammar change to support optional
			class type for a view.

				auth-nxdomain recursion query-source
				query-source-v6 transfer-source
				transfer-source-v6 max-transfer-time-out
				max-transfer-idle-out transfer-format
				request-ixfr provide-ixfr cleaning-interval
				fetch-glue notify rfc2308-type1 lame-ttl
				max-ncache-ttl min-roots

  28.	[func]		support lame-ttl, min-roots and serial-queries
			config global options.

  27.	[bug]		Only include <netinet6/in6.h> on BSD/OS 4.[01]*.
			Including it on other platforms (eg, NetBSD) can
			cause a forced #error from the C preprocessor.

  26.	[func]		new match-clients statement in config file view.

  25.	[bug]		make install failed to install <isc/log.h> and
			<isc/ondestroy.h>.

			files from header files.

  23.	[cleanup]	Provide more context in log messages about client
			requests, using a new function ns_client_log().

  22.	[bug]		SIGs weren't returned in the answer section when
			the query resulted in a fetch.

  21.	[port]		Look at STD_CINCLUDES after CINCLUDES during
			compilation, so additional system include directories
			can be searched but header files in the bind9 source
			tree with conflicting names take precedence.  This
			avoids issues with installed versions of dnssafe and
			openssl.

  20.	[func]		Configuration file post-load validation of zones
			failed if there were no zones.

  19.	[bug]		dns_zone_notifyreceive() failed to unlock the zone
			lock in certain error cases.

  18.	[bug]		Use AC_TRY_LINK rather than AC_TRY_COMPILE in
			configure.in to check for presence of in6addr_any.

  17.	[func]		Do configuration file post-load validation of zones.

  16.	[bug]		put quotes around key names on config file
			output to avoid possible keyword clashes.

  15.	[func]		Add dns_name_dupwithoffsets().  This function is
			improves comparison performance for duped names.

  14.	[bug]		free_rbtdb() could have 'put' unallocated memory in
			an unlikely error path.

  13.	[bug]		lib/dns/master.c and lib/dns/xfrin.c didn't ignore
			out-of-zone data.

  12.	[bug]		Fixed possible uninitialized variable error.

  11.	[bug]		axfr_rrstream_first() didn't check the result code of
			db_rr_iterator_first(), possibly causing an assertion
			to be triggered later.

  10.	[bug]		A bug in the code which makes EDNS0 OPT records in
			bin/named/client.c and lib/dns/resolver.c could
			trigger an assertion.

   9.	[cleanup]	replaced bit-setting code in confctx.c and replaced
			repeated code with macro calls.

   8.	[bug]		Shutdown of incoming zone transfer accessed
			freed memory.

   7.	[cleanup]	removed 'listen-on' from view statement.

   6.	[bug]		quote RR names when generating config file to
			prevent possible clash with config file keywords
			(such as 'key').

   5.	[func]		syntax change to named.conf file: new ssu grant/deny
			statements must now be enclosed by an 'update-policy'
			block.

   4.	[port]		bin/named/unix/os.c didn't compile on systems with
			linux 2.3 kernel includes due to conflicts between
			C library includes and the kernel includes.  We now
			get only what we need from <linux/capability.h>, and
			avoid pulling in other linux kernel .h files.

   3.	[bug]		TKEYs go in the answer section of responses, not
			the additional section.

   2.	[bug]		Generating cryptographic randomness failed on
			systems without /dev/random.

   1.	[bug]		The installdirs rule in
			lib/isc/unix/include/isc/Makefile.in had a typo which
			prevented the isc directory from being created if it
			didn't exist.
