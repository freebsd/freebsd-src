SSH-AGENT(1)               OpenBSD Reference Manual               SSH-AGENT(1)

NAME
     ssh-agent - authentication agent

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-agent [-a bind_address] [-c | -s] [-t life] [-d] [command [args ...]]
     ssh-agent [-c | -s] -k

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authenti-
     cation (RSA, DSA).  The idea is that ssh-agent is started in the begin-
     ning of an X-session or a login session, and all other windows or pro-
     grams are started as clients to the ssh-agent program.  Through use of
     environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for
     authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh(1).

     The options are as follows:

     -a bind_address
             Bind the agent to the unix-domain socket bind_address.  The de-
             fault is /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.<ppid>.

     -c      Generate C-shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL looks like it's a csh style of shell.

     -s      Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL does not look like it's a csh style of shell.

     -k      Kill the current agent (given by the SSH_AGENT_PID environment
             variable).

     -t life
             Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities added
             to the agent.  The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a
             time format specified in sshd_config(5).  A lifetime specified
             for an identity with ssh-add(1) overrides this value.  Without
             this option the default maximum lifetime is forever.

     -d      Debug mode.  When this option is specified ssh-agent will not
             fork.

     If a commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of the agent.
     When the command dies, so does the agent.

     The agent initially does not have any private keys.  Keys are added using
     ssh-add(1).  When executed without arguments, ssh-add(1) adds the files
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity.  If the identity has a
     passphrase, ssh-add(1) asks for the passphrase (using a small X11 appli-
     cation if running under X11, or from the terminal if running without X).
     It then sends the identity to the agent.  Several identities can be
     stored in the agent; the agent can automatically use any of these identi-
     ties.  ssh-add -l displays the identities currently held by the agent.

     The idea is that the agent is run in the user's local PC, laptop, or ter-
     minal.  Authentication data need not be stored on any other machine, and
     authentication passphrases never go over the network.  However, the con-
     nection to the agent is forwarded over SSH remote logins, and the user
     can thus use the privileges given by the identities anywhere in the net-
     work in a secure way.

     There are two main ways to get an agent set up: The first is that the
     agent starts a new subcommand into which some environment variables are
     exported, eg ssh-agent xterm &.  The second is that the agent prints the
     needed shell commands (either sh(1) or csh(1) syntax can be generated)
     which can be evalled in the calling shell, eg eval `ssh-agent -s` for
     Bourne-type shells such as sh(1) or ksh(1) and eval `ssh-agent -c` for
     csh(1) and derivatives.

     Later ssh(1) looks at these variables and uses them to establish a con-
     nection to the agent.

     The agent will never send a private key over its request channel.  In-
     stead, operations that require a private key will be performed by the
     agent, and the result will be returned to the requester.  This way, pri-
     vate keys are not exposed to clients using the agent.

     A unix-domain socket is created and the name of this socket is stored in
     the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.  The socket is made accessible
     only to the current user.  This method is easily abused by root or anoth-
     er instance of the same user.

     The SSH_AGENT_PID environment variable holds the agent's process ID.

     The agent exits automatically when the command given on the command line
     terminates.

FILES
     ~/.ssh/identity
             Contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_dsa
             Contains the protocol version 2 DSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             Contains the protocol version 2 RSA authentication identity of
             the user.

     /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.<ppid>
             Unix-domain sockets used to contain the connection to the authen-
             tication agent.  These sockets should only be readable by the
             owner.  The sockets should get automatically removed when the
             agent exits.

     de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features and cre-
     ated OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol
     versions 1.5 and 2.0.
