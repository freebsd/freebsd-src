.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
dc(1) is an arbitrary\-precision calculator.
It uses a stack (reverse Polish notation) to store numbers and results
of computations.
Arithmetic operations pop arguments off of the stack and push the
results.
.PP
If no files are given on the command\-line as extra arguments (i.e., not
as \f[B]\-f\f[] or \f[B]\-\-file\f[] arguments), then dc(1) reads from
\f[B]stdin\f[].
Otherwise, those files are processed, and dc(1) will then exit.
.PP
This is different from the dc(1) on OpenBSD and possibly other dc(1)
implementations, where \f[B]\-e\f[] (\f[B]\-\-expression\f[]) and
\f[B]\-f\f[] (\f[B]\-\-file\f[]) arguments cause dc(1) to execute them
and exit.
The reason for this is that this dc(1) allows users to set arguments in
the environment variable \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[] (see the \f[B]ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES\f[] section).
Any expressions given on the command\-line should be used to set up a
standard environment.
For example, if a user wants the \f[B]scale\f[] always set to
\f[B]10\f[], they can set \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[] to \f[B]\-e 10k\f[], and
this dc(1) will always start with a \f[B]scale\f[] of \f[B]10\f[].
.PP
If users want to have dc(1) exit after processing all input from
\f[B]\-e\f[] and \f[B]\-f\f[] arguments (and their equivalents), then
they can just simply add \f[B]\-e q\f[] as the last command\-line
argument or define the environment variable \f[B]DC_EXPR_EXIT\f[].
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following are the options that dc(1) accepts.

.TP
.B \f[B]\-x\f[] \f[B]\-\-extended\-register\f[]

See the \f[I]Extended Register Mode\f[] subsection of the
\f[B]REGISTERS\f[] section for more information.
.RS
.PP
This is a \f[B]non\-portable extension\f[].
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-e\f[] \f[I]expr\f[], \f[B]\-\-expression\f[]=\f[I]expr\f[]
Evaluates \f[I]expr\f[].
If multiple expressions are given, they are evaluated in order.
If files are given as well (see below), the expressions and files are
evaluated in the order given.
This means that if a file is given before an expression, the file is
read in and evaluated first.
.RS
.PP
After processing all expressions and files, dc(1) will exit, unless
\f[B]\-\f[] (\f[B]stdin\f[]) was given as an argument at least once to
\f[B]\-f\f[] or \f[B]\-\-file\f[].
.PP
This is a \f[B]non\-portable extension\f[].
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-f\f[] \f[I]file\f[], \f[B]\-\-file\f[]=\f[I]file\f[]
Reads in \f[I]file\f[] and evaluates it, line by line, as though it were
read through \f[B]stdin\f[].
If expressions are also given (see above), the expressions are evaluated
in the order given.
.RS
.PP
After processing all expressions and files, dc(1) will exit, unless
\f[B]\-\f[] (\f[B]stdin\f[]) was given as an argument at least once to
\f[B]\-f\f[] or \f[B]\-\-file\f[].
However, if any other \f[B]\-e\f[], \f[B]\-\-expression\f[],
\f[B]\-f\f[], or \f[B]\-\-file\f[] arguments are given after that, bc(1)
will give a fatal error and exit.
.PP
This is a \f[B]non\-portable extension\f[].
.RE
.PP
All long options are \f[B]non\-portable extensions\f[].
.SH STDOUT
.PP
Any non\-error output is written to \f[B]stdout\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will issue
a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[] section) if it cannot write
to \f[B]stdout\f[], so if \f[B]stdout\f[] is closed, as in \f[B]dc
>&\-\f[], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that dc(1) can report problems when \f[B]stdout\f[] is
redirected to a file.
.PP
If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other dc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stdout\f[] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[].
.SH STDERR
.PP
Any error output is written to \f[B]stderr\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: Unlike other dc(1) implementations, this dc(1) will issue
a fatal error (see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[] section) if it cannot write
to \f[B]stderr\f[], so if \f[B]stderr\f[] is closed, as in \f[B]dc
2>&\-\f[], it will quit with an error.
This is done so that dc(1) can exit with an error code when
\f[B]stderr\f[] is redirected to a file.
.PP
If there are scripts that depend on the behavior of other dc(1)
implementations, it is recommended that those scripts be changed to
redirect \f[B]stderr\f[] to \f[B]/dev/null\f[].
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
Each item in the input source code, either a number (see the
\f[B]NUMBERS\f[] section) or a command (see the \f[B]COMMANDS\f[]
section), is processed and executed, in order.
Input is processed immediately when entered.
.PP
\f[B]ibase\f[] is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[] section) that
determines how to interpret constant numbers.
It is the "input" base, or the number base used for interpreting input
numbers.
\f[B]ibase\f[] is initially \f[B]10\f[].
The max allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[] is \f[B]16\f[].
The min allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[] is \f[B]2\f[].
The max allowable value for \f[B]ibase\f[] can be queried in dc(1)
programs with the \f[B]T\f[] command.
.PP
\f[B]obase\f[] is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[] section) that
determines how to output results.
It is the "output" base, or the number base used for outputting numbers.
\f[B]obase\f[] is initially \f[B]10\f[].
The max allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[] is \f[B]DC_BASE_MAX\f[] and
can be queried with the \f[B]U\f[] command.
The min allowable value for \f[B]obase\f[] is \f[B]0\f[].
If \f[B]obase\f[] is \f[B]0\f[], values are output in scientific
notation, and if \f[B]obase\f[] is \f[B]1\f[], values are output in
engineering notation.
Otherwise, values are output in the specified base.
.PP
Outputting in scientific and engineering notations are
\f[B]non\-portable extensions\f[].
.PP
The \f[I]scale\f[] of an expression is the number of digits in the
result of the expression right of the decimal point, and \f[B]scale\f[]
is a register (see the \f[B]REGISTERS\f[] section) that sets the
precision of any operations (with exceptions).
\f[B]scale\f[] is initially \f[B]0\f[].
\f[B]scale\f[] cannot be negative.
The max allowable value for \f[B]scale\f[] can be queried in dc(1)
programs with the \f[B]V\f[] command.
.PP
\f[B]seed\f[] is a register containing the current seed for the
pseudo\-random number generator.
If the current value of \f[B]seed\f[] is queried and stored, then if it
is assigned to \f[B]seed\f[] later, the pseudo\-random number generator
is guaranteed to produce the same sequence of pseudo\-random numbers
that were generated after the value of \f[B]seed\f[] was first queried.
.PP
Multiple values assigned to \f[B]seed\f[] can produce the same sequence
of pseudo\-random numbers.
Likewise, when a value is assigned to \f[B]seed\f[], it is not
guaranteed that querying \f[B]seed\f[] immediately after will return the
same value.
In addition, the value of \f[B]seed\f[] will change after any call to
the \f[B]\[aq]\f[] command or the \f[B]"\f[] command that does not get
receive a value of \f[B]0\f[] or \f[B]1\f[].
The maximum integer returned by the \f[B]\[aq]\f[] command can be
queried with the \f[B]W\f[] command.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: The values returned by the pseudo\-random number
generator with the \f[B]\[aq]\f[] and \f[B]"\f[] commands are guaranteed
to \f[B]NOT\f[] be cryptographically secure.
This is a consequence of using a seeded pseudo\-random number generator.
However, they \f[B]are\f[] guaranteed to be reproducible with identical
\f[B]seed\f[] values.
.PP
The pseudo\-random number generator, \f[B]seed\f[], and all associated
operations are \f[B]non\-portable extensions\f[].
.SS Comments
.PP
Comments go from \f[B]#\f[] until, and not including, the next newline.
This is a \f[B]non\-portable extension\f[].
.SH NUMBERS
.PP
Numbers are strings made up of digits, uppercase letters up to
\f[B]F\f[], and at most \f[B]1\f[] period for a radix.
Numbers can have up to \f[B]DC_NUM_MAX\f[] digits.
Uppercase letters are equal to \f[B]9\f[] + their position in the
alphabet (i.e., \f[B]A\f[] equals \f[B]10\f[], or \f[B]9+1\f[]).
If a digit or letter makes no sense with the current value of
\f[B]ibase\f[], they are set to the value of the highest valid digit in
\f[B]ibase\f[].
.PP
Single\-character numbers (i.e., \f[B]A\f[] alone) take the value that
they would have if they were valid digits, regardless of the value of
\f[B]ibase\f[].
This means that \f[B]A\f[] alone always equals decimal \f[B]10\f[] and
\f[B]F\f[] alone always equals decimal \f[B]15\f[].
.PP
In addition, dc(1) accepts numbers in scientific notation.
These have the form \f[B]<number>e<integer>\f[].
The power (the portion after the \f[B]e\f[]) must be an integer.
An example is \f[B]1.89237e9\f[], which is equal to \f[B]1892370000\f[].
Negative exponents are also allowed, so \f[B]4.2890e_3\f[] is equal to
\f[B]0.0042890\f[].
.PP
\f[B]WARNING\f[]: Both the number and the exponent in scientific
notation are interpreted according to the current \f[B]ibase\f[], but
the number is still multiplied by \f[B]10^exponent\f[] regardless of the
current \f[B]ibase\f[].
For example, if \f[B]ibase\f[] is \f[B]16\f[] and dc(1) is given the
number string \f[B]FFeA\f[], the resulting decimal number will be
\f[B]2550000000000\f[], and if dc(1) is given the number string
\f[B]10e_4\f[], the resulting decimal number will be \f[B]0.0016\f[].
.PP
Accepting input as scientific notation is a \f[B]non\-portable
extension\f[].
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
The valid commands are listed below.
.SS Printing
.PP
These commands are used for printing.
.PP
Note that both scientific notation and engineering notation are
available for printing numbers.
Scientific notation is activated by assigning \f[B]0\f[] to
\f[B]obase\f[] using \f[B]0o\f[], and engineering notation is activated
by assigning \f[B]1\f[] to \f[B]obase\f[] using \f[B]1o\f[].
To deactivate them, just assign a different value to \f[B]obase\f[].
.PP
Printing numbers in scientific notation and/or engineering notation is a
\f[B]non\-portable extension\f[].

.RS
.PP
If the value is a number, it is truncated and the absolute value of the
result is printed as though \f[B]obase\f[] is \f[B]UCHAR_MAX+1\f[] and
each digit is interpreted as an ASCII character, making it a byte
stream.
.PP
If the value is a string, it is printed without a trailing newline.

Pops a value off of the stack, which is used as an \f[B]exclusive\f[]

dc(1) resets (see the \f[B]RESET\f[] section) while \f[B]seed\f[]

.SH REGISTERS
.PP
Registers are names that can store strings, numbers, and arrays.
(Number/string registers do not interfere with array registers.)
.PP
Each register is also its own stack, so the current register value is
the top of the stack for the register.
All registers, when first referenced, have one value (\f[B]0\f[]) in
their stack.
.PP
In non\-extended register mode, a register name is just the single
character that follows any command that needs a register name.
The only exception is a newline (\f[B]\[aq]\\n\[aq]\f[]); it is a parse
error for a newline to be used as a register name.
.SS Extended Register Mode
.PP
Unlike most other dc(1) implentations, this dc(1) provides nearly
unlimited amounts of registers, if extended register mode is enabled.
.PP
If extended register mode is enabled (\f[B]\-x\f[] or
\f[B]\-\-extended\-register\f[] command\-line arguments are given), then
normal single character registers are used \f[I]unless\f[] the character
immediately following a command that needs a register name is a space
(according to \f[B]isspace()\f[]) and not a newline
(\f[B]\[aq]\\n\[aq]\f[]).
.PP
In that case, the register name is found according to the regex
\f[B][a\-z][a\-z0\-9_]*\f[] (like bc(1) identifiers), and it is a parse
error if the next non\-space characters do not match that regex.
.SH RESET
.PP
When dc(1) encounters an error or a signal that it has a non\-default
handler for, it resets.
This means that several things happen.
.PP
First, any macros that are executing are stopped and popped off the
stack.
The behavior is not unlike that of exceptions in programming languages.
Then the execution point is set so that any code waiting to execute
(after all macros returned) is skipped.
.PP
Thus, when dc(1) resets, it skips any remaining code waiting to be
executed.
Then, if it is interactive mode, and the error was not a fatal error
(see the \f[B]EXIT STATUS\f[] section), it asks for more input;
otherwise, it exits with the appropriate return code.
.SH PERFORMANCE
.PP
Most dc(1) implementations use \f[B]char\f[] types to calculate the
value of \f[B]1\f[] decimal digit at a time, but that can be slow.
This dc(1) does something different.
.PP
It uses large integers to calculate more than \f[B]1\f[] decimal digit
at a time.
If built in a environment where \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[] (see the
\f[B]LIMITS\f[] section) is \f[B]64\f[], then each integer has
\f[B]9\f[] decimal digits.
If built in an environment where \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[] is \f[B]32\f[]
then each integer has \f[B]4\f[] decimal digits.
This value (the number of decimal digits per large integer) is called
\f[B]DC_BASE_DIGS\f[].
.PP
In addition, this dc(1) uses an even larger integer for overflow
checking.
This integer type depends on the value of \f[B]DC_LONG_BIT\f[], but is
always at least twice as large as the integer type used to store digits.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
dc(1) recognizes the following environment variables:
.TP
.B \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[]
This is another way to give command\-line arguments to dc(1).
They should be in the same format as all other command\-line arguments.
These are always processed first, so any files given in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[] will be processed before arguments and files given
on the command\-line.
This gives the user the ability to set up "standard" options and files
to be used at every invocation.
The most useful thing for such files to contain would be useful
functions that the user might want every time dc(1) runs.
Another use would be to use the \f[B]\-e\f[] option to set
\f[B]scale\f[] to a value other than \f[B]0\f[].
.RS
.PP
The code that parses \f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[] will correctly handle quoted
arguments, but it does not understand escape sequences.
For example, the string \f[B]"/home/gavin/some dc file.dc"\f[] will be
correctly parsed, but the string \f[B]"/home/gavin/some "dc"
file.dc"\f[] will include the backslashes.
.PP
The quote parsing will handle either kind of quotes, \f[B]\[aq]\f[] or
\f[B]"\f[].
Thus, if you have a file with any number of single quotes in the name,
you can use double quotes as the outside quotes, as in \f[B]"some
\[aq]bc\[aq] file.bc"\f[], and vice versa if you have a file with double
quotes.
However, handling a file with both kinds of quotes in
\f[B]DC_ENV_ARGS\f[] is not supported due to the complexity of the
parsing, though such files are still supported on the command\-line
where the parsing is done by the shell.

The other statuses will only be returned when dc(1) is not in

dc(1) resets its state (see the \f[B]RESET\f[] section) and accepts more
input when one of those errors occurs in interactive mode.

\f[B]\-i\f[] flag or \f[B]\-\-interactive\f[] option.
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.PP
Like bc(1), dc(1) has an interactive mode and a non\-interactive mode.
Interactive mode is turned on automatically when both \f[B]stdin\f[] and
\f[B]stdout\f[] are hooked to a terminal, but the \f[B]\-i\f[] flag and
\f[B]\-\-interactive\f[] option can turn it on in other cases.
.PP
In interactive mode, dc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see the
\f[B]RESET\f[] section), and in normal execution, flushes
\f[B]stdout\f[] as soon as execution is done for the current input.
.SH TTY MODE
.PP
If \f[B]stdin\f[], \f[B]stdout\f[], and \f[B]stderr\f[] are all
connected to a TTY, dc(1) turns on "TTY mode."
.PP
TTY mode is different from interactive mode because interactive mode is
required in the bc(1)
specification (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html),
and interactive mode requires only \f[B]stdin\f[] and \f[B]stdout\f[] to
be connected to a terminal.
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
.PP
Sending a \f[B]SIGINT\f[] will cause dc(1) to stop execution of the
current input.
If dc(1) is in TTY mode (see the \f[B]TTY MODE\f[] section), it will
reset (see the \f[B]RESET\f[] section).
Otherwise, it will clean up and exit.
.PP
Note that "current input" can mean one of two things.
If dc(1) is processing input from \f[B]stdin\f[] in TTY mode, it will
ask for more input.
If dc(1) is processing input from a file in TTY mode, it will stop
processing the file and start processing the next file, if one exists,
or ask for input from \f[B]stdin\f[] if no other file exists.
.PP
This means that if a \f[B]SIGINT\f[] is sent to dc(1) as it is executing
a file, it can seem as though dc(1) did not respond to the signal since
it will immediately start executing the next file.
This is by design; most files that users execute when interacting with
dc(1) have function definitions, which are quick to parse.
If a file takes a long time to execute, there may be a bug in that file.
The rest of the files could still be executed without problem, allowing
the user to continue.
.PP
\f[B]SIGTERM\f[] and \f[B]SIGQUIT\f[] cause dc(1) to clean up and exit,
and it uses the default handler for all other signals.
.SH LOCALES
.PP
This dc(1) ships with support for adding error messages for different
locales and thus, supports \f[B]LC_MESSAGS\f[].

.SH STANDARDS
.PP
The dc(1) utility operators are compliant with the operators in the
bc(1) IEEE Std 1003.1\-2017
(“POSIX.1\-2017”) (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html)
specification.
